"The Future Of Leadership Is Vulnerability, And This Guy Has It",https://www.ricemedia.co/future-leadership-vulnerability-culture-people/,25-May-21,"Photography by Wallace Woon.
Mr David Chua, CEO of National Youth Council (NYC), thinks he’s far from perfect. “I don’t always know if I’m making the best decisions. But I suppose that’s life, isn’t it? Like most people, I’m figuring things out as I grow.”
It’s likely that you’ve chanced upon NYC and the work it does in some form. But for those not in the know, it was set up back in 1989 as the national coordinating body for youth affairs with the ardent goal of developing future-ready youths committed to shaping a better nation.
Future-ready youth I may be, I was caught off guard by the man’s raw display of vulnerability. It’s a touch of humanity that’s often unseen in typically stoic government leaders—not just in Singapore but across the globe.
Higher-ups have the tendency to appear robotic, as though programmed to respond only through scripted answers. Even moments that are off the record seem staged at times.
Decked in a plain casual tee, jeans and sneakers, David lacked the formality that comes with most leaders. Neither was he perfectly polished and rehearsed in any way. In fact, the 47-year-old apologised immediately for running late to our meeting.
Just as we were about to begin, he admitted softly, whilst holding onto a cup of hot tea: “Aiyo, so formal ah. I don’t know if I’m ready for the interview.”
Same, I remember thinking to myself.
More than just a CEO: Vulnerable leader, ex-military man and father of four.
Admittedly, I knew almost nothing about David before working on this story. I was told that he’s “cool” and “interesting,” but that was it. Naturally, I turned to the next reliable (and millennial) solution: social media.
Source: Instagram, @davidxchua
Take a quick scroll through David’s Instagram and you’d likely see why he’s well-suited for a role in NYC. He engages in sporty activities like running, kayaking, and rock climbing—most of which are commonly associated with youths. I can’t help but notice other compelling posts; particularly memes of himself and wholesome family photos.
Still, I wanted a glimpse into David’s personality beyond his grid. What is he like as a leader? Who is he really, when the lofty title of CEO is cast aside?
I asked then, how he manages to keep up with youth trends. He simply shrugged and cited a time when his daughter pulled him to try “some TikTok thing.”
The way I see it, he had two choices: To dismiss TikTok as just another silly app—or to say yes, even if that meant making a fool of himself. He picked the latter.
“It was fun, even though I didn’t know what I was doing.”
Rather than shunning the unknown, he keeps an open mind in trying new things.
Asked to describe himself as a teen, his answer was simple: “I was driven and competitive, especially in sports. I collected badges as a scout and played in the rugby team.”
“Looking back though, I was highly ignorant about larger social issues. And I was definitely no changemaker.”
Immediately, this elicited laughter in the room. Like me, his colleagues were intrigued by this earnest confession. Shouldn’t the CEO of NYC, by default, have been a passionate changemaker since young?
But his point was clear: No one is perfect, not even someone of his current status.
He explained: “Back then, there were no green or environmental groups. We were mostly enclosed in our school bubbles. My first encounter with e-mail was in 1993 when I was 19-years-old.”
“The media landscape today is a lot more interesting … but it’s also very scary. It’s a different world.”
David confessed that the notion of leadership didn’t come naturally to him. In fact, the desire to lead only surfaced after he started observing others in secondary school.
“I looked up to senior scouts and thought: Man, I want to be like that person too.”
And then it hit me: Not everyone is a born leader. People think leadership is innate, but leadership is a skill that can be built through practice. The only difference is that some of us never come close to uncovering that potential.
As CEO of NYC, David is acutely aware of some missed opportunities that his children are choosing to forgo. “I’m very clear of what they don’t know—youth events and groups that they are not involved in, for example. Many youths are like them.”
But as a father of four, he’s simultaneously exposed to the reality of youths. It’s clear that his role as a dad presents valuable insights into his line of work.
He knows, for instance, that there are simply not enough hours in a day for youths to come close to doing everything perfectly.
“Our education system can be very stressful. Naturally, this limits the mind space of youths. Being a dad, I’ve learned to suspend judgement. And hopefully, I’ve become more patient too.”
Sit Down, Be Humble.
Much of what bothers youths can be puzzling and hard to solve. This issue is compounded when a generational gap comes into picture. As a leader, David is confronted with similar roadblocks that stand between him and youths today.
“Sometimes, I don’t know if my advice is even relevant.”
Certainty and conviction are qualities that we often associate with strong leaders, but this self-awareness pushes him to ask more questions—better questions—creating room for new possibilities to emerge.
Since his appointment as CEO in 2015, David began racking his brains to ramp up opportunities that would enable youths to thrive. These include programmes like the Youth Action Challenge, which encourage youths to take action, or the Asia-Ready Exposure Programme, designed for youths to gain social, cultural and economic perspectives of our ASEAN, China and India neighbours.
The onslaught of Covid-19 has inevitably impacted Singaporean youths—especially those who are stepping into the workforce in such a precarious moment in their lives. Under David’s leadership, NYC has partnered with both private and public sectors to tackle issues such as job insecurity and upskilling among youths.
Having said that, much of our nation’s concerns have snowballed. Some of these have grown so complex that it’s impossible for anyone to solve single-handedly.
It requires great humility to overcome hubris, and David’s attitude was refreshing, to say the least. It strikes me as a unique form of power—for a leader to acknowledge the limitations at play.
“It’s true that there is a very thick layer of pragmatism here. To create change, it takes the combined effort of all stakeholders. Youths, parents, employers, educators and policymakers must work together. We don’t pretend to do it alone.”
Stumbling Through Uncertainty
Much later, during our photo-taking session, I observed how David playfully posed with hypebeast squats and peace signs. When I caught up with him in between takes, he told me that it took time before he started feeling comfortable in front of the camera.
I soon discovered that he once took a personality test and it identified him as an introvert.
“In the army, I didn’t have to interact with the public as much. It’s very different here in NYC so I wasn’t used to it initially. But I’ll take this as a sign that I’ve improved,” he laughs.
Time and again, David actively places himself in zones of discomfort.
He then asked about my career goals.
To which I responded: “I don’t know, I’m still figuring it out.”
Without a moment’s hesitation, he exclaimed: “And that’s fine! You can’t predict where life takes you. I didn’t plan on staying in the army, but ended up being there for 22 years anyway.”
“To be honest, I just wanted an opportunity to travel. So I thought: Why not join and give it a shot?”
The fact that he went into the army clueless, with little to no expectations, was both eye-opening and liberating. We are kindred spirits in that regard. Not every decision needs to be imbued with grand meaning and purpose.
He went on. “I didn’t know that I’d be working so closely with youths one day too, but here I am. Most of us don’t know if we’re on the right path. Who knows where I’ll be years later?”
The more I listened, the more it made sense. David is willing to face uncertainty head-on. He also grants youths the permission to explore and fail. At the end of the day, we all need the latitude to try new ideas.
It takes courage to leave the land of certain outcomes, as shown by David’s journey thus far. But half the battle is won if we first resist the urge to judge our imperfections.
Who knows what discoveries we’ll stumble onto if we choose to transcend the fear of failure? As David puts it: “Youths need to step into areas that are alien to them. It’s up to them to look, believe, and explore.”
The man tolerates ambiguity, values progress over perfection. His path reflects a mode that he seems to operate on: Do it, even if it scares you. You’ll figure it out somehow and grow along the way.
Maybe, just maybe, we ought to grant ourselves the same Get Out of Jail Free card.

Pandemic Reporting Fatigue, As Told To Us By A Mainstream Media Journalist",Eve Lock,TRUE,TRUE
"Ten Windows, Ten Perspectives on Phase 2",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-ten-windows-ten-perspectives-on-phase-2/,27-May-21,"All images contributed by interviewees, with direction from RICE’s photo department. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.
Over the last week, my colleague Zachary and I reached out to ten people all around Singapore, from all walks of life. We asked them to share a view from a window they spend a lot of time looking out of, and what’s been on their mind since Phase 2 (HA) kicked in.
Had their routines changed? How would they describe their mood at this time? Now that we’ve mostly moved our lives indoors, how do they feel when they look outside?
The responses we got were thoughtful, conflicted, immediately relatable. Some talked about their anxieties; others shared what they’d been doing to pass the time. Often, they were as much about looking inward, or wondering what lies ahead, as looking out. (Many, too, alluded to the difference between looking and really seeing—being present, “standing still and learning to be astonished.”)
Put together, we hope they bring a shared experience into view, and—in some small way—soothe your ache for the world outside by glimpsing it through someone else’s eyes.
It’s amazing how quickly children learn things. One of the first ‘big’ words my son learnt was “coronavirus” (sadly enough). Unfortunately, they’ve also quickly learnt that this same coronavirus has a tangible impact on their daily lives.
Before Covid, we led quite active lives as a family with young children. We’d go swimming, visit the park, go for picnics and plane-spotting. Now they’re mostly cooped up at home, but they’ve been surprisingly sanguine about it, choosing instead to make even more of a mess in the house than usual. They’re quite happy to spend their time rearranging their bookshelves and taking apart their toys.
They’ve even learnt to say, “We need to stay at home, because of the coronavirus!” My husband and I, as parents, are the ones who feel as though their development is somehow being stalled and their enjoyment limited. Maybe we’re overthinking things, but when we had our children, we didn’t foresee that we’d be spending so much time at home with them, instead of being out and about.
Before Covid, I was already wondering how I would guide my children in a world that was becoming unfamiliar to an old fogey like me. Covid will transform that world even further. Will we as parents be able to provide the necessary guidance? Will we be able to keep up? Such thoughts keep me up at night, sometimes.
— Raaha is a freelance writer and editor who used to work in education. She took this photo a while back at her parents’ home in Bukit Batok. While it’s no longer her usual view, “I spent most of my youth growing up in that house. And my children spend a lot of time there as well, so it’s a view they are growing up with too.”
This is my view on the way to work, usually in a Grab or some other form of ride-share as I don’t have my own car. Ironically, I enjoy these rides the most when the roads are empty, but that usually means the COVID situation is getting more severe.
While I’ve gotten used to things like mask-wearing, the increased social restrictions are pretty frustrating. Most of my social circle is made up of other doctors working in different healthcare institutions, and because we’re discouraged from intermingling too much (to avoid a potential spread of the virus across hospitals), I haven’t seen a lot of my closest friends in person for months.
It’s also very frustrating hearing about the cases of discrimination against healthcare workers, some of which have happened directly to my friends. I understand that the public is probably wary that we might be carriers, given the high-risk nature of our work, but it’s still disheartening to be ostracised when all we are trying to do is to get to work and deal with this ever-evolving series of events. Claps for support don’t mean anything when your actions suggest otherwise.
— Shi Hui* is a doctor in a public tertiary hospital. Although she misses the fitness classes she used to go to to relax, she’s grateful for Netflix and her cat.
Circuit breaker last year and this year are quite different. This year we [migrant workers] can still work, so it’s better in a sense. But because things were slowly going back to normal, I thought I could go home to visit my family.
In January or February, I told them I’d come home in April. Then in April cases started to appear again, so I said change to August. Now it might be end of year, who knows. I need to make sure I can come back to Singapore as I’m the sole breadwinner, so if I get stuck in Bangladesh, my whole family will be in trouble. But it’s been hard to get them to understand.
I’ve been busy studying for a diploma and taking courses for work. A few weeks ago, I bought Yuval Noah Harari’s 21 Lessons For The 21st Century from Kinokuniya. I’ve only just started, and it’ll take me a while to read it, so maybe Phase 2 will be over by the time I’ve finished.
— Fazley Elahi Rubel is a migrant worker and advocate from Bangladesh. This is the view from outside his room, with his worksite in the background (he lives on site).
I haven’t thought much about being stuck in quarantine, because I’ve just tried to get on with it. I’ve kept to a routine, and it’s kept me afloat.
In the mornings, I wake up, have breakfast, make the bed, shower, and get dressed. I never stay in a robe or pyjamas; I don’t even get back in bed till after work. But I try to spend as much time away from my screen as I can, so after work ends, I’ll stay on the balcony and listen to a podcast while looking at the view. Right now, it’s this one my friend’s friend made called Sentimental Garbage.
The balcony is the best thing about this room, because I’m one of those people that really loves sunshine and fresh air. I was so lucky to get it because I had this dread on the plane that I was gonna get the worst hotel, like, without a window even. When I got here, I was so happy, I was practically jumping up and down.
— Javid recently flew back from the UK to visit his family. When we spoke, he was on Day 19 of his 21-day quarantine. He had originally expected to spend 14 days in the hotel, but found out on Day 3 that it was going to be extended.
Compared to a couple months ago, I’m definitely more worn out and resigned. It’s partially because a good part of my artistic practice involves performance-making. These last few months, it felt like live performances were slowly becoming possible again, so the sudden curbs hurt. They’re also a keen reminder that the timeline is not as linear as it has felt so far in Singapore, meaning the possibility of delay, cycles, repetition, going back and forth. It’s getting increasingly painful to contain my desire to move and perform. Some days, I struggle to write anything that feels meaningful.
There is also an exhaustion that has endured though, somewhat independently of the changes in Singapore. Palestine, Myanmar, and India have all been on my mind lately. It stems from the helplessness of seeing not just the pandemic but also waves of political violence sweep up so many parts of the world. This exhaustion feels very palpable amongst my peers, a shared and growing grief.
I tend to look out of my bedroom window throughout the day, but especially first thing in the morning, at sunset, and whenever it rains, which I love. I live on a fairly high floor, though, so I mostly look at the sky. I like the simplicity of this perspective. It helps me focus on things like how the clouds shift, especially when most of the time, I’m just busy learning how to live.
— Kia Yee writes poetry, reads books, and makes performances. Lately, she has also been playing Stardew Valley and spending time on Quanmin, a karaoke app.
The hair salon I work in has coloured film sheets over the window and balcony doors, so it changes with the sun. During the day it’s green. At nighttime, it’s more pink. After work ends, around 9:00 PM, I sometimes come out here and have a smoke to relax. You can see the Pinnacle at Duxton and the Outram Park area from here.
It’s not so bad compared to last year, when we couldn’t open the salon. That was quite terrible. But I hope I can see my family soon. It was my mum’s 60th birthday last month and I had to miss that. We’re quite close because my parents divorced when I was 15. I did a video call with my family and my sister helped me buy a present for my mum, but I still have to pay her back for that.
— Tomoya, a hairdresser, is from Kanagawa, Japan. He moved to Singapore about four years ago.
This is my bedroom window, which I tend to look out of throughout the day. The view makes me feel calm and happy. The block opposite my place is this beautiful teal and turquoise ombre, a bit like kueh salat. I also check that my plants are getting enough sunlight. I keep them in the corner near the window, and looking after them gives me a chance to unwind from how busy I usually am.
I’m quite grateful for this semi-lockdown because it forces me to take a break. I love my job, and I’m lucky that it both pays me decently and is stable enough that I don’t have to worry about losing it any time soon. And at least I still get to see a few friends for any emotional support I might need during this month.
— Leticia is a teacher in an international school working with children with learning differences. She also runs a small craft business on the side, enjoys rock-climbing and long boarding, and collects tropical plants.
My routine hasn’t changed much since Phase 2. I still wake up at 5:45 AM, wash up, catch the train from my flat in Punggol. The food court’s in Ubi so it takes about an hour to reach. I get there around 7:00 AM and help prepare the food. Lunch is usually the busy hour, but it’s more empty now. I leave around 3 or 4:00pm, and when I get back I spend time with my two-year-old.
The difference is that things are much more stressful. Since Phase 2 started, sales have been around 50% of normal days, but I’m still paying full rental and salaries for now. Delivery platforms aren’t helping much because most of our customers are walk-in. Plus we just moved into this flat a year ago, so there’s the loan. My son. Our helper’s pay. This is the main thing on my mind at the moment.
— Yiping, an F&B entrepreneur, runs three stalls selling cai fan, Korean and Japanese food, and bubble tea in a food court in Ubi.
Before the circuit breaker last year, I didn’t realize there was a yellow flame tree outside my window. I thought the flowers were a trick of light from the golden hour. The window is in my bedroom and next to my desk, which I tried to avoid; I couldn’t bring myself to write there. Instead, I spread a yoga mat on the floor, and did sun salutations and read novels with my feet propped up on my chair. When I could no longer avoid my desk, I shut the curtains to cull the daydreams.
On the last day of CB, my brain was blocked. Lockdown had muted my ability to create spontaneously. In frustration, I flung open the curtains and noticed the yellow flame tree in full bloom. Sprouts of ochre showered the canopy, as if they had always been there, urgent and wonderful. I got some words on the page that day.
In Phase 2 (HA), I’ve chained myself to this desk by the window again. The tree is in a period of transition: the bark is brittle and the boughs are bare, but up top, there is a smattering of flowers hanging on for better days. The yellow flame is battered but hopeful; I am the same. Now, I keep the curtains open.
— Zachary H is a writer with RICE. Lately, he has moved his languishing to parks.
My routine hasn’t had any big changes in Phase 2. I’m still going for my morning walks. I usually wake up at 5 and catch the first train at 5:47, then go to places like MBS or the green corridor. Lately, I’ve been going to the Kallang Riverside area, because I really enjoy the morning peace. Most people around me are running or exercising, but if you see the auntie snapping away with her phone camera, that’s me.
Walking is very healing. I love to look at beautiful things and when I walk, I don’t have to worry so much. I just focus on enjoying the beautiful things around me. I take photos of everything— buildings, sculptures, nature, insects, the sky. Most of the time, I like to look up, because even if you’re in the same spot, the colours and clouds will change. If I take a picture from my window every day, it looks different each time.
I never seem to get bored. After I come back from my walks, I make lunch and go over my photos, which is like getting to enjoy the route all over again. Maybe I’ll watch TV or play games on my phone, cook dinner, and then the day is gone. I don’t know where the time gets to.
Time passes faster now that I’m older. When you’re looking forward to something, time passes fast, when you’re waiting for a bus and you’re in a hurry. You want it to come faster. But when you’re on the bus and want to enjoy it, you want time to slow down.
— Bee Cheng, a retiree, started off documenting her photos on a private Instagram account, but made it public at her son’s urging. She has enjoyed photography for a long time, and jokes that digital cameras are the best invention ever.

One Millennial Smashes Stereotypes In Her Quest to Save Disappearing Chinese Traditions",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
Here’s What a Bonsai Master Taught Us About Pandemic Fatigue,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-heres-bonsai-master-taught-us-pandemic-fatigue/,27-May-21,"This article accompanies our video interview with Mr Boh Twang Keng, Bonsai Master in celebration of Vesak Day. All images by Feline Lim unless otherwise stated.
Boh’s Bonsai is a home-cum-nursery tucked away in Lengkok Mariam. Mr Boh, Singapore’s premiere bonsai master, tends to his creations with a devotion that is rooted in Buddhist traditions. His fingers are long and nimble, his gaze is patient and discerning. “In a few years, you will be beautiful,” he says to a fledgling bonsai; with brittle bark and sparse leaves, it looks fragile and fussy to me.
But Mr Boh is in no hurry to write off this bonsai’s struggle. “A single bonsai, seen from the perspectives of different people, can evoke a completely different response.” My assessment of this bonsai as fussy differs from Mr Boh, who views its growing pains as the source of all goodness. “Buddhism has many complex teachings, which require stringent studying to nurture a good heart.”
At Boh’s Bonsai, life is fragile. Without Mr Boh’s attentive care, the finicky bonsai’s will quickly perish. Often, they perish anyway, even under his watchful eye. His measured nurturing is sometimes futile, but that doesn’t stop Mr Boh from refining his craft or taking the time. His grounded approach to the art of bonsai reflects a central tenet of Buddhism, and a lesson for us at this point in the pandemic: the practice of heedfulness, also known as appamada in sanskrit.
The Spirit of Vesak Day
Yesterday, Buddhist’s celebrated the birth, enlightenment and death of the Buddha. For those who aren’t familiar with the meaning of Vesak Day, here’s a brief explanation: In Singapore, the celebrations begin on the second full moon in May. Vesak Day is a reminder of the universal law that all compounded things must disintegrate.
There are a few rituals which embody this universal law: deliverance of heavenly offerings like joss sticks and fresh flowers, singing hymns, eating vegetarian food, and making special efforts to bring happiness to the unfortunate. On Vesak Day, acting mindfully and with intention is paramount.
Venerable Muhinda, a Malaysian Buddhist monk explained the intentionality of the rituals on Vesak Day as such: “When we train our minds to observe the functioning of mental and physical processes we realise the true nature of our lives. We see how it is subject to change and unsatisfactoriness.”
In Phase 2 (HA), Can We Benefit From Heedfulness?
As I mentioned earlier, the art of bonsai and Mr Boh’s patience with the craft is one example of the practice of heedfulness. It’s the art of paying attention, which is the antidote to complacency. Because life is fleeting, heedfulness implores one to imbue each interaction with meaning and substance, to be vigilant of the possibility in every moment.
The observation of one’s own mind is a powerful tool that transcends religion—you don’t have to become a buddhist to pay attention. If you have meditated, then you know what heedfulness feels like. Now that we’re stuck at home with idling minds, perhaps we can harness some heedfulness to muddle through.
Ṭhānissaro Bhikkhu is an American Buddhist monk, most known for his translations of religious texts. If sitting down to meditate feels overwhelming to you in this moment, he reassures us that heedfulness can be practiced even in the moments where we might not think to be mindful at all.
“We tend to kill the little bits of time. For example, waiting in the doctor’s office, sitting at a red light, or taking a break from work. There’s a lot that can be done in those little bits of time. Too often we think of the practice as what we do when our eyes are closed. But practice is practice everywhere. You’ve got the same mind, the same qualities of mind, that you want to develop, simply in different circumstances.”
The Power of Discernment
In Buddhist teachings, intoxication is used as a metaphor to describe the trappings of the mind. According to this metaphor, desire, cravings, and anxiety are forms of intoxication which lead to suffering. Discernment is the heedful, grounding force which frees one from suffering and fuels the enlightened mind.
How can we put this into practice? In the moments at home when we’re feeling damn sian, perhaps we can bring some awareness to the detours that the mind takes in frustration and boredom. In mindfulness exercises, to calm racing thoughts, you acknowledge them first, then give permission for them to leave.
It’s impossible to have racing thoughts or feelings of boredom at Boh’s Bonsai. Mr Boh is self assured and calm. Having spent years refining his finicky craft, he has realised something that we can all benefit from even while we’re stuck at home: “I have the chance to live a quieter, slower life.”

Ten Windows, Ten Perspectives on Phase 2",Zachary Hourihane,FALSE,TRUE
"Pandemic Reporting Fatigue, As Told To Us By A Mainstream Media Journalist",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-pandemic-reporting-fatigue-mainstream-journalist/,27-May-21,"All images RICE file photos.
Earlier this month, my colleague Sophie wrote an article about being sian during this long-haul pandemic. It was a colloquial way to say that we are sick and fed up with the virus. The New York Times has given a more fanciful touch to this emotion: languishing.
I get it. We follow the news, track the daily cases, learn about Covidiots flouting safe distancing measures, and get demoralised that the nightmare doesn’t seem to be ending. This is the news cycle we have been used to for more than a year, and we are exhausted.
But what about the folks behind the bylines of news reports you read? Most of us have the luxury of ignoring Covid-related news if we want to, but for journalists covering the pandemic, they don’t get to choose. It is their bread and butter. After more than a year since the pandemic started, Covid-reporting fatigue has become a real problem.
The thing about journalism is that we often do not write about the difficulties of the craft. We take challenges in our stride and guard them as secrets, rather than putting ourselves in the spotlight. Our job is to tell the stories of others.
To be fair, healthcare workers who are fighting the virus get it worse than us. But journalists are fighting another kind of fire, and it can be draining too.
In light of Covid-reporting fatigue, the following account is written from the perspective of a journalist, and is based on actual events that were shared with us.
The journalist is from the mainstream media, which covers the bulk of Covid-related news. The story has been condensed and compiled from a longer interview, with edits for length and clarity.
While we recognise that this is only one individual’s point of view, and may not reflect the situation in its entirety, or the views, experiences, and practices of other mainstream media outlets, I believe this account provides a valuable look into the fatigue experienced by those who bring us constant news of the pandemic.
I have lost count of the number of stories I have written about the darn virus. Maybe a few hundred, since the pandemic started last January.
At the start, my colleagues and I thought this whole affair would blow over in a few weeks or months—similar to SARS [Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome] in 2003 which started in March that year and everything was done and dusted by July.
This is why when it came to the daily compilation of statistics, it used to be just one of us handling it. These days, since the pandemic will be a long-drawn fight, we rotate among ourselves so it is less tiring.
Actually, reporting the statistics isn’t too bad. Stats are just stats and I report as it is. It is tougher to analyse and present facts about the virus in the simplest way possible because this is something that even top scientists are still struggling to grapple with.
I tend to doubt myself when reporting on Covid-related news. It is difficult to process what the experts say and churn a story out quickly. Moreover, as a mainstream media reporter, I face huge pressure to deliver the news accurately, since readers are taking whatever I report on as the gospel truth. Very often, I feel unprepared and have a sense of impostor syndrome.
And because I report on Covid-19 all the time, relatives and friends see me as a pandemic prophet, as if I know what is going to happen next.
“Will there be a lockdown?”
“When will Sinovac [a Covid-19 vaccine developed by China] going to be approved?”
The truth is: I don’t know!
As if things are not bad enough, the Covid-19 situation is evolving rapidly. I have to be on alert and constantly monitor developments, which means I am thinking about work all the time.
I can never switch off from work, as long as the pandemic rages on. My line of work—to chase and report on news—is already intense enough but at least there used to be lull periods when nothing big happened around Singapore. With the pandemic, it has been a sprint all the way.
For most of you, the pandemic is stressful enough, especially when you read about tighter restrictions or a lockdown. Just reading the news is enough to distract you and sap your morale. People wouldn’t even want to think about work. Instead, they would think about taking care of themselves and their loved ones first.
But for a journalist like me, news like this means I have to work extra hard to cover the stories. When the nation is reeling and recovering, I am forced to continue running.
It is tough to beat this whole Covid-19 reporting fatigue. These days, I try to avoid responding to work messages on my days off. However, I always feel guilty, thinking that I’m not working hard enough.
I’m sick of reporting on Covid-19 too. But it can’t be helped. Just because we don’t read or report on it doesn’t mean the pandemic is not happening.
I even tried to wriggle out of Covid-19 reporting by requesting for opportunities to cover other stories. But I understand that covering the pandemic is part of my job. Moreover, everyone in the newsroom is already stretched. If I don’t do it, who will?
Covering the virus has gotten to me: besides being more short-tempered and angsty, there were also times when I had anxiety and depressive episodes. My mental health certainly took a toll.
To destress, I exercise daily and spend time with my loved ones and friends. I also avoid reading the news unless absolutely necessary.
I know you are sick of reading those pandemic-related news reports. I’m sick of reporting on Covid-19 too. But it can’t be helped. Just because we don’t read or report on it doesn’t mean the pandemic is not happening.
As journalists, we are responsible for reporting on events that are happening. Although we might be tired of news relating to Covid-19, we still have the responsibility to report on key developments. People will still want to know; a drop in the amount of information we put out will be worrying.
I feel that people out there need to understand why we cannot answer every query readers have or report on every single Covid-related issue. We are just really, really overwhelmed.
Like everyone else, I’m also struggling through this pandemic. Just because we’re always reporting on the challenges others face doesn’t mean we don’t have challenges of our own.
In this time of crisis, let’s be kind to one another. Perhaps you can think twice the next time before you send out that nasty comment online or email to the reporters. There is always someone behind that byline.

Here’s What a Bonsai Master Taught Us About Pandemic Fatigue",Sean Lim,TRUE,TRUE
One Millennial Smashes Stereotypes In Her Quest to Save Disappearing Chinese Traditions,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-one-millennial-smashes-stereotypes-quest-save-disappearing-chinese-traditions/,28-May-21,"Photography by Thaddeus Loh / RICE Media.
“Wow.” My jaw dropped open as I let my inquisitive eyes wander around … As I moved slowly through the space, I could not help but let my fingers touch the furniture as a sense of warmth swept through my body …
I caught sight of my own reflection in the mirror. The opposite facing mirrors formed an infinitely smaller me in every reflection, as if revealing how minute one is in the universe. The black-and-white portraits hung on the walls smiled upon me, as if reassuring that no matter how small or misunderstood one was, one has a role to play and contribute.”
Everyone has a defining moment in their life and, for heritage researcher Lynn Wong, this was one of those. Her short story—aptly entitled My Second Home—recounts the first time she visited a clan association at the age of 15.
“I was there to learn kung fu and lion dance,” says Lynn, a fan of Wong Fei-hung and traditional martial arts since young. “But it opened my eyes to a whole new world.”
The trip, you see, had been nothing short of an epiphany: “Before that, I was only able to learn about history through social studies and TV shows. Entering the clan however felt like entering a time capsule undisturbed by the hustle and bustle of modern Singapore.”
The thunderstruck teenager began spending more and more time at the clan. In her story, she recalls a strained late-night encounter with her mother after one such incident:
““一个女生为什么要练到这么晚才回家?” (“Why does a girl have to train till so late?”)
“I heard my mum’s disapproving voice as I unlocked the house door. I looked up at the wall clock while avoiding my mum’s intense gaze. It was already past midnight.
“Because I’m not Cinderella,” I joked in an attempt to ease the tension.
She was certainly not pleased with my reply … Growing up in a traditional Chinese family, coming home late was considered unacceptable for a girl, especially when the reason was training in martial arts late into the night at a clan association—a place stereotypically male-dominated and some say associated with secret societies.”
Lynn had fallen in love without realising it. But unlike other childhood infatuations that are fickle and fleeting, this one would lead her to exciting new discoveries.
Fast forward 17 years later to a typical weekday morning at the Kwong Wai Siew Lee Clan Association. All was quiet, except for the clicking of a camera shutter. Now 32-years-old, Lynn—who’s lost none of her youthful chutzpah—is busy capturing the clan’s sombre exterior with her camera. It is one of the handful of clans in the vibrant enclave of Ann Siang Road that have survived the onslaught of time.
Clad in a cheongsam, Lynn is modern-day heroine, armed with more than just a clunky DSLR. She also possesses a psychology and business degree from NUS, several trophies in traditional Chinese martial arts, and a life mission.
Only five years ago and with her parent’s full support, Lynn gave up her PhD at INSEAD to be a full-time champion of Chinese culture and heritage. She now holds a leadership position in five clan associations—including Kong Chow Wui Koon—and is in a race against time to document Singapore’s remaining clans before they disappear forever.
For the uninitiated, clans once served as “embassies” for newly arrived immigrants from China, offering networking and commercial opportunities as well as lifelong friendships to those who have travelled far from home. Now stripped off of their original purpose, many clans are struggling to remain relevant.
Lynn, however, believes they are more important than ever.
“These clans existed to serve our forefathers,” she said. “They’ve touched lives and they’ve helped in nation building. I believe it’s our responsibility to preserve them, because they remind us of the struggle it took to get to where we are today.”
Not many Singaporeans share her sentimentality. Of the 500 or more clans that were established in the country, only about 200 have remained, according to Lynn.
“People often ask why is there a need to preserve so many clans. Why can’t there be an umbrella clan instead?” she says. “That’s because we’ll be losing a lot of diversity … China is so big, and each of these places have their own produce, festivals and language. Canton alone has at least 16 distinct districts.”
These days, Lynn is all about damage control (“I thought I could revive some of these clans but I now realise how naive I was.”). She goes traipsing around the city salvaging mementos—badges, old photographs, even ancestral veneration scriptures—of soon-to-be shuttered clans.
Recalling these incidents makes her grimace: “When I was at one of the clans, I spotted some old manuscripts in a trash bag. It turns out they were account ledgers from the Qing Dynasty! But the worst part was that the people who threw them away had no idea how precious they were.”
“This is just the tip of the iceberg. So much is being lost every day,” she says, sighing.
Of course, there are also intangible items like clan recipes and festivals that need to be recorded. Lynn whips out a photo album filled with fast-disappearing specialties like the Guo Zeng Zong, a type of pillow-shaped glutinous rice dumpling from the Song Dynasty, and the Mandarin Peel Duck, a duck-based dish featuring a golden broth, made from boiling the peel of mandarin oranges aged for 30 years.
“It’s from Xinhui and was a tribute item for the empress dowager,” she says, referring to the latter. “The mandarin peel from there can be as valuable as gold depending on how many years it is aged. Unfortunately, the man who has helped me recreate the dish has passed away.”
Lynn has compiled these recipes for Ho Yeah!, a Cantonese and Hakka food and culture festival she organised back in 2018. One of her biggest endeavours yet, it’s a subtle and clever approach to attracting the public’s attention, since food is a common denominator for Singaporeans.
The next Ho Yeah! Festival—along with other heritage-related events and exhibitions she organized—was supposed to happen last year, but that was before a virus tore through the earth, leaving a trail of wrecked plans in its wake.
It is now mid-afternoon but the Lee clan has received few visitors apart from the steady trickle of customers visiting the TCM clinic that’s discreetly set up in the back of the building. Many clans now survive by renting out available space, and this 147-year-old association is no different—apart from the TCM clinic, it also collects rental fees from an interior design firm occupying its upper floors.
The clan’s main hallway—which is redolent of 1960s Singapore, with its mosaic floor, antique furnishings and Chinese lanterns—now doubles up as a waiting area for the clinic’s patients. Its walls are mostly adorned with framed monochrome portraits of men and women—portraits that Lynn helped to painstakingly restore—and the occasional Chinese poetry scroll. Among these, a photo of the late Lee Dai Soh hangs, his bespectacled face looking placidly upon those who may or may not recognise him as the legendary Cantonese storyteller at Rediffusion.
Lynn is the only source of energy in this place—she’s now speaking with gusto whilst fiddling with her camera, oblivious to the inquisitive stares of the elderly patients.
“Even though things have been done a certain way for so long, I think many clans now realise they need to change with the times in order to stay afloat,” she says.
Sitting across from Lynn is one by-product of these changes. Madam Lee Swee Har, however, seems to be unruffled by the fact that she’s made clan history by becoming the association’s first chairperson three years ago. Things were very different when the 79-year-old was first introduced to the clan by her father at the age of 14.
“The clan leaders were always male before this, but it wasn’t something I ever pondered over,” says the highly accomplished singer and chef in her native Cantonese. “There were more than a thousand of us, and we were all like brothers and sisters. We usually played music and sang when we got together, and also occasionally performed for the radio.”
Lynn, on the other hand, isn’t impervious to this breakthrough: “Clans were once patriarchal, but I think there’s a trend towards equality. When I first joined the lion dance troupe in a clan, there was only one other female. It was even taboo for females to touch a lion’s head if it was new.”
Today, membership numbers at the Lee Clan have plummeted to just above a hundred—its one and only youth member is in his 40s. It used to be that one needed to have the surname Lee and hail from one of three districts in China (Guangzhou, Huizhou or Zhaoqing) to be able to register, but since the clan’s very survival hinges on fresh blood, regulations have relaxed over the years.
While Lynn herself isn’t a member, she is helping Madam Lee with a few events in conjunction with the Singapore Heritage Festival (most of these events are now cancelled due to the heightened COVID-19 restrictions). The pair first met back in 2017 while Madam Lee was giving a talk at the clan.
“Lynn has done a lot for us,” says Madam Lee. “I think it’s really admirable to be doing what she’s doing in a capitalistic world. She’s not motivated by money. We need more people like her.”
Beaming at the compliments, Lynn remarks: “It’s not that younger Singaporeans don’t care, it’s because they aren’t aware of all the things they could lose once these places are gone. I think we can all start by asking our family and relatives questions about our own ancestors – their name and where they come from before settling in Singapore. That way, it’s easier to find the clan you belong to.
Lynn’s own story has come full circle recently, after she discovered the identity of her own great-grandfather in a clan register.
“I never knew what he looked like until the day I saw his picture. I always thought I was a third generation Singaporean Chinese, but it turns out we’ve been here for longer.”

Who Decides Where Home Is? After 17 Years, A Long Time Immigrant Reflects on Leaving Singapore",Louisa Lim,TRUE,TRUE
"Who Decides Where Home Is? After 17 Years, A Long Time Immigrant Reflects on Leaving Singapore",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-after-17-years-a-long-time-immigrant-reflects-on-leaving-singapore/,29-May-21,"Photography by Thaddeus J Loh.
As a child, Maria “Masha” Isaeva was plagued with skin rashes. They were so bad her skin would become flakey, red, and itchy to the point that she couldn’t sleep. Her doctors told her she couldn’t eat anything but potatoes—anything else would cause an allergic reaction. By the time she was 12, she was so underweight that her apartment elevator wouldn’t detect her presence when she was alone in the lift, making her unable to travel in it.
Desperate for a resolution, her mother booked them a flight from Vladivostok, their hometown, to Singapore, where Masha’s Japanese stepfather was residing (she refers to him as her Otousan, which means father).
Soon, with the help of Singaporean doctors and the tropical climate, her body changed. The red rashes on her skin started fading away, and she was allowed to eat an assortment of food for the first time—like strawberries, chocolate, and anything containing milk. She would rarely ever get flare-ups again—until recently.
Red patches have reappeared on her skin. The cause? The stress of moving from Singapore in a matter of days. After 17 years, Masha’s visa is still tied to her employment. And when most of the foreigners in her company were trimmed, she decided to leave—following the exodus of almost 200,000 other foreigners who left in 2020 alone.
10 days To Go (From Masha’s Diary)
I have made a list in a day of who I can meet for the last time
in my last 10 days in Singapore.
It’s funny having to squeeze years of memories with people
into hourly interactions.
21 May 2021
Living in Pasir Ris, Masha was assigned to Loyang Primary School from MOE, where she attended before moving on to Greenview Secondary. Integration in school was not easy at first—between the language barrier and looking obviously foreign, she was often excluded.
While she soon managed to make close friendships, it was her teachers who never warmed up to her. Soon after joining, Masha tried to join the National Police Cadet Corps (NPCC) as a CCA. She joined because she “likes discipline,” and because it was a good opportunity to learn Malay.
But when it was time for all the enrolled students to collect their uniforms, Masha’s was the only one not there. Instead of picking up the attire, she was taken into a room where she was interrogated. “They asked me, a 12-year-old, what my intentions were with joining NPCC,” she recalled. “They asked me if I intended to send my uniform abroad, and they asked me to promise not to export it.”
The conversation ended with an agreement that her uniform would be ordered in, but by National Day, it was still nowhere to be seen. “Just march without a uniform,” they told her. Unsettled, Masha dropped out.
“I told them I wasn’t going to go forth with marching on the day itself as the only person without the uniform, it’s embarrassing.”
Over her 17 years here, the system has reminded Masha time and time again that she is a foreigner. Often, when flying back from abroad when travelling, she would get questioned by authorities. “You’re too young to be working here alone, we need to check your documents,” officers would tell her. Similar to Masha, I have heard from many Russian women that they are often questioned about being escorts or prostitutes in airports across the globe.
Now again she is reminded of her standing, as she waits for the result of her 10th PR application—the previous nine of which were rejected.
9 Days
Time has a very powerful way of filtering out chaos
The noise of people you thought saw you are now silent
The people whose intentions had been a grey area
have a fixed colour palette now.
This day will become a blur too, and moving
will allow me to see things from a broader perspective,
from a lens of a person who is not weighed down
by a giant adolescent diaper.
Those who do not become a blur, will be immortalised
Are there more reasons to leave than to stay now?
22 May 2021
The last time I saw Masha before this interview was over a year ago. She told me how when we last met, I asked her a question that has remained etched in her mind ever since.
What keeps you here?
When we met again, she knew the answer, one she had thought about continuously. It’s the relationships with people.
“My first love happened here. My first graduation and job too,” she said. “I watched my boyfriend go through NS while I got my diploma. I went to the funerals of my friend’s mothers. My own mother’s church friends became my second family when she left.”
“Over time, my friends have become my everything here. When I’m sick, they are the ones who send porridge to my house and bring me groceries.”
While heartwarming to hear, all of that is not recognised on paper. But while her documents say she is an immigrant, it takes barely more than 10 minutes with her to realise she is far from one. Her accent sways from intense Singlish to generic English. If you talk to her about her career as an Art Director, she can easily go on about the plans she had for Singapore’s creative community. These were so consolidated she even applied for PR via a National Arts Council scheme that rewards talents who intend to make long-term contributions to the local scene—but this attempt also failed.
6 Days
What am I feeling now? The word for this sits between the pages
of a foreign vocabulary I am yet to discover.
Like when you visit a new place for the first time, and you experience loss,
disorientation and floatiness for the first couple of days
Places I used to frequent as a student,
the parks where we would have family BBQs
or the traffic lights I would cross for daily business lunches
have become unfamiliar. It’s very uncanny.
I feel like my mind has already detached itself
from this town while my body has not.
My mind is floating somewhere,
I will find out soon when I land.
25 May
So where are you from? I asked Masha.
“I’m a citizen of the world!” she laughs with a grin on her face. “Say that.”
The second time I asked, she said she only knows that Singapore is home.
“I feel the most stable here. I feel like I belong but literally, I don’t. I thought about that over Hari Raya. My childhood friends invite me to their homes every year. I’ve seen their siblings grow up and their parents grow old, but unlike them, I don’t know if i’ll be there next year.”
While these memories float around vividly in Masha’s mind, they only exist there. There’s no tangible proof of them being there—and she knows it.
“I’m not investing in and buying property, and I’m not in cancer research or finance,” she said. “And I really like that the government is putting locals first. Every country should do that.”
But why is Masha not a local? She will never know—PR application rejections don’t come with reasoning.
Singapore has a relatively high number of foreigners living in the country, but what kind of immigrants are preferred remains unknown. On one hand, there are immigrants like Masha who are essentially locals—their relationships and lifestyle are built side by side with their Singaporean peers.
Then there are immigrants who come in with job expertise or financial prowess—your researchers, finance moguls, and shipbrokers, among many others. Naturally, the government may prefer these individuals for the knowledge and experience they bring with them.
But the same week that Masha leaves, Bloomberg announces that Singapore is the new preferred destination for the region’s ultra-rich and their families. This contrast begs one question: what will the future of integration between foreigners and locals look like?
What happens when deeply rooted foreigners are forced out, but schemes like the Global Investors Program give the ultra-rich a fast track to gaining Permanent Residency (PR)?
It is only understandable that the government would want to attract investment and talent to the country, but to what extent can these immigrants integrate into society?
Last year, a survey found that more than 6 in 10 Singaporeans felt that foreigners were not doing enough to integrate. But as the Bloomberg article highlights, the newly settled rich are currently scrambling for luxury property, sports cars, and golf club memberships—is this where bonds with everyday Singaporeans are fostered? They would need to go far beyond their comfort zones if they intend to integrate into Singapore society.
For Masha, someone who has been through the same system as the average Singaporean kid, these headlines could be a source of resentment. But Masha says she is leaving with a free heart.
“I’m not angry or sad, I’m just at a state where I’m trying to draw conclusions. After having been through so much here, there’s so much emotional baggage to sort through.”
5 days
The most interesting part of my journey will start
when I leave Singapore
People will want to know where I come from,
about my childhood, and why I’m not living there anymore after 17 years
When you’re done chewing your gum, do you spit it out?
26 May 2021
Recently I interviewed Jane, a Singaporean woman who left her insurance career, car, condo, and marriage to live a digital nomad life in Europe. One of the biggest realisations she had was that all her old dreams and aspirations were in fact not hers, but those absorbed from the society around her.
When she came to visit Singapore after a year, the joy of seeing her old family and friends was trumped by sadness, a sense of feeling out of place.
“I love Singapore, and I love my country, but if I can’t feel at home there, then where can I feel at home? I felt sad because I knew I would no longer be able to fit in,” Jane said.
When I asked Masha what the scariest part of leaving was, she said something similar. It wasn’t leaving behind people or memories, as these can always be revisited. The scariest part was leaving behind a mindset, a way of living life she may soon outgrow. You can come back to people, but you can’t revisit a life you have evolved from.
“I know once I’m out of this bubble my life will change 360,” she stipulated. “After seeing more of what life has to offer, I may not want to return, and I’m afraid of that feeling.”
“That part is scary because that means I’ll have to put this huge chunk of my life—17 years—behind for good.”
And how will Masha explain those years to new people she will meet? How do you explain to someone that you are Russian, but you feel more Singaporean, even though you can’t legally call yourself that, or live there?
Until this day, her sense of identity has been heavily tied to being in Singapore physically. But once she steps foot on that plane, 17 years of life will have only existed in her memories and of those around her. How does one reconcile that?
“I still remember queing up to buy this paper. I wanted to remember how I was here at such a pivotal moment in history. The store I was in had sold out, but a guy who managed to get a few copies saw me and gave me one.”
2 Days
“Why today so tired?” said Aunty Winnie from Cheers, who probably knows more about my everyday than the person next to me at work
Aunty Winnie works at West Coast Plaza Cheers. When she found out I was leaving, she said “can give me something from Russia one? Souvenir?”
I told her I don’t have anything from Russia as I grew up here, but I will try to think of something
“Never mind just pass me something before you leave”
I didn’t manage to catch her as she was off shift, so I passed her a letter and handmade bracelet through a colleague
“Hey i know you r leaving Singapore this week, i’m so exhausted, can I just send courier to pass me back the powerbank?”
A text from my ex-colleague and friend who’s known me for 5 years. He was like a brother to me

This Polyamorous Commune in Singapore Aims to Help People Find Authenticity in Relationships,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-polyamorous-commune-singapore-aims-help-people-find-authenticity-relationships/,30-May-21,"Photography by Liang Jin Tey / RICE Media.
Gabe and Elle first met through a dating app. They watched Jumanji on their first date, and it just so happened that they had the same lifestyle philosophy about open relationships.
For both of them, the scripted Singapore relationship is far from appealing: getting married by 25, BTO by 30, then having kids and a traditional family structure. To them, this arrangement prohibits connecting with and loving other human beings outside their relationship. They both feel that there are so many interesting people in this world, and it is possible to build deep intimacy with more than one person.
Gabe is a man of many interests and passions. While he holds a full-time job, he is also an avid practitioner of sensual massage therapy on the side, and works with both women and men. This is how he first got acquainted with the polyamorous lifestyle. Meanwhile Elle, a freelance designer, has pursued her own fair share of research, and exploration into this lifestyle, out of her own interest and curiosity. The two quickly connected over the same vision of how a relationship should be.
“We are both solo polyamorists who get along so well, and decide to cohabit together without marriage,” Elle said. “Our primary partners are ourselves, we are two complete individuals who choose to take care of each other. In this sense we get to date other people and have sex with other people outside of our relationship, but this does not diminish the strength in our relationship in any way.
“If anything, this arrangement is a testament to how strong our bond is, because we choose to stay together out of our conscious will and love as a daily choice, not because we have to follow through till ‘death do us part’.”
Just last year, the couple decided to move in together in the middle of the pandemic to an HDB flat in the heartlands. But before you think that this was a typical move-in arrangement, here’s the caveat: they moved in together with another couple—Art and Dee—who practices a dominant-submissive relationship, making the household essentially a quadruple “polyamorous commune” of sort.
They’ve come to call the space “The 360 Experience.” It is not only a co-living space, but also a space to host “holistic” sexual education related events, collaborating with other polyamorous advocates and practitioners in their communities.
‘360’ (degree) refers to an all-rounded education, true to their mission to cover every aspect of growth in self-discovery, sex, love, and intimacy. Elle explained: “A lot of sex education platform and courses in Singapore are usually limited to abstinence and negative consequences. People don’t find them relevant or informative at all. We are teaching through different means and sensorial experiences, using tools, props, and practical workshops. We are creative and versatile. We want to provide a multidisciplinary sex education that is inclusive, honest, complete, real and available for everyone.”
The second couple in the household, Art and Dee also met through a dating app.
Dee, who works in the healthcare industry, came from a very traditional Muslim family. Before meeting Art, she was previously engaged in a toxic relationship where her fiancé would control her behaviour, refusing to let her be herself.
“It was a toxic relationship but I did not realise how bad it was. I was not myself, I was being shamed for having desires and inclination to do many things. When I finally met Art, it felt like a breath of fresh air. He did not judge me—he encouraged and supported all of my explorations, my needs, and my desires. I felt heard and nourished.”
Art, a bartender-turned-food delivery rider, came from two prior failed marriages, so he understands how a lot of couples in Singapore are trapped in toxic marriages or relationships where they are unable to grow or to be themselves.
“It is so easy to lose sight of who you are when you feel like you have to conform to a template dictated by society,” he says. “With every failure, I learnt more about myself and that led me to who I am today, someone with crystal-clear clarity on what I need and want from my romantic relationships. Effective, vulnerable, open communication and strong trust are foundational to create a lasting relationship.”
Through their explorations in the polyamory communities and alternative lifestyles, they met Gabe and Elle. The two couples hit it off immediately and became good friends. They’ve gone for staycation trips together, and enjoy each other’s company immensely. Then, in 2017, on a fateful night over drinks, they decided they would move in together in the coming future. They understood that they connected intellectually and emotionally, and share similar relationship values. They also wanted to educate others on how to have better relationships. Hence the idea of The 360 Experience was born.
Even though they live together, the two couples are not romantic and sexual with each other. Art and Dee share a very different polyamorous relationship model than Gabe and Elle. They are exclusive with each other and chose to get married, followed by signing an official dominant-and-submissive contract.
Elle and Gabe were respectively the best woman and the best man, acting as witnesses in the marriage and the signing of the contract. Elle cried buckets during the signing ceremony. “It was such an emotional, touching moment,” Elle recalled.
But how exactly does the dominant-submissive contract work?
It is basically an agreement to establish a communication style and share an exchange of power. Dee defers to Art for most decisions but still retains her autonomy to veto. The dominant, Art, agrees to be responsible for the well being of his submissive, Dee, and has her best interests in all aspects of her life at heart, including everyday routines and even her diet. In addition, Art dictates to Dee how he would like to be taken care of. An example of such instructions would be how exactly Art likes his morning coffee made. On the other hand, Dee shares with Art her goals in self-improvement and self-care, and Art guides her through their shared journeys.
“It is not legally binding though,” Art clarified. “We are always revising the terms of the contract for further improvement, and we can adapt them according to different life stages.
I visited this curious HDB commune for this interview. As far as the layout went, it was a completely normal unit, but with a few little twists.
First came a rather spacious living room that is used to host workshops. On one side stood a big shelf displaying sex toys and relationship card games. On the other side was a headless mannequin body tied up with shibari ropes, next to a curious metal rig from which an aerial yoga hammock hung. A curtain at the corner led to the dining room.
In the dining room, there was a mood board populated with erotic photographs: from boudoir to bondage, from nyotaimori (the art of eating sushi from one’s body) to nuru massage (Japanese erotic body-to-body massage where participants are covered in odorless and colorless massage lotion)—the tastefully taken snaps showed an eclectic range of experimental sensual activities.
“These are just a few of the workshops and activities that we host in this space,” Gabe told me. He pointed to a blackboard mounted on another wall in the dining room. “There on the blackboard is the list of our upcoming workshops. We do not plan too far ahead as we all have full time career and family commitments. We communicate through personal channels, sometimes social media, and host bespoke, tailored events only one at a time. Our offerings are very intimate and catered for small groups.”
I saw all kinds of events and workshops, from the more avant-garde practices such as bondage and nuru to more “vanilla” activities such as “mindful masturbation”, learning about “erogenous zones”, “communicating consent”, and even a “cocktail making masterclass.”
However what really caught my attention was the upper right corner of the blackboard, which spelled out the key values of the commune: connection, openness, communication, inclusive, love, safe space, discovery and awareness, and so on.
The foursome shares that life inside the commune is a lot of hard work. They come up with a proper schedule for each other to do house chores, cooking, and other logistical operations so that everything runs smoothly and harmoniously. They all live and work together inside the commune, on top of organising events for the public—hence life inside the commune can be very hectic if not properly managed.
“We work hard to create events and workshops that will be useful for the attendees. We have to prepare presentation slides, plan for event flows, and collaborate with the right people in the scene,” said Elle. “We have to make sure that we respect and appreciate each other’s needs and schedule in the commune, and give each other space. We take turns using the living room and we decide on all the events and workshops by consensus.”
They are also very open and accepting of each other’s sexual expressions and desires, regularly inviting friends of their communities to join in or host events. Unlike other groups of roommates who might stigmatise and judge each others’ sexual activities, this is one big way in which they do things differently.
Another thing that they emphasize in the commune is a radically honest, compassionate communication format to discuss everything. They have regular house meetings to check in with each other on any problem that needs to be addressed. Instead of treating each other passive aggressively and letting dissatisfaction fester into resentment, they choose to always have open discussions.
“We call out on each other … lovingly of course,” Gabe added with a chuckle. “Of course we encounter problems like any other group of people living together. Maybe one of us forgets to clear the dishes, maybe one bails on cleaning the house, or hogs the bathroom too long … But we will voice out all these concerns in a neutral, rational, calm, and loving manner. We pride ourselves for striving to have the best communication possible with each other.”
They also frequently schedule group dates and celebrate every milestone in their joint relationships. Group hugs, cuddles, and massages are common in the household.
People outside the polyamory lifestyle might associate all this with debauchery, hedonism, and recklessness, but according to them, polyamory relationships can offer a more structured flexibility and diverse life experiences as compared to traditional relationships. This lifestyle requires a commitment to honesty, ethics and mindfulness to maintain.
The last room in the unit was the “play room”. At first glance, it seemed like a normal bedroom with a queen-sized bed. However, a curtain on one side of the room opened to a big wardrobe filled with all sorts of sex toys, tools, ropes and costumes. Toys and paraphernalia can be cost-prohibitive in Singapore and many find themselves unable to have a firsthand experience at retail outlets or online. The 360 Experience presents an opportunity for singles and couples to explore different things that they may like.
I was genuinely impressed by what I learned from the two couples that day. It sounded to me that spaces like The 360 Experience need to be more common and accessible. We all sorely need access to better education regarding love, sex and intimacy. We want answers, opinions and insights to discuss things that we repress or are deemed taboo, and a non-judgmental safe space to discuss and explore.
It is always a constant challenge for the four of them to keep the space financially sustainable, as they are not marketing or scaling their events for large profits. They consider the commune a non-profit; a passion project. Moving forward, they hope that their network and community members can grow organically and contribute to the longevity of their passion, purpose, and mission.
They are envisioning a fully fledged co-living and educational space in the future, equipped with an F&B space that is open to the public. They hope they can eventually run this space full time.
“Fingers crossed that we will be able to spread our philosophy and help many couples in Singapore become more authentic with themselves and each other,” Dee concluded with a hopeful smile.
The 360 Experience is available on Telegram, Twitter, and Instagram at @th360exp.

"We Took A 12 KM Walk To The Industrial Heartlands Of Tuas, Because Phase 2(HA)",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-travel-a-12-km-walk-to-tuas-phase-2ha/,30-May-21,"All photography by the author for RICE Media.
A month ago, before Singapore went into ‘heightened alert’, I hit upon the idea of walking to Tuas on foot, following the 2009 heritage trail from Pioneer MRT to Tuas Link station.
The journey is 12-kilometres long and takes roughly two and a half hours. If I set out in the afternoon, I’d reach my destination just in time to catch the ‘best sunset in Singapore’ at Raffles Marina.
Why was I doing this? Well, with gyms being shut down, and massive queues forming in nature, I felt like I was slowly suffocating here in Singapore.
The second reason for walking to Tuas was morbid curiosity.
As an outsider, a lot of what I thought I knew about Singapore have turned out to be half- truths. There’s a gap between the clean-cut image that Singapore projects to the world and the often harsh realities that are hidden within its borders. With tensions rising in this pandemic, more locals are starting to notice this rift as well.
To this end, I wanted to head west to see Singapore’s industrial heartlands for myself. I wanted to follow the paths and viaducts of the ‘real’ economy that most Singaporeans choose to ignore, on their way to their air-conditioned offices in the CBD.
In short, I wanted to test the firmness of Singapore’s foundations with my own two feet.
I. The Heat
It is unconscionably hot in early May. Not just your garden-variety tropical heat, but the kind of heat that really saps willpower and raises tempers. It’s the kind of hot that makes you want to question everything.
In the ensuing days, I make several half-hearted attempts to begin my walk to Tuas, only to be turned back, first by the suffocating humidity, then by a sudden thunderstorm, which, turned the air into even more of a sauna instead of cooling things down.
This is the type of climate that can really draw out the crazies: Beow Tan. The Pasir Ris Man. Bruce Lee and the Karate Kid. In Ang Mo Kio, cats are being found with slash wounds on their bodies.
But even as I condemn these violent acts, I’d be lying to say that I don’t recognise the anger.
A five-minute walk to my neighbourhood kopitiam is enough to leave me short-tempered and drenched in sweat. Despite being an early advocate of facemasks, I feel an urge to declare myself sovereign and join the anti-mask movement.
Eventually, I start to let my guard down and wear my mask beneath my nose.
In this climate of uncertainty, it’s a small and feeble attempt to take back control.
“This is the kind of weather that makes me want to hurt somebody,” I tell my wife.
II. The Road
I finally set out towards Tuas on a Wednesday—just two days before Phase 2 (HA).
To maximize my shade, the plan is to follow the MRT viaduct from Pioneer station all the way to the Johor Strait, before rounding the corner to Tuas Link and Raffles Marina.
Beyond the residential HDBs of Pioneer, the road widens, as do the number of trucks barreling towards the expressway. The noise of traffic is deafening, making it hard for me to find my bearings. Even behind my face mask, my lungs are filled with the smell of burnt rubber and car exhaust. It takes just fifteen minutes before I’m dripping with sweat.
Enroute, I make a quick pit-stop at a Chinese restaurant that’s frequented by the PRC community, just south of Pioneer Road. I’m there to inquire about a whole roasted goat on their menu.
“Was this goat born and raised in Singapore?” I ask the restaurant owner’s wife.
She shakes her head. “No, the goat isn’t Singaporean. It had to be imported from Malaysia.”
Disappointed, I move on, all the while lamenting the fact that the Singaporean goat is slowly being replaced by foreigners.
By the time I reach Joo Koon station it’s almost the end of the work day. Outside the NTUC Fairprice hub, workers huddle outside the entrance smoking cigarettes. They all have different coloured uniforms on, some in blue, some in yellow, some in white, but all of them wear the same blank and exhausted looks on their faces.
Poor bastards. A storm is coming and they don’t even know it.
III. The Workers
Turning off the main road, I get lost somewhere in a quiet industrial estate in Gul Circle, caught within a labyrinth of factories and migrant worker dormitories. At a deserted traffic light, an auntie behind the wheel of a Toyota honks at me. She puts up both hands, in the universal body language of ‘boy, what the hell do you think you’re doing?’
I’m beginning to ask myself the same question. What am I doing here? Because none of what I’m seeing makes sense to me. My sheltered scholarly ass has absolutely no frame of reference for the industrial parks and construction and engineering firms that I walk past.
I watch blankly as containers get loaded and unloaded onto trucks, and stare at the bales of packaged goods stacked up towards the warehouse ceilings—without really understanding anything.
Everything feels alien. Detached.
I walk past the enclosures of factory workers. They’re all sitting behind chain-link fences, on makeshift benches and picnic tables. Some are on their phones, others are having dinner. This has been their life for the better part of the year, their movements heavily restricted, even as the rest of Singapore has moved from Circuit Breaker to Phase 2.
As some of them stare back at me with equally blank expressions, I realise I don’t know anything about these people. Their lives are so removed from mine that I can’t even imagine myself in their shoes.
On the main road, I see plenty of lorries transporting migrant workers in the rear decks like cattle. Some are smaller and can fit 8-10 men. Others are spacious enough to carry dozens. Last month, two workers died and over a dozen were hospitalised in two separate lorry accidents. Apparently, that’s just the cost of doing business here.
While a vocal minority of Singaporeans might make a fuss about seat belts and safety standards, others will say that these are ‘unfortunate incidents’ that can’t be helped. The drivers should’ve been more careful. A few weeks later, the construction firms will beg for more workers to replace them, and Singaporeans will wait impatiently for their BTOs to finish construction.
For all its reputation for order and efficiency, this is the practical side to Singapore that gives me pause. It encourages zero-sum games, where your loss is my gain, and the price of human dignity must be ‘carefully balanced’ against a construction company’s profit-loss statement.
Perhaps we can rationalise this because most of these workers are foreigners. The ballasts that Singapore shed in a storm. And even as they build our homes and pave our roads, they exist outside the social contract that Singaporeans have signed up for.
But when I walk past the chain-linked fences towards Tuas and see the Chinese and Indian workers sitting behind them, I can’t tell who’s a local and who’s a foreigner. Who’s a PR and who’s a citizen.
Do these distinctions even matter when they’re all stuck in brutal, race-to-the-bottom jobs in the forgotten corners of this city?
IV. The Marina
By 7 PM, I manage to round Tuas Crescent. From here, it’s a straight shot all the way to Tuas Link station.
Despite my best efforts to make good time, I know I’m not going to make the sunset at Raffles Marina. I can see the light dwindling in the distance; no matter how fast I walk, it’ll be too late. But that’s okay.
Sometimes life just works out that way.
At the westernmost edge of Pioneer Road, solitary migrant workers lounge under the MRT shade on blankets. I can’t tell whether they’re praying or resting. Only later do I realise that it was Eid al-Fitr that evening, the final day of Ramadan. The workers had been sitting there watching the sunset, far from family and home.
I reach Raffles Marina and scan my TraceTogether token at security. My face is hot and sweaty and I barely manage to clear the temperature check.
Feet blistering, I limp past a Mercedes Benz as it’s pulling out of the parking lot. I poke my head in for a moment into the grand lobby of the Raffles Marina Club. In my sweat-drenched state, the air-conditioning is almost too overpowering. So I retreat via a side path towards the pier.
At the pier, a French man playfully slaps the ass of his partner as they walk towards the Marina Bistro, their swimsuits glistening in the dusk. There’s a lightness to the air that stands in harsh contrast to the industrial scenes I just witnessed.
Growing up around the rich in an international school, I’ve noticed that there’s a specific kind of distance the rich can create between the world and themselves. It’s a distance that can only be achieved with money.
Sooner or later, you start to believe that your problems are the only ones that matter. The only ones that exist. A cocoon of comfort numbs your senses and dulls your capacity to feel anything. Everything comes too easy. You know all the rules and just go through the motions.
Sometimes, this is the way I feel about Singaporeans.
Whose song was it anyway? The ‘Singapore’ vs. ‘Indian’ variant. Never have I seen so much being made of so very little.
When you zoom out even further beyond this city’s borders, and consider the hospital beds and ICU units being overrun and families not able to say their last goodbyes to their loved ones, it can make some of the outbursts I hear from Singaporeans sound spoiled and coddled.
I reach the end of my walk at Raffles Lighthouse with its selfie-taking locals, and I take a seat by the water’s edge to catch my breath. Malaysia lies over the bridge in the darkness. Over 6,000 cases per day. The half-finished condo developments in the distance are as dark as the jungle that surrounds them.
Everything looks all but abandoned.
V. The East-West Line
From Raffles Marina, I slowly trudge back to Tuas Link station, and board a train back towards the CBD.
Both Asian and Western cultures have this romantic idea of the mythical, unexplored West, whether it’s the Monkey King in search of enlightenment, or cowboys and Indians in America’s westward expansion.
But what if there is no epiphany?
What if, by attempting to replace my pandemic fatigue with a physical one, I got no closer to true empathy or understanding? What if, in the end, there are some things that I won’t ever be sure of and can never fully control?
At Tuas Crescent station, a group of migrant workers board the train and sit down in the seats next to me. We are all squeezed together, shoulder to shoulder. Too close for comfort. I get up from my seat and move towards the door. While I’d like to think that it’s not racism that makes me do this, I honestly can’t say for sure.
I doubt Singaporeans can either.
Covid and job losses have created a pressure cooker, where all plans have been disrupted and all lines have blurred. And we’re suffocating, just looking for someone to blame.
On the East-West Line, the train doors open. The night settles in.
I look up from the latest Covid numbers only to find myself right back where I started.

This Polyamorous Commune in Singapore Aims to Help People Find Authenticity in Relationships",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
"Indians Not Allowed, Thank You.",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-racism-indian-national-singapore/,31-May-21,"All images by Zachary Tang.
“Indians not allowed, thank you.”
This was what an agent said to me back in April, when I was looking for a new home here in Singapore. Trouble is, this wasn’t even an isolated incident. Before long, I had to either start looking for houses owned by Indian families, or give a caveat to agents beforehand that I am, in fact, Indian.
I felt bad, of course. But more than that, I felt pity for these people for having such mindsets even in this day and age.
(Coincidentally, my Swedish housemate finally found a house for us which was apparently owned by an Indian man, and I indulged myself in the house shifting and tried to forget these racist experiences that I’ve accumulated over this two-and-a-half-year long stay in Singapore.)
Racism—it’s not always in plain sight. But one can still sense it in the everyday.
In that look in the eyes of one person. Or a smile returned with hostility during a walk in the park. You sense it behind sugar-coated words, especially when you try to have an open discussion about it. Even if it’s not always put in words, you can sense it.
All that said, if you ask me if I think Singapore is a racist country, my answer would still be a big no.
Kewal came to Singapore to study theatre, and has lived here for close to three years.
A friend of mine from India was having lunch with his Chinese girlfriend (from Hong Kong) at an Indian restaurant one day. Out of nowhere a middle-aged, Singaporean Chinese lady leaned over and said something to her in Mandarin, in a low tone. His girlfriend snapped in response that it was none of her business. A long silence followed.
When my friend asked what the matter was, she told him that the lady informed her that “Indian men are not trustworthy, you know, so be careful.”
I mean, my friend is no Casanova or Picasso. He ain’t no John Wilkes or Peter the Great. He comes from India, but he ain’t no Maharaja Bhupinder Singh. He’s just a simple-looking, decent, brown middle-class student. I wonder if it was an Italian, Russian, Spanish, or any white guy in his place—would he have been greeted with such judgement?
I find it funny because maybe my guy’s just got tough luck. The other day, we were running late for work and rushing down an escalator when his hand brushed the hand of a Chinese woman who looked to be in her late 50s. Which he apologised for, twice. This is what she shouted back.
“Fuck off, you people do this intentionally, I will take you to the police!”, she yelled, trying to kick him. He mentioned that there were cameras around and he wouldn’t mind going to the police if she wanted. She lost her temper even more and started blabbering in Mandarin.
Throughout this entire ordeal, what stood out most was that not it was not just us — even fellow Singaporeans around could sense that she was being unreasonable and nobody paid any attention to her.
From these incidents, one can see that it takes a whole nation to make for a multicultural, interracial, peaceful society. But it takes just a few frustrated, inhumane, and unreasonable people to make us look like a racist country.
Singapore is a vibrant country to me and has those attributes that make me love it like my own country as well. Like India, it is colourful; it is home to people of multiple nationalities, faiths, and interests. It is full of nature, heritage, and art; it has a rich history in its struggle for freedom. I love the similar ways we improvise with food, where everything gets all mixed up and accepted until it’s difficult to identify their origins. Isn’t it all so beautiful?
To flag a country like this as racist would be unfair. It would be unfair to all of my Chinese, Malay, Filipino, Australian, European, and Indian friends, who have always been there, who show love and support in difficult situations.
It would be unfair to all of those sending postcards asking how I’m doing, or how my family’s doing back home in these disastrous times. Some have even asked me out or sent me homemade food just to tell me that I am not alone here. It just wouldn’t be fair.
My Indian mates and I haven’t been home for a year and a half now, and what we hear in the news is enough to send us spiralling into depression.
Every other day brings some bad news—hearing friends and relatives dying because of COVID-19 keeps us on our toes. We fear: what if something happens to our families tomorrow? Would we even be able to go home to be with them?
With all this in the backdrop, it makes the treatment of Indians here by those with crippled mindsets even more questionable and sad, like kicking us when we’re down. When the actions of these small groups of people come to national attention, sometimes it looks like they are winning against racial harmony. We shouldn’t let that happen in a country like Singapore.
My Chinese friends tell me about the kind of racist statements they hear from the people around them, and one of the silliest things I’ve come across is that “Indian houses smell like curry”.
Well, yeah … I guess they would?
Every household smells like something or other, but how is that cause for discrimination?
I remember how I didn’t like the smell of Malay and Filipino food when I came to Singapore in 2019, but that only made me curious about it. After some time with my friends from these regions who invited me over and cooked for me and introduced me to their food, I started enjoying it. All I needed was to break my walls and accept the differences and the love that everyone brings with their own culture.
The other stupid thing I hear is that “Indian houses are dirty.”
Well, myths, myths, myths. A person’s way of living isn’t just decided by their nationality. There are so many factors, like their personalities or their financial situation.
People look down on our construction workers’ quarters and call them dirty, just because they can’t afford the kind of maintenance that a regular Singaporean household can. What do you expect from someone with a monthly salary of around $450?
But still, mind you, there are houses of the same construction workers that are cleaner and way more organised than rich fellas out there who have no sense of living and couldn’t do a thing without maids in their houses, which are ten times bigger than a construction worker’s abode. But we just wouldn’t dare to go and pay a visit to the houses of people who have built our homes. It’s easier to call them names.
To break these taboos, we have to explore and experience on our own, and not be part of the crowd which blindly follows “traditions” and “beliefs”. Two years ago, when I first visited my previous rented apartment and met the owner, a sweet and humble Chinese lady, I noticed a line of doubt on her forehead. Later, I was also told by her Chinese agent how some Indian and Bangladeshi tenants had their leases terminated because they could not maintain hygiene standards.
They rented the house to me anyway. Two years later, as I was giving my keys back on the last day, my landlord laughed and told me I was her favourite tenant.
On my end, I feel we must stare back laughing instead of looking down, especially when passing by a stranger with that look in their eyes. We must pass an even brighter smile if it isn’t returned. The more people start sugar-coating their words, the more firm our voices should be when we talk about it.
All this with complete understanding that these people might be completely innocent, unaware of this virus called racism that they’re showing symptoms of, and what it might have done to their poor brains.
We need to identify them, talk to them, give them some love. That might just be the only hope for change.

Antique Warehouses Along Turf Club Road Is What We Need To Stave Off Historical Amnesia",Kewal Kartik,TRUE,TRUE
Antique Warehouses Along Turf Club Road Is What We Need To Stave Off Historical Amnesia,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-antique-warehouses-turf-club/,1-Jun-21,"All photography by Marisse Caine for Rice Media
Unless you know the specific warehouses that operate there, few would have even heard about Antique Row. Even this name is a moniker Singaporeans attach to the antique warehouses along Turf Club Road, rather than an official title.
I would not have known of Antique Row’s existence either, if not for my cousin who took a wrong turn while driving to Rider’s Cafe, which is about a 15 minutes walk away.
This treasure-trove located in an ulu part of Bukit Timah is a quiet playground for scavenger hunters, never mind that the building is dilapidated. Who knows, the unpretentious state of the building might be what aroused visitors’ curiosity to the warehouses in the first place, which, by the way, are open to the public till evening.
The four antique warehouses are hidden out of view within the secluded Bukit Timah Saddle Club and Turf City area, flanked by thick vegetation on both sides. Its rooftop is overgrown with shrubs and trees.
At first glance, I did not think highly of the row of warehouses. With a mix of wooden furniture and rock sculptures piled up and cluttered outside the building, it resembled more of a dumpster for bulky items by karung guni men, than a de facto history museum.
Afternoon coffee break outside an antique warehouse.
But the old-world charm of the vicinity caught my attention, as wild roosters roamed around in the shrubs and uncles unwound outside their warehouses. Sitting on stools around a foldable table on the road, they chatted away in Chinese dialects and drank Kopi O together, paying no heed to the hustle and bustle of city life.
For a brief moment, I thought the kampung spirit had made a comeback. Not as a national myth, of course, but more like an organic sense of community fostered among the owners.
Looking at their interactions, I could see that they have camaraderie, cracking jokes and gossiping with one another like old friends. But, more crucially, there is a culture of trust and neighbourliness. If one of the uncles had to leave their warehouse unattended to pee or make deliveries, he could always count on his neighbour to keep a lookout for him.
If I had to churn out a recipe for nostalgia, this has to be it: A group of middle-aged uncles collecting and displaying antiques in this laid-back and rustic setting, set in an elongated building built decades ago. The metal netting at the top of its facade reminds us of the past when people installed them for ventilation, instead of using fans or air-conditioners.
In one of the warehouses which belongs to 55-year-old Alan Wong, there are many items from yesteryear which would bring a tear to the eye of someone who lived through the 1960s and 70s in Singapore.
They range from black-and-white television sets (which used to be a luxury) to smaller collectibles like bus tickets (which bus conductors used to punch holes on), coated with a layer of dust which makes those items look even more time-worn. The other three warehouses also have a similar collection of local antiques, with unique items such as a vintage jackpot machine and an old barber chair.
If you dig deep enough, you may even spot a blue restricted passport placed haphazardly among the shelves of Mr Wong’s warehouse, which tells us an almost-forgotten immigration policy from the past. There was actually a time when Singaporeans held two passports: the red passport we are familiar with for international travel and the blue one for trips to West Malaysia. The blue passport was used from 1967 to 1999.
I spoke to the friendly and bespectacled Mr Wong, who set up his warehouse here in March 2018. He also has a shop in Bukit Merah which sells similar goods.
Like the other uncles, Mr Wong is knowledgeable of his antiques. Appreciating antiques is an expertise, he says. He takes it upon himself to know the history behind the products displayed in his warehouse, sometimes learning from visitors themselves. For art pieces, he has to distinguish between the real masterpieces and the forged ones.
Speaking in Mandarin, he shares the tranquility of the area—with sounds coming only from the crowing of the roosters or chirping of crickets—is what makes the place enjoyable.
The countryside-like vibes is why Mr Wong chose to relocate his warehouse here, after shifting from various locations such as Depot Road and Toh Guan Centre. On the flipside, as the Turf City precinct is secluded, he has to contend with a lower footfall. On average, he receives fewer than 10 visitors on a weekday, while the number is only slightly higher on weekends.
But Mr Wong claims that over here, he pays a lower rent of about $3,200 per month, which isn’t surprising since the area is ulu. His warehouse of over 2,000 square feet would have cost him at least $5,000 per month at somewhere more populous, according to him.
It is pitch dark when night falls—there are no lamp-posts along this stretch of road. Perhaps this is why the uncles from adjacent warehouses call it a day by 5pm. Mr Wong, however, stays on till after sunset. He says he spends his mornings at his Bukit Merah store and opens his warehouse later, at noon, while other owners start their day here at 10am.
Although the darkness does not spook him, he recalls an incident during the Hungry Ghost Festival last year. As per tradition, he lit up red prayer candles along the road and prayed. But in the midst of doing so, nature called and he went to answer it in the nearby bushes.
This was when Mr Wong saw a “lady” in a red dress who sat by the roadside near his car and disappeared after a while. He later learnt from a visitor that many years ago, a woman was raped and killed in a colonial black-and-white house nearby. Apparently, it’s a well-known tale among those working in the vicinity.
Personally, what I found more mysterious was that nobody seemed to have a clear idea of the history of this decrepit building. Multiple attempts to reach out to the relevant authorities did not yield any concrete answers.
What I did have were anecdotal accounts from the uncles. One of them said the building used to be a stable and was built in the 1930s; another remarked that the building used to store horse feed and that the road in front of it was previously closed to vehicular traffic. It’s a shame that there isn’t an official history of this old building.
Given the lack of heritage interest in this building by the authorities, I wasn’t surprised when Mr Wong told me they might need to make way by June next year as the place is slated for redevelopment. Upon checking, I learnt that plans for the site are still being studied, so my fingers are crossed while its fate hangs by a thread.
I’m praying that Antique Row does not get relegated to the history books. For one, we will lose a place with an identity and rustic character of its own, which distinguishes itself from the cookie-cutter shopping malls we are so sick of. A tight-knit community will also be erased.
Moreover, ever since the Sungei Road Thieves Market was closed in 2017, we no longer have a large collective site for antique collectors to display their wares. The closest we have now are Antique Row and Fook Hai Building, which houses a few antique shops.
Perhaps in the eyes of the authorities, they have no qualms doing away with the vintage scene because little economic incentives can be reaped from there, as compared to redeveloping the area for residential or commercial purposes.
If the Urban Redevelopment Authority redevelops Antique Row and its surroundings according to its latest Master Plan, taller flats or condominiums can be built and the government coffers can rake in more money derived from stamp duties and property taxes—more than rent collected from antique warehouse owners of an old single-storey building.
But not everything can be measured in dollars and cents. What does it bode about our collective history if we no longer have antique warehouses and shops, more so if the collectors decide to call it a day, in the event they are forced to vacate Antique Row?
From an educational perspective, I will feel sorry for our children and grandchildren if they do not have opportunities to be exposed to these vintage goods which used to be everyday items for us.
Sure, there are museums where children can learn a fair bit from. But museums only display items aligned with their curatorial agendas, rather than random knick-knacks. This does not do justice to those arbitrary items of yore, which also have a story to tell.
For example, a coin-operated public telephone displayed in Mr Wong’s warehouse may not be important enough to deserve a place in a glass casing at the history gallery of the National Museum. Ultimately, the museum’s focus is on Singapore’s pre-independence history and the public phone is a relic from the 1980s.
But it tells us a story of a time before mobile phones became common, when communication was less convenient and people on the streets had to physically search for a phone to contact someone. This was also why people used to carry 10-cent coins and pocket phone books when they were out, so they could make calls in public.
History is not just gleaned from textbooks, museums or state-sanctioned events like Singapore HeritageFest, because they do not paint a complete picture of the past. It is also through organic and ground-up experiences like visiting antique warehouses and shops which not only keeps the national memory alive, but also gives them a sense of cultural rootedness. I will be sad if one day, our children suffer from historical amnesia and are clueless about their community’s history and lived experiences of the past.
Sometimes, it is in such unassuming places like Antique Row where you unearth unexpected vintage gems and learn a history lesson. For me, Antique Row is also a social space which reminds me of simpler times in the past, as I see how laid-back and easy-going the uncles are. This is also the reason why owners like Mr Wong chose to shift his warehouse here.

Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Is A Cultural Treasure (Part 1)",Sean Lim,FALSE,TRUE
Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Is A Cultural Treasure (Part 1),https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-classic-movie-reviews-jack-neos-ah-boys-to-men-franchise-is-a-cultural-treasure-part-1/,2-Jun-21,"All images taken from Netflix.
The consensus at RICE is that Ah Boys to Men is a terrible franchise. That its director Jack Neo is a hack who has really jumped the shark from his early decent films like Money No Enough and I Not Stupid to directing big-budget B-movies that are essentially commercials for the Singapore government and corporate brands.
Jack must be wiping away tears with money at our disapproval because the S$30MM in local box office receipts tell a different story. Every couple of years, hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans willingly part with their hard-earned cash to attend these cultural events.
If it isn’t the quality filmmaking that draws them in, something else must have struck a chord — enough for them to overlook the blatant MINDEF propaganda.
But debates about quality aside, all films are also time capsules. And it’s precisely this combination of government backing, corporate sponsorship, and mainstream appeal that makes the Ah Boys franchise so interesting for the armchair anthropologist (i.e. me).
When you read between the lines, the true value of this franchise is that it tells us what the powers-that-be in Singapore accepted as ‘normal’ and ‘uncontroversial’ between the years 2012 and 2017.
This is especially relevant in light of the recent proposal by AWARE chief Corinna Lim to let women serve NS, in order to address the ‘toxic masculinity’ problem in SAF.
So what I want to know is this: does Ah Boys to Men depict a problematic NS culture? Does the series actually deliver on its promise of turning boys into men? And if so, what kind of men do they turn into?
Let’s find out.
Ah Boys to Men 1 (2012): Sponsored Sexism
In 2012, Ah Boys to Men was the highest-grossing Singaporean film of all time.
It also finds Singapore’s media authorities asleep at their terminals.
Because forget the Hollywood movies depicting drug use. The opening montage to Ah Boys to Men is the biggest threat to Singapore’s national security.
Within the opening seconds, we learn that Singapore is under attack by a mysterious military force. The brain-dead responses from Singaporeans, however, is like an invitation for Singapore’s enemies to actually invade.
Ma'am, the country is under attack.
Yes, that is a bomb.
This screenplay violates the Geneva Conventions.
Watching civilians, including women and children, get gunned down or burned to a crisp with bad CGI shouldn’t be this funny, and it borders on treason that Jack Neo has managed to make the death of innocents look so corny.
But fear not, in the ultimate non-sequitur, a GAME OVER sign flashes across the screen, and we find out that the past twelve minutes was actually … a video game all along? This is a worse plot device than ‘it was all a dream.’ It’s more upsetting when you consider that a big part of the film’s S$3M budget must’ve been spent just so that Jack could go pew pew pew and make explosion noises like a 5-year old boy playing with LEGOS.
Who said there wasn’t patronage of the arts in Singapore?
But to quote HBO’s Chernobyl, “Reality is the most horrifying genre of all.”
After this Ready Player One ripoff, we are introduced to the main character Ken Chow, whose entire personality revolves around being a rich brat who really hates NS. His girlfriend is leaving to study overseas, but the patriarchy is holding him back.
In a rage, Ken stops traffic and ends by kicking over a garbage can, before being arrested by SPF. This isn’t just your run-of-the-mill rich boy fit, it’s the kind of tantrum deserving of execution by firing squad.
“IS THIS CHILDISH ENOUGH FOR YOU?” Jesus. This girl deserves a medal for not leaving him on the spot.
What follows is your standard NS enlistment process, where we are introduced to a cast of colourful characters: Lobang (the ah beng with a heart of gold), IP Man (the playboy), Aloysius Jin (aka Wayang King), as well as the Indian, Malay and PRC stereotypes who serve as comedic wallpaper for its four Chinese-Singaporean main characters.
Sounds about right.
Partway through the movie, Ken’s worst fears finally come true. His girlfriend leaves him. After the breakup scene at Benjamin Sheares bridge, she hops into the passenger seat of a mysterious Mercedes, whose owner is presumably a richer white man with a ten-inch penis, thus confirming the darkest fantasies of incels on SammyBoy and EDMW.
But by far, the worst advice on women in this movie comes from the father figures.
Inflation’s a bitch.
During training, the boys are constantly mocked for being gu niang (ladies in Chinese). Government-issued rifles are compared to wives:
“After tonight, we are all married men. This wife is a pain. She sticks to you wherever you go. You’ll be punished for mistreating her. And she has a loud voice, ‘Bang!’ You can’t say no to marriage and you can’t get a divorce. Worst thing is, you can’t even go to bed with her.”
Wait, are we still talking about rifles? This analogy is getting weirdly personal and drawn out.
In case you think I’m cherry-picking, I present you with the CB leaf.
“Gentlemen, I proudly announce that you’re no longer boys.” Reminder: this screenplay was approved by MINDEF.
Here are some other classic Boomer pearls of wisdom that cleared Singapore’s media censors in 2012:
“Women are like clothes, ready to be worn and discarded when you’ve worn them. Why must you insist on wearing this one?”
“Next time, when other guys pick her up, they’ll be like rag-and-bone men. Because she is used goods.”
If I can sum up the internal logic of this movie it would be as follow:
Younger women are possessions with sell-by dates. They have unrealistic expectations and are overly materialistic. “90% of recruit girlfriends” will confirm cheat on you (mutiny / bing-bian) when they get the chance.
Middle-aged women are shrill and naggy mother/wife figures that should not be taken seriously.
But don’t fret, women become lovable again once they become Grandma, whose only purpose in life is to spoil their grandsons and fall ill.
As for the female siblings? Forget it. Just let them do housework. The twins from The Shining had more to do than the actresses playing Ken Chow’s sisters.
He worked hard all week to put food on the table. Can you stop your nagging and just give him a break?
Finally, the movie drags on with tedious Boomer flashbacks on how NS was so much tougher back in their day, ending on a cliffhanger after Ken’s father has a stroke/heart attack while driving to the hospital to see his shithead son.
TL;DR
Singapore in 2012 was basically an EDMW forum in real life.
Ah Boys to Men 2 (2013): Know Your Role and Shut Your Mouth
Meet the second half, the same as the first half.
In 2013, the second instalment of Ah Boys picks up where the first one left off. After his father’s accident, Ken Chow makes an about-face and is now on the straight and narrow path to OCS. Another recruit, IP Man, gets cheated on by his girlfriend. Because women, amirite?
Meanwhile, Wayang King’s wayang skills have gotten so powerful that the whole section ends up hating his guts. In a hazing incident worthy of Ngee Ann Polytechnic, they sabo him by putting a stone in his field pack during a march across Singapore.
Here, the father figures in these movies have another chance to shine. At FoodRepublic, Wayang’s father provides Wayang with more nuggets of wisdom lifted straight out of a HardwareZone message board. His advice for dealing with bullies?
The best way to fight is to not do anything.
Say what? He goes on to explain this ‘logic’ in the most convoluted way possible with, of course, yet another CGI set-piece courtesy of Jack Neo.
But maybe Wayang’s dad has a point. Later on in the film, we are introduced to the concept of being ‘marked’ by a superior officer, a practice that’s reminiscent of Jack Nicholson and A Few Good Men. Allegedly, it’s an unofficial way that superiors can punish recruits they don’t like by always volunteering them for the toughest tasks. Everyone knows it’s a punishment and yet no one can acknowledge that it exists. Since it’s off the books, there is no way of proving that this actually happens.
Which is why under these (alleged) conditions, Wayang Father’s advice of keeping your head down and avoiding the spotlight is actually a pretty good one.
Please, just let me die.
TL;DR
Fall in line, soldier. Don’t be such a lil bitch and just STFU. The manliest thing you can do is keep your head down and allow problems to slowly fester beneath the surface.
The Story So Far
This concludes the first part of this review on Jack Neo’s Bohemian Rhapsody for Boomers.
My verdict so far?
On one hand, it’s hard to get worked up over something this juvenile and pathetic. Some might even argue that I’m reading too much into a slapstick comedy.
Normally, I’d agree with you. After all, freedom of artistic expression should cover terrible artists as well. But culturally, these films become significant once you consider the context in which they were made.
While many misogynistic movies aimed at a broader audience were released in the early 2010s, only the Ah Boys franchise can boast this level of private and public support — to the point where the likes of MINDEF and other local brands had no problems slapping their logos on it.
Other movies have been banned for less. In a country like Singapore with tight restrictions on ‘controversial’ content, the fact that Ah Boys 1-2 was considered ‘normal’ is truly an indictment of the times.
Stay tuned for Part 2 tomorrow, where the writer reviews Ah Boys to Men 3-4. In the meantime, Ah Boys 1-2 are available on Netflix.

Classic Movie Reviews: Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men Franchise Follows the Money (Part 2),https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-movie-reviews-jack-neos-ah-boys-to-men-franchise-part-2/,3-Jun-21,"The following is Part 2 of a two-part review on Jack Neo’s Ah Boys to Men series. You can read Part One here.
By the mid-2010s, there was a noticeable shift in the global culture towards more socially progressive causes, driven largely by the internet and social media. As Disney’s Marvel franchise and movies like DC’s Wonder Woman (2017) would go on to demonstrate, there was now an easy buck to be made from taking a stand on social issues.
The formula is simple: just slap a <insert minority> into a lead role, write some generic dialogue about empowerment, add a dash of 90s nostalgia, then have said minority kick the ass of their historic oppressor … and voila! The audience can now experience the catharsis of shattering the Grand Illusion, while enriching the coffers of global MNCs. Everyone wins.
Coincidentally, this sudden whiff of profits also made these ‘Western’ ideologies more palatable in Singapore. This is reflected in the final two movies of the Ah Boys Franchise — with mixed results.
Ah Boys to Men 3 (2015): Every Seamen’s Fantasy
In the Ah Boys to Men 3: Frogmen, Jack Neo uses the Time Stone to transport his characters back to an alternate timeline where they enlist in the Naval Diving Unit (NDU) instead — in order to produce propaganda for the Singapore Navy. The early films’ success at the box office is reflected in the now bloated runtime of two and half hours.
Supported by an even more massive budget, the audience is treated to yet another CGI opening sequence. This time, our heroes board an ocean vessel, where a group of United Colours of Benetton terrorists have taken the crew hostage.
To be honest, despite the CGI fireworks, it’s getting late and I find myself nodding off within the first few minu—
HOLY SHIT. NEVERMIND. A Chinese female terrorist just got shot in the face!
She’s hiding a pistol. This is why women can’t be trusted.
“There are no female crew on the list,” said the naval commando to his subordinate. “Do your homework.”
Duly reprimanded, I’m now wide awake. The threat of terrorism in Singapore is no laughing matter. Like the Spanish Inquisition, it can pop up in places where we least expect.
Unfortunately, this headshot is also the highwater mark of this movie. Perhaps this is due to the limitations of the alternate timeline, where the characters must retrace the exact same arc, albeit with a few adjustments. Wayang King is still very wayang, but in this timeline, he actually fights back and stands up for himself. Meanwhile, Ken Chow’s girlfriend leaves him again for being too childish.
“I need someone who’s stronger, who’s able to protect me, love me, care about me, understand my feelings,” says his girlfriend. “I need someone who is more determined and mature.”
“You’ve been watching too many movies because that person doesn’t even exist!” yells Ken.
Ooh, nice. This movie is breaking the fourth wall to gaslight the audience.
The only standout scene is a genuinely touching storyline of Lobang and his mother, who struggles with drug addiction. One night, as his mother goes into a fit of withdrawal, Lobang is forced to break out of Tekong. He then makes the heart-wrenching decision to turn his mother into the police in order to save his sister.
Back at camp, the whole platoon is brought before the encik to be held to account for this dangerous safety breach.
“How do we choose between doing the right things, and doing things right?” asks the encik.
Astonishingly, this scene ends with the encik admitting to his own mistake of not understanding Lobang’s family situation and giving himself 100 push-ups as punishment. This inspires the rest of the platoon to follow his example.
Leadership: the rarest of Pokemons.
TL;DR
Leaders showing accountability? This really is the alternate timeline.
Ah Boys to Men 4 (2017): Joking Only One. Women Cannot Take a Joke Meh?
By 2017, the culmination of three instalments and half a decade of character development finds the ah boys mature into fully-fledged uncles, as they sluggishly report for their fourth round of reservist duties — this time to the armoured division.
When the movie first came out, a RICE contributor dubbed Ah Boys to Men 4 ‘pure sexist trash’. I disagree. The most egregious examples of sexism actually took place in the first two instalments. By the fourth instalment, the franchise is, on the contrary, attempting to pander to the increasingly lucrative trend of female empowerment.
Unfortunately, this attempt fails miserably.
The introduction of the first real female character in Lieutenant Zhang Xinyi, played by Apple Chan, arguably sets womens’ rights in Singapore back another generation.
It’s not the actresses’ fault. For all the controversy her character generated, Apple Chan is given almost nothing to work with. Her defining personality trait is that of a hardass with no sense of humour, and her hobbies include making the reservists write lines as punishment.
That said, as misogyny goes, it’s pretty toothless stuff compared to previous iterations. The entire cast and production feels tired, sad and low energy.
Sure, there’s a confrontation between IP Man and Apple Chan, where the familiar refrain of ‘can’t women take a joke?’ is trotted out. But even this movie is self-aware enough to have the other characters call IP Man out for sexual harassment.
The bigger problem is that despite all the hullabaloo about a female ‘lead’, Apple Chan’s character is still just being used as a prop — except now she’s a prop in the foreground instead of the background. Having her beat up IP Man is supposed to be one small step for all womankind, before the movie takes three giant leaps backward when the screenwriters awkwardly pair her up with Second Sergeant Alex Ong (played by Tosh Zhang) by the end of the movie.
An unmarried woman is a leftover woman.
The writer / director even had to work Apple Chan’s mouth like a puppet for a final time with this cringey piece of dialogue:
“The power of brotherhood is really amazing. I will definitely want to learn more from you guys.”
Thanks Jack. Very nice.
TL;DR
Can someone explain why this is the last shot of Ah Boys to Men 4? Why is Singapore burning down? Is it a metaphor? Like…the true enemy was inside of us all along? I’m genuinely lost and concerned.
Together We Will Chiong. On and on and on.
Once you remove the bad CGI and outlandish plot developments, Ah Boys to Men is less a slapstick comedy and more a cultural record of the times. Its primary value lies in documenting the shifting cultural priorities from 2012 to 2017, from open misogyny to insincere pandering to women’s rights.
Like the franchise, it’s a bit pathetic to call this progress, but one can’t deny that for the past decade, ‘socially conservative’ Singapore has been dragged kicking and screaming into the modern era.
Arguably, the government’s support for Ah Boys has less to do with outright sexism so much as risk aversion and political expediency; it seems that the authorities always have a knack for following the prevailing wisdom of the times, even if it means hitching their wagons to declining cultural and social trends.
Maybe what Jack Neo has really taught us is that you can’t lead a country based on the nostalgia of out-of-touch uncles, where NS was always ‘so much tougher’ back in their day and gender roles were easier to understand.
After all, NS was never just about national security. According to LKY, it is also about building a national and political consciousness. While I take umbrage at always placing the blame on the authorities, we already have a few recent examples of how SAF culture might bleed into the civil service or corporate boardroom — with negative social consequences.
So instead of always rushing to wait and waiting to rush, perhaps some initiative and leadership are in order. Perhaps it’s time to actually chart a course for the type of society Singapore wants for the future, instead of just acquiescing to the prevailing winds of the times.

We Went Languishing Around Singapore And It Was Terrible, But Perfect",Ivan K. Wu,FALSE,TRUE
"We Went Languishing Around Singapore And It Was Terrible, But Perfect",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-we-went-languishing-around-singapore-and-it-was-terrible-but-perfect/,4-Jun-21,"All images by Feline Lim.
In April, the New York Times termed the latest stage of the pandemic fatigue as languishing. The thinking goes: We’re not burnt out, depressed, or anxious. We’re joyless, aimless, stagnated and empty. “[Languishing] feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life in a foggy windshield.”
We’ve all felt like we’re just muddling through, right? Even when the restrictions in Singapore were eased, there was a distinct lack of spontaneity, adventure, and excitement. It almost felt normal to sit in a restaurant with a group of eight friends. It was something like freedom but not quite. There was a roadblock to joy. It could be remembered but not replicated.
Now, in Phase 2 (HA) the slices of normalcy that eased our languishing are gone. There’s nowhere to hide. We can’t meet more than one person at a time. We can’t travel anytime soon. Essentially, we’ve regressed to a point in the pandemic that we wanted to forget.
The languishing article I mentioned above offers some antidotes: give yourself uninterrupted leisure time, focus on a small goal. These strategies might feel implementable in the United States, where mass vaccination is steadily easing restrictions—but in Singapore, we’re a few months away from returning to the spoils we enjoyed pre-pandemic. Though hope is on the horizon, until later this year, we’re in a semi-pleasant purgatory.
So, in the absence of an imminent end to the pandemic, I wanted to try something different. Instead of rejecting this mid-point between flourishing and depression, I indulged it. Here’s how I intentionally languished around Singapore.
Where Should One Languish in Singapore?
Firstly, languishing is neither pleasant nor destructive. When researching the term further, I learned that it is “an apathy, a sense of restlessness or feeling unsettled, an overall lack of interest in life.” To languish appropriately, I thought it best to select places where not much happens, and there’s nothing spectacular to see or do.
In fact, when scouting for locations, I wanted to make sure there was nothing excitable at all. The whole point of languishing is to embrace a low-level of dread. So, with that in mind, I picked three areas of Singapore which are not featured in tourist brochures: Tuas, Sembawang, and Yishun. Of course, I was still writing an article—technically a photo essay, with pictures from my colleague Feline Lim. We needed some nice visuals, so I found some photogenic spots in these unremarkable places. Does glamourising languishing defeat its purpose? It could have, but it didn’t. Here’s what happened.
Missed Connection: The Lalang Field
Initially, I selected the Raffles Marina lighthouse as our first location to languish—there was an idyllic shot I had in mind: a silhouette of myself or a stranger gazing at the sea while the sun set on the water. Unfortunately, the marina was closed to non-members. The security guard shooed us away as we approached the gate.
A bummer. But I had another place in mind: the famous Lalang Field in Tuas South Avenue 4, the backdrop of many wedding photoshoots. “What do we do when we get there?” Feline asked me. I told her that we were going to languish and she would know how it felt when we did it. Though, at this point, I wondered if I had pitched an article I couldn’t write. We drove in circles around the area where the Lalang Field was supposed to be. It was fenced off with barbed wire.
“Where do we go now?” Feline asked and I shrugged. I ran out of options. We meandered on the empty sidewalks, submerged in a cloud of dust stirred up by a lorry on the road. It was late in the afternoon when we stumbled on a dehydrated field of nothing.
There, I laid down on a spikey patch of grass, and closed my eyes. The sun roasted my skin and a swarm of midges buzzed in front of my face. With the lorries rumbling in the background, and the afternoon heat on my neck, I felt uncomfortable but not uncomfortable enough to change position. I laid there and thought how nice it would be to sunbathe literally anywhere else.
“Okay, we’re losing the light, shall we go somewhere else?” Feline called from afar. Sure, I thought, without saying anything. I was overcome by the need to stay where I was, to indulge the discomfort. But we had an article to produce.
In Pursuit of Nothing: The Break Down in Tuas
The next port of call in Tuas was Lamp Post 1, a landmark for cyclists at the westernmost point of Singapore. Lamp Post 1 is outside the Tuas Checkpoint and home to a collage of stickers and trinkets put there by the cyclists. I thought it would be heartwarming, but upon closer inspection there were ziploc baggies of cigarette butts and used masks taped next to the inspirational quotes.
It was a nonsensical place to spend more than a few minutes, given the heavy traffic, grimey litter, and noisy construction beyond the checkpoint. There was no good reason to hang out there, yet there we were; languishing. I felt annoyed and slightly serene.
In the car, I talked with Feline about how frustrating it was to find a ‘good place’ to languish in Singapore. “There are no open spaces.” She remarked while switching lanes. “Before, there were places you could go to make your own fun. You didn’t have to buy, eat, or drink something to participate. There was no price to pay.”Feline mentioned the plot of reclaimed land where Gardens By The Bay now exists. It used to be a wide, open space of nothing. Yet, it was made useful. Both of us remembered the afternoons we spent flying kites and picnicking there. It wasn’t special or remarkable, but it was unspoiled and free.
Before we went home, we stopped by Long King Canteen—which had an excellent selection of Bangladeshi cuisine. There were some migrant workers there (on their own, or in pairs) collecting refreshments. They too, seemed to be languishing.
We took our food across the road, to another stretch of dehydrated grass that faced the water. There, we watched the sunset. In the distance I noticed Forest City silhouetted in the sky. Forest City comprises four man-made islands in Johor, billed as a “smart and green futuristic city.” It’s a copycat version of Singapore opposite our own shores. Forest City looks a lot like Dubai. While admiring it, I thought: I would really like to be in Dubai. Or, again, anywhere but here. With great effort, I could swim to Forest City from Tuas. Seeing another country up-close and personal made me think about how arbitrary travel restrictions are.
Technically, I could have booked a flight from Changi and gone somewhere the next day. But I didn’t. On the way home, the car broke down. Feline wrestled with the spare tire, then we waited two hours for help. The entire trip had been kind of a bust, all of our preferred locations were closed. We sat on the side of the empty road, in silence, apathetic and disinterested.
Long story short, Tuas is ripe for languishing.
Go Forth and Languish at Sembawang Beach and the Yishun Dam
Sembawang Park was crowded when I arrived. Uncles huffed and puffed through their masks as they shuffle-jogged around the beachfront, which was also under construction. On the pier, a small crowd were fishing. “Fishing is kind of like languishing, right?” Feline asked as we watched the fishermen stare expectantly at the filthy sea.
A man waded into the sea to cast a big net. Time and again he threw it out, then pulled it back in. We watched for half an hour and he didn’t catch anything. The other fishermen observed from the pier in silence. “Yes, fishing is definitely a kind of languishing.” I said to Feline.
Sembawang Beach was covered in plastic bags, empty cans, and food waste. It was not an idyllic spot to relax. Yet, there were quite a few pairs sitting on stone benches and smoking cigarettes. I wondered: Why did they choose this place? Singapore is full of manicured, pristine nature. Were they deliberately languishing, in a setting which suited the mood? The hulky port disturbed what could have been a nice view. Though there were many people around, I never heard any chatter.
Yishun Dam was our hail mary for one good picture. Feline said the sunset on the water was unreal. We arrived early and sat in silence for some time, dodging insects and watching a hawk swoop down from the sky to catch a fish. “Sometimes I come here with my boyfriend and we bring a portable chess table.” Feline exhaled. I thought this was another example of languishing.
When the sun finally set, it was too cloudy for the pretty colors to break through. The sky went dark without warning. As we called our cabs to go home, we counted the hours spent chasing nothing this week. I disagreed with Feline on how long, exactly, we had spent in Tuas. “Surely, it was only an hour,” I said, but she seemed to think we had been there for three or four hours.
In the car on the way home, I thought: we wasted a lot of time on something that is not interesting. But, isn’t that how most of the past year has been? Sitting around, trying to unearth diamonds from the rubble, and forgetting how long it took.
Yes, we had wasted the whole week languishing. And it felt aimless and joyless, but appropriate.

After Dover, Will Clementi Forest Be Next On The Chopping Board?",Zachary Hourihane,FALSE,TRUE
"After Dover, Will Clementi Forest Be Next On The Chopping Board?",https://www.ricemedia.co/dover-will-clementi-forest-next-chopping-board/,5-Jun-21,"Trudging through the maze of vegetation, we brush off waist-high foliage lazily trawling our sides, gingerly setting shoe to soil until we finally emerge into a landscape reminiscent of Jurassic Park. With the ethereal morning mist draped across the valley of lush greenery, it is a marvel that this terrain sits next to a bustling tarmac road.
Elliott and Inez, a pair of self-professed nature enthusiasts, have brought me out to trek Clementi forest in the wee hours of the morning. As nature guides and educators, they belong to a burgeoning group of Gen-Z environmental influencers. From Tik Tok dances (“I am a reluctant participant,” says Elliott) to speaking at seminars (cue the recent Singapore Heritage Festival), the lovebirds have taken the cause of championing our local habitats to heart. We’re in Clementi forest today because the couple wants to show me what might be disappearing next.
Earlier this year, the outcry over Dover Forest sparked waves of action, from petitions to parliamentary speeches. While a laudable milestone in the uphill battle to protect our green spaces, Elliot maintains that Dover is a unique case study.
“Dover was unprecedented because prior to this, so many of our forests were disappearing but not as many people cared about the issue. But with Dover, it was the residents living in the area who didn’t want to see it go. That’s not always the case with other green spaces,” Elliott muses.
Inez nods in agreement. “Have you heard of Tengah forest?” she asks, to my puzzlement.
Tengah forest is (or was) an approximately 700 hectares patch of greenery teeming with life, housing predators of the air such as the near-threatened Grey-headed Fish Eagle, as well as land troopers like the critically endangered Sunda pangolin. Sitting snugly between the Western Water Catchment and the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, it also serves as an important connector facilitating the migration of wildlife from one forest patch to another.

Unfortunately, being located remotely meant that there was little fanfare when it was announced that the forest would soon give way to what was termed the “Tengah Forest Town”, an HDB residential estate resembling the size of Bishan. In fact, slots for the upcoming Build-To-Order (BTO) flats recently opened up in May 2021. Not lost on me is the irony of its name or its tagline where future residents can experience being “At Home with Nature”.
Inez is quick to reassure me that rather than a mercenary bulldozing, there were indeed mitigation measures announced like the setting aside of a 5km long, 100m wide green corridor to ensure connectivity between the catchments, as well as a wildlife shepherding exercise to safely relocate the animals to neighbouring habitats. But can we really heave a sigh of relief and congratulate ourselves on acquiring these concessions?
Woefully inadequate, is how the folks at the Nature Society of Singapore puts it.
The land area of the corridor, which totals only 10% of the original forest or less, is inadequate in accounting for the volume of species present, while the mere 100m width of the corridor will see the slender strip being sandwiched closely by the Kranji expressway on the northern flank and disturbances coming from a dense housing estate on the southern flank.
“We also need to think about the journey once wildlife exits the green corridor,” Dr Ho Hua Chew, vice-chair of the Conservation Committee of the Nature Society, says. Highlighting the fragmented connectivity to surrounding reserves, he elaborates, “Currently there are only segmented green patches here and there, not a complete passageway to safety. In essence, an animal still has to cross the Kranji Expressway to get to their next destination.”
This is why Dr Ho and his team have advocated for building further eco links and preserving two core areas of forest patches on either end of the green corridor. “It’s a pitstop for them to take cover and get back their confidence before pushing on through the corridor,” he explains.

Constantly relocating wildlife is proving to be a feeble solution too. In fact, Dr Ho posits that wildlife may have originally entered Tengah Forest as the carrying capacities of other forests were likely exceeded. As we tear down more and more, we will be left cramming our wildlife like sardines in a can to whatever green space is available. After all, we guided animals out of Lentor Forest into the Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and then, later on, decided to run the Cross Island Line (albeit 70m down deep) through said reserve.
As it stands, the current fate of Tengah is uncertain, a common refrain when it comes to most of our forests.
The obscurity of our natural spaces is what drives Elliott and Inez to frequently lead tours to uncommon habitats like forests or coastlines, in hopes that getting acquainted with an area would help people care deeply about it.
“People get so stoked just getting to hold a starfish in their hands,” Inez says. “There are actually so many cool things in Singapore that people don’t know about, so I love that I get to help people discover this side of our island.”As we continue our hike, they point out the richness of biodiversity with ease. Did you hear that? It’s the straw headed bulbul, Elliott says breezily. Elsewhere, Inez is admiring a leaf she’s picked up from the ground. It’s not every day you hear someone describe a leaf as cute.
To understand more about the success of mitigation measures, I ask about efforts at re-planting when a forest is cleared, such as in the recommendations following the Cross Island Line saga.
“It takes a long time to engineer a regrowth forest, and no matter how well you do it, you can never get back the same makeup of biodiversity. It’s effective if you’re talking about carbon offset, but it’s a loss on the biodiversity front,” Elliott patiently explains. A carbon offset is a reduction in emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases to compensate for emissions made elsewhere.
My interest is piqued on this topic of biodiversity. To the layman, the case for biodiversity just seems like preserving for the sake of variety. Is it just so we have cool things to gawk at?
Both of them react viscerally to my insinuation, to which Inez flatly responds, “if there’s no biodiversity, we’ll all die.”
The two try to paint it for me simplistically.
Bats, like the fruit bat or the cave nectar bat, are indispensable in the pollination of the nation’s favourite fruit (subject to personal discretion)—durian. Wipeout its habitat, lose the bat, and we will have no more green, thorny shells to crack open.

To find out more, I turn to Dr Andie Ang, a Mandai Nature Research Scientist and President of the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore).
“Firstly, I just want to say that tree planting is great, it really is,” she says with gusto over our Zoom meeting, hands clasped anxiously to reassure me she is not a tree-planting hater. “But planting a million trees is not the same as keeping a million trees.”
Newly planted trees are usually scattered around different landscapes, such as in a housing estate or by the roadside. The outcome is far from replicating the dense, rich environment of a forest primed to support existing biodiversity. From acting as a natural water filter against flash floods to curbing sweltering temperatures, the benefits of strong ecosystems are endless.
“We have to look at forests as a whole and not in compartments. You cannot talk about intact forests without talking about the wildlife that lives in the forest. So even if you preserve a green corridor or a strip of greenery, but if it’s an inadequate space for wildlife to really thrive in, that’s not fully protecting our biodiversity,” Dr Ang says.
Dr Ang would know. She has devoted her time to conservation efforts for the Raffles’ banded langur, a jet black monkey whose home has been constantly threatened on our shores.

Amid deep sighs, Dr Ang tells me about a roadkill incident of one such langur in 2017 on the BKE. The langur was most likely attempting to cross from the Central Catchment Nature Reserve to the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, and video footage showed the langur perched on the central divider in the middle of the road, wavering in its course of action.
“It might have tried to cross, realized that the traffic was too busy, tried to go back, and then, bam,” Dr Ang says sadly.
Ironically, the kill spot was only 650m south of the eco-link corridor.
“That’s the thing right, it’s not like animals can read signs telling them that there is a safe corridor further down the road,” Dr Ang laments regretfully. “If we’re removing someone’s home, we need to think about how to provide proper alternative homes.”
Back at Clementi, Elliott is making me squirm with a story on how baby wasps feed inside figs.
“Only certain species of wasps, the fig wasps, can pollinate fig flowers. The wasp mum will crawl inside, lay her eggs and then die. The inside of fig fruits are food for her little grubs, so if you take an unripe fig fruit and peel it open, you’ll see all of them wriggling inside.”
Upon seeing my appalled face, Elliott laughs. “Yeah, it sounds quite gross. But once they mature, they all fly out of the fig fruit, and that’s when we pick it and eat it. And figs, in turn, are important food sources for other animals, like birds, monkeys, even bats.”
Talk about biodiversity.
“I think our generation has a lot of nature influencers talking about climate change, like reducing plastic and all that, but I do think biodiversity has been largely overshadowed,” Elliott quips.
Karl Png, 24, from the Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity, is certainly well versed to speak on Gen Z advocacy. A two-year-old organisation, the youth team behind SYVB boasts an impressive roster of advocacy work, from organizing youth consultations and forums to participating in international roundtables.
The idea of advocacy can bear a bitter taste in the sceptic’s mouth, so I question if he gets jaded hearing about these cases with very little fruit over and over again. Does the work put in actually equate to a proportionate outcome?
“Let’s just put it this way,” Karl responds. “I am not certain of the fate of Dover forest, but it’s way better than if it were business as usual.”
As we speak, Karl and his team are in the midst of finishing up an infographic on yet another case of undue clearance at Sembawang Woods, where an 800m section of the North-South viaduct is slated to pass through the forest patch. Karl gives an approving nod to the mitigation measures taken in this case, albeit calling for connectivity corridors to be sufficiently vegetated and widened.

“The thing about biodiversity that people don’t always grasp,” Karl states, “is that we are part of it. It does take a toll seeing spaces get culled all the time, but the motivation comes from knowing that it’s these organisms that feed me and give me clean air and water. It’s that gratitude I have toward nature because of all the underappreciated services it provides.”
Elliott echoes a similar thread. “We always try to frame it as saving wild spaces for animals, but in actual fact, it’s saving these spaces for people too. We always benefit when we preserve natural spaces. I think people tend to forget that until it’s something closer to home.”
The sky is turning an ominous grey as we near lunchtime, so we decide to head out before the imminent downpour. As we skirt back out onto the main path, construction fences loom on either side, housing excavators donning a faded shade of green. In land-scarce Singapore, how are we to satisfactorily balance conservation with the need for development?
“Land use is a touchy topic,” Karl acknowledges. “We’re not saying you cannot do this or that it’s morally wrong, rather, we’re trying to pose a set of questions that can result in more robust decisions. Have we considered all options of other usable areas? Have we allowed ourselves to study the forest in question?”
For instance, Mr Christopher de Souza, MP for the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, had previously pointed out the availability of neighbouring, vacant sites in the Ghim Moh area as a substitution to clearing Dover Forest.
Similarly, Elliott and Inez clarify that their stand isn’t a brusque opposition to development, but rather the need for a more thoughtful and intentional approach to it. “In fact, when there’s clearance to be done, I actually think we might not always need to preserve the whole area,” Elliot offers. “But we hope that there can be consultations at the start, not just when the clearing happens and consultations are only to salvage or remedy.”
Dr Ang thinks there needs to be a mindset overhaul on the ways we approach land use. “Rather than mitigating the impact, it’s about not even incurring this impact. I know it’s challenging to say you want to be involved right in the beginning, but I really feel it’s a missed opportunity to not be more consultative at the start.”
The recent erroneous clearing of Kranji Woodlands is a testament to the mantra of too little too late. Adding on to the list of umbrages is the shock clearing of Lower Seletar Reservoir, a move that the Nature Society of Singapore has indicated they were uninformed about.
Within the nature community, calls for an Environmental Impact Assessment law, or EIA law, have been circulating as well.
Elliott explains that in the case of Dover, only a baseline study was conducted, which is not the same as an EIA. While a baseline study outlines what kinds of flora and fauna are present in the forest, EIAs assess the impact on the habitat when construction works are made and present recommendations to circumvent those effects. Simply put, knowing what is in the forest does not equate to knowing how it will be affected.
Pointing out the presence of EIAs that have led to mitigation measures in the Cross Island Line and Bukit Batok Hillside Park cases, Inez says, “we’re really gunning for a law that would make EIAs mandatory, and that the findings would be made transparent to the public.”
On the flipside, Dr Andie Ang and Karl are more cautious about the push for legislation. “Do we really have to go down the fine people route?” Karl laments, yet acknowledges that enforcement might be inevitable if patterns of careless clearing persist.
“What I would really like to see is more education upstream,” Dr Ang counters. “Teach about our local forests in the kindergartens, so that there is an early appreciation of it. Ultimately, you can only care about the things that you know.”
With all that is on the horizon, do they still feel hopeful?
Across the board, all unanimously agree that the recent attention on green spaces merits great encouragement. Recounting how she recently heard some elderly folk complaining about the Kranji Woodlands clearance at the kopitiam, Dr Ang says, “previously, it was always the converted talking back to the converted, but for the story to reach a 70-year-old uncle, that’s really on the ground.”
“I just hope more people go out into the green spaces near them and enjoy them. Have a stake in our natural spaces, so that when the time comes, you’ll be a voice for it,” Elliott challenges.
“I won’t stop advocating,” declares Dr Ho, “because nature is so fundamental to a meaningful life.” After all, as Dr Ang reminds me, our flora and fauna can and should be coined a part of our heritage. “Our natural heritage is part of our national heritage too, it’s what we have and share. I hope we get to preserve that.”
The ecofeminist scholar Donna Haraway talks about the concept of making kin, where kin are defined to be “those who have an enduring mutual, obligatory, non-optional, you-can’t-just-cast-that-away-when-it-gets-inconvenient, enduring relatedness that carries consequences.”1 For Haraway, she found kin in Cayenne, an Australian shepherd dog with whom she had a relationship founded upon mutual respect. She posits that if we have kin with another, then we carry accountabilities and obligations that are steeped in sites of attachment and relationship.
Indeed, we make kin unknowingly with the creatures and critters that surround our atmosphere day in day out, painfully unconscious of the ways in which our ability to breathe and move are, in part, attributed to their continued existence on this planet. We would do well to acknowledge and honour these threads of kinship, treating them with a dutiful reverence and safeguarding them with a discerning will, before these threads are irreparably severed.
Or, as Inez simply puts it, “You got to respect the forest man, these guys were here before us.”

Should Sex Offenders Receive Treatment Instead of Punishment? A Psychotherapist Weighs In",Jessica Heng,FALSE,TRUE
Should Sex Offenders Receive Treatment Instead of Punishment? A Psychotherapist Weighs In,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-sex-offenders-treatment-or-punishment/,6-Jun-21,"Top image by Marisse Caine.
Last week, Leonard Teo Min Xuan, the administrator of the obscene chat group SG Nasi Lemak, was sentenced to a year of mandatory treatment. The verdict came after a report by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) noted that he suffered major depressive disorder that impaired his judgment, and led to him committing the offences.
Teo’s case brings to light important questions on whether more sex offenders should be made to go through mandatory treatment, and whether we should be treating sex offences as a public health issue as opposed to a criminal one.
Psychotherapy and addiction recovery can be important tools in the treatment of sex offenders, and many professionals in the field believe that a treatment approach can help to address the underlying social issues behind rampant sex offence cases.
To gain further insight into these issues, we speak to Andrew da Roza, an Addictions Psychotherapist at Promises Healthcare, who has experience working with sex offenders. He explains why we should explore treatment as a default response to sexual offences:
Rice: Do you advocate for sex offence cases to be treated as mental health issues, rather than criminal offences?
Andrew da Roza (ADR): Where possible, yes. But we need to differentiate the presentations of sex offenders.
It is possible to separate sex offenders into two categories: sex offenders who are unlikely to respond to treatment, and individuals diagnosed with compulsive sexual behaviour disorder (CSBD)—who are susceptible to treatment. CSBD is defined as an impulse control mental disorder by the World Health Organisation. There are different therapists and therapeutic interventions for these groups.
If a client has CSBD and their sexual behaviour is confined to Internet porn only, and this has led them to join “homemade” platforms like SG Nasi Lemak, it is likely that treatment will be effective. It does depend on their motivation and their response to therapy.
However, clients who present with more severe forms of sexual behaviour—such as rape, sexual assault, and the exploitation of vulnerable people (such as children, the elderly, and those with severe mental or physical disabilities)—treatment is less likely to work.
In some cases, the only option may be to protect society from their behaviour by incarceration and close monitoring in the community.
Rice: How do we differentiate between sex offenders who deserve treatment, and those who don’t?
ADR: A sex offender who is unable or unwilling to take on recovery will commonly present with personality disorders such as Antisocial Personality Disorder.
They are likely to lack remorse, guilt, empathy and compassion. Their actions are exploitative and tend to be malicious and premeditated. They may also be indifferent to the consequences of their actions and may feel entitled to act in the way that they do.
These individuals are less likely to connect and cooperate with their therapist or see that their behaviour is harmful, and therefore, do not have the motivation to change.
Recovery work involves joining peer-led, 12 step recovery groups like, Sex and Love Addicts Anonymous and Sexaholics Anonymous. Such sex offenders are likely to be resistant to joining or even be disruptive within such groups.
Individuals with CSBD who do not suffer from Antisocial Personality Disorder tend to be more suitable candidates for treatment.
They may have underlying mental health issues that led them to sexually acting out. These could be, for example, major depressive disorder; general or social anxiety disorder; borderline personality disorder—which are treatable. Some may also suffer from addictions.
These individuals tend to be significantly distressed by their sexual behaviour and the damage it is causing in their lives and in the lives of others. They may often be ashamed and even loath this side of themselves. The therapist will then seek to treat their underlying disorders, as well as CSBD.
Rice: How does one get a Compulsive Sexual Behaviour Disorder from watching porn?
ADR: Broadly, the same dynamics occur across addictions—whether it be porn, gambling, or drugs. Some of the factors that make a person vulnerable to CSBD also make them vulnerable to other addictions.
Compulsivity occurs when the “reward centre” in the brain is “hijacked” by the behaviour, such as porn watching, if the behaviour is frequently repeated over long periods of time.
Growing tolerance and withdrawal will feed compulsivity, so over time, more porn of more novel, exciting, disgusting or dangerous nature will be needed to get the same effect.
The porn industry knows this, so they will ensure that a porn user transitions from one porn genre to another until they land on problematic genres such as non consensual porn, revenge porn, under age porn, and violent and abusive porn—which were the genres discovered on the Sg Nasi Lemak chat site.
As the brain gets desensitised to the genres, the porn user may eventually find themselves watching a genre they don’t even enjoy or a genre that would have disgusted or even alarmed them in the past.
For example, I have worked with men who are not homosexual but end up getting aroused by homosexual porn because of this spiral.
There are also men who have watching child pornography, but who in the “real world”, would never consider acting sexually with a child or fantasize sexually about them.
However, if someone goes straight to this kind of content, it may be a much more complex issue that may not be a result of CSBD.
Rice: It sometimes feels like the online space is becoming increasingly dangerous, and filled with places like Sg Nasi Lemak. Why is this happening?
ADR: To understand why these spaces are rampant, we need to look at why they grow in the first place. Porn addiction cannot be looked at in a vacuum, as it is tied to a spectrum of familial, religious, social and cultural issues.
The first of which is the lack of appropriate sex-education throughout children’s development.
Currently, sex-ed is not taught in schools at every level in a way that appropriately addresses sexuality, intimacy, respect, and consent. And when sex-ed doesn’t teach these things, but only emphasizes how ugly some STDs are and the dangers of pregnancy, children will internalise the notion that sex is always a disgusting, horrible, dangerous and fearful act.
Without appropriate sex education, children and teens turn to porn for their “education”. Porn is “educating” children to objectify men and women, to accept and normalise non-consentual sex, and to believe that abusive sex is appropriate. It may also give children unrealistic expectations or demands of their future sexual partners.
Similarly, if sex is a taboo topic at home, it’s hard for children and teens to gain a healthy understanding of consent, sexuality, sensuality and intimacy. Parents who only talk about the dangers of sex and solely focus on sexual abstinence take the risk of further instilling the idea that sex is ‘dangerous’ and ‘bad”, immoral and unhealthy. Their children’s healthy sexual development will suffer and this may lead to fractious, difficult and unsatisfying relationships when they become adults.
Rice: Why do we see more men turn to these toxic outlets, like porn or group chats, as compared to women?
ADR: If we add the lack of adequate sex education, with socially perpetuated toxic masculinity, we have a recipe for disaster.
Social and cultural norms pressure boys to be strong, tough, self-reliant, and to show little emotion. This creates men who feel isolated, lonely and incapable of expressing and managing their emotions in a healthy way. They become vulnerable to “self-medicating” their loneliness, emotional suffering and frustrations by turning to addictions like gaming or porn.
Another issue is that male dominant environments often make matters worse. From NS to boys schools, the prevailing narrative towards women can quickly turn to objectification, disrespect, competition and conquest. And in chat groups like SG Nasi Lemak, men egg each other on by normalising and encouraging what is abnormal and destructive behaviour.
Rice: How do we start addressing these sex offence cases with public health in mind?
ADR: If we treat all sex offenders the same—as criminals—we miss the opportunity to treat those who can be helped; and we risk ignoring the social and educational issues that may be at the root of the problem.
It would be helpful for all men who are investigated for sex offence cases, such as being online predators, to be given a psychiatric evaluation.
From there, clinicians can determine whether the offender can be treated and is willing to take action to recover. If they have spiralled in their sexual behaviour because of CSBD and other conditions, they should be given an opportunity to recover. In these cases, a mandatory treatment order may be helpful.
If they are simply incarcerated without treatment, they are likely to relapse on their release, once again exposing the community to danger.
Rice: On a macro level, how do we start addressing the increasing number of sex offence cases in society?
ADR: A socio-cultural approach needs to be taken to target underlying social issues. This should start with research on porn use and its effect on children and youth.
For example in collaboration with schools, the SAF, and institutes of higher learning, independant researchers could ask students anonymously, what they know about sex, what sex means to them, whether they use porn and if so, when they started, and so on.
Research like this will give the Government and those in the mental health treatment space an idea of the scale and severity of the public health problem, and what resources to apply to it.
This research can also be used to create robust sex eductation initatives, to teach children, youth and adults about mental health, sex, sexuality, sensuality and intimacy; and how to avoid, manage and seek help for CSBD when it arises.
With this information, men can learn to be more aware of their peers’ behaviour towards women, call each other out on disrespectful and damaging behaviour, and most importantly–be aware when they themselves are falling into toxic spirals.

What Goes Into a $5 Hor Fun?: The Economics of Running An F&B Business In A Pandemic",Edoardo Liotta,FALSE,FALSE
What Goes Into a $5 Hor Fun?: The Economics of Running An F&B Business In A Pandemic,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-food-the-economics-of-running-singapore-f-b-business-pandemic/,7-Jun-21,"Photos by Liang Jin Tey; annotations by RICE’s photo department.
If COVID-19 has rallied us around anything, it’s local F&B businesses. The pandemic has already claimed countless eateries, many of them beloved (RIP, Thaipan and your glorious butter squid). Since the start of the current ban on indoor dining, social media has been abuzz with campaigns aimed at averting further losses.
This said, most of us, myself included, know butt-all about restaurant economics. We cringe if our local bak chor mee stall raises prices, or at shelling out $15 for avocado toast, just because we know what we’d pay for the ingredients at NTUC—but this doesn’t account for all the costs that go into making a dish, or how much restaurants can make at the end of the day.
So armed with an empty stomach and a list of questions, I set out to eat my way around Singapore in search of answers. The idea: get F&B owners to break down the costs and challenges of staying in business, using a dish from their menus.
The 4th Gen Zi Char Hawker: Tang Kay Kee
Debbie, the upbeat 4th-gen owner of Tang Kay Kee, perks up when I arrive at her stall around 3:00PM. “I thought you were a customer,” she explains.
The business was started by her great grandfather in the 1940s, before moving into fixed premises at Hong Lim Centre. Today, Debbie’s great-aunt owns the business, and she and a cousin came on board a few years ago. On top of zi char dishes, they offer a limited lunch menu of items like rice and hor fun bowls.
Ingredients (approx. 27% of gross margins)
Zi char places make most of their profits on dishes like har cheong gai or cereal prawns, compared to ‘main’ carbs like fried rice. Debbie illustrated this with their popular Mixed Hor Fun lunch bowl: ingredients alone cost the business nearly 50% the menu price ($5). In absolute numbers, there’s not much profit to be made.
Mixed hor fun lunch bowl. (Menu price: $5)
“For lunchtime, people go for ‘filler’ items like carbs, and my grand-aunt always gives people more because she doesn’t want customers to go back hungry,” says Debbie. “But per head spending for these is a lot lower than if people get dishes.”
Moreover, zi char is usually only ordered at dinnertime— the period of their business which has been worst hit. While they are getting by at lunchtime, thanks to lingering office workers in the area, dinner takings have plunged about 50% without families and large groups coming in.
Overheads
Rent: Approx $2,000 a month for two stalls. Debbie considers them lucky, because this is cheaper than what many surrounding stalls pay: as an older-generation hawker business, their rent is partially subsidised. (As tenants in an NEA-managed hawker business, their rent is currently being waived during Phase 2 (HA)).
Cleaning charges: $800 for two stalls ($400 each). While these have also been waived during Phase 2 (HA), she isn’t sure how this will change when the upcoming measures to get diners to clear their own trays at hawker centres take effect. While this would reduce the need for a clearing service, they haven’t heard if the charges will be slashed accordingly.
Packaging costs: With the entire F&B industry pivoting to take-aways and deliveries thanks to the pandemic, packaging costs have shot up, pushing their operating costs up as well. Due to a shortage of white cardboard boxes (8-10 cents per piece), they had to start using more plastic takeaway containers (14-17 cents per piece).
This is partially passed on to consumers: they now charge a flat rate of 30 cents for takeaway packaging, including disposables like cutlery, though this is waived for large orders.
“My aunt wasn’t happy about this, but I explained that we really don’t have a choice,” said Debbie. “We just couldn’t keep absorbing the costs. Some of our regulars weren’t pleased too, especially older customers, but most younger consumers seem to recognise it’s necessary.”
Given how rare young hawkers are, I’m curious as to why Debbie joined the business, especially after she shares her hours: 8:30am to 10:00pm most days, although she has breaks in between. The punishing schedule means late nights out and impromptu meals with friends are rarely possible.
She shrugged. “I’m with my family, so there’s a stronger incentive for me to keep doing this. My grand-aunt has been doing this for a long time, and she keeps us all grounded.”
Nonetheless, she knows exactly how hard it is to find staff, having struggled with hiring challenges even before Phase 2. NEA-managed hawker stalls like hers are only allowed to hire Singaporeans and PRs—but given the pay, unsociable hours, and perceived lack of prestige, few locals want the gig.
“I think this is why a lot of hawkers, especially elderly couples, just do what they can and close up when they’re done for the day,” she surmised. “If they had higher labour costs, this would drive up the price of their food, and I don’t think Singaporeans are willing to pay more just yet.”
The Small Dessert Shop: Merely Ice Cream
Things were grim at Merely Ice Cream, a small-batch ice cream shop with two branches.
“I don’t see an endgame any time soon,” says Ying Wai, the owner, as we chat by the glass shopfront of his Sunshine Plaza outlet. Since the start of Phase 2 (HA), takings here have plunged around 70-80%, while their Tampines outlet has fallen 60-70%. Of the three places I interviewed for this story, they’ve taken the worst hit.
Being in the middle of the museum and university district, the branch used to attract significant footfall from office workers, students, and—pre-pandemic—tourists. Today, I’m the sole customer in the store, and the only people outside are delivery riders walking past.
Ingredients (approx. 27% of gross margins)
Salted butterscotch ice cream. Menu price: $3.80 for a single scoop (+$1 for waffle cones).
If there’s a silver lining in all this, it’s that ice cream is a relatively flexible product. Production can be adjusted depending on demand, and sudden changes don’t result in the same amount of scrambling as highly perishable cooked food, like cai fan.
“Although walk-in demand was hit badly, most of our ingredients have a longer shelf life of a few weeks to a few months, so there’s less wastage and you don’t have to throw everything out at the end of the day,” said Ying Wai.
To adjust to the falling demand, they’ve consolidated their supply orders for the two outlets. Still, I can’t help but wince as he shares some numbers: where they used to order 8-10kg of pasteurized egg yolks per outlet per week, they’re now getting by on 2-4kg.
Overheads
Rent: Approx $6,000 per month for a ground floor, street-facing unit in Sunshine Plaza, a strata mall. Due to the prime location, this is on the high side for the area.
(Financial assistance measures for Phase 2 (HA) were announced shortly after our interview. Ying Wai is still working out how the business will benefit from these, but expects to receive rebates of 50% and 100% for the Sunshine Plaza and Tampines outlets respectively.)
Labour: While they’ve benefitted from the Jobs Support Scheme, this has been limited by a snag: the rebate only applies to full-time employees, and the bulk of his staff are part-timers. (PT staff earn about $7.50-$8.50 an hour, depending on shift, experience, and commitment.)
“I feel really bad not being able to give them shifts, because many of them are students paying living expenses and so on,” said Ying Wai. “I’d been planning to expand the team before Phase 2 kicked in, but that’s on pause because there’s simply no work.”
Delivery: Both outlets are on Grab and Deliveroo, for which they pay around 30% commission. They also take in-house orders via their website, sent out via Lalamove (flat delivery fee of $12, waived for orders above $45).
While Ying Wai finds the app charges bearable, on the basis that they get marketing and exposure on top of delivery services, the clear preference is for in-house orders. Orders tend to be larger, and even if they waive the delivery charge as an incentive, “all in, it’s still cheaper than using Grab or Deliveroo.”
To my surprise, he explains that despite the push to #supportlocal, delivery demand has actually fallen compared to last year.
Since the start of the pandemic, the whole food delivery business has become more competitive. Operators—including home-based businesses— have proliferated, and everyone is competing for a slice of the pie. Moreover, the ‘gifting novelty’ of circuit breaker, which was enough to tide them through last year’s closure, has worn off.
“Last year, people couldn’t see each other at all, so the volume of gifts was much higher. People would send ice-cream to their friends, boyfriends, as Mother’s Day gifts, and so on,” he explained. “That’s dropped off now.”
The Institution: Warong Nasi Pariaman
For my last stop, I wanted to look at something different: an established restaurant with a decades-long history and a loyal customer base.
Warong Nasi Pariaman, located a stone’s throw from the Sultan Mosque in Kampong Glam, is said to be the oldest nasi padang restaurant in Singapore. The business is currently helmed by Mr Jumrin and his family, whose father set up the restaurant in 1948.
Ingredients (% of gross margins: …it’s complicated.)
Despite his gentle, fatherly air, Mr Jumrin looks exasperated— as far as I can tell behind his mask, anyway — when I ask if he can break down a standard nasi padang order.
He gestures to the bento box in front of us. “Sophie, look at this. Got so much. How to break down like that?”
Looking at the tray, I concede he has a point. The mix must contain at least 20-30 ingredients — and there are at least another dozen dishes at the counter downstairs.
Chicken nasi padang bento set (menu price: $8.50).
What he can tell me, at least, is that the cost of ingredients has skyrocketed over the years. Mr Jumrin still goes to Tekka Market early in the morning to get some groceries, and where $400 or $500 would cover this in the past, he now forks out as much as $1,000. They manage the volatility of market prices by relying on suppliers, some of whom they’ve worked with for years.
Although he says they’re not doing too badly in Phase 2 (HA), business has still suffered from the various restrictions.
Extras like drinks and rice top-ups are where they make the highest margins, but those have vanished with the loss of dine-in customers. During Ramadan, bulk orders for iftar also fell, and they no longer benefit from walk-in customers stopping in after prayers at the Sultan Mosque.
“Normally, that mosque has a capacity of 5,000,” says Mr. Jumrin. “Now, it’s more like 50 or 150.”
Overheads
Rent: Although he declines to share the exact amount on the record, the business pays a sizeable five-figure sum for two units. (While they used to allow dine-in customers on both floors, the upper storey has been closed for the last year.)
Labour: Costs here have grown, albeit not due to the pandemic. The business employs a handful of work permit holders, and the local qualifying salary—ie. the minimum amount that a local worker must receive in order for the business to be allowed to hire foreigners— has been increasing. (It is now $1,400, up from $1,200 previously.)
“So for example, for five local workers, that’s an extra $1,000 a month. Small things like that, but they add up.”
Other costs: The business budgets for tax duties in their cash flow, on top of regular utilities like electricity, water, insurance, packaging, and delivery costs.
Throughout our interview, Mr Jumrin keeps stressing that making ends meet is enough. His priority each month is just to break even with no debts, and ensure that all the staff are paid. Nonetheless, the sustainability of the business is a growing concern.
“Frankly, if you ask whether we still can make money, yes,” he says. “But margins are very, very small compared to my father’s time.”
“ I’m here because I’ve been here for 30 years and I am committed to it. Older generations like me, we just keep going. It’s just the way things are now, but young people don’t want to start a traditional business like this. So what to do?”
By the end of my eating tour, I was stuffed, sweaty, and fighting a losing battle against my food coma. (Digestion: 1. Deadline panic: 0).
Even with the urge to nap, however, one thing was clear: while the loss of dine-in customers has blown a hole in business’ balance sheets, many of the underlying challenges also preceded the pandemic.
In fairness, it’s no secret that F&B has always been one of the hardest industries to make a buck in, but COVID-19 has made it painfully clear how these businesses are vulnerable to forces beyond their control.
While margins on ingredients are generally good, prices are volatile to supply shocks like trade disruption and climate disasters. After that, overheads like rent and labour gobble up most of what’s left. While all three places I spoke to have raised their prices over the years, this is barely keeping pace with costs.
Moreover, even after COVID-19 recedes, issues like labour shortages, business sustainability, and the difficulty of changing customers’ mindsets will persist. There’s no clear way of solving any of these. If, like a vaccine, a pill could be developed to cure the delusion that hawker prices can stay fixed for all eternity, I’m sure Debbie would love to hear about it.
So even if it’s really sticking a band-aid on the problem: #supportlocal. Buy from your favourite places (and get a takeaway or their in-house delivery, if you can). Suck up that extra packaging charge, or bring your own containers.
It’s the least we can do.
Note: This story was amended on 8 June to reflect that Tang Kay Kee pays around $2,000 per month in rent, not $1,000 as previously stated. We apologise for the error.

These Stalls Used To Fuel Workers At Industrial Parks. Now, They Are Barely Surviving",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
The Dave Parkash Video Shows Our Double Standards In Calling Out Racism,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-dave-parkash-video-double-standards-racism/,8-Jun-21,"Top image: Dave Parkash/Facebook.
For the last couple of days, the Internet has been abuzz over the video of a couple being harassed by a Chinese man, simply for being mixed-race. I’m sure we’ve all seen it by now, so I won’t rehash all nine excruciating minutes.
The video has gone viral and drawn condemnation all around, but it’s worth scrutinising what exactly this is directed at. The responses to it are telling about our current politics of acceptability, and what gets to ‘count’ as racism or not.
One response, typified by Minister K. Shanmugam’s, is first and foremost appalled by the shamelessness of the Chinese man — namely, that he actually came out and said those things in public.
Screencap from Minister Shanmugam's Facebook page.
What could he (and people like Beow Tan and the Choa Chu Kang attacker) have been thinking? Where are all these people coming from, and what has emboldened them to come forward and spew filth so openly?
I’m no proponent of thoughtcrime, but I think we can all agree that the litmus test for whether something is racist isn’t whether it’s aired in public. Racist statements are just as racist even if they’re muttered over the dinner table rather than hurled in the street, or silently brushed off rather than blowing up on social media. (Even, for that matter, if they’re unintentional.)
To that end—as minority Singaporeans and residents, in particular, know all too well—racism is neither a new nor surprising phenomenon here. Videos like Dave’s only make it more difficult to pretend that Singapore is a racially harmonious, cosmopolitan utopia, but it shouldn’t be news that many people (especially Chinese people) have long gotten away with expressing similar prejudice.
And in many cases, what they got away with was exactly the same as the man in the video: objection to interracial relationships.
This leaves us with a curious double-standard where incidents like what happened to Dave are quickly condemned as racist, while we contort ourselves into all sorts of mental gymnastics trying to explain how others are not.
In the video, the harasser draws on the trope of ‘Indian men coming to prey on Chinese girls’. It’s racist, sexist, and utterly cringeworthy, but show me a Chinese girl who hasn’t heard this at some point growing up.
Unfortunately, sentiments like this are all too common. My parents were horrified by Dave’s video, and they have welcomed and adored my friends and exes of all races and backgrounds. But years ago, before I went off to university, they, too, implored me to ‘try not to come back with a Black guy’.
It’s a difficult and ugly memory to grapple with, though part of me recognises my parents were probably only repeating what they had heard all their lives. Tropes like the apu neh neh, the predatory Bangla, thieving Africans—these were probably recited by their parents, too.
All the same, the problem can’t be easily dismissed as generational. You only need to look at dating apps, and the many accounts of minority Singaporeans being rejected by people who don’t want to date outside their race, to see this. It’s just explained differently: writing someone off on Tinder, rather than cussing them out in the street, gets to be justified as ‘personal choice’.
This leaves us with a curious double-standard where incidents like what happened to Dave are quickly condemned as racist, while we contort ourselves into all sorts of mental gymnastics trying to explain how others are not.
Heckle a mixed-race couple in the street: racist. Not wanting to date someone of a different race: personal preference.
Attack an elderly Indian lady out for a stroll: racist. Refusing to rent a flat to an Indian tenant: personal preference.
Post a job ad for tuition teachers saying ‘no minorities allowed’: racist. Explaining that ‘the parents are more comfortable with a Chinese teacher’: personal preference.
(Chinese person intimidates someone from a minority race: racist. Minorities call out racism: racist!)
Part of the problem is, perhaps, the reluctance to recognise that small things add up, and that playground slurs and familial warnings help prejudice take root. Part of it is a climate where dog-whistle racism is increasingly spouted by politicians and the press.
But part of it is also that we conflate degrees of harm—which can exist on a spectrum— with whether something is racist or not.
There shouldn’t be a gray area there. Clinging to arbitrary standards, where conduct only deserves censure if it breaches social norms like politeness and non-aggression, does nothing for understanding and unity. Socially endorsed racism is still racism, and a quiet bigot is just as concerning as an unapologetic one.
Calling what happened to Dave and his girlfriend a ‘wake-up call’ doesn’t do justice to how minorities have long put up with things like this. But if it does achieve anything, perhaps it’s exposing the false binary around what is unacceptable and what can be tolerated. To paraphrase the famous line from Animal Farm: all forms of racism are racist, and some are not more racist than others.
And for what it’s worth: we really need to get over this obsession with other people’s relationships. Whether the parties are of different races, the same sex, have a 20-year age gap, or are into bondage and food play— hell, even if someone is single and not dating anyone at all— it’s really no-one else’s business.

With Dining Out Restricted During Phase 2HA, How Have Singaporeans Been Coping?",Sophie Chew,FALSE,TRUE
"These Stalls Used To Fuel Workers At Industrial Parks. Now, They Are Barely Surviving",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-stalls-fuel-workers-industrial-parks-barely-surviving/,8-Jun-21,"All photography by the author for RICE Media. Top image by Tey Liang Jin.
Three words: They are screwed.
With most of us forced to work from home, the de facto circuit breaker we are experiencing now has been a nightmare for stallholders at industrial parks. This is pretty much a death knell since their businesses cater mainly to workers there.
An empty 280 Cafe coffee shop at Harvest@Woodlands, at 2pm on a Tuesday
It is 2.25pm on a Tuesday. I’ve decided to visit the 280 Cafe coffee shop at Harvest@Woodlands, which is located in Woodlands Industrial Park.
The journey there takes me more than half an hour from Woodlands Bus Interchange, as I board bus 858 and alight seven stops later. After alighting, I walk for another 15 minutes before arriving. Given how far-flung the coffee shop is, it is no wonder places like this get overlooked unless one works there.
As if the restrictions were not damaging enough to the stallholders there, they were dealt with a Covid-19 cluster from the same building during the last week of May.
The coffee shop is eerily quiet, with sound coming only from the humming of the large overhead fans. Among the beige tables taped with the familiar red-white barricade tape, I spot 31-year-old Jomin Goh taking a breather in front of her noodle stall.
1. Noodles are difficult to takeaway – Jomin Goh, 31
Dressed in a red, short-sleeved qipao top, Jomin tells me the deserted scene of the coffee shop is a daily sight—even during lunch time—since May 16 when Phase Two (Heightened Alert) started.
Normally, Ms Goh doesn’t even have time to rest because long queues are a constant when she whips up piping hot bowls of fishball noodles or bak chor mee from 8 AM to 7 PM daily, except on Saturdays (when she operates half-day) and Sundays (when she closes).
Her business used to flourish, selling more than 150 bowls of noodles daily. Those were the good old days when office ladies, who make up the majority of her customers, had lunch at her stall.
But sadly, most of them are now forced to work from home and Ms Goh struggles to even dish out 80 bowls per day. She said men cannot be depended on either—gastronomically speaking—because they usually prefer heavier meals such as cai fan (economic rice) over lighter fare from her stall.
Ms Goh forks out almost $2,000 a month for rent and other miscellaneous fees. Last year, she received relief during the circuit breaker and paid about $500 a month after accounting for the subsidies—which was still a burden since she barely sold 20 bowls a day then.
I asked her: Why don’t you hop onto the delivery platforms? Isn’t this the most logical thing to do?
Food sellers like Ms Goh are not stupid. Obviously she is aware of them. Due to poor business during the circuit breaker last year, she applied for her stall to be listed on Grab, FoodPanda and Deliveroo. But she lamented that none of them got back to her due to the large volume of applications.
Ms Goh did not follow up with the application process after the circuit breaker because business gradually picked up. She reckoned that by accepting online orders from those platforms, she would struggle to cope as there were already many orders from customers at her stall.
Little did she know the same fate would befall her again this year with the dine-in restrictions.
I can see she takes pride in her noodles, as she describes enthusiastically that the chilli paste, fried shallots and crispy pork lard are all prepared in house once every few days—less commonly seen these days as many hawkers take the easy way out and buy them from a supplier.
And it is this same pride which makes her reluctant to embark on delivery platforms: her food was never meant to be dabao-ed in the first place. She wants her customers to feel satisfied eating her noodles.
By the time the delivery person in the signature green long-sleeved shirt arrives and hangs your bag of mee pok tah (dried noodles) on the door, the noodles would have gone soggy and become an inseparable lump of mess. This is not the kind of food Ms Goh wants her customers to chomp on.
I pity Ms Goh, who is a working mother of four children, aged four, five, six and 10. Life is not easy for this Malaysian here on a long-term visit pass. Her Singaporean husband, 51, used to help her at the stall but has gone to look for other jobs in the past year to supplement the family’s income. He is now working as a linen attendant at a hotel.
Like me, Ms Goh has her fingers crossed that restrictions will be lifted on June 13, because things are not looking good should there be an extension.
“If this situation persists for another two to three months, I might consider closing down the stall,” she says.
2. A double whammy for HMJ Malay Cuisine – Razali, 58
At Gold 186 Food Court, I get hold of 58-year-old Mr Razali at his corner stall and he immediately tells me the no dine-in rule is a double whammy. He is a newcomer in this F&B business—at least in the coffee shop industry.
The opening of his stall after Chinese New Year this year was actually a pivot from his previous business of wedding catering, which he was running for 15 years. Due to the pandemic, he found it untenable to continue his family business of more than five decades.
With the current restrictions which only allow customers to take away their meals, he claims his sales have plummeted by more than half, with barely enough money left to pay his rent of about $4,000 a month.
Meanwhile, it does not help when he—as well as other stallholders—depends on workers from the nearby semiconductor factory Micron (a 10-min walk away) to have their lunch here.
According to him, due to the pandemic, Micron has instructed their staff—some of whom are still working on site—not to leave the workplace for meals and consume food sold in the factory instead. The factory did not respond to queries on this as of publication time.
The HDB dwellers in Woodlands don’t patronise his stall either.
“HDB there already got makan, they want to come here for what? So leceh, ” Mr Razali says. He opens his stall only on weekdays, from 6.30 AM to about 3 PM in the afternoon.
Even among the few who drop by his stall, such as taxi drivers, they pick fewer dishes for their nasi lemak than they normally do. Not because Mr Razali’s food is unaffordable (his prices are modest at $3 to $4) or that people are tightening their belts. But these customers who have to eat their meals in the car prefer to keep it simple.
Maybe one chicken wing and a fried egg to go with their rice, tops, so the packet of food is easier to hold onto on the go, Mr Razali says.
But Mr Razali is not one who throws in the towel easily. Instead of moping when his catering business became untenable, he opened a food stall. Instead of swatting flies at the coffee shop, he dabbles a little in his old trade by preparing bento sets for couples who push on with their weddings (solemnisations can still take place, within limits). Better to have bread crumbs than nothing—an attitude I see in Mr Razali.
Then what about food delivery platforms, I ask him.
“You ask the claypot guy lah, he uses all these!” gesturing me to another stallholder a few tables away who sells claypot dishes.
3. Business is still horrible despite being on three delivery platforms – Au Chee Meng, 39
I walk over to the Claypot Delight stall, and clearly, its stallholder is a forward-looking one. Mr Au Chee Meng, 39, has numerous food delivery labels attached to his stall-front—GrabFood, foodpanda and Deliveroo.
Not bad, I tell myself, business should not be too bad. Online, commentators have lauded the usefulness of these delivery platforms in the—pardon the cliche—pandemic new normal.
Statistics from SingStat have also painted an optimistic picture, with Enterprise Singapore funding 5% of the commission cost charged by four food delivery platforms—including Bungkus—until June 15. These platforms usually impose a charge of about 30% of the total food order.
The Infocomm Media Development Authority also launched the Digital Resilience Bonus cash grant last year to help stallholders like Mr Au to go digital.
But if food sellers are indeed benefitting from food delivery apps, Mr Au isn’t one of them. He claims his business has fallen by 70%, selling only 20 to 30 claypots worth of food a day. This is a blow for someone who used to sell more than 100 claypots.
“I don’t even know how to think anymore,” Mr Au sighs. He said his rent and miscellaneous fees which add up to about $3,600 have been weighing down on him.
He blames his dismal business on the inaccessibility of the coffee shop. While it may be convenient for workers nearby to pop by for a meal, residents don’t do so—the nearest flats are a kilometer away and walking there takes you 20 minutes. Food delivery riders are not keen to serve this area either, Mr Au says.
Like every stall in the coffee shop, he also relies heavily on his customers from Micron. Before the restrictions, the coffee shop would normally be packed to the seams with more than half occupied by Micron workers. But the crowds are no longer here.
Despite the difficulties, Mr Au soldiers on. He continues to dish out piping hot claypots of curry chicken and tom yum soup every single day, from 11 AM to 9 PM.
He’s also gotten creative with his outreach efforts, getting his friend who is an insurance agent to advertise for him. His clients who order those claypot dishes from Mr Au enjoy a 10% referral discount.
For the past few weeks, I have read countless stories online about the plight of hawkers, especially those in the central business district. Like stallholders in the industrial parks, they are also suffering from a dearth of customers as most of us are working from home. Some even chose to shut during this period of tighter restrictions.
For now, they stand to benefit from a one-month rent waiver and full subsidy of table cleaning and centralised dishwashing services from the government if they are managed by the National Environment Agency.
CBD stalls have also had their fair bit of media coverage in recent days (here and here). The more well-known ones in the area—numerous of them—may have loyal customers from other parts of the island patronising them, even if they don’t have their usual clientele of office-workers.
But those stalls nestled deep inside the industrial parks are usually nondescript and cater specifically to workers who work in the vicinity. Few of us would make a trip down to these food establishments to have a meal because of how inaccessible they are.
When the government imposed the no dine-in rule, these stalls suffered, even with measures such as the Job Support Scheme and Covid-19 recovery grants.
The road ahead looks bleak too: for coffee shops not under government agencies such as JTC Corporation and Singapore Land Authority, they will receive only half a month of rental relief instead of a month’s worth.
And only from mid-August this year will the taxman dole out the rental support cash payout directly to coffee shop operators and their stallholders.
These stallholders also do not receive any waiver for dish collection services (or any other miscellaneous fees for the matter) from the government, which is understandably so for privately-owned coffee shops. If they do, it is usually due to the goodwill of their operators.
I’d say the odds do not seem to be in their favour.
These are stories of persistence, determination and maybe even desperation. We can only wish them all the best in surviving the rough journey ahead. After all, they are the ones who keep the industrial parks fed and running.

The Dave Parkash Video Shows Our Double Standards In Calling Out Racism",Sean Lim,TRUE,TRUE
"With Dining Out Restricted During Phase 2HA, How Have Singaporeans Been Coping?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-dining-restricted-phase-2ha-singaporeans-coping-outdoors/,9-Jun-21,"Photography by Zachary Tang unless otherwise stated.
Outdoor Dining, But Where?
With the introduction of measures in this heightened version of Phase 2, diners all across Singapore have found themselves stranded and uncertain on where to head for their weekly date fix, be it with a friend or special other. In light of this, public spaces such as park benches, steps, playgrounds and even backdoor alleys are now playing host to diners who wish to have their take-away meals outside the confines of their home. Couples armed with cooler bags and take-away boxes seem to flock to these places in recent times in hopes for a short getaway from their back-to-back Zoom meetings during the day.
Fascinated by this rising trend, I decided to scout out other notable spots where diners have opted to have their meal outdoors in the city, in hopes of capturing similar vignettes of how Singaporeans have found ways in coping with these heightened safety regulations.
The First: A Drive-Thru Escapade
The first locale of note I visited was tucked away in an open-air car park in Kallang, conveniently located near a McDonald’s drive-thru and a KFC outlet.
The wide expanse offered by the parking lot in the area ensures that visitors who patronise either the neighbouring fast food outlets are guaranteed to be able to find a cosy spot to enjoy their meal in the comfort of their vehicle. Be it with the windows down, sunroof open, or air-conditioning on full blast, dining in one’s vehicle is indubitably becoming a popular option for those looking for an “outdoor” dining occasion for two. Just be mindful of spillage and crumbs in the car.
For those wanting to replicate the ambience of al fresco dining, I was slightly bemused to observe couples bringing foldable chairs and a makeshift table to the car park with them. It was not a rare sight to witness visitors reclining in their chairs under trees in the car park, cups and snack boxes in hand.
The Decathlon store nearby provides the opportunity for pairs to walk off the grease from their fast-food meal and seek some air-conditioned respite from the heat outside. Just a cautionary note, however: be prepared to expect decently strong sentiments of post-indulgence guilt in the face of ab-rollers and yoga mats.
The Second: RoofTop+
One of the more popular options for outdoor dining finds itself situated cozily above the mall of Bugis+. Accompanied with the fairly calming ambience of carpeted grass and trees, the wooden floorboards that cover the rooftop veranda provides an almost oasis-like atmosphere for diners in search of a quick respite from the air-conditioned retail shops that lie below.
After a quick menu deliberation with my dining companion, we eventually decided on having our dinner at this very location.
Awkwardly struggling with our purchases of tako-yaki and a selection of finger food, we made our way to the mall’s rooftop veranda to host our meal. Pairs of diners were sparsely strewn across the entire area, paper bags with snacks just like ours. Others cradled precious lunch boxes and tiffin cans drawn from cooler bags, complete with metal utensils and personal hand sanitisers. One couple at the far end of the patio even basked in the tiny flickering glow of an electronic candle as they chatted over their supermarket haul.
Comfortably nestled on the rooftop of the mall, this locale boasts relatively scenic views of the surrounding areas. The synthetic foliage that surrounds the veranda also provides some shade from the elements as well, offering sporadic shade to diners who opt to lounge on the synthetic grass.
Of note however, would be the exhaust pipes and vents that line the walls of the shopping mall – this may not be the ideal location for the picky or those with sensitive noses. Nevertheless, the unique ambience and wide expanse still makes this a note-worthy dining spot, with adequate space for couples to maintain social-distancing with each other and other diners without having to jostle for spots.
The Third: Diner’s Bridge
The CBD itself plays host to unique ad-hoc outdoor dining spots while boasting mesmerising panoramic views of the bustling city. If the grounded feel of Kallang’s open-air carpark doesn’t cut it, the bridge across Raffles Boulevard offers a more scenic alternative.
Embarking on the short stroll down from Millenia Walk and onto the white-tiled bridge, it would be difficult for one to avoid the unique and rounded seating areas that pepper the vicinity. The circular formation offers evening diners privacy from other bridge-goers, while at the same time guaranteeing an almost unobstructed view of the city. Food options in the area, however, appear to be far pricier than in other places. An inevitable cost of getting a bite within the CBD area.
Photo by writer
While still relatively picturesque and scenic during the day, its lack of shelter and covered areas left visitors like me absolutely scorched in the afternoon sun and scampering back into the air-conditioned comfort of Millenia Walk. For thrill-seekers and the dauntless who are willing to brave the afternoon heat however, the brilliant lighting in the afternoon makes for excellent keepsake photographs that accommodate shots of the Singapore Flyer.
Alternatively, the cool evening winds and stunning nighttime views of the city that this spot offers makes it a brilliant locale for an impromptu al fresco dinner to recuperate from the ubiquitous zoom meetings that occupy the most of our days.
A Better Tomorrow?
Be it dining on mall rooftops, upon bridges or even in car parks, outdoor dining has undeniably taken on a new meaning and perspective in recent weeks. The truth of the matter is, this phenomenon paints a particular picture – one that details our perseverance in sticking close to our love for food and communal interaction. It is also perhaps within these short glimpses of normalcy as we dine outdoors with our companion, that we seek some brief respite from the perilous reality we know as normalcy today.
That aside, safe distancing still takes priority. Even in the absence of the watchful sentinels that were the ubiquitous safe distancing ambassadors in red, I found that these outdoor diners were often responsible and space themselves (and their vehicles) far apart from each other. What the world had once brushed off as a temporary ailment has now evolved into a lived reality for all. It is indeed fortunate then, that the vast majority of us have come to accept and internalise this new iteration of normalcy, and this is perhaps the first crucial step towards a better tomorrow.
Perhaps it is not so much the environment per se that is important, as much as it is the company that we share with our dining companions and friends. Regardless of whether you opt to indulge your outdoor meal on a cush rooftop, fancy bridge, or even an open-air carpark, it is arguably these precious moments that are shared over food and drink that truly make for the most indelible memories, especially during this trying period. While you do so however, do be mindful that we are still a ways to go before we can fully enjoy this same experience in the future, but with more company then. We are not out of the woods just yet and there still remains work to be done. Until then, here’s to safety a la al fresco.

How We Must Redefine 'Racial Harmony' for Singapore in 2021",Darren Woo,TRUE,TRUE
Through Their Lenses: Teenage Mums,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-teenage-mums-disposable-camera/,10-Jun-21,"‘Through Their Lenses’ is a photo series where we hand disposable cameras to people from different walks of life, giving them free rein to document their everyday realities on film.
A week after Raj asked her to be his girlfriend, Gerry discovered she was pregnant. She was 16 at the time, and had been sure she’d wanted an abortion. But she went on to miss every appointment made with the clinic (they only had early morning slots, and she kept oversleeping) until it was 5 months into the pregnancy, and the doctor told her that they’d have to kill the foetus before aborting. Raj and Gerry left the clinic, cried, smoked, and decided to keep the baby.
Belle was studying for her O-levels when she found out. The child became the single most important thing in her life, and she ditched her studies and started planning how she could raise him. People at school called her a disgrace for keeping the baby, and a slut, even though the father of her child was her first sexual partner.
Autumn cried when she moved out to live with her in-laws. She used to be her parents’ little girl, and all of a sudden she had to be an adult and move out, without having given anything back to her own family.
Today, at 19, 20, and 22, Gerry, Belle, and Autumn couldn’t be happier to be mothers. All of them, in their own ways, agree that their lives have been made better for it, despite what were mistakes in their teenage years.
For this photo series, we gave the three of them disposable film cameras to capture their experiences being a young mother in Singapore.
GERRY
“The pregnancy was a very, very difficult part of my life. Raj and I were new to the relationship and had to settle into a fully committed one. We were still maturing individually, and there was a lot going on around me … I wasn’t on great terms with my family.
Those were very sad days, I couldn’t go out much because I’d get looks from the public, being so young, visibly pregnant with tattoos and all. I didn’t want to take public transport, I just cooped myself up at home, and I don’t know, they were sad times. But at the same time it felt very wholesome, feeling Asher’s kicks in me.”
“Seeing Asher and Raj fall asleep together really warms my heart. Just knowing that someone else loves this child as much or more than I love him.
I think about him in the future, about how he’ll see me and Raj. And that motivates me to want to continue with my education. I don’t want him to have to worry about our survival.”
“It’s always close to sunset around the time we pick Asher up from preschool. There’s pretty skies, everyone is there with their kids and their dogs, doing their own things. Three of us would just get on the swing and chill for a while. It’s times like these, in our little bubble just for that 10 minutes or so, where I feel like our lives could be so much better if it was just the three of us, in a place of greenery.
I don’t like the environment that Asher is growing up in. Everywhere you look, there’s fucked up things happening. Around the world, and just downstairs. I wish I could give him better.”
BELLE
“I’m really glad I brought them (note: Belle is a mother of three boys, of whom the younger two are twins) into the world and I would do it over again.
I’d just like to say that young mums are just as capable as, if not more than, regular mums. Physically, because our bodies had to go through something meant to be experienced in adulthood, and mentally, because of the judgment we had to face.
I wouldn’t say I’m the best mum in the world but I’m pretty sure I’m the best mum in their eyes. We’re very close.”
“My twins have never really been outside because of Covid, it’s quite sad, they only know how our void deck looks like. For my eldest son, we used to bring him out a lot, now he can’t even go to school and everyday he’s saying he wants to go.
Now my hubby and I usually dabao food back for the whole family. We also just like to go riding around on an e-bike.”
“This picture of the sky was actually taken early in the morning. I hadn’t slept; I usually look after my kids at night, pat them to sleep, and change their diapers in the middle of the night. When my helper and grandma-in-law wakes up, then I’ll go to sleep. So this sunrise is the last thing I see before I sleep. If there’s work the next day sometimes I just don’t sleep.”
AUTUMN
“Being a mum at any age isn’t easy. If a woman is willing to go through that nine months then that child must be very precious. I believe these photographs tell a story, and when Grayson grows up he can see how much he’s loved.”
“Grayson is like a treasure, he’s something that I didn’t ask for but he’s here for me. If I tell him that my leg hurts he will try to massage it; he’s very smart, we tell him things once and he will listen and learn, like when I sing him the ‘sun, moon, and stars’ song he will look outside the window and say ‘hello moon!’. Even the teacher calls me and says he’s very cute, clever, understanding.”
“I don’t know why but I feel like he is the happiest thing. He brings a lot of joy everywhere he goes, and his presence bonds the family more, even our extended family. Everyone looks forward to seeing him, and being the first grandson he’s showered with a lot of love and attention.
I used to be very insecure about my voice because people said it sounded cartoonish, and I was afraid to speak out. After having Grayson I feel more courage, like I can take on the world for him.
To all the young moms out there, I’d say that being a young mom is tough, but definitely worth it. You don’t have to worry about other people’s judgment, because 在妈妈的眼里只有小孩 (in the eyes of a mother, there is only her child).”

How We Must Redefine ‘Racial Harmony’ for Singapore in 2021,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-redefine-racial-harmony-singapore-2021/,10-Jun-21,"All images from Rice File Photos unless otherwise stated.
No one can seem to agree on what exactly racial harmony is. Or at least, what Singapore wants it to be.
Online discourse over the past few months has been a massive feedback loop of disenfranchisement. The recent spike in COVID-19 cases and its rapidly spreading B1617 variant has not only emboldened some Singaporeans to express noxious racist and xenophobic comments on social media but has also fueled public cases of unbridled targeted physical and verbal attacks.
The latest lightning rod of controversy comes in the form of a Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer’s unprompted racist tirade at an interracial couple. In a video shared by Dave Parkash, the man accuses him of predatory behaviour, doubling down on shaming and hurling racist insults at the interracial couple even after being confronted.
Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam then responded, saying: “I used to believe that Singapore was moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony. Based on recent events, I am not so sure anymore.
It is impossible to ignore the irony of a senior educator clad in a shirt with ‘Singapore’ emblazoned across his chest uttering typically implicit, veiled racist sentiments out loud.

While nothing new, these long-simmering hostilities seem to be exacerbated by the profound exhaustion of the past year—and the seemingly never-ending, ever-mutating virus that has indirectly called into question the optics of Singapore’s racial harmony.
Sure, there’re government benchmarks measuring its success based on abstract markers like being comfortable with having a neighbour of a different race and the lack of racial or religious tensions in our daily lives. There’s also the florid spiel we hear in school about how Racial Harmony Day commemorates the race riots of 1964. Never again, they say.
Similarly, Singaporean youths can’t quite reach a consensus on what they want the idea of racial harmony to mean.
“I would say that within Singapore, or around the globe, no country has reached racial harmony,” one remarked in a group discussion with Rice.
As disparate viewpoints accented the conversation, a small but diverse set of young Singaporeans cycled through their various interpretations.
For a country whose national identity hinges so much on this indescribable, infinitely debatable concept, why do recent trends reveal a Singapore that is not, in fact, racially harmonious at all?
CMIO CMI
Plumbing into the depths of racial politics, the group first turned a gimlet eye upon the country’s unique structural relations.
One suggested that perhaps the vague notion of racial harmony can be read as moving past race entirely, that it should be a non-factor in the way we treat each other.
Another attributed the current surge in blatant xenophobia and racism to our rigid understanding of race, an unfortunate and pervasive byproduct of the CMIO Model passed down from Singapore’s colonial past.
In a survey conducted by Institute of Policy Studies and CNA, six in ten respondents indicated that race was important to them, which seemed to suggest that the Singaporean identity is still greatly enshrined in the CMIO framework.
While race-based policies such as the Group Representation Constituency (GRC) and the reserved Presidential Election ensured minority representation in various institutions, it has, more importantly, been emphasised as a key structural reinforcement for minorities to practice their cultures without feeling like they would have to conform to the practices of the majority race.
“What we struggle with is that with CMIO, you lose a lot of resolution in the form of racial subcultures … It’s not about ignoring race and pretending that (overlooking race) is understanding.”
However, racial categorisation in Singapore is not something that is self-identified but is assigned by the state based on paternal lines of descent.
“We are measuring today’s problems with yesterday’s policies,” he elaborates.
Zeroing in on the Ethnic Integration Policy, a scheme enacted in 1989 to ensure a balanced mix of ethnicities in HDB estates to “promote racial harmony and strengthen social cohesion”, he laments that these goals don’t quite translate. Rather, its mechanical and impersonal design lends itself to a lack of organic, communal understanding.
His peer chimes in that despite being surrounded by a diverse set of neighbours, he still keeps to himself. As for those who already confine themselves within their racial bubbles, the lack of meaningful interaction in HDB estates exacerbates things. This illuminates the glaring fault lines between the different racial groups.
No Country for Old Values
Most strikingly, the youths were especially eager to distance themselves from the inflexible ideologies that have come to be characteristic of older generations.
“I think it’s easier for (my grandparent’s) generation to have the tendency to rely on race as an excuse”, one participant observed.
This, as the group identified, is a double-edged sword that could result in one of two outcomes. These racist sentiments could either internalise themselves, passing through the generations, resulting in an infinite cycle of ignorance and intolerance. Or it could spawn a new batch of vocal and educated youth willing to acknowledge their culpability and challenge the prejudiced assumptions of the older generations.
“I remember my father mentioned that (I) cannot take the lift (by myself) because the cleaners are foreign workers and therefore it is not safe. It is only when I started volunteering with migrant worker enterprises that I realised they are extremely precious. But it really stems from these organic opportunities,” commented a participant.
Either way, it is hard to ignore that race will always be the first mark in the face of uncertainty and discomfort. The overarching narrative of racial harmony has, after all, been central to our country’s self-conception, making it an easy and inevitable scapegoat to avoid uncomfortable conversations about more complicated underlying issues.
Take for example the inflammatory remarks made by local creative director Eugene Chong, who asserted: “The noisy minority must be discouraged from playing the race card.”
Likening our heightened cultural sensitivity to an unwelcome disruption in our country’s racial harmony, he epitomises the wider inclination for Singaporeans to remain silent and plaster a feeble band-aid on a gaping wound, shying away from informing themselves and speaking up in the face of discontent.
Singapore Social… Studies
Just as the participants were quick to point out that the key difference in the current generation’s multifaceted perspective of race is due to more comprehensive education, many of them also recognised that national education has been crucial in moulding their perception of racial harmony.
Taught in schools and reinforced in the larger rhetoric, this simultaneously prioritises and hinders the way they view how various aspects of Singaporean life intersects with race.
They enriched the discussion with personal anecdotes of institutional successes and missteps.
One shared her coddled experience in a Special Assistance Plan (SAP) School, which presented a Singaporean experience that was predominantly Chinese. It was only when she entered polytechnic that she became cognizant of her shallow depth of racial awareness, inadvertently tinting her new experiences with peers of different racial groups with an air of ignorance—even if it was in good faith.
Another added that some SAP Schools have also been taking steps to actively combat their lack of racial diversity, introducing tailored programmes like Exploration in Ethnicity and Faith. Through their curriculums, they aim to provide a safe environment to facilitate much-needed conversations with young students.
But if such supposedly fundamental ideas have to be supplemented, or what more specifically taught, does that indicate a larger failure to weave nuanced racial awareness and sensitivity into our social etiquette?
An Identity Crisis
A participant puts forth the assertion that although racial harmony has always been Singapore’s defining feature, this does not actually equate to most of our lived realities.
“Whenever we have national performances, our national identity is that we’re racially diverse. Other ASEAN countries are amazing in their cultural performances, but in Singapore, we struggle when we sing Munnaeru Vaalibaa.”
His peer agreed: “I think national identity is sort of amorphous, it’s something that when you go out chasing, you will never get.”
Moreover, celebrating racial harmony in its current manner may also belay the attainment of true harmony, whatever that may amount to.
“When a new culture enters, we stereotype them based on the jobs that they take up, whether blue or white collar, based on a handful of individuals. So, for example, if they’re taking particularly high paying jobs, Singaporeans will say these people are stealing our jobs.”
Another shared that many still colloquially refer to Changi Business District as Chennai Business Park because of the high density of Non-Resident Indians living and working in the area. This diagnosis of poor cultural awareness signals a wider obstacle of pervasive and prevalent stereotypes, and how easily that could curdle into active discrimination.
As the conflation between race and nationality bounced back and forth, it was, frankly, a much-needed reminder that it is easy for many to swap them out almost interchangeably.
Ironically, being constantly reminded to look beyond the superficial instead reveals an attempt to codify experience. It is just as crucial to understand that many intersecting factors such as class, nationality, and even gender colours individual perspectives.
Though Singapore’s foreign workers more often than not fit into CMIO moulds, they seem to be socially exempt from fully integrating into the racial fabric of the country, assuming a certain uniformity of experience that separates locals from “outsiders”.
The same youth points out that this has driven the manner in which discrimination is pegged to job opportunities.
“Purely pursuing racial harmony because it’s something we want or something we value may make less sense than identifying the problems and frictions that may emerge because of clashes and tensions between races. If we take a problem-driven approach to help address some of these race-related problems, challenges, and tensions, perhaps it may also be worth taking a look behind the frustrations and anxieties.”
Promising Young Nation
“The more we talk about identity, it becomes a lowest common denominator thing. And if it starts splintering and decentralising amongst each of us, the idea of the self is broken into all these small little pieces that form our identity. How can we come back together if all we worry about are these small pieces?” posited a participant.
Broad solutions were thrown around, some suggesting a more empathetic approach from an angle of diversity and inclusion. This includes fostering a welcoming environment for Singaporeans to ask questions, without fear of hostility or retaliation. Courage and critical thinking should also be encouraged to challenge the existing assumptions and beliefs that drive outright bigotry.
“My hope is that the idea of identity as the key thing that differentiates us becomes the key thing that brings us together,” another remarked.
While education remains vital, many agreed that more emphasis should be placed on illuminating the set of challenges minorities face, addressing the root cause of current-day animosity head-on instead of shying away from “taboo” topics.
Or maybe the answer is a lot simpler: It’s time to move past the narrative of racial harmony entirely.
As our country progresses and our youth evolve accordingly, they hold the power to redefine what racial harmony could be, something that is neither fixed nor absolute. Just as their perceptions of racial harmony are currently varied and conflicting, their concepts of it are sure to change accordingly in the next decade.
Even though our future feels more uncertain with each passing day, pre-existing racist and xenophobic sentiments coming into sharp focus should be more than enough to mobilise our youths to affect tangible shifts in attitudes in the larger community.
But if there is one thing we can all agree on, though, it’s this: These issues will definitely not be met with yet another generational shrug.

After a heavy rain, the forest lights up with foxfire.
From the hillsides of Bukit Batok to the green lung of Macritchie, clusters of bioluminescent mushrooms appear seemingly from out of nowhere and all at once, like psychedelic beacons in the darkness. This phantom light draws in the critters and insects of the forest, which helps the mushroom to cast its spores across Singapore like an invisible spell.
For the average city-dweller, the mushroom feels rather alien and unnatural. It is by turns attractive and disgusting; beautiful, yet vaguely unsettling. We fear it for its poison even as many fungi like lingzhi are prized in TCM for their rare healing properties. It’s the yeast that raises our bread and the mold that spoils it.
It exists in a liminal space between the living and the dead.
As Nature’s decomposers, mushrooms break things down. They remind us of things we’d prefer not to think about—death, disease and decay—even as they facilitate the most vital parts of life.
So much about the mushroom remains shrouded in mystery. In recent years, scientists have discovered an ‘internet of fungi’, a communication network made up of fungal threads called mycelium that’s buried beneath the soil like fiber-optic cables, connecting the forest together.
Through this network, large trees can donate essential nutrients to younger seedlings in the shade. Plants can warn their neighbours against predators or disease by sending chemical signals through the mycelia.
This network has existed for thousands of years. And even as we clear our forests to make way for development, most Singaporeans remain largely ignorant of the ancient mysteries buried beneath their feet.
Which begs the question: is it the mushroom that is alien or are we as human beings just alienated from Nature?
Have You Met the Mushroom Man?
“For many years in my 20s I was just floating around in life,” says Ng Sze Kiat, 41. “I guess I was looking for something that I could dedicate myself to. Then one day, mushrooms came into the picture and I fell in love.”
This might sound like the opening monologue of a tree-hugging hippie, but a quick tour of Kiat’s lab at the heart of Bukit Merah quickly dispels this notion.
As the one-man R&D team behind Bewilder, the man knows his science. His primary occupation, that of growing mushrooms, is an intense and carefully tuned process.
First, Kiat collects mycelium samples from the wild and clones them in petri dishes in his lab. Once the mycelium starts to run cleanly, the cultures are then used to inoculate a container full of millet, where the web-like mycelium colonises the grain. Finally, the colonies are transferred to even larger bags of sawdust and wood chips, from which mushrooms start to fruit.
This is work that requires precision. One false move could contaminate the entire batch and undo weeks of work. So it’s strange, then, that Kiat would prefer to call himself an artist and his lab, a ‘mushroom design studio.’ Looking around, I can see examples of his artwork: unsettling sculptures of mushrooms growing out of replica human skulls and lamps with protruding mushrooms hanging from the ceiling.
“Growing mushrooms is as much about feel and intuition as getting the measurements right,” Kiat explains. “Fungi are fickle organisms. I know some scientists who can’t fruit mushrooms to save their life—even when they follow a fixed formula. On the other hand, some artists can grow mushrooms with one eye closed.”
This kind of intuition has been honed through over a decade of experience. Before starting Bewilder, Kiat worked on a local farm, where he cultivated mushrooms from waste substrates by converting two disused toilets into his personal R&D lab.
“I moved into the men’s toilet and covered the entire room with duct tape and plastic sheets,” he recalls wistfully. “The samples I kept in the urinal. It was terrible because there was no ventilation in there. I had to step out every half hour just to get fresh air.”
These years of experimentation and play have made Kiat who he is today. Three years ago, the farm shut down and all of his cultures—a two-door fridge filled with them—were thrown away, leaving him to start from scratch again. For many, this would be a failure, but to Kiat, it held the promise of a blank canvas. Now in his early 40s, he no longer feels insecure about calling himself an artist.
“Looking back, I wouldn’t exactly call it an illustrious career,” says Kiat. “I guess I always had a rebellious streak. A bit stubborn. I don’t really fit the mold of your typical Singaporean.”
Despite his personal passion, mushrooms are only a means to an end. Kiat’s primary goal is to educate the Singaporean public on the environment. As a business, Bewilder is structured like the mushrooms he grows: there’s an education component, where Kiat holds mushroom workshops with the public. The second spore is the R&D that goes into creating sustainable materials using fungi, a technology that could one day replace materials like styrofoam. Finally, there’s the F&B component, where he plans to supply top-quality mushrooms to high-end restaurants.
“Right now I’m in the colonising period,” says Kiat. “On one hand, it’s tough to do this because no one else in Singapore does it. It’s just me. But that’s cool. I get to play around. I get to shake things up. People in Singapore aren’t used to seeing this kind of stuff, so straight away, it attracts attention.”
Ultimately, Kiat wants people to be more eco-literate at a younger age, to understand that we are all part of something that’s bigger than ourselves.
How Singaporeans Treat Nature
A tree falling in the forest is a momentous event.
It provides much needed sunlight for saplings on the forest floor to grow. The trunk of the fallen tree becomes home to insects and fungi. As the tree decomposes, it becomes fertile soil for the next generation of life.
But in Singapore, who shows up first? The saplings and fungi? Or does NParks show up with a team to remove this ‘dangerous obstacle’?
“Singapore sells a pretty picture of green spaces and people living in harmony with nature,” said Kiat.
“A part of this is true. We’ve done a great job at putting greenery all around us. But do we really live in it? I don’t think so. When you look at parents and their kids at our crowded parks, it’s almost as if they don’t know how to interact freely with the natural world.”
Garden City is both window-dressing and a clever marketing campaign for tourists. In reality, when a tree grows out of line in Singapore, we trim it. When there’s a hole, we fill it. Every bump in the road is smoothed over. Every risk and uncertainty is made more predictable.
We plant non-native trees along the roadside and are surprised when the roots don’t run deep and end up falling over.
But it wasn’t always this way. Singaporeans are just two generations removed from people who still know the names and uses of certain native plants and fungi. These traditions are kept alive in the makciks who still forage on Pulau Ubin today, and the villagers in remote corners of Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, these are largely oral traditions. They are not documented anywhere. In another generation, Singaporeans will become tourists in their own land.
“That’s what I feel angry about. In Singapore, it’s all about producing results,” says Kiat. “What’s the yield of this land? How much money can this make? When will it be ready to be consumed?“
“But hey, slow down, you know? Let’s try to understand the land we live on first, instead of thinking that we already know everything. That it’s all just there for our benefit. It’s so arrogant to think that way!”
If there’s one silver lining to this pandemic, it’s the kick in everyone’s ass. We’ve been forced to slow down and confront the sometimes uncomfortable things about ourselves. It’s making us question the important things in life.
“Don’t get me wrong,” says Kiat. “Making money is important but it’s not the most important thing in the world.”
“Ultimately, we as human beings are the biggest problems on the planet. We are the cancer. So we need to find ways to keep ourselves in check.”
“Besides that, I don’t have any easy answers.”
Please, Accept the Mystery
“I fell in love with mushrooms because they both scare and excite me,” says Kiat.
”When a fungi sample gets contaminated in my lab, it freaks me out too, okay? There are some molds that are so vile and toxic it’s almost too repulsive when you’re confronted with it. But at the same time it’s a push and pull thing. Why am I so repulsed by something so natural? It makes me want to understand it even more. That’s the contradiction. Everything in life is ultimately that lah.”
This attitude of curiosity and exploration feels out of place here.
There’s this tendency in Singapore to put people and things into boxes. You’re an artist. She’s a scientist. You belong in this box. She belongs in hers. This is the yield the land can generate and this is the economic value you can create. The line ends here. No trespassing.
We rush to make ourselves useful without taking the time to truly come to terms with who we are and what we actually want.
As a result, Singapore’s brand of resilience is a fragile and stage-managed one. The constant interference with Nature and in people’s lives stunts their ability to innovate and adapt. It creates comfort without intimacy, safety without connection.
The roots run too shallow and the soil lacks the essential nutrients of life.
We’ve become disconnected from the land we live in and our memory and knowledge of it is fading faster than the forests are disappearing.
But if Covid has taught us anything, it’s that there’s no hiding from the uncertainty of the world. As the saying goes, life is what happens when you’re busy making other plans.
There’s also no running away from ourselves.
“This is the way I see the world,” says Kiat. “There’s good stuff and bad stuff in it, but there’s no true good or evil. It’s all just one big mishmash of everything that’s constantly moving and changing.”
As human beings, we have to remember that we’re part of this evolving mystery too.

The Sandwich Generation: What Being Caught in the Middle Feels Like,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-sandwich-generation-caught-middle/,14-Jun-21,"All photography by Thaddeus Loh for Rice Media.
By the time Christina Quah departed from her job as an auditor more than a decade ago, she was already burnt out from juggling the long, unpredictable hours of her job. As much as it was a lucrative career that would have seen her yearly income balloon generously if she carried on, the constant crunch time to meet tight auditing deadlines meant sleeping overnight in the office on the regular.
Was that considered normal for people working in the audit industry? “Define normal,” the 48-year-old laughed.
Sleeping in the office lounge, waking up under fluorescent office lights — that lifestyle, as it turned out, wasn’t fun. Neither was it a sustainable one after Christina got married and tried to conceive. Facing complications during her pregnancy, she decided to quit her job and focus on her health. With two sons, now 12 and 13, there was no remorse for not missing out on her boys’ formative years.
Christina and her sons.
Shortly after becoming a full-time homemaker though, her father-in-law fell ill from diabetes. Her own mother, who resides in Malaysia, was just as medically fragile too — she had to undergo a hysterectomy. Suddenly, being in a single-income household wouldn’t be so prudent. Christina and her husband would have to care for two dependent generations.
A Generation Caught in the Middle
Christina’s family.
Christina and her husband belong to Singapore’s sandwich generation—the group of middle-aged Singaporeans undergoing financial strain to simultaneously support growing children and ageing parents. The physical and emotional toll, on the other hand, can be downright taxing.
“I wouldn’t lie to you lah, it was stressful,” Christina remarked on the tumultuous time when she and her husband had to care for her ailing father-in-law, who has since passed away.
While they were lucky enough to have his medical expenses subsidised under a pension scheme, there was the matter of logistics: the couple lives in the northeast, while Christina’s parents-in-law lived out west. Travelling took up a lot of their time, with constant visits to the National University Hospital and, later on, a rehab centre in Ang Mo Kio where the father-in-law underwent physiotherapy following a leg amputation.
“We were just running around a lot. And at the same time, we were trying not to show the stress on our faces—that we were tired and things like that,” she recalled.
Reminiscing with old pictures of Christina’s father-in-law.
Thousands of Singaporeans like Christina have found themselves inadvertently caught between two sets of dependents, making single-income households almost impractical these days. Back in 2019, a survey by NTUC Income revealed that 94 per cent of parents aged between 35 and 55 already feel the squeeze of having to financially support their growing children and ageing parents.
And by the looks of population trends, the strain will only get worse. Singaporeans are among the world’s longest-living people (84.8 years in 2017 compared with 76.1 years in 1990), and by 2040, the average Singaporean lifespan is expected to hit as high as 85.4 years.
Live longer lives? Sure. But does one really want to, especially if you’ll be ridden with health complications?
Harsh, I know, but the quality of life in the latter years inevitably declines when we could be outliving our retirement savings. The potent combination of rising costs of living (who knows what a pack of chicken rice will cost in the distant future) and the constant threat of chronic illnesses (or future global pandemics) would put even heavier burdens on the working population to care for the elderly.
As far as Singapore’s readiness for an ageing population goes, the government has been prepping for the upcoming paradigm shift since the 1980s. The youth of the nation, on the other hand, are coming to terms with the fact that they would have to finance—fully or partly—their parents’ retirement. They’re even foreseeing having to downgrade their lifestyles, have fewer children or even none at all to relieve the future pressures of supporting two sets of dependents.
Such is filial piety among Asian families. And the actual law that requires Singaporeans to financially support their parents.
The Art of Caregiving
For Christina these days, the pressures of supporting her family aren’t as tough as it was before. Her father-in-law passed in 2016; her own father passed recently; her kids are getting more independent and can take care of themselves without her around the house.
For many others, however, the role of caregiving duties still weighs heavily on them, especially so for those with parents who can’t carry out activities of daily living (ADL) independently. The children of these seniors would have to play vital roles when their parents can’t function — eat, dress, shower and even use the toilet — without assistance.
The conundrum here is they can’t be around all the time. The carers would need to work, or even work longer hours, to continue having the resources to support their ageing parents. The implication here? There will be little choice but to get professional help.
By some cosmic coincidence, Christina joined the very service that would have alleviated her caregiving anxieties when her father-in-law was around. Three years ago, she joined Homage, an online provider of on-demand caregiving services. A Grab for trained care professionals, for lack of a better analogy.
Homage operates primarily through an app, which means getting personal care, nursing services, rehabilitation therapy and medical consultancy are a couple of taps away. Users get to read up about the licensed care professionals — dubbed Homage Care Pros — after they’ve been assigned according to the needs of the job. Communications can be done in-app, so client and caregiver get to brief one another directly.
Landing a job as a freelance Homage Care Pro was kismet for Christina. While looking to get back into the workforce as an accountant once again, she came across Homage job ads while browsing online. She thought to herself, might as well try applying.
The response was pretty immediate and she was called down for an interview. Having passed it (unsurprising, considering Christina’s infectiously bubbly demeanour) she quickly underwent the onboarding process, getting trained in various home nursing skills like proper bathing techniques, physical therapy and first aid. She remembers the up-skilling opportunities as well, such as attending a dementia caregiver training course through a collaboration between Homage and the Alzheimer’s Disease Association.
Christina takes an elderly client, Uncle George, through cognitive exercises.
It was a hard pivot from her number-crunching days in the finance industry, but she enjoys the process. It was a reminder of her time as a Junior Red Crescent in her secondary school days in Malaysia.
“Meeting other caregivers, learning how to take care of seniors and people in need… you find that it’s quite meaningful. I fell in love with the job lah, I’d say.”
Of course, as a caregiver, she would need great interpersonal skills as well, like empathy, patience and positivity — all of which Christina had truckloads of, based on our conversations. They proved to be pretty useful in the first-ever case assigned to her.
“This Ah Ma had just come out from the hospital after a fractured collarbone and was staying with her son. The son felt shy about bathing his mother, so he engaged Homage. I was pretty nervous, you know, first time on the job. But it turned out well—we chatted, we laughed, we sang. We spent so long in the bathroom until the son had to knock on the door and ask why we were taking so long!”
The Ah Ma enjoyed her company so much that her services were booked on the regular. As I learned from Homage, the Ah Ma wasn’t the only one—Christina soon became one of the more hotly demanded Care Pros. Not only was she fulfilling the caregiving roles that the patients’ children would not be able to; she was also improving the mental wellbeing and happiness of the seniors.

She does downplay her popularity, pointing out that her fellow Homage caregivers (who do their jobs in full-time capacities) are just as commendable. The network she forms with her colleagues is important, she says, as they exchange notes and discuss the best techniques to care for challenging medical conditions, like clients with chronic itching or how to handle dementia-driven meltdowns.
Reflecting on the abrupt switch in career, Christina realises that the job she once stumbled on has been a calling after all.
“After I took on my first case, I liked it instantly. It was a very heartwarming experience for me.”
The workbooks for Uncle George's cognitive exercises.
The fulfilment on Christina’s end is palpable—she constantly finds joy and warmth when she makes care recipients smile.
The passion shines through the care she tailors specifically for each client. In the case of Uncle George, who is illiterate, she assessed his strengths and weaknesses to customise his activities accordingly. Sessions would involve arts and crafts and running through simple workbooks together on top of more unorthodox undertakings, like singing karaoke while guiding him through light physical exercises.
Christina feels accomplished when speaking to their family members after each care session too, informing them of what she observed, the progress made that day and suggestions on what they can do next.
Sharing the Load
It’s this kind of care for ageing parents that Christina and her spouse would have appreciated during their hectic caretaking years. Being in the sandwich generation herself, the struggles of other Singaporeans in that position are more than familiar. Now, as a caregiver herself, she’s relieving the pressures of families who might have it harder than she ever did.
“All I can say to them is ‘Hang in there, you’re doing a good job!’” Christina enthused. “I know that sometimes they need to take a break, so just take a break.”
“If they need to focus on work or maybe want some variety of activities to engage their loved ones … sometimes they could be facing personal difficulties or they need some respite care… that’s where we come in!”

Gym Bros Are The Face Of Toxic Masculinity. True or False?",Ilyas Sholihyn,FALSE,TRUE
"After Music Dreamer Cafe Closes, What’s Next For The Xinyao Scene?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-music-dreamer-cafe-closes-whats-next-xinyao-scene/,14-Jun-21,"All photography by Music Dreamer cafe and taken before the pandemic, unless otherwise stated. Top image by Music Dreamer cafe (taken during Phase Three)
I felt a tinge of guilt stepping into Music Dreamer Cafe for the last time on May 12 this year. A few days later, this last local folk music cafe shut its doors for good. It had been hard to sustain the business with an insufficient budget, according to media reports.
What’s the big deal over this cafe, you might ask. Don’t we have the likes of Timbre and Blu Jaz Cafe already?
They are not the same. Music Dreamer Cafe occupies a special place in the hearts of Mandopop and Xinyao fans like me, as the cafe was less boisterous with performers belting out soothing Chinese classics such as Mavis Hee’s Moonlight In The City and Liang Wern Fook’s Friendship Forever.
“Chey, people closing down then you visit and bemoan its loss, where were you all these while?”, a friend quipped upon knowing I was visiting for the last time.
He wasn’t wrong.
I used to visit this cafe often, especially in its previous location at Marina Square. It moved to Kallang in 2014, when the mall underwent a revamp.
But the same life narrative repeated itself: Life caught up, friends didn’t have time to turn up with me, too sian to travel there; pick a lame excuse, and I had it.
I kept thinking to myself: “It will still be there. Why the rush? I can always go the next time. Let me make a mental note of it.”
Except now it is gone.
I was back here only because the cafe was shuttering—a typical Singaporean who takes the existence of some places for granted and swarms them only when closing down. Places like Waffletown, Robinsons, and the McDonald’s outlet in Ridout Tea Garden.
Christmas 2018 celebrations.
This cafe had been a homely refuge whenever I was stressed or jaded. Its old-school vibes provided me with comfort, as I immersed myself in music and reminisced about a time when life was more carefree.
It didn’t even matter that the cafe’s 30-odd performers were part-time singers/musicians. To me, it resembles lunch-time concerts during my junior college days, where some students would gather and do an open-mic while others watched.
At the cafe, customers like me could also request certain songs to be played. When I was “lucky” enough to encounter a more humorous performer, he or she would playfully tease me from the stage about my choice of song.
“Ah boy, you picked this oldie? How old are you? This song is your generation one meh?”
But it was all in good faith to liven up the mood. This sort of audience interaction can never be re-created for online live-streams of music performances.
The Lady of The House
Owner of the cafe, Sally Leong.
My parents first brought me to the cafe as a little boy in the 2000s during family outings, and that was when I knew its owner Sally Leong. Growing up, I called her Aunt Sally. Behind the petite 54-year-old figure is a story of strong-willedness, persistence, and determination.
By the time Music Dreamer cafe started in 1997, it had already missed the heyday of Xinyao and folk music cafes. But it was a sense of mission which spurred Sally to take over the cafe when its previous owner called it quits.
Speaking in Mandarin, she shares that others were approached to take over, including the owner of another music cafe Lao Di Fang, but the owner was not keen.
Eventually, together with some music-loving friends, they took over in 2000, even though it was not the most profitable business to go into.
“It was out of fate that I took over. I felt strongly that we shouldn’t let such a music cafe disappear,” she says.
The cafe’s previous location at Marina Square.
Back then, besides Music Dreamer Cafe, there were about five to six other similar cafes, such as The Ark and Lao Di Fang. It was The Ark that first introduced this concept of a folk music cafe from Taiwan in 1993.
During those days, people would flock to these cafes to hear the latest hits if they were unwilling to buy a CD album or wait by the radio player for the song to be played.
Because they were popular, folk music cafes also became incubators for up-and-coming performers to showcase their talents. Some of them even had their own followers, who would tag along to whichever music cafe they performed in.
Just in Music Dreamer cafe alone, there were well-known figures who used to perform there, such as radio deejay Chua Leelian (known for her Guan Huai Fang Shi duet with Chen Hanwei) and singing group MICappella (which sang at a national day parade before).
Another fun fact: Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport Baey Yam Keng once held a theatrical production at the cafe in 2005 before entering politics the following year.
Revellers at the cafe’s New Year’s Eve party, 2012.
But along the way, with more entertainment options, people’s enthusiasm over these cafes faded. For performers, there are many other online platforms these days where they can showcase their music talents. The physical stage is no longer as appealing, especially when they can reach out to more viewers online.
Even though they had their fair share of publicity, be it via word of mouth, school outreach programmes, or a cameo in television drama Crescendo, it was still not enough for Sally to pull through.

If it is that difficult to sustain the business, why not pivot (a catchphrase these days) and sell booze to increase sales?
But nope, she chose not to.
“There were youngsters who came and U-turned when they realised we don’t sell alcohol,” Sally says. “But no, I’m not budging.”
I assume she was stubborn or even silly. But this is where I saw the principled and insistent side of her, when Sally reveals why she chose not to do so, even towards the end when the already-declining business was struck with Covid-19 restrictions.
In theory, there might be more income from selling booze, but the clientele of customers would change, she says. There might be fewer customers with the genuine intention to appreciate music. Families with children in tow may choose to avoid the cafe.
Not only that, Sally was also worried the cafe’s ambience would be altered. The same warm and homely vibes might be lost as it was possible for the place to be rowdier and less rustic with the influence of alcohol. Her cafe would no longer be differentiated from the rest.
Ditto for her performers, Sally says. They didn’t want their performances to be merely background music, as seen in many pubs with live bands. These performers took pride in their music and wanted an audience who could truly appreciate it.
“You must know what you are doing and what you want from it. Once you get that aligned, you won’t be swayed no matter what,” she adds.
But for her regular customers: no alcohol, never mind. It didn’t matter for long-time supporters like Hendry Toh, 47, who had patronised the cafe since it first started.
Compared to other cafes, the former teacher feels the performers at this cafe were friendlier as they also interacted with customers on and off stage, instead of only sticking to the stage and maintaining an emotional distance.
Hendry specifically mentioned the genuinity of owner Sally, who treated her customers as friends and even kept his spirits up when he was ill. He also fondly remembers the time when he sang Guan Huai Fang Shi (Manner of Care) with Chua Leelian on stage, which must have been an honour given her fame.
The cafe’s notice board was where customers pinned love letters, doodles and reflections on life, among others. Image by author.
Over the years, he says, many performers became his closest friends, even spending weekends at chalets together during his younger days. I’m not surprised, especially after Hendry shares that he used to visit the cafe once or twice a week when it was located at Marina Square.
“It’s a shame this place has to go, given the amount of memories I had here. Everyone is sincere and warm. In fact, I feel sadder for Sally [the owner] than the demise of the cafe because she has put in blood, sweat and tears into this,” Hendry laments.
What comes next in the Xinyao and Mandopop scene, now that Music Dreamer cafe has called it a day? While Sally and her performers soldier on with live streams, I hope this is just a temporary arrangement due to Covid-19, and that this genre of music does not get relegated permanently to the online world.
It will be a pity if that eventually happens, because the joy of Xinyao and Mandopop is not just about the music but the accompanying camaraderie too.
Currently, some schools such as Evergreen Secondary School and Temasek Junior College incorporate Xinyao in their curriculums, which is an initiative by the Committee to Promote Chinese Language Learning under the Education Ministry.
It is good to promote Xinyao as part of our cultural heritage, even though it might be ironic, given that Xinyao started off as a ground-up initiative by students in the 1970s and 80s.
As ironic as it may be, if a top-down approach can keep the Xinyao culture alive, why not? While there might be some cajoling on the government’s end now to get the young to buy into this genre of music, in time to come they might grow to love it genuinely instead of perceiving it as class work.
My final visit there in May felt poignant; it was my first time back since 2018, as I was overseas and soon after, the pandemic struck and the cafe had to close during the circuit breaker.
While it was the same cafe but with all the safe management measures, I couldn’t help but feel the place was under siege. My friends and I had to keep a distance from other customers. We were further away from the stage. We could no longer chomp on tapioca chips and sip on bubble tea while swaying along to the music as food and beverages had to be consumed before performances started.
The show goes on, despite the pandemic. Image taken in its final days during phase three.
But I should count my blessings. At least I could bid this teenage stomping ground of mine farewell, after Sally went through much hassle to get permission from the authorities to conduct live performances.
When performances started at 8 PM sharp, I experienced the same sense of solace which I always had when I visited the cafe. Although the bottom half of everyone’s faces were covered, I knew there were smiles behind those masks, be it customers who immersed themselves in the melody or the performers who sang with gusto.
I approached Aunt Sally when the performance ended, with an irrational sense of remorse, to catch up with her. After all, it had been a long time since I patronised the cafe.
“Wah, how come you didn’t come for so long,” she said achingly. I could only manage a giggle and admitted that I had been busy.
Deep inside, I felt guilty for not patronising this lovely place for a long time, and only did so when it was shutting down.
Go ahead and accuse me of living in denial, but I hope the day comes when Xinyao and its music cafes are revived. People are social creatures who relish a sense of fellowship, and Xinyao has the magic to cultivate this feeling.
Not everything can be replicated online and I’m confident when this hell of a pandemic is over, such cafes will sprout again. With some luck, maybe a Xinyao-themed one like Music Dreamer cafe will appear again.

The Sandwich Generation: What Being Caught in the Middle Feels Like",Sean Lim,TRUE,TRUE
The World Can Be Kinder When There’s a Unifying Threat. So Says A Quiet Place Part II,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-a-quiet-place-part-ii/,14-Jun-21,"Production stills courtesy of United International Pictures.
A competitive society makes us selfish at the core. Agree? From wrestling for the last chicken drumstick to being first to grab a cab, Singaporeans are familiar with the inclination to be first in line. Doesn’t matter what’s at stake. We cannot lose out to others.
Take Malaysia’s response to the Covid-19 outbreak: the Movement Control Order. A cordon sanitaire that has been implemented more than a few times since last year.
When Malaysians were stuck at the border and effectively rendered homeless, what were some nasty Singaporeans saying on the Internet? Stranded Malaysians were lambasted for “taking jobs” and earning up to three times their local currency. When the Singapore government offered $50 a day to help employers house displaced Malaysian workers, the chatter grew. Some complained it was a waste of tax money.
From the pockets of discontentment, several Singaporean samaritans emerged, opening their homes to workers: some for a small fee, others for free. Few offered food, cooked for them, provided towels and toiletries. All to ensure they too could rest, eat and work well day-in, day-out.
These Singaporeans understood what it meant to be left out of one’s home, with family they cannot see and embrace. Malaysians are, after all, just as crucial in Singapore’s workforce as locals—they take up jobs as factory floor workers, cleaners, bus drivers, waiters, healthcare workers and much, much more. If not for these few good folks and the generosity of several companies and the Manpower Ministry, Singaporeans were at risk of being seen as selfish in the eyes of our neighbours up north.
During this time, I caught A Quiet Place Part II. Contrary to sceptics (my office colleagues inclusive), there were similar themes in the movie that resonated with me. The film markets itself as an emotional survival-horror film, but I think it’s about collectives—a me-versus-us theme.
It’s kind of like, do I see Malaysians (and all other foreign workers here) as part of us, or do I treat them as outsiders?
Strength in Numbers
Through 110 minutes of the film, the questions explored are similar, except on a smaller, familial scale. Emily Blunt plays Evelyn Abbott, the protector-mum to her three children. If you’ve not seen the first film, you probably should, because the film continues exactly where it left off (after a brief backstory).
There’s Regan, Evelyn’s deaf daughter, who communicates through sign language. Millicent Simmonds plays her like an old soul, and she’s deaf in real life. Marcus is Evelyn’s oldest son, but he has to work on his confidence issues to fill big brotherly shoes. Then, there’s Evelyn’s newborn baby, conveniently there to drive me crazy whenever he wails (the monsters are blind but they’re attracted to the slightest sound).
John Krasinki, Blunt’s real-life husband, briefly reprises his role as Evelyn’s husband, Lee Abbott. While he does more backseat writing, co-producing, and directing this time, he shines in his scenes, because he’s the most selfless guy in both films. If you’ve seen the original, he made many selfless acts, including diverting his son Marcus away from danger at one point, just to make sure his family gets through the day.
Sadly, in this sequel, he isn’t around as much.
Emily Blunt, left, and John Krasinski on the set of A Quiet Place II.
So, without Mr Selflessness to string his family along, what is Evelyn Abbott to do? She does it through self-discovery and soul-searching, after lots of, shushing, Twister-like limb movements, and blood-curdling screams. Oh, and she also has four mouths to feed.
I’m not going to sugar-coat it. In times of disaster, whether the monster is a blind creature with hypersensitive “ears” or a virus I can’t see, it is tempting to distance oneself and think only about me. I call it Quiet Distancing. I socially avoid everyone, but I’m also out of sight.
In A Quiet Place Part II, Evelyn is Mum Solo. She has no husband to fall back on. She has to pull herself together, corral her kids, coo her noisy newborn, and distance herself from the kaypoh monsters. I’m not sure if I can do the same if I’m in her shoes. I might just break down, huddle inside a locker, and pee/poop myself to death.
Yet, where there’s collective strength, there’s redemption. We find it within us and among us. What’s cool about acts of selflessness is when there is a pay-it-forward effect. One act of human kindness within you generates multiple impact on others, doesn’t matter if it’s towards your children, friends or strangers.
A Collective Kindness
In hard times, pockets of society gravitate towards the greater collective. If this collective is governed by acts of selflessness, the social impact grows exponentially. If a majority of its members decide to be selfish, chaos ensues. Real-world examples: peace protests dissolving into riots or supermarket queues turning into panic-buying.
In A Quiet Place Part II, it’s as basic as deciding if you should help a hungry bystander, or approach a lost, little girl. One bad choice means monsters emerging to tear you to pieces.
Throughout the film, as Evelyn struggles to fit in Lee’s shoes for the sake of her children, the effect rubs off on her daughter. Regan remembers her father’s selfless acts, steps up to help her mother and distracts the monsters. That’s two selfless individuals against one selfish creature. The equation improves. It’s all very Aliens’ Ripley-and-Newt stuff, but with additional feels.
Then, there’s Cillian Murphy. He plays Emmett, an Abbott family friend turned broken man. He remembers the Abbotts but stops short of bringing them under his care.
Cillian Murphy stars as Emmett in A Quiet Place Part II.
What if I’m in his shoes? Living alone, having figured out ways to beat the system, staying off-grid? What if I’m already living in an uninterrupted world, away from the authorities (or the monsters in this case)? Would I open my doors when acquaintances beg me to let them in?
What would it take for me to do so? They have to give me something in return, yes? Something I feel will give me, or them, or all of us, a better chance at survival.
It’s the same way with taking exams. If I’m failing my tests, I would observe how the smart-alecks do it. If I can take shortcuts and copy their answers, maybe I’ll have the upper hand. Or I can ask them to teach me and join in their discussions. In reel life as it is in real life, we’re always one choice away from making the wrong decision. Sometimes we don’t know it.
But wait. Remember my theory? If the collective is mostly selfless, and I’m the only one being selfish, do I continue being selfish or join them in selfless acts? The longer they stay with me, the deeper I’m pulled into the collective. It’s infectious (sort of like a virus) but in a positive way.
What if Emmett builds a bond with Regan? Does she see him as a man still in touch with his past, a substitute father figure compared to her exhausted survivalist mother? The small, selfless acts Regan makes to keep everyone alive depends on whether she trusts Emmett as part of her collective. Emmett’s selfishness will keep her second-guessing his motives. Is he truly helping or is he out to save his own skin?
Naturally, as the collective grows, I mix with more people. I encounter strangers and question their intentions. Do I welcome them into the collective, or take a step back? In my earlier example, let’s assume there’s no virus and no border lockdown. Would I open my doors to a Malaysian man in need willingly, if he asks if I have a place to stay? Should I be wary? Or shut the door in his face?
Sometimes it takes a unifying threat (like a virus outbreak or real monsters) to really tip our scales. The combined selfless or selfish acts from Evelyn, Regan, Marcus and Emmett, demonstrate this impact, and the scale of lives lost, for better or worse.
A Quiet Place Part II has its tender and tense moments. It keeps the familiar, human beats from the original by anchoring the children’s anxieties around Evelyn Abbott. It ups the tempo by introducing Emmett, tossing everyone into situations where anxiety, distrust and panic mean certain and often gruesome death.
The situation gets dire when they encounter strangers (humans and monsters) and have to decide whether to be selfless or selfish. These moral choices keep the film engaging, and force us to question the extent we’ll go to protect ourselves as individuals or as a group.
Every day, I deal with my own sets of monsters, psychologically and emotionally. People close to me do so too. The Abbotts deal with real monsters, but the symbolism remains the same.
With what’s been happening within and beyond our borders since Covid-19 (our common threat at the time of writing), there’s a little bit of Emmett in all of us. I struggle between individuality and collectivism everyday, deciding if I’m selfish or selfless. This will be put to the test, when people like Evelyn and Regan come knocking on my front door, begging for help.

After Music Dreamer Cafe Closes, What’s Next For The Xinyao Scene?",Terry Ng,TRUE,TRUE
Gym Bros Are The Face Of Toxic Masculinity. True or False?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-gym-bros-are-the-face-of-toxic-masculinity-true-or-false/,15-Jun-21,"Photography by Marisse Caine.
This is part two of a series of articles about Singaporean masculinity and how it is changing. In this episode we unpack whether gym bros are the face of toxic masculinity. We speak to fitness enthusiasts about their experience in the gym, exercising with other men, and their personal journeys with body confidence.
Gym regulars should be familiar with that type of gym bro. The one grunting excessively while curling heavy dumbbells, furiously dropping them on the floor upon reaching the end of his capacity. The one who walks around like they own the place, needing everyone to know he is the most jacked in town.
The moment I started this series on Singaporean Masculinity, I knew there was something to unpack about the gym, a place where men sometimes go to assert their dominance or masculinity.
At the same time, the reality is that the vast majority of men in gyms are not that kind of gym bro. They have personal goals, enjoy pushing their bodies, and genuinely want to improve their physical strength. But there is still something about gym environments—the judgmental stares from the ultra fit guys, the cliques, and the hogging of equipment—that can reek of toxic masculinity.
What do the men who live and breathe in these environments really think about it all?
“I started gymming when I was about 20 because I felt the pressure to look good and have big arms,” said 29-year-old fitness trainer Lokies Khan.
Lokies and I discussed how we both hated PE in school, but eventually felt pressured to go to the gym like many other boys our age did. Unfortunately, this is a far too familiar tale for many men and women who start their fitness journeys. And for many, these endeavours do evolve into a love for sports and fitness in their own right, which is healthy. But at adolescent ages, this is often not the case.
The Irony Of The Female Gaze
Brent.
Take Brent, for example. The 25-year-old NTU student said that he started gymming because he was an overweight child. “I always thought men had to be muscular,” he explained.
On top of wanting to get fit, Brent started becoming an avid gym-goer to attract girls. “I only ended up attracting other guys,” he laughed. Ironically, guys are more amused by muscles than most girls are.
In a poll we ran on RICE’s Instagram, more than 50% of the men who responded said they felt the pressure to be muscular. Only 23% of our female respondents said that they would prefer to date a muscular guy.
A TikTok I saw encapsulated this dichotomy perfectly. In the video, the TikTok user Cassandra said that most straight women she knows find celebrities like Conan Gray or BTS members attractive, while the men she knows perceive them as feminine.
@casserole_cass on TikTok.
“Men assume this is what women want,” she says, plastering a photo of Chris Hemsworth (who is extremely muscular as Thor) behind her. “But again, this is the male gaze, not the female gaze,” she continued.
“While the male gaze is heavily rooted in physical appearance, the female gaze tends to centre around how a person’s character makes you feel emotionally.”
Cassandra’s explanation encapsulates how the male gaze has instilled in them an idea that physical appearance trumps everything else. But digging deeper, where does this gaze come from?
Sufian.
Unhealthy Representation
Partly, it’s from the men we look up to as a society. Surprisingly, the vast majority (86% of our respondents) voted that the men portrayed in mainstream media are unhealthy role models for young boys. The men I interviewed said the same.
Poll results from @Ricemedia.co on Instagram.
Brent mentioned how he grew up watching The Terminator and joked about all boys growing up wanting the dream “Arnold body.” Similarly, 32-year-old trainer and sports science lecturer Sufian Yusof said that seeing muscular men on the covers of magazines like Men’s Health while growing up a sports enthusiast skewed his understanding of what being fit is supposed to look like.
“Porn definitely influenced me too,” Lokies offered candidly. “It was always big muscular men that were being featured and glorified.”
He shared about the added pressures that come from being in the gay community too. Fit, muscular and straight-acting men are often the preferred type in the community. It is a regular occurrence to find men plastering phrases like ‘masc4masc’ (which basically means a muscular man only wants another muscular man) on dating apps like Grindr.
But gay or straight, social media has amplified the unhealthy representation of bodies for everyone. Fitness influencers and Instagram models are inescapable on newsstands, television, and social media. And while it’s not necessarily bad or harmful to consume fitness content, it’s the body standards younger audiences may internalise that can be toxic.
There is a flip side to social media too, of course, like the body positivity movement. Yet, our obsession with fit bodies still seems to be “rooted deep inside,” Lokies said. “Even with the awareness, it doesn’t disappear.”
When It’s Never Enough
No matter the intention with which one starts their fitness journey, there is no escaping the positive reinforcement from others—which is usually a good thing. For example, Lokies told me that when he started working out, he started receiving extra attention from people around him.
“I rode on it and I enjoyed it,” he recalled. “My self-confidence changed because I grew up hating sports, so the fact that me, of all people, pulled a 180 degree was unexpected.”
While compliments help keep us motivated, they can sometimes keep you chasing an endless goal. All the guys I spoke to—be it gym-goers or those who work in the fitness industry—said they often feel like they need to get stronger and bigger with no endgame in sight.
“Sometimes when I am on some guys’ Instagrams, I wonder how nice it would be to look that good,” Lokies shared.
“If you’re not happy without abs, don’t expect to be happy with abs.”
I stared back in disbelief. How can this man, who has the epitome of the Instafit body, not think it’s enough?
“Maybe the guys I see on Instagram also feel the same. This spiral is not talked about enough,” he continued.
“I’m trying to not attach myself to the image that ‘I am fitness’. It is what gives me purpose, but it shouldn’t be my identity. I don’t know how all the kids are coping now with the overload from social media. If it was me, I’d be pretty fucked up.”
Similarly, it took Sufian many years to break out of this mindset and gain a more nuanced understanding of personal fitness journeys.
“When I was younger, I was influenced by what I thought men should look like,” he said. “Eventually, in my late twenties, I started questioning whether I was conforming, or setting my own rules.”
After studying psychology and researching mental health, Sufian decided to live by a personal metric that fitness is what your body needs at a current point in time.
Like one of his mentors told him when he was training: “If you’re not happy without abs, don’t expect to be happy with abs.”
The Connection Between Toxic Masculinity and Gym Environments
In our conversation, Sufian questioned whether it’s the way “men bottle everything up” that is somehow related to why some men overexert their physical presence.
“There’s a stereotype Asian guys play into,” he said. “I grew up in a traditional Singaporean household where parents don’t express love to anyone. My dad shows strength in character, not by expressing himself. Seeing men bottle everything up was considered normal, and I saw that in my dad.”
In his experience, Sufian has observed how this culture of strong but silent manhood is intertwined with gym bro culture. At the gym, everything is expressed from a physical standpoint, and rarely from within. So if you were raised to be strong and not show emotion, the gym environment would likely make you feel relatively comfortable.
This has a domino effect on a variety of issues. For example, the fact that men tend to be less introspective means they are less likely to point out problematic issues within the fitness community. Or within themselves.
If a woman eats very little, people are very quick to question whether she has an eating disorder. But when was the last time you heard someone question a man for having an eating disorder because he eats eight times a day to grow bigger?
“When you start seeing food as your enemy, or as something you need to be so calculative about, then it can be toxic,” Brent explained.
If someone eats too much or too little to the point they feel sick, or feel like they can’t engage in social activities with their friends, it’s an eating disorder. “Call a spade a spade,” Sufian added.
Yet men don’t realise their relationship with food is toxic, because addressing an eating disorder would probably open a Pandora’s box of insecurities (and other mental health issues) they are not willing to explore.
So what is healthy masculinity?
“What is the opposite of masculine?” Sufian asked. “Being feminine.”
“But what is it like to be feminine? We have a predisposed idea that being feminine equals being weak or vulnerable. But being feminine actually just means understanding your insecurities and showing emotion.”
Nothing and no one is 100% binary. Where one pushes themselves to either extreme of the spectrum, it can lead to unhealthy decisions, spanning from having a bad relationship with food, the bottling up of emotions, or even the abuse of substances like steroids.
Gymming to look hyper-masculine doesn’t necessarily mean you are pushing yourself to an unhealthy extreme, but the journey to get there and the environments you are in can be. For this reason, Lokies said he often tries to counter ultra-masculine environments by showing his fun, feminine side.
When he used to work at annual CrossFit competitions—where dozens of ‘manly men’ convene—he would have a little fun by throwing on a crop top, booty shorts and a wig on. “That’s a part of me I never let myself feel pressured to hide just because of the environment I’m in.”
For other guys, having a healthy relationship with their masculinity doesn’t necessarily have to come in a visual expression of the opposite. It can also mean understanding that everyone is different and has different needs.
Currently, ‘feminine’ and ‘masculine’ are seen as polar opposites, with a set of defining characteristics for both. But as we continue to deconstruct our conventional understanding of gendered behaviour, perhaps we should be looking to both deepen and expand these definitions of, and see them as less binary, contrasting, and mutually exclusive. At the end of the day, both sides encompass characteristics that we all share, albeit in different amounts. And all of that is completely okay.

A Snowflake's Guide to Talking About Racism",Edoardo Liotta,FALSE,TRUE
A Snowflake’s Guide to Talking About Racism,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-snowflake-guide-racism/,16-Jun-21,"Rice file photo.
There are some diseases you just can’t get vaccinated against. For instance, racism. Or at least the unwillingness to have an open discussion about race relations and the existence of ingrained cultural blindspots.
Sure, it’s uncomfortable. But one of the major blocks towards reducing biases both unconscious and intentional is something called “conversation”. Why would anyone avoid it? Human beings have held conversations for centuries, and everyone’s better off from it.
Race relations in Singapore; now that’s a conversation we need to have after a few (extra) exhausting weeks for minorities here. And we already have—from our double standards in calling out racism to the need to shift the definition of Singapore’s take on racial harmony.

But now we need to talk about how a certain statutory board—established to promote social cohesion and multiracialism—dug itself a deeper hole after a recent oversight that saw a Malay couple’s wedding portrait reduced to a trite caricatural prop. How the organisation refused to engage further with the people they wronged and went on to invalidate their distress over the experience. How the organisation missed out on an opportunity to address the issue head-on, dismissing the chance to hear out the concerns of citizens they’re supposed to engage with.
We also need to talk about how a certain public figure probably made things worse. How the former political representative, lacking a sense of nuance, branded the wronged party (or anyone seeking open conversations) as unscrupulous. How he failed to see the irony in calling for grace while simultaneously telling someone to stop being an easily offended snowflake.

Folks like Alfian Sa’at and Firdaus Daud have already touched on the flaws of cherry-picking quotes and offered thorough analyses on what the government body got wrong with its response.
What we’re offering on our end: three branches of a dialogue tree the next time government bodies, political figures or anyone else find themselves in a position where they have to issue a defensive statement about race relations. Since respecting racial diversity is such a “work-in-progress” in Singapore, these would eventually come in handy sometime.
The Wrong, Chaotic Evil Path
• “Stop rocking the boat to preserve our fragile racial harmony.” This is the most common take on social media. No matter how genuine the concern is, the importance of preserving the status quo outweighs uncomfortable discussions on racial relations. Often accompanied by callbacks to race riots in the ’60s.
• Utilise hostile, defensive language. “We reject”, “without basis,” “at any cost”.
• Alternatively, passive-aggressiveness. “We find this odd.” “This is untrue.”
• Explain away the racism or resort to semantics. “Let’s not go overboard and call this racism, this is more like insensitivity”. “It’s just a mistake what, move on”.
• Play the devil’s advocate. Personal lived experiences need to be debated, apparently.
• Shut down honest conversations by blaming it on Critical Race Theory, Cancel Culture or anything deemed as Western ideology.
• Call people snowflakes.
The Lawful Neutral
• Cautiously acknowledge the matter at hand, offer broad recognition that Yes, This Is A Problem.
• “We don’t have all the facts” or “I’m not at liberty to say”. Thereby relinquishing any need to take a position or a stance right now. It can wait until after investigations have concluded or after people have forgotten about it.
• Form sentences that don’t really say anything specific. Offer overly general solutions that could fix any problem. Hope for the Barnum effect.
• Evade talking about the deeper issue and make generic calls (for society, community, species, etc) to do better for one another.
The Constructive, Neutral Good Road
• Fully acknowledge the issue, follow through with a sincere, unconditional apology where needed. “We take full responsibility for the oversight.” No “sorry, but…”
• Be open to criticism and be the bigger party/person, no matter if one feels personally attacked. Take the high ground and stay classy.
• Display some sensitivity to the emotions of the affected minority party. Accept that blindspots exist and that nobody should brush off another’s experience when it comes to racial affronts. Understand why they feel that way.
• Realise that racism is not binary. It’s not about deciding if the person/action should be deemed racist or limiting racism to typical acts of abuse, harassment, or violence.
• Don’t make assumptions about hidden agendas. Don’t make assumptions at all.
• Advance the conversation by opening the floor to others to have their say about their concerns, preferably IRL instead of written messages. Provide opportunities for them to share. Hear them out, not speak over them.
• Actually put the things learned into practice and keep at it. Then perhaps diversity and inclusion wouldn’t be such a mountainous climb even after all these years.
The point here is that you can’t push any constructive discussions forward if these incidents devolve into an argumentative skirmish that ends in a winner-loser situation. In the process of edging out the last word on the issue, the conservative party invalidates the other’s experiences just so they can stick to the safety of their current worldview.
But for a proper, productive conversation to happen, we would need to start thinking instead about how we would want to be spoken to if we were on the other side of it. Would you want your experiences and emotions questioned and discredited? Or would a willingness to acknowledge, learn, and make amends establish the social cohesion and harmony to cure the ills of racism?

Oh Nothing, Just Me and My Mum Trying Out Vulva Care Products Together",Ilyas Sholihyn,FALSE,TRUE
"Oh Nothing, Just Me and My Mum Trying Out Vulva Care Products Together",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-me-and-my-mum-trying-out-vulva-care-products-together/,17-Jun-21,"Photography by Zachary Tang.
These days, talking about our bodies isn’t as taboo as it was anymore. Even in conservative Asian cultures such as ours, we’ve shifted towards franker discussions of our relationship with sexuality and self. In our ‘Intimates’ series, we’d like to kickstart open conversations about the wellness of our private parts—in both the physical and psychological sense.
In this piece, we explore the perspectives of a mother and daughter on femininity and self-love… through the art of vulva care.
“Mama, it’s okay if you don’t want to, but do you want to do an experimental article with me? The story will feature you… and our opinions on trying vulva care products together.”
Sitting in a restaurant with my family, I expect some resistance from my mum. Even though she’s down to talk to me about anything, she prefers to keep private discussions, well, private.
She breaks into a cheeky grin and says: “Why not?”
My mother and I talk about everything — and I really mean everything. I could only ask her to take part in this unusually intimate story over dinner because that’s far from strange in my household.
To put things into perspective, here are some of my family’s casual conversation topics: shaving, butt hair, and douching.
But simply talking about vaginas brings on the giggles, so holding discussions about vulva care products are bound to be awkward. Right?
I put that to the test by spending some quality time with my mum while trying out TWO L(I)PS products together.
The TWO L(I)PS Experiment
Even as someone who writes about fitness, wellness, and lifestyle for a living, I have to be honest — I’ve never really been that familiar with vulva care products until I got this assignment. Never have I given deep thought about treating the skin below the belt any different than the rest of my body.
As a fitness nut who’s always breaking a sweat though, I totally get it. The exterior areas of female genitals — the vaginal lips, the vaginal opening, inner thighs and the flesh over your pubic bone — are highly sensitive areas. Granted, the vagina is a “self-cleaning oven”, but the external bits (i.e. the vulva) do need to be kept clean and washed regularly.
There needs to be a delicate balance though. Neglect the area? A build-up of sweat, bacteria, dead skin can nestle in the folds of the vulva. Clean the area too much? It might strip your skin’s natural oils away or disrupt its pH balance. This can lead to dryness, skin irritation and other discomforts. In the cross-junction of maintaining this balance sits vulva care products that are formulated with an optimal pH range for skin on your vulva. Like TWO L(I)PS, for example.
TWO L(I)PS, as its name cheekily/cleverly suggests, has something to do with the female nether regions. The company touts itself as the “world’s first luxury intimate care range” and that’s evident from the array of products — balms, cleansers, scrubs, serums — meant solely to give vulvas a five-star skincare treatment.
I mean, just looking at the range of goods available on the TWO L(I)PS website was overwhelming enough. Who knew that our external genitals needed such TLC?
There’s a prebiotic range to feed the skin on your vulva the nutrients it needs while keeping pH values perfectly balanced (as all things should be). There’s a Vitamin C serum that brightens dull skin. There’s even an overnight repairing mask to leave on your intimates so your vulva can get nourished and restored while you rest.
Again, these are sensitive areas, so it was good to know that TWO L(I)PS products are gynaecologically and dermatologically tested and made free from sulphates and parabens. Honestly, that’s a load off me and my mum’s mind as we embarked on this intimate experiment together.
On Femininity
Everyone tells me I’m a carbon copy of my mother but I’m sure she disagrees. She was a lot less coarse and liberal in her twenties, she often says.
While we do have our fair share of ideological differences there is one unequivocal physical similarity: We both have vaginas.
Periods
I remember telling my mum I couldn’t wait for my periods to be permanently over. She was horrified, because “a woman blossoms with the arrival of menstruation and it’s a gift to be fertile”.
During her time, Asian society and culture dictated that a woman’s main priority is motherhood.
As we move away from that conservative mindset, starting a family is now met with more hesitance. With the increase in economic competitiveness, cost of living, and global warming, many women are (understandably) postponing motherhood.
Our pick of period products echoes our upbringing, too.
Like everyone else, I was introduced to pads and pantyliners, but I fell in love with the convenience of menstrual cups.
While some people shy away from internal sanitary products, the application or insertion of period products doesn’t matter to me — what’s important is that it works. Converting to a menstrual cup was a no-brainer because I no longer need to worry about period stains, constantly changing sanitary pads, or making sure the bathroom is stocked with pads.
My mum, however, remains unconvinced about shoving anything up there, so she’s sticking to pads. Until menopause hits, that is.
Hair removal
Regarding hair on intimate areas, I only tried shaving because my mum taught me to.
Her traditional mindset makes itself visible when she tells me she feels weird showing her private parts to strangers.
I’m much more liberal about the feminine area because I don’t think there’s anything pure or holy about it.
For me, it’s just another part of my body. But as a “no sex before marriage” and “I married my first boyfriend” kind of lady, my mum believes you should shelter your private parts as they should only be seen by your partner.
Even though both of us don’t use other hair removal methods, my reason for sticking with shaving is more practical — it’s the most painless, convenient, and cost-effective option.
Vulva care
To be honest, my mum and I don’t do anything special for our vulvas. The only thing my mum does is use a feminine wash now and then. Me? I’m too lazy.
In my defence, I believe hygiene is the most important thing when it comes to vulva care so I keep my nether regions clean by wiping from front to back, ensuring they’re dry after exercise, and opting for cotton undergarments whenever possible.
Yes, that’s pretty much the extent of our glamourous vulva care routines.
Generational Self-Love
Walking by the pool with my mum.
As a busy mother of three, my mum has never really prioritised self-care. I, on the other hand, am all about that self-care life. I attend yoga classes every day, head down to the pool to journal every morning, and allocate some time to read before bed.
Many people in the older generation see self-care as indulgent and unnecessary, while those in the younger generation believe it’s vital to honour our bodies and take care of our mental health.
Despite this disparity in how we define taking care of ourselves, my mother and I have never tried any vulva care products.
We changed that by spending a relaxing Sunday evening giving TWO L(I)PS products a try together.
Chatting about self-care and our Sunday plans.
We started with Blackout, the Activated Charcoal Mask, where my mum and I ended up in positions for prime birthing while we peered over our bellies to look at each other.
Although the new experience put us in awkward positions that made us stare at each other’s vulvas, we did enjoy the hilariously intimate activity. We both love the smell and feel of the mask, and how refreshed we felt after using it.
For the rest of our bodies, we love the skin-soothing effect from Ice, the lightweight Calming Rescue Cream, and the hydrating whipped butter texture of Juice, the Prebiotic Body Balm.
Our TWO L(I)PS products in the bathroom cabinet.
Both products earn bonus points because they are made for use on the face and body (and not just the vulva) which simplifies our self-care routine.
I suppose it’s impossible to keep clean 24/7 because of (a) my active lifestyle and (b) Singapore’s hot and humid weather. But the difference in hygiene between the days before TWO L(I)PS arrived and after is positively palpable — I now realise how important vulva cleansers are in a woman’s arsenal of self-care products. Goodbye to rashes and weird bumps around my intimate area. Take it from me: give some love, care and attention to your privates even if you’re not feeling any discomfort down there.
Vulva Vulnerability
After a week of chatting about intimacy while trying out vulva care products together, honestly, I’ve never felt more comfortable and open with my mum.
Also, who knew that using vulva care products would feel so lush?
Just one week of being on top of our hygiene and vulva care left our nether regions feeling fresh and smooth, without any sticky residue. Our vulvas have never felt better. It looks like vulva care will be a normal part of our daily routines now — a healthy habit that should transcend any generational misgivings.
Discussing who should get more TWO L(I)PS products.
Although it’s no surprise that my mum and I see femininity and intimacy from different perspectives, it was enlightening to see how her generation’s conservative upbringing and environment created this dichotomy in how we treat our private parts.
Self-care and self-expression might not be familiar concepts for her and the rest of her generation — a generation that didn’t have the freedom, time or exposure to such notions. Though my mum found it strange that luxury intimate skincare products exist, she’s glad that women today have the opportunity to indulge in things like masks and serums made specifically for vulvas.
Opening the floor for vulva care discussions is empowering and change-making because many women have burning questions that go unanswered. If chatting about intimacy isn’t seen as taboo, women everywhere would be able to attend to their vulvas with more care and confidence.
I’ve never been afraid to bring up sensitive topics when I’m with my mum, but now both of us recognise the behavioural norms that dictate our respective generations. Which makes communicating our different perspectives a lot easier.
Plus, we’ve literally stared at each other’s vulvas, so we don’t know what the word awkward means anymore.

The Digital Future Is Now: How The Pandemic Has Re-Energised Local Theatre",Carissa Wong,FALSE,TRUE
The Digital Future Is Now: How The Pandemic Has Re-Energised Local Theatre,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-online-theatre-pandemic-evolution-change-community-digital/,18-Jun-21,"Top Image: 3 Cups of Kopi
If there is one thing that has really irked me during this pandemic, it’s the assumption that our theatre industry has met its demise. Things like live performances and exhibitions may not be feasible in these trying times, but a closer and more nuanced investigation into the heart of our theatre scene reveals that it is anything but going extinct.
Despite the struggles and challenges posed by the pandemic, local theatre has been taking these obstacles in good stride. Companies have continued experimenting with ways to adapt their works, and upgrade their skills to push out pieces that will not only tide through this difficult period, but will also remain relevant post-pandemic.
Case in point: 3 Cups of Kopi, a group that specialises in Playback Theatre—an applied form of theatre where participants are invited to share their personal stories and have trained actors play back the different emotions, thoughts, and feelings associated with the story—has found innovative ways to incorporate their art form into the online medium of Zoom.
In essence, an online version of Playback Theatre generally operates in the following manner: after inviting a participant to tell their story, the facilitator summarises it and signals for the actors to begin performing. Using common household items such as pots and pans, small whiteboard markers, and even zoom filters, the emotions and thoughts that accompany the participant’s story are represented by the actors and “played back” to the audience. The entire experience is quite surreal indeed, bringing to life an almost invisible, untold layer of the story that imbues it with new meaning and empathetic connection.
While this is certainly somewhat different from how Playback Theatre would function in person, it by no means points towards the inferiority of online theatre. To start, it helps to recognise that online theatre is more than just a substitute for live performances. It is a completely different medium that has its own unique ability to bring people together and touch the lives of many.
Certainly, having a physical process, such as purchasing a ticket from a booth, entering into a space guided by an usher, perusing an itinerary, and even exiting the space after the performance is over may be valuable to the overall experience of theatre. However, while this is understandably important in establishing a sense of ritual and ambience for the performance, who’s to say that these acts of ritual and process cannot take place online?
Offstage 3.0, a production by Emergency Stairs, incorporated this very line of inquiry into its performance. Using multimedia tools such as laptops, phones, and live-streamed videography, the performance, which was performed online in December 2020, sought to challenge the need for a physical presence in arranging a theatrical production. This was just one of the many innovative ways that theatre companies have adopted a fairly optimistic perspective when dealing with the pandemic.
They’ve seen it as a catalyst for innovative change rather than a circumstantial hindrance.
Online and digital theatre has become increasingly common as a result of the pandemic. As technology continues to upgrade itself over time and change the way we live and interact with one another, so does theatre reflect this dynamism in its dramaturgy and style. With the spotlight being drawn towards avant-garde theatre companies such as New York-based experimental theatre company The Wooster Group, which specialises in multimedial performance and digitalisation, the rise in technology as a whole as pivoted our focus towards what is particularly relevant to us – which oftentimes takes the form of technology as a whole.
""Hamlet"" by The Wooster Group, an experimental theatre company based in New York
In essence, the times have been, and are always changing. What the pandemic has done effectively to catalyse this move forward for all of us. While this transit may have been unexpectedly sudden, it is nothing completely unforeseen. Theatre groups in the past have been dabbling with the incorporation of new forms of technology into their performances, and will continue doing so even after the pandemic blows over.
As our local theatre scene embarks on this journey of reformation and evolution, the last thing they need right now is for audiences to shun their digital works, and mistakenly trivialising them as being inferior copies of the real.
Here are three reasons why we should celebrate this rise of online theatre.
1. Accessibility
Holding a performance in an online format has the significant benefit of allowing more and more people to access these performances from the comfort of their own home. This is especially important when we consider things such as individuals with physical disabilities, together with well, just the thought of having to physically travel down to watch something.
Clicking on a Zoom link and participating in an online performance from one’s own home makes online theatre and performance far more accessible than it otherwise would have been pre-covid.
The migration of theatre towards the online form also allows for participants to attend workshops and performances from all over the world, as long as their time zones match, of course. Participants not only enjoy a greater diversity of online shows to choose from, they also become part of a global community of audience members when participating in online performances. In effect, a global tapestry of theatre is sewn together as a result of this unprecedented level of accessibility.
You can’t help but be changed by so many stories that are being told and shared at the same time, because now [theatre] is everywhere
By allowing for a greater diversity of audienceship as well as performance groups, theatre productions experience an unprecedented range of views, expectations, and awareness as a whole.
To learn more about the community’s perspective of diversity in moving towards the online format, I spoke to Michael Cheng, the artistic director of Tapestry Playback Theatre and Adjunct Lecturer at Singapore Polytechnic. He explains that this diversity is necessary in communicating an even greater sense of empathy and connection with groups of people we may not otherwise have the opportunity to engage with on an ordinary basis:
“I would have Palestenian friends, Arab friends, so on and so forth,” he says.
“And you think about how politics has impacted lives, and how many different perspectives there are. Yet I can choose to say that every one of those views are valid because they are the realities for each of these individuals.”
Michael Cheng, Artistic Director, Tapestry Playback Theatre
“It just makes you appreciate how complicated situations, moments, and politics can be. But at the same time it impacts individuals, and that’s where I think a lot of us need to be more aware that things are rarely so black and white. There are always more sides to the story.”
For most of us, theatre is about bringing people together. It’s about sharing stories, experiences, and perspectives with one another. It’s about community building. If we accept that all of these are important to theatre, then surely it is through this transition to the online form that we better achieve this greater diversity where perspectives and opinions all across the world are shared and embraced.
2. Affordability
This is the part that some of us may be the most concerned with. Yes, shows and performances have mostly become more affordable and cheaper with the migration towards online platforms. Performance groups and troupes are able to save on things such as securing physical venues for rehearsals and the actual performances, as well as the additional logistical support that comes with hosting a live performance.
Gone are the days where expensive lighting and sound equipment had to be rented or even bought to facilitate performances. This inevitably means that ticket prices are considerably cheaper than before, which only serves to make attending an online performance an affordable and meaningful way to spend your weekend nights.
More importantly, being able to save on venues and physical logistics also means that performance groups are able to invest more time and resources in continually being innovative and finding new and creative ways to execute their performances. Expenditure on things like skills upgrading workshops for performers to accommodate the new online format for instance, are now more accessible to even smaller theatre companies.
By investing in IT skills upgrading and proficiency, theatre companies are not only able to find more creative ways to express their art over the online form, but are also able to future-proof their performances for the long run. Online theatre will not be going away even after the pandemic tides over, and these skills will ensure that their art remains relevant and up to date for the long haul.
3. Interactivity and Intimacy
While arguably the most controversial aspect of online theatre, with many criticising the form for its lack of personal connection and feeling, perhaps a more nuanced discussion on this needs to be had to explore this further.
In the same way that performance groups rely upon a certain ritual (be it curtain calls, physical gestures, or even setting a particular ambience) in order to create a sense of connection with their audience members, online theatre brings with it its own set of processes and facilitation techniques to re-create this sense of ritual, and bring the heart of the performance to its audiences.
Some of us are holding onto the perspective that online theatre is a temporary substitute. But really, a lot of us are also enjoying the online platform because there’s so many opportunities now.
3 Cups of Kopi for instance, in holding their online playback performances, still preserve the ritualistic aspects of ice-breaking activities, physical warm-ups and use of key words such as “let’s watch” that are all integral to their art form. These are all necessary steps in order for a firm emotional connection to be established with their audiences to facilitate the sharing of personal stories and experiences, which forms the backbone of their performances.
Especially in interactive performances that require participants to speak up and interact with the room, doing so in a physical space with people around you may be daunting for some. This pressure and fear is often assuaged when one is behind a computer screen.
Having attended a live Playback performance in the past, I can attest to the fact that speaking up in front of a crowd about my own personal story can be incredibly intimidating. However, when attending an online version of the performance recently, I found myself more willing to share.
The fact that the facilitator also requested other participants who were not sharing their story to turn off their view cameras also helped create a more intimate and personal experience between myself and the performers alone.
Some online Playback Theatre groups have even opted to incorporate technology as means of ensuring greater interactivity with handicapped or disabled groups. Take Karnataka-based Playback group YoursTrulyTheatre for instance, who are currently embarking on a performance project catered to the visually-handicapped community. With the transition to the online platform, they are now able to use applications such as Clubhouse, which allows for audio-only discussions to take place, creating conducive spaces for members of the community to participate and engage in the performance.
Ultimately, ensuring intimacy and engagement still boils down to ensuring that the basics are done right, and that facilitation methods are kept relevant and meaningful to all participants and audiences.
The Way Forward
Online and digital theatre as a whole is nothing new. Performance groups all across the world have long been incorporating the virtual space as a core part of their shows; hybrid or otherwise. The only thing that has really changed is the surge of this very genre and the necessary transition towards it.
While the pandemic has indeed been difficult on our local arts scene, it is perhaps through the efforts of groups like 3 Cups of Kopi and T:> Works, who will be hosting their online exhibition and performance Festival of Women N.O.W 2021, which begins on the 13th of July, that we observe how the pandemic has actually been a period of critical evolution and change for our local arts scene. You can find out more about T:> Works’ upcoming works and projects here.
While the transition towards the online form undeniably brings with it its own unique set of challenges, there is an optimism that these groups carry with them that truly exemplifies the undying spirit of our local theatre scene.
This is a period of tumultuous change and uncertainty. The specific requirements that go into instrumentalising the online platform as a medium for performance may indeed be challenging, but this is precisely also what demands our respect for the form—that this is far from being a temporary and inferior substitute to live theatre. Rather, it is a unique genre on its own that boasts distinct benefits, charms, and poise.
The cast of 3 Cups of Kopi as they bid participants farewell for the night
By embracing this major transition towards the digital, theatre groups all across Singapore ensure not only their survival during this trying period, but also guarantee their relevance as technology continues to evolve and alter our expectations and attitudes towards life in general.
Performances that incorporate advanced technology such as augmented reality and virtual reality have been on the rise over the past decade all across the world, and artists have been continuously finding new and innovative ways to express their art with changing mediums that grant increasingly diverse opportunities. We need to carry this optimism forward within our local communities in receiving the works of performance groups who take the bold leap forward.
Their undying spirit for evolution and change is the torch that lights the way forward, piercing through the miasma of the pandemic and bringing the future to us. We ought to be there with them as they do so.

On a rainy January afternoon, Erika paced up and down Victoria Street looking for a hotel where she was expected by her date. She didn’t know much about him, only that he was wearing a dark blue shirt. She hadn’t even seen a photo of him or been told his name. Naturally, her nerves were starting to kick in.
This was her first time using Maybe.sg, a platform that, according to its website, gives you access to a range of personalities for on-demand social experiences. While clients can pick a girl (or guy) for a date, their information won’t be shared with them until they arrive at the meet-up point.
Upon entering the hotel and approaching the restaurant, Erika was greeted by a receptionist who asked her who her date was.
“I haven’t met him yet,” she responded, held back by the question. The awkward encounter was quickly interrupted when Erika’s date recognised her and brought her to his table.
It was awkward at first, Erika described, because “we were just not on the same wavelength.” But a bottle of wine later, the conversation was flowing smoothly. “It was like hanging out with an uncle,” she said, referring to how Maybe’s no-touching policy keeps the dates friendly and casual.
The Growing Demand For Girlfriend Experiences
Erika is one of the many new sign ups Maybe.sg has seen since the pandemic started. A Maybe representative told me that there has been a drastic increase in clients, and speculates that the boredom from being stuck in Singapore has led to more men and women looking for people to enjoy recreational activities with.
For Erika, there’s a very practical reason why she joined Maybe: acting is her passion, and the platform offers her a more flexible way of earning side income as compared to a 9-6 job. Especially during COVID, stable sources of income are harder to find.
Chrissy, another Maybe girl I interviewed, said that the platform is a way for her to gain professional guidance while earning extra income. So far, she has met men who have taught her about trading, crypto currencies, public speaking, and who have even told her they would help her network and invest in any businesses she wants to start.
Erika.
What Do These Men Truly Want?
While there have been a minority of clients who have made uncomfortable propositions, both Erika and Chrissy said that the vast majority are “really sweet.” Generally, the archetype is a post-break up man who needs a listening ear, or one who has been single for many years and is craving a sense of intimacy with someone.
Erika recalled meeting a guy who asked her if she would be willing to make an arrangement with him to offer the ‘girlfriend experience.’ “He said he just wanted someone to hold when he dances,” Erika recalled.
But by far, the most memorable date for Erika was when a divorced man with two kids invited her to the Wild Wild Wet water park. At first, she thought it was a ploy to get her in a bikini, prompting her to wear a long sleeve surf shirt with swim shorts. But on the date, she found out the man had very different motives.
“I chose Wild Wild Wet because I used to come here with my kids and I really miss it. None of my friends want to come with me,” he said.
While Chrissy told me about various dates that consisted of visiting upscale restaurants where expensive sushi and red wine were ordered, it’s the men who were vulnerable that she still remembers today.
One of these dates came as a surprise when she saw she was invited to a bak kut teh restaurant by a man in his early thirties. They spoke a bit and he opened up to her about his ex-girlfriend, after eventually just asking her if they could play chess.
“I don’t think he wanted anything but company and someone to hang out with,” Chrissy said. “So we played chess for most of the two hours. It was so wholesome.”
The Role Mainstream Dating Apps Play In Pushing Men To The Fringes
The modern world of online dating has made matchmaking a superficial ordeal. On apps like Tinder and Bumble, users choose potential dates based off of a select set of profile photos and a short biography. Naturally, appearance is the main deciding factor—followed by career, and fun facts about the person. While this format works for some, it leaves out a portion of people who may not benefit from the way dating apps emphasize the importance of looks.
“With dating apps, like Tinder, you need to be somewhat attractive, or young, to find matches in that circle,” Chrissy said. “And if you’re not, it’s going to be harder for you.”
In one of Maybe’s first promotional videos from 2019, this cycle is perfectly exemplified. The video starts with Cedric and Aloysius, two good friends since young. Cedric is athletic and is presented to be more attractive, while Aloysius is described as a “geek who prefers to stay at home.”
Both friends swipe on a dating app together, but only Cedric gets any matches. “I swipe swipe swipe so many times, one match also cannot get,” Aloysius complains.
Still from Maybe.sg promotional video.
“Life is unfair sometimes,” Cedric responds.
Aloysius deletes the dating app from his phone, but his eyes light up as he mutters “Maybe” under his breath. A few minutes pass and an attractive young girl walks towards the two. Cedric prepares himself to greet the date he assumes is his, but to his surprise, she is there to meet Aloysius instead.
Still from Maybe.sg promotional video.
It’s a continuous cycle: men try to find companionship online, but this fails, eventually pushing them to turn to hiring girls online instead.
“Sometimes I think about how lonely they must be to have to hire somebody for companionship,” Erika shared. “Some of them are not the society standard of attractive, so it lowers their chances of finding somebody.”
“I have friends who are in relationships with people they didn’t find physically attractive at first. But they fell in love with them because of their personalities when they met. Now, with how the dating world is changing, this is happening less and less. There’s less opportunity for showing your personality.”
Does The Paid Girlfriend Experience Help These Men?
When Chrissy and Erika told me about the lonely men who turned to Maybe after failed attempts with other apps, I struggled to consider it a viable solution.
If they can’t find love on mainstream apps, do apps like Maybe not just reinforce the idea that they will never find love unless they pay for it? And while this is not the fault of Maybe girls—they are just supplying a service there is a demand for—it does raise some important societal questions.
In the long term, what is the impact on these men who know that their dates were only nice to them because they were paid?
“Look, I know this isn’t a real date,” one client told Erika. “I know I’m not your type. I called you because I was bored and lonely.”
Hearing men say this only reinforces Erika’s belief that an app like Maybe is good. She told me that because she is open about her social escorting gigs on social media, she gets a lot of responses from followers online. Of which, some have told her how grateful they are for apps like Maybe because it gives them the option to pay for someone to hang out with rather than be completely alone.
Erika admitted that on paid dates, there is a lot of acting involved. At the end of the day, she needs to deliver a service—a fun, enjoyable time—which doesn’t always come naturally depending on the person in front of her.
“But it’s also not always sad and lonely guys. It can be super fun,” Erika reassured me. “Some of them really just want a bigger group of people, so they hire more to join, that’s it.” For example, some rich men want to fill out their yachts. Others just want more buddies to drink with.
“What is the bigger issue for me is the judgment we get,” Erika confessed. “We get comments saying that renting a buddy is just PG-13 prostituion. So many people think women on Maybe are just tools, but it’s not like that at all.”

Meet Beckie, The Swimwear Designer Who Left Singapore For the Surf Life in Bali",Edoardo Liotta,TRUE,TRUE
"Meet Beckie, The Swimwear Designer Who Left Singapore For the Surf Life in Bali",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-meet-beckie-swimwear-designer-left-singapore-surf-life-bali/,20-Jun-21,"Immigration has become a hot topic in recent months. But thus far, the discussion has largely centered around foreigners that choose to come to Singapore. But what about the other side of the picture? In this ‘Singaporeans Abroad’ series, we share with you the stories of locals who—thanks to living in a globalised world—have found success in different corners of the globe, whether financially, romantically, or for the pure joy of adventure.
Recently, we met Jane, the insurance agent who gave up her career, marriage, and condo to be a digital nomad and Weihui, the Singaporean working with refugees in Syria.
Now, we bring you Beckie, the NUS communications & new media graduate who created a sustainable swimwear brand and surfs for Team SG in Bali. This is how she fell in love with the sand, the slow life, and created the sea-sterhood.
Some part of me always knew that the traditional expectation of a ‘good life’ in Singapore wouldn’t fulfil me. I studied communications and new media in NUS, and for a while, I followed what everyone else was doing: I did some internships and tried out the office lifestyle. My parents didn’t place a lot of pressure on me, but I was very influenced by my peers and their choices. I got caught up in the stress of securing the next best opportunity.
When I was younger, I watched a lot of Lilo and Stitch. I was drawn to the slow pace of island life, so I spent some time in Bali when I finished my O Levels to experience that peacefulness. There, I discovered surfing and it clicked. On the water, I just felt free. It’s meditative to be away from your screen for two hours, studying the waves and tuning your body to the rhythm of the ocean. It’s an experience that you literally can’t find in Singapore because there are no waves.

In my second year of university, I knew that a 9-5 wouldn’t give me the purpose I felt while I surfed. So, I started to make a plan for what my life in Bali could look like. Obviously, an office job wouldn’t facilitate the freeness I desired, so I started designing swimwear for surfers. I stayed up until 2 or 3 AM working on new styles and figuring out what patterns and materials would look good, but also stayed put while catching a wave. I never felt tired or burnt out, because I was deeply passionate about this venture. I felt hopeful, actually.
In Bali, I found a production company which shared my vision of sustainability and lean business practices. This was a difficult process, because I wanted to make sure we could produce quality products in small quantities. Finally, I found the right person who took a chance on my vision for Haikini. We’re a fully e-commerce company, and the pouches which hold our products are made from repurposed dead-stock fabrics. We don’t use any plastic in our packaging. To reduce our waste, we take pre-orders and custom orders, then produce according to the demand.

I think my love for surfing and swimwear helped Haikini to take off, because I wanted to foster a sense of community in tandem with the business. I’m in touch with my customers, and we call each other seasters, aka sea-sisters. In 2019, I hosted a surf camp, where I taught some girls from Singapore how to surf and showed them the spoils of island life. It was an amazing experience. I got to know their aspirations and dreams. Many of them started side projects after this experience, and I’m happy that I helped facilitate that by showing them the surfing culture in Bali.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
I felt lonely at the start of my surf journey. In those days, it was pretty rare to see a girl on the water. It’s definitely a male-dominated sport. Part of my mission with sharing my life in Bali and creating Haikini is to encourage more women to join the sport. It’s empowering to stand up on a wave, and it helped me feel more confident in my body. However, I’ve noticed that men can be aggressive on the water. There’s surf-etiquette, and I always joke with my girlfriends that this etiquette is better performed when girls are in the line-up.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
Just last week I was surfing with some girls on an island off Bali, and there were two guys who kept cutting in front of us to catch the waves. There were only five of us there in total, and they refused to practice the surf-etiquette, which is quite rude. I’ve learned to be more assertive when I’m in the line-up and waiting to catch a wave. I feel nervous, almost like I have to prove that girls can surf too. This feeling propelled me to compete in the SEA games and represent Singapore in 2019.
That experience was exhilarating, but incredibly stressful. Which is kind of ironic, right? Surfing is supposed to be peaceful. But it’s still a sport which requires a high level of skill. It’s difficult to get funding for a new sport, and to be honest, I didn’t receive any when I was representing Singapore. I chose to invest in a coach, so that I could be prepared for the competition. I even went to the competition site a month early to learn the waves. I had a lot of breakdowns at that time, because Haikini was still growing, and I was having to spend so much on training. I remember telling my friends: “I don’t know how this is going to turn out.”
Ultimately, I’m proud of my performance. I was so close to winning the bronze in the Philippines, but unfortunately, I didn’t make it. Next time I’ll train harder. It also meant a lot to compete as the first female longboard surfer. Since this sport is an integral part of my life, it doesn’t feel daunting to put in the work to improve. Unfortunately, there were no games in 2020. But I can’t wait for the next opportunity to represent Team SG. I felt so proud holding the flag, because we were the only competitors who came from a country with no surf.
I’ve learned some life lessons through surfing. A few weeks ago I was trying to master this trick. The thing about surfing is that every wave is different, so you have to be patient and find the right moment to do a trick like a nose ride or a hang five. Throughout this session, I tried so hard to force the trick and it didn’t work. During a break, I realized: Why am I trying to force this? I can’t control how the waves break. If there’s no opportunity to do a trick, I can’t do anything about that. When I got back on the water, I stopped trying to force it. Finally, I managed to do it. There’s a lot of things in life that you can’t force. It’s not always about going with the flow, but working with what you have the best that you can. This relates to COVID as well. What can I do about COVID? I can’t change the external factors. But within myself, I can try my best to work with what I’ve got.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
In Bali, I try to embody this lesson. It would be hard to maintain this attitude in Singapore. When I come back, I remember why I left, although I do love visiting my family and friends. It’s so fast paced, I feel that I’m never doing enough. I have friends who thrive in this environment but it doesn’t work for me. There’s a comparison mindset, where we’re encouraged to replicate the success of others. I think often you’ll see someone else’s triumph and think: I want exactly what they have. But in that thought process, there’s not much room to dream.
What do you actually want to achieve, what hobby or practice fills you up?
I’ve modeled my business and my life in Bali around this question. Even when I was pressured to do an internship and follow the corporate path, I kept my true passion at the front of my mind. Then, I made an action plan. A lot of people message and ask me how to replicate my life. But what I really want to advise them to do, is to take stock of what gives them a sense of purpose. I think people are drawn to the freeness I’ve found, not the exact circumstances I have. Unfortunately, I can’t tell anyone how to do exactly what I did. When it comes down to it, you’ve got to put yourself in a position where you have no option but to follow your own path.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
If you’re not happy in your job or your relationship, you can change that. Of course, it doesn’t happen immediately. For some people with a lot of resources, it might be easier to accomplish. I was forced to make this work because I left myself with no other option: I had to build a company to support myself and pursue island life. Before I moved to Bali, I spent a few years shoring up my ability to do this. I don’t think that uprooting your life will solve any problems. Think deeply about what makes you happy, and work around that. A change in circumstance is not a magic wand.
With that being said, there’s power in taking a leap of faith. In general, I think Singaporeans are overly focused on having a ‘safety net’. We’re taught to think of the worst case scenario and be very risk averse. I struggle with being risk averse myself. Sometimes, I get scared of investing a certain amount of money for Haikini’s marketing or logistics. This thought echoes in my mind: What if I lose it all? Everything I have right now could go away. But, I’ve found that the greatest things happen when you surrender to the process. Serendipity can only be found in the unexpected.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
For example, when I first came to Bali I went through a breakup. I was a bit bruised, but still, I was open to finding a connection with someone. Randomly, I started searching through mutual friends on Facebook and found this surfer who I thought was really attractive. I added him and forgot all about it. A few weeks later, I ventured to this beach where the competition is really tough and the surfers can be hostile. I was in the line-up for a wave and I noticed this guy in front of me: I saw his back and his hair and thought he was good looking. Then, he turned around and said “Are you Beckie?” It was the same guy I added on Facebook.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
We met in February 2020, and we’ve been together ever since. He’s half American and half Indonesian, and he came to Bali to enjoy the surf and the slow life. We spend three days a week apart to maintain our independence, which I think is important, so that we still cultivate our separate identities. It’s been so easy and natural with him, and we’re very well suited to each other. None of this would’ve happened if I hadn’t surrendered to the process and made room for serendipity in my life.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
My grandmother still asks me when I’m going to come home and get an office job. But I’d rather see where the slow life takes me. My day-to-day life is fulfilling. Depending on the tides, I catch a surf in the morning for a few hours, then go for lunch, visit my production house and work on a new bikini design in the afternoon, then I end the day walking my dog on the beach at sunset. It’s a low maintenance lifestyle, and it’s fairly easy to live comfortably in Bali for a fraction of the cost-of-living in Singapore.
Image credit: Beckie Liu
Though I don’t feel called to go home, I’ve found a community of Singaporeans in Bali. Most of them are not surfers: some own restaurants, do personal training, or build villas. I have to do a lot of code-switching, because Singlish can be hard to understand, so it’s nice to have people to lah and lor with. This connection to home while I’m away is valuable. At the end of the day, we’re all following the path of experiencing something different and searching for a purpose. That’s what binds us.

Asexuals in Singapore Tell Us How It Feels To Disappear",RICE STAFF,TRUE,TRUE
Asexuals in Singapore Tell Us How It Feels To Disappear,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-asexuals-singapore-tell-us-feels-disappear/,23-Jun-21,"All images by Feline Lim for RICE Media.
A few years ago, on Valentine’s Day of all days, I was grabbing drinks with an old friend of mine at a bar near the foot of Ann Siang Hill when, apropos of nothing, she came out to me as an asexual.
This news came as quite a shock. Because for as long as I’ve known her—going on fifteen years now—this friend had always been a notorious flirt in her social life. An extravert who would crack obscene jokes in front of total strangers, ones that made grown men blush. This was my favourite quality about her; she was often inappropriate, but never boring.
In short, she was the last person I expected to learn was asexual. While I knew she had no reason to lie, I confess that my first reaction was not acceptance, but skepticism.
So my natural follow-up question was:
How do you know for sure?
How to Disappear Completely
To this day, ‘how do you know’ is perhaps the question that plagues the asexual community, or ‘ace’ for short. To openly address it is to run the risk of being ridiculed or dismissed.
Asexual women are typically written off as frigid and repressed. Asexual men, on the other hand, are laughed at. They have failed the unspoken test of what it means to be a ‘real man’, which perversely, means having the innate desire to fuck anything that moves.
The implication here being that there’s something wrong with the asexual. That at some point in their life, something must’ve damaged them. That this can’t be who they really are.
While many in the LGBTQ+ community experience similar prejudices, the asexual struggle stands apart. This is because the lack of intrinsic sexual desire can never be ‘proven’ or ‘shown’ to the outside observer, so it’s often conflated with social factors like a repressed childhood or simply not having met the right person.
By contrast, when a gay or lesbian brings home a partner of the same sex, or when a transgender individual chooses to undergo hormone therapy or gender reassignment surgery, these are all observable facts. Whatever our prejudice, we can’t deny the commitment.
Asexuality, on the other hand, is like Schrodinger’s cat. From the outside, we can’t know whether the cat in the box is dead or alive. Only the cat knows.
Which is why asexuals are arguably the hardest group for even reasonable people to accept. Some don’t believe asexuals exist in the first place. It’s a fake. Yet another fancy label the strawberry generation made up just to get more attention.
In essence, the asexual’s struggle is the minority’s struggle writ large: because to truly accept a person, we have to learn to see them first. But how do we ‘see’ someone whose sexuality is defined by its absence?
Linda’s Story
“I think I’m on a different wavelength from most Singaporeans I know,” said Linda, an asexual Singaporean who was born and raised in Singapore, and now resides in the United States.
“But timeline-wise, I have had a very conventional Chinese Singaporean high-achiever life.”
For Linda, doubts about her sexuality started creeping in during secondary school/JC, when puberty hit.
Like many others in the LGBTQ community, it starts with the realisation that there’s a disconnect between external appearances and your inner reality. It’s a vague feeling that’s hard to put your finger on. To further complicate matters, it can be difficult to distinguish whether this feeling is part of the normal confusion of puberty or something that’s separate and distinct.
“One very distinct memory for me is around 15 or 16, hearing a friend saying “(this celebrity) is so HAWT” and me not knowing how to respond to that,” said Linda. “I felt like she was talking about something that I couldn’t access at all.”
A few years later, Linda stumbled upon the Asexual Visibility and Education Network (AVEN) community online.
“The moment I read their FAQ page a lightbulb went off,” said Linda. “And I knew, deeply and instinctively, that I had found something that described me in some way.”
At this point in our interview, I could already anticipate the skepticism from some readers. Who’s to say that the FAQ didn’t warp her views, causing her to stray from the ‘normal’ path of sexual development? This is an argument offered by some conservative groups, who believe that Singaporean youth are being corrupted by dangerous foreign ideas.
Of course, there’s also an irony to this line of reasoning. Because what exactly makes the traditional mindset on sex so healthy and normal?
Growing up in Singapore, Linda got the sense that abstinence-only sex education and chastity/modesty culture has led a lot of young adults to becoming strangely obsessed with sex in sometimes unhealthy ways. These issues are often left unresolved as they enter university and into the working world.
“The major misconception about asexuality is that we’re sexually repressed,” said Linda. “Believe me, I have been checking to see if this is just a phase for about a decade now.”
It would have saved her a lot of stress and heartache. Because to come out as asexual to family and friends is to open yourself up to unsolicited advice and questions, ranging from the well-intentioned to the disturbing:
The most common response that Linda gets is that this is just a phase. Others have suggested the possibility that she’s a closeted lesbian who’s forcing herself to be with men. One friend jokingly proposed corrective rape.
”Needless to say, we are no longer friends,” said Linda.
But like most people, Linda still longs for a romantic life partnership. What she wants is not so different from the norm: marriage (or equivalent), family, romantic gestures, and the works.
So if what she wants is the same as everyone else, why is her asexuality even an issue?
The answer is simple: there’s more to a functional relationship/marriage than just keeping up appearances. If finding a compatible partner is hard enough in traditional relationships, being asexual makes it that much harder.
“I would say that asexuality has impacted my dating life significantly and negatively,” said Linda.
“Feeling ‘unwanted’ or like your partner is ‘neutral’ is, of course, a great way to turn off any attraction a non-asexual partner might have towards you.”
This is why some asexuals limit their dating pool exclusively to those who also fall on the asexual spectrum. Others pursue romantic bonds with non-asexuals, but allow their partners to fulfill their sexual needs outside of their partnership.
“It certainly narrows the dating pool available to you because I don’t feel that primal need to come on to another person.”
Without broader understanding of asexuality as an orientation, it can be hard for asexuals to find their bearings, intensifying their feeling of isolation.
“Back when I was using dating apps, I had my profile set up to show me matches from anywhere in the world,” said Linda.
It came back with only five matches.
A Case For Labels
Linda identifies as 99% asexual and demisexual. This means that while she has no intrinsic sexual desire (asexual), she is not averse to having sex once a deep emotional connection has been formed (demisexual).
“While I enjoy having the option of having sex as a way to deepen an intimate bond with someone I love, the reality is that there’s a 90% chance that sex is never going to be something critical to me in a relationship.”
For many in the ace community, these labels and definitions are essential. They serve as reference points for asexuals to communicate their experience—while at the same time acknowledging that there are various shades of gray.
“In the end I see these as useful labels for helping a partner understand me,” she explained. “They have been also not-so-useful at times as well, as they don’t capture the fluidity and openness of how I feel about sex.”
For members of the older generation, this proliferation of sexual orientations, spectrums and pronouns is a lot to take in at once. The first impulse might be to dismiss these out of hand. Is there even a need for such labels? Can’t we all just identify as human beings?
This is the Catch-22 for many minority groups. For the asexual community in particular, to abandon all labels is to become unmoored, to lose a common language to talk about their experiences with each other and convey that invisible feeling to others. Yet to champion these labels is to create new vectors to be ridiculed and attacked.
To be ‘woke’ is to draw backlash to ‘woke culture.’ Similarly, ‘critical race theory’ has drawn an equally strong backlash from venues like Zaobao, who ironically parrot U.S. right wing talking points in erecting CRT as a straw man against liberal ‘snowflakes’ and foreign influence.
These are the ways that language and politics lock things down. It takes what is complex and turns it into a series of talking points and jargon. Its goal is to preemptively shut down conversations that challenge the norm.
But it is the exclusive privilege of the majority to eschew labels and definitions. Examples of our normalness are all around us. Everything from media portrayals to education to government policies are designed to validate the ‘correctness’ of our identity and life choices.
What the asexual community illustrates is that having a language of your own is not just a preference for minorities, but a matter of survival, without which, their experiences would disappear into the realm of the shapeless, the unseen, and the unspoken.
More Than Words
If we made the effort, it’s not that hard to relate to the asexual community’s feeling of loneliness and isolation.
Most of us probably harbour a secret that we find difficult to share with even those who are closest to us—for fear of being ridiculed or dismissed. Some of us will keep it bottled up inside, and for the rest of our lives, we’ll carry it like a weight around our necks.
This feeling may not have a clear outline, and words may be insufficient, but at the same time, it’s quite fundamental to everything that makes us human.
Despite the noise and trolls, civil society in Singapore is slowly moving in a positive direction. Just as we now know that the ‘power of positive thinking’ will not cure our depression, many have come around to the idea that homosexuality and transgenderism are not lifestyle choices.
Instead of intellectualising serious issues away or erecting strawmen to shield ourselves from discomfort, what the asexual community can teach us is how to listen, reciprocate, and reflect.
Maybe then we can all attain the liberating feeling of finally being seen.

Inside Singapore’s Thriving Black Market: Is It Time To Rethink The Vape Ban?",Ivan K. Wu,FALSE,TRUE
"A Journey Through The Only HDB Estate In Siglap, The Lesser-known Dakota Crescent",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-journey-hdb-estate-siglap-lesser-known-dakota-crescent/,24-Jun-21,"Photography by Eliza Ho.
What does it mean to be Singaporean? Many will say that being Singaporean means speaking Singlish, or being kiasu. But in recent years, it can feel like being Singaporean is all about being in a constant state of change—constantly measuring trade-offs against bets on future growth, having to re-establish our identities as the spaces around us face a seemingly never-ending cycle of being torn down and built up, taking with them intimate memories and slices of our culture.
This story is part of a series where we explore the spaces, subcultures, and stories of Singapore that may no longer exist as we pursue urbanisation and progress. It’s not just about conservation and nostalgia, but also about understanding why, as a nation, these transformations are sometimes necessary.
Golden shafts of light line the pale pink walls, casting quivering shadows of trees jingling their sleeves of green. As the mynas trill, a sense of peace settles snugly over a cluster of five-storey HDB blocks in Siglap. Supposedly due for demolition under the Selective En Bloc Redevelopment Scheme (SERS) in 2015, the four, stout blocks still sit solemnly along East Coast Road today, its empty hallways and vacant grounds a queer sight amidst the neighbourhood.
This curious compound is very much the lesser known Dakota, sporting the same apocalyptic qualities, now that residents have all but emptied its quarters. Dated posters are splashed against dusty storefronts, obnoxiously publicizing telco offers or coyly showing off the latest sultry hairdo. Void of their original inhabitants, mailboxes are stuffed full with an assortment of leftover flyers, plastic bottles, and other alien intruders. A mishmash of wooden boards are deftly nailed to windows and entry ways, while hefty locks coil around grills with their paint peeling off, a warning to the stray explorer.
A former kampung, the Siglap flats were built in response to a case of Chinese New Year festivities gone awry, when a blazing fire in 1962 consumed several attap houses. The new flats to rehouse affected residents were completed in 1964, consisting of a mix of residential units and shop spaces.
Setting up Framer’s Choice some 20 years ago, Mr Kadir was one such former tenant before he moved to a corner unit at Siglap Centre. With a wealth of experience in frame making, Mr Kadir is one of the few craftsmen in what he labels as a dying trade.
“Last time when I’m missing a material, I can just call my frame making friends to ask if they have spare. But now, less and less friends,” Mr Kadir muses. He is seated amid a stack of frame samples lined up like a searing arrow, with a jumble of tape, receipts and other handy tools crammed on the neighbouring shelf.
Mr Kadir’s brother was the one who first showed him the reins, and the two shared a frame making business together.
“It was tough at first when I didn’t know anything”, Mr Kadir shares. Gesturing to his palm, he explains, “I would get my hand cut on glass, cut here, cut there, all bleeding.”
Mr Kadir has framed all sorts of knick knacks, from Ming dynasty replicas to Nyonya beaded sandals. He claims there is no secret to frame making, but expertly recommends a medium tone wooden frame with a thin gold line for the chinese calligraphy scroll I brought.
As talk turns to life at the Siglap flats, a glimmer of nostalgia enters Mr Kadir’s voice.
“All the ground floor shop owners were friends,” Mr Kadir reminisces. “Dr Wong, his clinic was just beside my shop, so he actually helped me to get many customers. Whenever people visit him, they would see there’s a frame shop next door and come in to enquire.”
“When I had to move out, I felt, how to say,” Mr Kadir ponders, searching for the appropriate word. “Uneasy, I felt uneasy.”
I ask if he still keeps up with the other folk, but he shakes his head, telling me that they all lost contact. “Every now and then, I’ll hear that someone passed away,” he says softly. “Like that la, old already.”
One friend, however, made the move to Siglap Centre with him, setting up a salon in the basement of the creaking building.
Always sporting a hat of some sort, Uncle Sam, as he is affectionately known by his customers, is an unmistakable sight at the salon. Picking up the tricks of the trade from his father at the tender age of 18, the exposure sparked off a journey that would see Uncle Sam move from salon to salon to garner experience, before finally opening Siglap 5 as his own.
He readily offers an explanation for his shop’s name, pointing to a framed poster of a Malay band.
“My friend’s band back in the day was called Siglap 5 and I really liked their music,” he says.
Stepping foot into his salon is akin to taking a trip back in time, with walls peppered by retro looking posters of local bands from the 60s and old school barber tools strewn over the counters. He even has a sleek, black electric guitar hanging on the wall, a relic of his distant musical past. “Now my hands cannot press the chords la,” says Uncle Sam.
In fact, Uncle Sam used to belong to a band, but he abashedly brushes me off when I ask about their songs, insisting that it was merely for fun. “It’s just for the photo,” he humorously quips when I point out his guitar wielding self in the faded print.
A constant stream of customers flow in and out of his shop, “How are you”s and smatterings of Malay echoing throughout the basement. Experienced folk help themselves to plastic stools stacked by the side, and sit by the corridor waiting for their turn on the black leather chair. The tune of Seruling Anak Gembala, one of his favourite tracks, reverberates as he nimbly works scissor and razor.
Malay tunes are swapped out for cartoons on his iPad when little Nicholas gets his hair cut. Uncle Sam personally hoists the young boy up on the barber chair, and confidently snips away. I ask Nathaniel, his older brother (who has been narrating an adventure from The Land of Stories to me), why he likes coming to Uncle Sam.
“Because …” he says shyly, “he gives me sweets!”
I wonder how the move to Siglap Centre has been for them.
“Totally different,” says Mr Kadir as he shakes his head, forlorn. “Last time, I can just go out under the big tree and sit at the chess table outside, chit chat. Now here I feel so cramped,” he adds, gesturing dispiritedly at the tiny corner his shop now occupies.
In a bid to reminisce about old times, we cross the street to walk along the foregone pathways of the Siglap flats. The faded storefronts bear testament to the life that once existed, an ode to the hair salon and the photo studio, the coffee shop and the violin store. The banter flows naturally between the two, with Mr Kadir impishly dishing out a schoolboy refrain of I don’t want to sit near him when I ask them to pose for a photo together.
On our evening stroll, we discover one of the doors left ajar, and cautiously peer in. I am beyond myself with curiosity, but the two of them are nonchalant.
“This one the owner pass away already,” Uncle Sam says. Surprised, I ask how he knows, to which Mr Kadir interjects, “This fellow knows everyone here!”
When asked about the kampung spirit, the pair enthusiastically gush about the good old days, voices overlapping one another as they speak. The kampung spirit has always been a rather elusive concept to me, a distant mantra rather than a lived experience, an elevated synonym for courtesy and awkward neighbourly bonding.
“Kampung spirit is real, you not part of kampung you don’t know,” Uncle Sam chides. “Last time 5km down the road, whose son whose brother I also know.”
“Next to my shop, there was this auntie selling joss sticks and traditional Chinese items,” Mr Kadir said. “She would always help to jaga my shop when I need to go out, and when customers come she will help me to tell them to wait. After the work day finishes, she’ll always tell me to go home safely, I always remember that.”
We hear of a neighbourhood’s demise all the time. A season ends, shops shutter up, residents move on. In my own homeground of the Siglap-Katong area, storefronts are always changing rapidly, with new tenants swiftly occupying jilted spaces in hopes of a different fortune. With the kaleidoscopic changes come an amnesia that seeps in unconsciously, often climaxing in the shuddering realization that we no longer remember what previously occupied the space where the shiny new cafe now sits. While I welcome the plethora of coffee options now bestowed upon us east siders, I cannot help but feel a pang of worry about the creeping homogeneity slowly encroaching neighbourhoods like Katong. It is the relentless tug of war, the tension between preserving a slice of old history and welcoming a new chapter of modern development.
There has always been a tint of artifice to nostalgia, a lament for the bygone days seen through rose tinted lenses. We clamour for second hand bookstores to stay open even though we rarely patronize them. Or bemoan the loss of kampungs we have never set foot in. Yet, there exists a group of people who are well justified to lament, a community for whom the treasure trove of memories does not simply exist as a caricature. Places breed relationships, and the relationships fostered at Siglap flats are real to both Uncle Sam and Mr Kadir.
In Tan Pin Pin’s film In Time to Come, the fanfare accorded to stately milestones is contrasted with the ordinary, quotidian moments often swallowed by the headstrong rush toward productivity. The glittering sea of camera flashes anxious to capture the opening ceremony of the Downtown Line is contrasted with a mundane shot of commuters sprawled on the train, a subtle critique on our biased curation of what is “worth remembering”.
The film goes on to chronicle the exhuming of a time capsule from the past, and a making of a time capsule for the future, where the objects both uncovered and prepared are ironically the inconsequential—a telephone book filled with obsolete addresses, a life jacket peppered with unidentifiable signatures. It is regrettable that when in preservation, focus is given to the ordinary, yet in present life one remains shockingly unconcerned about the commonplace.
Thankfully, the excavation of a place is rarely sufficient to uproot the totality of memory, as Mr Kadir and Uncle Sam have so proven.
“Of course sad,” says Mr Kadir when asked about how he feels now, but then adds, “so that’s why you must give me the photos you take.”
“You must be happy when you’re cutting hair,” Uncle Sam chirps, “cannot be unhappy.”

So, What Do Retired Grandparents Get Up to in a Day?",Jessica Heng,FALSE,TRUE
Inside Singapore’s Thriving Black Market: Is It Time To Rethink The Vape Ban?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-inside-singapores-thriving-black-market/,24-Jun-21,"Have you walked through a cloud of sweet smelling, fast dissolving smoke lately? At this point, I’d bet that you have. It’s no secret that vaporisers and e-cigarettes are prevalent in Singapore. Their presence has been discussed ad nauseum in mainstream media outlets. From cautionary tales penned by health experts to school teachers who are concerned for the wellbeing of the Singaporean youth. The consensus (from the media at least) is that vaping is scary and bad.
There are a few reasons cited by the well intended fear mongers: unstudied long-term health effects, dubious marketing materials aimed at teens, and vape related fatalities overseas. It seems all parties can agree that vaping is rife in Singapore. What goes unremarked upon, though, is the immediate health threat that unregulated black market products pose to the public.
A Thriving Black Market
Channel News Asia reported that there is a plethora of digital avenues to access illegal vaping devices and accessories. In fact, if one knows where to look, it isn’t hard to find them at all. Sellers mostly hawk their wares on Telegram (which has end-to-end encryption), but listings for vape products have popped up on Carousell, Lazada, and Shopee too. Non-encrypted technologies and online public marketplaces are easier to police, and in 2020, the HSA collaborated with social media platforms to remove over 2,000 of these listings.
What exactly is the scale of the black market, though? CNA mentioned there were several groups with up to 10,000 members, which RICE has verified in our own investigation. At press time, some groups have grown closer to 20,000 members. Inside these group chats, new listings and offers are posted every second. Clearly, the removal of listings by HSA (presumably off non-encrypted platforms) has not significantly dented the black market activity on Telegram and WhatsApp.
It’s hard to describe the scale of the black market without getting into specifics on what’s available, but here’s a non-exhaustive list of what can be found on Telegram: DIY vaporiser tanks, reusable coils, disposable (one use) vapes, a home delivery service which refills the disposable (one use) vapes, reusable vape devices with nicotine salt cartridges, cartridges from established overseas brands, cartridges from dubious brands, e-juice in any flavor you can imagine, chargers, and bundles with combinations of any of the above.
Because the market is overflowing with suppliers, pricing has gotten competitive. From our own research, we’ve witnessed a significant drop in cost over the last six months. When the market was nascent, a pack of vape pods cost close to $30. Now that the pool of suppliers has expanded, the same amount goes for >$25. Due to market growth, sellers are upping their CX. One can pay extra for same day delivery, or fetch a discount by self-collecting an order from a pick up point.
The bootleg products seem to be arriving on all fronts. In October of last year, more than 5,000 vaporisers & paraphernalia were intercepted at Tuas Checkpoint by ICA. Despite the border closures, products seem to be making their way through to Singapore in Malaysian – registered lorries. On the same day as the Tuas Checkpoint seizure, there was another catch of 24,000 vape products at the Changi Airfreight Centre.

Black markets thrive when consumer demand overlaps with hard regulation. In the past five years, the e-cigarette industry has exploded with popularity. Globally, the industry is expected to have a valuation of USD $45,000,000,000 by 2026. Singapore is not immune to global trends, and this is clear through the thriving black market.
In 2018, local authorities quickly clamped down on the sale and use of e-vapourisers in Singapore. A lack of clinical research and some unexplained vape related fatalities were cited. However, for Singapore, it might be worth considering regulation at this juncture instead of only doubling down on the outright ban.
There are a few reasons which justify regulation at this point: firstly, the scientific evidence has advanced tremendously in the past three years. It has since come to light that the vape-related fatalities cited by the authorities as a reason for prohibition, were induced by toxic levels of Vitamin E and THC in unregulated black market products. In fact, current medical science indicates that while it’s not harmless, vaping is almost certainly healthier than smoking. In the United Kingdom, the PHE has identified e-vapourisers as a safe and key component of their national tobacco cessation strategy.

Another concern which would be solved by regulation: Youth access to e-vapourisers. Implementing appropriate taxes, enabling oversight by local health authorities, and designating specific points of sale, would help deter young people from participating. Regulation would also make a dent in the black market and reduce supply, which is where young people have the most immediate access, anyway.
Ironically, Amrin Amin (Secretary for Health and Home Affairs) made this point while using the tobacco industry as an example. “The banning of cigarettes, given the existing pool of smokers, will give rise to black markets and increase the flow of smuggled cigarettes into Singapore.” The same logic can be applied to the local vape black market as well: The banning of vaporisers, given the existing pool of vape users, has given rise to black markets and increased the flow of smuggled vape products into Singapore.
The final reason why the black market continues to thrive is the lack of harsher punishments for offenders. Illicit vapes are not treated with the same severity as Class A drugs. Perhaps, this is because the market is hard to trace. On end-to-end encrypted services, it’s near impossible to surveil offenders, and much harder to prosecute. The vast majority of the black market operates on Telegram, and the reported offenders who have been fined were caught selling on non-encrypted platforms like Carousell, Lazada, and Instagram. Though there are hefty fines for repeat offenders, those charged with first time possession are typically fined $500 and jail time is rarely handed down for either offence.
What Are The Health Risks On The Black Market?
In the absence of regulation, the black market is run by anonymous sellers who stock a wide variety of products. In our investigation, we found the most commonly available products are created by a mammoth Chinese e-cigarette manufacturer. According to our research, the laboratories of this Chinese manufacturer have a stringent, 18 step quality control process. The company invests millions of dollars into R&D, while engaging medical experts and scientists to manufacture products which are safe for use.

When the Chinese products are purchased from a verified source, they are labeled with QR codes which inform the user where the product was manufactured. This includes batch numbers and expiration dates. However, these safety measures undertaken by the company are flattened on the unregulated black market.
If the consumer has never encountered a legitimate product before, realistically, how can one deduce whether it is counterfeit or not? Copycat devices and accessories of this Chinese brand are rife in the Telegram chats. To the untrained eye, tell-tale signs of a counterfeit are tricky to spot. Moreover, the majority of copycat products are compatible with the legitimate devices, which further complicates the buyer’s discernment.
In April 2020, the Chinese manufacturer conducted an investigation into the contents of counterfeit pods. The results were concerning. Nicotine percentages were 58% higher than the advertised 5%, and the levels of Toluene (which can cause central nervous system depression and arrhythmias) were concerningly high. In their report, the Chinese manufacturer included pictures of the dangerous counterfeit products. Are these counterfeits circulating in Singapore as well? Without a ‘safe’ standard to refer back to from regulation, it’s impossible to tell.
Is There A Path Towards Regulation In Singapore?
We spoke with Sean Ang—a community pharmacist and smoking cessation counsellor to gain a better understanding of how Singapore could proceed with e-cigarette regulation. From his perspective, even if e-vapourisers were legalised, “it would likely be used as a prescribed cessation tool’’ as this approach “requires medical testing, to ensure that the products are consistently effective.”
Mr. Ang further noted that local health authorities are hesitant to normalise addiction. “Take smoking for example. If cigarettes were banned tomorrow, there would be riots. It’s hard to get the public to abstain from something which has been normalized. In my opinion, shisha was banned for this reason, so that it wouldn’t become normalised.”

When we asked about regulation for commercial use, Mr. Ang believed this was a pipe dream. “Because the medical literature on vaporisers (even as a cessation tool) is nascent, if they allowed it now and discovered down the line that it was extremely harmful, then decided to impose a ban—it would be tough to get people to stop.”
Mr. Ang went on to comment on the lack of urgency on this matter, despite the expanding black market. “Nicotine addiction is not a pressing issue. We have fairly low rates of smokers, which is why our cessation efforts are no longer excessive. I think the black market problem extends beyond the e-vapourisers. Look at it this way: no matter the price of an illicit activity, there’s always demand.”
To play devil’s advocate, RICE mentioned to Mr. Ang that Singapore could tackle the problem of e-vapourisers with a harm reduction approach. The principles of this public health ideology respects the autonomy of the substance user, and works to facilitate safe substance use instead of imposing harsh restrictions, which drives the user to the black market. Though it sounds straightforward and utopian, Mr. Ang rebutted that this notion is incongruent with Singapore’s hard-line stance on substance abuse in general. It’s also a contradiction to the extensive efforts which the HPB have taken to install nationwide cessation programs. However, this doesn’t mean that it’s not worth considering, given the health risks posed by the widespread sale of black market products.
Ultimately, the discourse on e-cigarettes strikes at the central conflict of policy makers in Singapore. Is it possible to be progressive and pragmatic? If not, what takes precedence? If we continue to de-normalise and ban vape use, we will expose nicotine users (close to 3% of our population) to black market products which carry substantial health risks. On the other hand, it’s worth considering if a more enlightened approach can be adopted, to regulate e-cigarettes as we already do with cigarettes, minimising black market risks and ascribing accountability to stakeholders.

A Journey Through The Only HDB Estate In Siglap, The Lesser-known Dakota Crescent",RICE STAFF,FALSE,TRUE
"So, What Do Retired Grandparents Get Up to in a Day?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-people-retired-grandparents-get-up-to-in-a-day/,25-Jun-21,"All images by the authors.
Lives begin at different starting points. The more financially assured are symbolic of hares — folks with a better head start in life. On the flip side, most average Singaporeans (like the writers of this story) are born tortoises — we hustle steadily and slowly save to get through the much-dreaded #adulting. Depending on one’s circumstances and family history, resources—and in turn, lifestyles—can greatly differ.
In the classic tale of The Tortoise and The Hare, the biggest lesson is about the consequence of complacency. Tortoise, hare, or human, no one comes out on top from getting lulled into sleepy comfort and contentedness.
The same can be said about building capital for retirement and beyond. Stay complacent enough about the amount of savings you have, and everything could be wiped out on a rainy day. That leaves little money for oneself, much less money for the next of kin. In other words, don’t be foolish enough not to plan for the future.
We speak to two grandmothers in divergent circumstances to see how their senior years turned out in the end.
All the Money in the World
Written through the perspective of Ilyas.
The first thing that Madam Saleha asked me after I salam her (that Malay ritual where you kiss the hands of your elders) is if I wanted to order some Thai food on Grab. She insisted on the cash-on-delivery option, wanting to pay for the pineapple fried rice, mango salad, minced beef with basil, and other items that amounted to nearly $80.
Too late. Her granddaughter refused to let the 79-year-old retiree dole out a single cent and had already tapped the order button with the payment charged to her card. It’s a pretty standard scene that plays out among Malay families: the younger kin refusing to let their elders pay when it comes to meals.
“Hehe, thank you!” the septuagenarian eventually relented, settling back into her armchair, holding a wad of $50 notes in her hand—the cash that her granddaughter just gave as a monthly allowance. Filial piety and all that jazz.
Saleha isn’t her real name though; she requested to keep her identity anonymous. What I can tell you is that she and her husband have been together for 60 years. I can tell you that they both live with their daughter, son-in-law, four grandchildren, domestic helper, and a bunch of cats in a capacious HDB apartment in Pasir Ris.
l can also tell you that the cupboard where she stores her baju butterfly is the same place where she has $12,000 in cash squirrelled away. That’s about a thousand times more than what she had in her bank account when she got married at 19 years of age.
“I wanted to climb out of that situation,” she recalled about the days with little to her name, pledging to hustle hard to build a family.
And hustle she did. Like most people in Singapore’s pioneer generation, Mdm Saleha took on a multitude of jobs—any jobs—to sustain her family. While her husband went into education and shipping, she climbed her way into managerial roles in logistics, catering and hospitality.
She forgets how much she earned in those jobs (“So long ago, how to remember!”) but it was substantial enough for her to start investing and buying up multiple properties in Singapore, Malaysia and Jakarta. Honestly, it’s impressive. And they’ve all provided a sweet return on investment, though she hesitates to reveal just how much she racked up.
“I just managed to do it,” she says with more than a twinkle in her eye.
Putting the hows aside, I asked her about the whys. The sparkle in her eye turned watery. All that hustling, all that strategic asset planning—it was always for the kids; their two daughters who grew up in comfortable environments and now have families of their own.
These days though, she has given it all up to live a simple life with her daughter and grandchildren. Surprisingly, as someone with hundreds of thousands of dollars stored in her accounts after cashing in on her investments and properties, Mdm Saleha and her husband live modestly. They share a double bed in a spartan room with a small television. Medication, pills and supplements are tucked away on a small table. Their daily routines revolve around playing with their young grandkids, short walks around the neighbourhood and watching whatever’s on the telly.
There’s a reason behind living frugally — all the wealth that she built could be undone without thoughtful planning or lifestyle adjustments on her end. As we tucked into our desserts, it’s clear that they’ve never fancied the high life. Macaroons, panna cottas and parfaits? Nah, just chendol and some durian for them, thanks.
Perhaps it’s this hardline principle towards prudence that enabled her to accumulate assets so easily. To Mdm Saleha, money is no issue at all. There’s the occasional splurge to go on holidays overseas during The Before Time, but that’s pretty much it. Otherwise, the money stays in her bank account (and her cupboard) to stretch out as long as possible throughout retirement.
As confident as this grandmother was in her savings—she’s got more money to her name than the funds of both her daughters combined, she reckoned—there’s always the danger of having it all obliterated by unexpected financial burdens. Leaving little to pass on to her children and grandchildren.
I have to admit, I struggled to even broach the subject of legacy planning, the financial strategy to bequeath assets and wealth to the next of kin after death. Culturally, it’s just not good etiquette to talk about death—much less post-death affairs—with an elder.
After some poor attempts to dance around the subject, she gets the hint.
“I haven’t really planned anything, to be honest. I trust my daughters to split my assets equally because I raised them to be sensible people,” she affirmed. In the hustle to snowball enough funds for a decent livelihood for the family, the official affairs of her wealth after going beyond the veil had not mattered that much to her.
But it does matter, I brought up. Tailoring exactly how she would like to distribute her assets would at least give her peace of mind about how her kids and grandkids will carry on. If she has the capacity to plan things out, why not?
She laughed it off. For Mdm Saleha, there was never a doubt that her daughters and their families will get along just fine even without her help. Like her, they’ve learned to be fiercely independent women who aren’t dependent on anyone else but themselves.
She does know, however, that her middle-aged kids will end up inheriting a substantial amount that’ll ensure they continue living in comfort for the rest of their lives.
Leaving the HDB flat with a sense of admiration (and more than a tinge of envy) over her nonchalant frame of mind towards wealth and assets, I wonder what the thought process is like for other retirees who aren’t as privileged.
Last in Priority: A Frugal Approach to Modest Living
Written through the perspective of Eve.
Nothing means more to Mdm Sally Chan than her family. At 73, she continues to be a selfless giver.
As I entered her 1-room rental flat, it wasn’t so much the tight quarters that caught my eye. Neither was it the quirky decorations that colour the interiors. Rather, it was the word ‘love’ that marked Mdm Chan’s otherwise plain t-shirt. It is perhaps the most accurate term one can use to describe her.
A stack of daily newspapers to be shared with her neighbours.
If I were to track Mdm Chan’s career path, it’d be a long list of odd jobs. There were so many that she could barely recall them all.
Since her twenties, she had worked as a babysitter, packer at the wet market, mixed rice stall helper, chicken rice seller, office cleaner and quality control inspector at a factory.
Some of these were part-time jobs that paid $40 a day; others were monthly gigs that provided a couple of hundreds. The highest was a contract job which offered approximately $1,300 a month.
As a divorcee and single mother raising two young children back then, Mdm Chan exclusively picked jobs that required little travel time. They had to be flexible enough so that she could still keep a watchful eye on her children.
The hustle life plopped her into a busy, recognisable routine: Work hard. Money in, money out.
Despite having little to spare, Mdm Chan made it a point to allocate a portion of her earnings into a bank account. Never mind that those savings got wiped out when her son needed it for school. Never mind that she had to give up her dream of living in a 5-room HDB flat with a balcony.
Having sold her first house after the divorce, Mdm Chan had to live with her daughter for a period of time before moving to her current rental flat.
Her daughter, also a divorcee, was busy earning dough for her family and had little time to care for the kids. Mdm Chan then quit her job, stepping in to care for her grandchildren as a paid caregiver.
Retirement only began at 66, when the family’s financial situation stabilised. Life is a lot less hectic these days. Every day, she wakes up at 7AM to prepare breakfast, before walking to a coffee shop to buy lunch around 12PM. She then cares for her plants, does some housekeeping and watches TV before preparing dinner.
At times, medical ailments like knee joint pains arise. Doctors have made in-house visits, while social workers check in occasionally. There are trips to the grocery store too, but that wraps up her daily routine.
The plan was to stay for dinner. Rather than opting for food delivery options, Mdm Chan insisted on a hearty home cooked meal. We weaved through the tight walkway, chatting as she turned her attention to boiling soup in the kitchen. Through it all, a loud Hokkien tune played on the radio.
Discussions about death may be disconcerting and even morbid for many. When prompted for her thoughts on the topic, she remarked: “Aiyo, What’s so scary about death? We all die one day.”
When people spend their most productive years fulfilling familial responsibilities, this causes them to neglect their own retirement and savings. In wanting to provide for her loved ones, Mdm Chan has left little for herself. She was never a top priority.
While Mdm Chan is content with living a modest life, she sometimes worries about her dependents; and wonders if they’ll get along fine in the future after she passes on.
“I don’t have much to give them, and I’m lucky that they have stable incomes. But worrying has always been part of my nature. Good thing I’m healthy. At least for now, ” she laughs.
Silence descended momentarily, and there seemed to be a collective tenderness between us. Even in the absence of words, I knew that the situation would be vastly different if a serious illness ever came knocking on the door.
With limited stovetops, pots are sometimes placed on the floor.
Coming from the pioneer generation, she depends on a small allowance from the government and some pocket money from her children. These quickly go into her monthly rent and daily expenses, leaving little to spare for other luxurious wants. She rarely pampers herself with anything — no annual vacations, branded handbags, fancy high tea sessions, or anything of that sort.
As we sat down for dinner, Mdm Chan acknowledged that she’s considered fortunate despite having little left for retirement. In fact, some elderly have it worse. Others may be in a similar financial predicament, but with the added adversity of being sickly and no family members to rely on. With no safety net, retiring comfortably would be the last thing on their minds.
Over the course of my stay, I noticed how one neighbour casually stepped in the house twice — first to collect some leftover red bean soup; second to distribute some rice dumplings. I get the sense that social ties are thicker here than in wealthier, more affluent neighbourhoods — there seemed to be an unspoken, mutual dependence between the old folks.
Retirement planning is akin to winemaking — the process is slow and requires a long term view. The finished product, however, will be well worth the wait. Surely, not every person gets the luxury to plan ahead, like in the case of Mdm Chan. But oftentimes, it is lack of foresight that holds many back from going forth with an official long-term strategy such as legacy planning, like in the case of Mdm Saleha.
7PM arrived in a blink of an eye. It was two hours before her bedtime; a cue for me to head off.
She catches my eye and smiles. A genuine, kind smile.
“To be honest, I don’t have great advice for young people, except that if you have the ability to save or plan ahead, then do that. These are habits that I believe should be imparted from a young age. I tell that to my grandchildren too.”
“If you have $1, spend 70 cents and keep the rest. You’ll be surprised by how these things add up.”
Who doesn’t wish for a comfortable life after slogging for years? With so much to consider (and life getting in the way), planning for retirement and beyond can get overwhelming. But in dreaming about the life we envision, not all of us are actively thinking about ways to make it a reality. Ironically, we could end up being our own villains by holding ourselves back from the life we seek. Take it from the grandparents then: live old, plan young.

Struggling To Keep The Flame Alive: A Collection Of Wild Pandemic Dating Stories,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-wild-pandemic-dating-stories/,26-Jun-21,"Since last year, our social lives have been largely shaped by social distancing restrictions. We went from complete lockdown to being able to meet in groups of five, then eight, then back to five, then to two, and now five again. But since the Circuit Breaker, and even when rules were at their strictest, at least two people have been allowed to meet. With this, dating has been one of the main forms of social interaction for single Singaporeans trying to keep some excitement in their lives.
Globally, apps like Tinder, Bumble, and OkCupid have seen the highest numbers of swipes on their apps since the pandemic started. And in Singapore, unconventional means of dating have increased in popularity as well. Websites like Maybe.sg, that offer girlfriend experiences, have seen a surge in client sign ups. And similarly, Sugar Baby dating websites have seen user traffic skyrocket throughout the pandemic.
But with increased dating also comes a higher chance of finding oneself in a sticky or unpleasant situation. We were not disappointed when we asked our readers and friends for their worst pandemic dating stories, so here’s a select few you to make you feel better about your own life as a single in a global crisis:
The Married Man

When I matched Alex on Bumble, he was serving his quarantine in a hotel after returning from a trip abroad. Our conversations were flowing smoothly, so I continued chatting with him until he got out.
On our first date after his quarantine, he told me that the name on his profile was fake, and that I should call him Deryl instead. I didn’t think much of it at the time, so I started calling him that name from that point on. A few days later, we had another date at a park, after which we headed over to his apartment where I spent the night.
Just as I thought things were starting to pick up, he called me to say that he had to go to Indonesia for work and would be uncontactable for a few weeks.
At first I didn’t think much of it, until I saw him out on a date with another woman in town. When he saw me, he came up to me and told me he was having a work meeting—I didn’t believe this as it clearly looked otherwise. Then, he disappeared again for another week.
I got suspicious at this point so I Googled him, and I was horrified to find out he was married. I stalked his social media accounts, his wife’s profile, and even a website they had made together for their wedding photos.
I immediately unmatched him on Bumble and deleted all our texts, but I soon found out he had made a new profile. I felt vengeful, so I agreed to meet him again just so I could collect evidence.
After a few more dates, I wrote out the entire story and sent it to his wife via email. She’s heartbroken and in disbelief, but I think she believes that I have no reason to lie to her.
The Rude Girl

I broke up with my ex a few months ago, and have started feeling really lonely since. I decided to give Tinder a shot, and to my surprise, I matched with a girl I thought was really sweet. This was my first time online dating ever.
After chatting on Tinder for a couple of days, I asked her if she wanted to watch a movie together. She agreed, and we met up.
At this time I was a fresh PES E recruit in the army, which I had mentioned to her previously. While we were walking to the dinner spot we decided on, she asked me why I wasn’t fit. “You’re kind of fat,” she said. The irony was that she didn’t exactly look like her profile pictures either, but I didn’t think it would be right to call her out on that. Instead, I laughed it off and explained yet again that I didn’t actually have any combat activities where I was stationed.
At dinner, she started asking about my siblings, what they do, and how old they are. I was suspicious but I went ahead and told her that all three of them were in high paying roles, like healthcare or law.
Her immediate response was to ask me why I fell off the wagon and why I wasn’t as successful as them. At this point, all I wanted was to get the hell out of there. I pushed through with the date, left, and never saw her again. I haven’t been on online dating apps since.
The Foursome
I went on a date with a guy from Tinder to get drinks, and I texted my best friend to let her know the location as a safety precaution. She planned to grab a drink nearby in case things went south and I needed her.
An hour into my date with this guy I realised we weren’t clicking, so I suggested I invite my friend over. So I did, and a few more drinks later, I asked my date if he had anyone to introduce to my friend. He proceeded to show us a photo of his roommate, who she liked. We took a cab and went over to their place for more drinks.
While their flat was gross, we decided to stay for a few drinks because the guys were hilarious. At one point I left to get water and when I came back my friend was kissing the roommate on his bed. My date looked at me sitting on his bed and said, “well are you going to leave me hanging?”
So I went to him and we started kissing. I didn’t think things would develop with all of us in the same room, but they did. They started having sex, and so did we. Eventually, we started sharing the same bed then sharing each other.
Afterwards, I begged my best friend to come sleep at mine because my parents are really strict and I didn’t want to get scolded.
In the cab my friend said “I can’t believe we just had a foursome,” which of course caught the attention of the driver. He continued to closely listen to every word of our very detailed recount. Upon reaching my block, he very blatantly turned around to say bye to us so he could get a good look at our faces.
Overall it was gross, funny, and fun.
The Love That Got Deported

I’ve been single for years so I’m a serial dater. My friends even call me the dating queen because I refuse to give up on the search for love. While I have ramped up my dating efforts in the last year, I can’t say it has been successful yet.
At the end of last year, I started talking to a guy on a dating app. We really got along so we eventually moved over to calling each other, and we continued to speak for over a month. When we finally decided to meet up, he dropped the bomb on me that he was actually living in Malaysia.
At that point I was in too deep, so I decided to keep the conversation going with him. Sure enough, he eventually made it back into Singapore. The excitement didn’t last long, as on our first date, I realised he was a massive fuckboy. A few dates later I had been reduced to becoming his booty call before he eventually ghosted me.
Back on the dating apps, I started talking to a new guy and we were really getting along. We went on a few dates and we started getting closer. I saw a future with him, but soon after we met he got himself in a legal situation to do with COVID restrictions.
I was hoping for the best, but the worst actually happened—he got deported. I was heartbroken and upset. Dating in a pandemic is hard enough as it is. I was so frustrated when I finally found a decent partner and he was forced to leave.
Now, I’ve just accepted that maybe I should be single for a while. As my friends say, love always comes when you least expect it. So here I am now, away from the apps, with zero expectations.

"Until Our Politicians Talk About Race More Meaningfully, This Conversation Isn’t Going Anywhere",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-politicians-responses-to-racism/,26-Jun-21,"Top image: Screencap/Mediacorp
– Although our politicians have always condemned racism, they have hesitated to discuss it in substantive or meaningful ways. This silence at the top has not kept pace with how conversation on the ground is evolving.
– Focusing only on obvious examples of racism limits progress, and avoids responsibility for how these outcomes are the result of political or policy choices.
– Nonetheless, recent shifts in how our leaders talk about race point to opportunities for change. We explore how the different political parties in Parliament might achieve this.
If there was a playbook for how our politicians respond to racism, it would go something like this:
Condemn racism while recognising its continual threat. Affirm the public space as one for all Singaporeans. Cite the pledge. Appeal for mutual respect and understanding. End off with something along the lines of “racial harmony is a work in progress, but we can always do more”.
Minister Lawrence Wong’s speech at the IPS/RSIS conference on Friday followed this template, but with several noteworthy additions. In it, he called on Singaporeans to recognise that minorities face difficulties ‘in all aspects of daily life’, and spoke of the ‘real hurt’ that discrimination can cause. Significantly, he stated that we should be “upfront and honest about the racialised experiences various groups feel’ and ‘begin civilised discussions’, grounded in empathy, good faith, and a willingness to listen to all.
It’s a thoughtful and earnest speech, and a step in the right direction. Nonetheless, one can’t help but notice that at the state level, several of the biggest and most controversial incidents of the last two years—the ePay mess, the investigation of Raeesah Khan, and most recently, the PA/Sarah Bagharib debacle—yielded scant progress in how we talk about race.
Rather than fruitful discussion, it is more common for a news-making incident to end in police reports and ‘missed opportunities for dialogue’. For the most part, the developments in conversation on the ground —or appetite for this—have not been matched by our leaders.
No politician has denied that racism exists here, or portrayed it as anything less than unacceptable and dangerous. However, this is often softened with qualifiers that the vast majority of Singaporeans are not racist, that racism exists in every country, and at least it’s not as bad here as it is elsewhere—the race equivalent of ‘not all men’, if you will.
Earlier this month, I argued that the Dave Parkash incident exposed some double-standards in how we think about racism. We can observe a similar divide at the state level, where politicians leap to denounce racism, but hesitate to weigh in more meaningfully.
Tan Boon Lee’s harassment drew unanimous censure, with all three parties in Parliament citing a zero-tolerance stance towards racism. However, few examined the notion of ‘preference’ in interracial unions, and whether such views are acceptable today.
While there was agreement that the PA was wrong to use Sarah Bagharib’s photos without her consent, politicians side-stepped the question of whether the affair was racist or merely ‘culturally insensitive’. Notably, MPs from the PAP and WP declined to comment on the incident when approached by TODAY.
It’s fine that there’s no public consensus on how to define racism—our understanding of the concept is still evolving. The problem is that almost no politician dares to push these boundaries.
With a handful of exceptions, few politicians have dared to go beyond the obvious, and examine racism as outcome- rather than intention-focused, systemic, or explore how it intersects with class and other social determinants.
Source: Census 2020
This goes beyond interracial marriage and squabbles over ‘cooking smells’. Questioning the financial outcomes of HDB’s Ethnic Integration Policy, for example, remains a minefield, as does exploring links between socioeconomic factors and racial disparities in health outcomes, or income gaps. The recently released 2020 census showed that the average household income of Malay families is the lowest of all ethnic groups, which has not changed since 2010.
The thing is that the government has long recognised that disparities exist, and taken some steps to look into these. Most recently, in the last couple of months, workgroups were set up to explore health outcomes in minority groups and to boost home ownership amongst Malay families.
These would have been valuable conversation starters on the material aspects of racism. Working towards solutions is important, but implicitly recognising that a problem exists is not the same as ‘being upfront and honest’ about it. Skipping this just looks like avoidance.
Nonetheless, in the last couple of months, there has been a subtle shift in how racism is framed.
Minister Wong’s speech is the latest example, but Minister Shanmugam’s comments following the Dave Parkash incident raised some eyebrows. In a longer post on cohesion, President Halimah reflected:
Such displays are so hurtful because we thought that we had done so much to protect our cohesion until we are shaken from our belief … We wonder whether these are one-off incidents or reflective of a larger problem.
Despite this, there has been little acknowledgement of the accounts of everyday racism flooding social media. While these were referenced in Minister Wong’s speech, and younger politicians, like the PAP’s Nadia Samdin, WP’s Nicole Seah, and Jess Chua, leader of the PSP’s Youth Wing, have posted statements on social media, many more have remained silent.
It’s understandable why no one wants to open Pandora’s box. Racial and religious harmony are the most out-of-bounds of the OB markers. Nobody wants to be accused of playing identity politics, grandstanding, stoking ‘culture wars’, or risk alienating voters.
Ultimately, however, the milquetoast ‘we must do better’ comments enable self-preservation. If the focus remains on incidents of obvious malice, this allows deeper questions about racism to go avoided and unanswered.
Probing further entails recognising that outcomes are the result of choices. It also raises expectations about when these choices will be reviewed, and who will be responsible for this.

Here, the PAP’s history works against them: as the ruling party since independence, they shoulder the most responsibility going forward.
As a start, they will need to introspect on, and acknowledge, Lee Kuan Yew’s troubling views on race and eugenics as well as past comments by its MPs. They will need to examine how portrayals of race in their communications can be less one-dimensional, including guarding against stereotypes about the ‘Malay problem’.
More significantly, where evidence points to racial inequalities (such as in housing, educational outcomes, and income), nuanced and thorough reviews should be conducted. As the dominant party, many of the gateway actions to doing this—such as making more race-based data publicly accessible—rest with them.
None of this needs to amount to fuelling tribalism or pretending race doesn’t exist.
For example, Minister Wong is right to say that Chinese privilege can’t be addressed without involving generations still aggrieved by the loss of Chinese-medium schools and dialect erasure (decisions which, it must be noted, were the result of government policy). But what if reviewing SAP schools was framed as increasing educational access for non-Chinese students, rather than attacking Chinese-ness? Or the EIP about mitigating inequality, rather than a premature rush towards race-blindness?
Opposition parties might have limited decision-making power, but they are neither blameless nor helpless. Chiefly, they need to not only condemn racism, but acknowledge their culpability in allowing it to fester.
As a party, while the PSP has come out multiple times to denounce racism and xenophobia, it has not acknowledged how its supporters’ enthusiasm for reviewing CECA often shades into these, or attempted to rein them in. Nor has it addressed how its own politicians’ remarks sometimes veer into dog-whistle territory, like Leong Mun Wai’s hand-wringing over hawker centres serving ‘more and more foreign food’, or ‘recouping’ Singaporean rice bowls from foreign PMETs.
Comments on recent Facebook posts by Leong Mun Wai ahead of the upcoming debate on CECA and foreign employment.
This has to stop. Letting mutters about ‘CECA personnel’ pass unchecked is only a few rungs down from Nigel Farage’s legitimising of ethno-nationalism—the kind that started with ‘British jobs for British workers’ and ended in minorities being told to ‘go back where you came from’ post-Brexit.
(For that matter, the PAP is equally guilty of ignoring the politicking carried out by groups like Fabrications About the PAP. Despite all the talk of mutual respect, I have not seen one politician publicly call out Shamsul Kamar.)
The WP, meanwhile, has been ultra-cautious about stepping up to the discussion. While several of its members have made statements on social media, and Raeesah Khan recently asked several Parliamentary questions about racism in schools, the party has said nothing groundbreaking since Sylvia Lim’s speech on a post-racial society last September.
The proposals in that speech, which argued for a review of the CMIO model, the EIP, and community self-help groups, amongst others, should be revisited. After all, their GE2020 campaign was based on the checks-and-balances pitch; this is the standard they will be judged by.

This dynamic is hardly unique to Singapore. Worldwide, political willingness to move on controversial issues is often dictated by the public mood. Politicians don’t usually take a stand until it becomes more disadvantageous to keep quiet than speak up.
All the same, the issue is gaining momentum, and by waiting too long to say anything meaningful, everyone stands to lose: the PAP’s potential for a rebrand, Opposition parties who market themselves on progressivism, and the country as a whole, for a chance to learn together. The irony is that silence from the top is the ultimate indictment of the state of Singapore’s social fabric: if harmony is as valued as all have claimed, then we should survive talking about this.
Shattering the taboo around race will be both uncomfortable and politically risky, but it can only make this country stronger. It is also an opportunity to demonstrate real leadership.

Behind The Scrubs And Masks: What Do Healthcare Workers Do After Work?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-what-do-healthcare-workers-do-after-work/,29-Jun-21,"All photography by Thaddeus Loh for Rice Media. Responses have been edited for length and clarity.
The pace at our hospitals has been unrelenting: Intubating patients, changing colostomy bags, and resuscitating the stricken. Doctors and nurses go through 12, 13 hours work-days, sometimes going for more than a week before getting a day off. And with extra measures imposed by the pandemic, many of them get their noses poked (swabbed) more often than they like.
It has been a tough ride so far, with no end in sight. But these people are not just mere digits or faceless figures whom we classify under a collective “healthcare workers”. Behind every medical gown and mask is a human being we don’t always see. Like us, they too have emotions and a life outside the doctor or nurse persona.
Earlier this month, we caught up with four healthcare workers (two are twin brothers), some of whom only started their jobs recently, and they gave us a snippet of what a typical workday is like, what they do after work, and on their well-deserved rest days.
WHO: Zeng Ding, 26, Junior Doctor at Sengkang General Hospital
“It may be my birthday today (5th June) but work goes on. Celebration with the family comes later in the day. Fortunately, Saturday’s a half day for me so it is a 6 AM to 12 PM shift. I’ll shower and have lunch at home later on, and watch some of my Youtube videos. I might also hit the sack if I’m feeling tired later on. Day-offs are supposed to be once per week but once in a while, it gets eaten up by work. It’s not uncommon for junior doctors to work 12, 13 days a row, including being on call, before getting a day off. But the hospital tries to avoid that. Anyway, since it is best to stay home as much as possible, I spend my day-offs catching up on much-needed sleep.”
WHO: Ong Jing Long, 26, Junior Doctor at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital
“Work has been hard. These days, at work, we get swabbed regularly and don our PPE (Personal Protective Equipment)—the gown, goggles and all, in these extraordinary times. But the work has been satisfying.
While senior doctors have high expectations of us, I understand they do so to maintain high standards in our healthcare system. It really feels good to work in a team with numerous healthcare workers playing different roles. You get a one of a kind feeling to be part of a collective that cares, and that is what drove me to be a doctor.
Even though it can be busy as a junior doctor who is still learning, I make a point to find time for important things in life, like my health and spending quality time with those whom I care about. There must be a proportion in life! I have had time to think about how to make the time with my family and friends more meaningful, and more present through shared experiences like cooking a new dish or exercising together. Or engage in deeper conversations with them to learn about their motivations for life. These require more thought put into my gestures and actions.
When I’m not working, I try to make the best of the little time I have—exercising, having some ‘me time’, planning mini goals and reorienting what I would really want to achieve in life. Of course, there is always time for some Netflix. I have been watching documentaries recommended by my friends, such as Seaspiracy. A real eye-opener!”
WHO: Nicholas Han, 28, Nurse
“These days, whenever I am off work after spending long hours at the hospital, I try to spend more quality time with my family—having meals with my parents and elder siblings or watching action movies and documentaries on Netflix with my wife. Keeping myself fit and healthy is also important, especially during a pandemic, so I work out with my dumb-bells at home.”
WHO: Ong Jing Zhi, 26, Medical Officer (Emergency Medicine) at the National University Hospital
“It’s 12.30 AM and I’m Grab-ing my way home now, after seven, eight hours of continuous work at the emergency department, on a Saturday evening. A silver lining that our rides home on weekends are claimable, so I can catch forty winks after a tiring shift.
Today’s shift has been an ‘interesting-chill’ one, where patients that came through had significant problems that were diagnostically stimulating, but the workload remained somewhat manageable. This is different from ‘boring-busy’ days where we are flooded by a high volume of patients with vague and non-emergent issues that could have been managed by our robust primary care colleagues in outpatient clinics.
Once I get home, the first thing I’ll do is to get a good shower. Infection control is one thing, but also, getting out of scrubs is as shiok as taking off your socks after a long day. Then I’ll follow up with some casual Netflix binging or reading my fiction novels, before drifting off to sleep. Not every day is work-sleep-work, of course. On day-offs, I might go to the gym, exercise, go out with friends, play computer games or jam on my guitar at home.
Those in the emergency department or working on shifts, our rest days come at rather regular intervals irrespective of weekends, while my colleagues in the wards generally get 1.5 days off a week (we work one half day on either weekend) unless we are on call (at which we work overnight till the next morning).”

Before NTU, There Was Nantah. Have We Forgotten How Students Struggled To Save It From Demise?",Sean Lim,FALSE,TRUE
How Tuberculosis Became A Chinese Disease,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-epidemics-shaped-modern-singapore/,16-Feb-20,"Do you like Milo? Of course you do. This is Singapore, and Milo is to Singapore what Tequila is to Mexico: a national institution. Kids drink it on Sports Day and adults drink it to sugar their sorrows. Once, I met a Singaporean in London who likened our Milo addiction to Charlie Sheen’s cocaine habit.
“I swear, we literally snort that shit by the bucket.”
However, what you might not know about Milo is the historical link to Tuberculosis and public health. In the late 1950s, Milo was not an accompaniment to your maggi goreng or three-piece chicken meal. It was used to boost children’s resistance to TB.
Since a well-fed child of healthy weight and adequate protein intake is ‘less likely’ to get TB, skimmed milk was given to young children at school. During recess, teachers would pick out the scrawniest, most malnourished-looking kids and give them The Milk Cure.
The good news: it was free. The bad news: everyone hated it because the milk had an ‘unpleasant odor’.
An early ad for Milo. Source: thelongnwindingroad.wordpress.com
In 1961, to force upon our children the life-giving elixir that was UNICEF-sponsored skim milk, principals received a budget for “flavoring agents like Milo”. This turned the project into an unprecedented success. 20,000 children were given their Milk-milo mix in 1961, with “larger numbers” in the years to come. Low-income families, however, were given Ovaltine—presumably to confuse future historians.
Was this the origin of Singapore’s Milo fetish? Did their love for malted beverages endure? What if the principals had chosen Horlicks instead? Would we all be changing our McDelivery orders to Ice Horlicks?
These are the burning questions which keep me awake at night. Dr. Loh Kah Seng/Prof Li Yang Hsu’s new book Tuberculosis: The Singapore Experience, 1867-2018, does not answer these questions, but the book does offer up more thought-provoking perspectives about TB, Singapore, and Singapore’s tortuous relationship with infectious disease.
It is a pertinent—if somewhat depressing—read in the midst of our current Coronavirus outbreak. The book is a chronicle of how far we’ve come since the 1800s, but also a story about how little certain things have changed.
The Filthy Chinaman

As it turns out, Coronavirus was not the first outbreak of xenophobia and/or racism. Since every disease comes from somewhere, every outbreak is closely followed by an outbreak of pseudoscientific racial theory.
Since most Tuberculosis sufferers were male Chinese migrants living in the overcrowded shophouses, TB quickly became a ‘Chinese Disease’.
This would be understandable, had it not turned into a libel of Chinese people in general. In 1907, Sir David Galloway—personal doctor to the Sultan of Johor and founder of the Straits Medical Association—wrote that “The Chinaman is the most insanitary of mortals”. Cities in China were “instances of filth” and Chinese migrants in Singapore—unlike the European populace—did not cooperate with the sanitary authorities because they lacked intelligence.
He was not alone. Such views were not just widespread, but orthodox. The Chinaman, although filthy, was said to have a ‘natural resistance’ to TB. Straits Chinese—i.e. Peranakans—caught TB because of their ‘immoral behaviour’.
Portugesese and Eurasians were also uniquely afflicted with TB, although they were not considered filthy.
Even the architecture became racialised. Asian peoples, in general, were said to ‘dislike air in their dwelling-house’. Since the cause of TB’s spread was blamed on ‘dark’ shophouses, British medical expert W.J.R Simpson concluded that: “The Chinese prefer, where possible, to build horizontally, rather than vertically.”
Not very ideal. Source: NUS Medicine
As Dr. Loh Kah Seng notes, such notions were not formed based on personal prejudice but were part of medical theory popular at the time. Colonial administration was an intensely racial affair, and the medical authorities were no exception. Even though germ theory was already the norm, much of the thinking on public health was fixated on race.
Malays were considered the most susceptible, followed by the Japanese, the ‘agrarian’ Chinese, and “some Indian races, most notably Sikhs”. More often than not, these ideas were confusing and self-contradictory. China-born Chinese were said to possess a ‘wonderful degree of resistance’ even though large numbers of coolies ‘invariably died’ when they got TB.
The disease was said to be ‘wonderfully rare’ amongst the Malay population, even though they were the ‘most vulnerable’ to it. Sir Galloway attributes it to ‘the phase of civilisation’. The less developed, the more vulnerable to infection.
Sir David Galloway, knighted in 1924.
However, despite all the talk about racial immunity and disgusting shophouses, nobody actually did much to resolve the crisis. Even after World War 2, there weren’t even accurate statistics for TB-related deaths. Instead, there was a confusing morass of inference/speculation based on hospitalisation rates and death certificates.
Multiple attempts were made to build a sanatorium for TB patients, but each time it failed because of nimby-ism.
Plans for a Pasir Panjang hospital fell through because upper-class citizens did not want to live next to a TB ward, even if it had fences.
Another proposal to site it in Seletar’s Trafalgar rubber estate was likewise scrapped because of complaints from a wealthy landowner named Tan Soon Bin, who suggested that TB would spread by patients defecating or urinating near the seaside.
As it turns out, moral panic about the slums and migrant labour did not translate into any meaningful policy. The racial theories of disease had a useful side effect: as an excuse for the government to shrug their shoulders and go, “C’est la vie.”
After all, if TB was a ‘Chinese disease’, it was perfectly acceptable to do nothing. The government could not be asked to resolve deep-seated racial/cultural problems. Just as racial ideas about TB freed British-South African mining companies from the responsibility of keeping their workforce healthy, the spectre of ‘The Filthy Chinaman’ placed the blame on Singapore’s coolies, instead of the colonial authorities.
HDB v. TB

The later part of Tuberculosis: The Singapore Experience deals with our post-war efforts to combat TB, and links it to Singapore’s growing nationalism. It is more contemporary, and therefore less dramatic than the colonial chapters. There are no more riveting accounts of incompetence or weird eugenical ideas, but it’s nonetheless quite illuminating to read about how we managed to ‘conquer’—or at least control—TB.
There is no clear-cut, single reason for why TB waned. Instead, there was a smorgasbord of different policies. Milo was one (ameliorative) solution. Contact-tracing, better healthcare processes, outpatient treatment, public education, and X-rays were just a few others.
I don’t want to sound like a social studies textbook, but to give credit where credit was due: the newly-elected PAP government did not lack for will when it came to disease eradication. Aided by NGOs like Singapore Anti-Tuberculosis Association, they carried out mass X-ray screenings where every citizen had their lungs examined for signs of TB. Primary School children were tested and given the BCG vaccine.
There was even an anti-spitting campaign which stigmatised spitters as “stupid, selfish and lacking in education”. Chinese storytellers were deployed to spread the cautionary tale of one Uncle Ho, an indiscriminate spitter who killed his entire village by launching TB-ridden phlegm in every direction (Netflix series forthcoming).

Even Muslim Singaporeans were warned. Apparently, ST got the idea that swallowing one’s saliva was forbidden during Ramadan, and might thus result in increased spitting.
But perhaps the most surprising of all anti-TB efforts was the HDB. Even though public housing was not created as a solution to Tuberculosis, it was regarded as a key factor for why cases declined after independence. With people no longer cramped into ‘airless’ shophouses or unregistered ‘cubicles’ which made contact-tracing a nightmare, it became easier to monitor and to control the disease’s spread.
The Ministry Of Health concluded that “Perhaps more than any other non-specific measure, this has played a key role in the reduction of Tuberculosis in Singapore”. More than 50 years after slum-like housing was identified—vilified—for causing epidemics, Singaporean finally began moving out of the ‘terrible slums’ with their ‘dark dank cubicles’.

Today, Tuberculosis rarely makes the news. However, you might be surprised to learn that roughly 23% of those aged between 70-79 still have latent TB. The disease is most common amongst the elderly, and amongst those who are born overseas, in countries with a high prevalence of TB.
But what can we learn from the disease’s history? What lessons can be drawn in aid of the fight against Covid-19? This is probably what you’re thinking, but the answer is not so simple, and Tuberculosis: The Singapore Experience offers no easy insights or clear-cut solutions, except one.
Racial classifications of disease are, more often than not, pretty useless. Chinese coolies were the most susceptible to TB, but they were equally susceptible to typhoid, cholera, and beri-beri because there was no cure for an empty bank account, which leaves you vulnerable to nearly everything.
Hence, the authors of the book conclude: “the illness affected particularly low-income workers residing in congested housing, suffering from poor health.”
There are no more migrant workers in Chinatown’s shophouses anymore. It’s all yoga studios and overfunded start-ups. However, most of the migrant labour upon which Singapore’s prosperity depends still reside in relatively congested housing—dormitories, cheap hostels—rooms that make HDB flats look like good-class bungalows.
However, migrant workers do not get free face masks from the government. They also do not have the luxury of working from home, unlike DBS employees. One of them is already in critical condition, and others are reportedly protecting himself with bandanas. NGOs like itsrainingraincoats are collecting masks and vitamin C for migrant workers, but they can’t do it alone. There are too many workers, and not enough activists.
Perhaps the next logical step is for our government to distribute free masks and disinfectant to those who are most vulnerable and least able to afford protection—our migrant workers. The early history of Tuberculosis in Singapore is a history of incompetence mixed with indifference, but the history of the Coronavirus need not be the same.

"To My Father Who Smokes, Here Are All The Things I Wish I’d Said",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-father-smokes-things-i-wish-id-said/,11-Jun-20,"Image credit: Shutterstock
Note: This article was transcribed from an interview with Jody (not her real name) and rewritten in the first person.
When I was younger, I used to wonder what those grey clouds and halos emerging from my Dad’s mouth in wispy trails were. I only learned that he was a smoker and addicted to the habit when I was in primary school.
My father doted on me dearly. We were pretty close when I was young. But somehow his serial smoking of Marlboro Reds or Greens has been one of the many causes that made us drift apart over the years.
I’m now 26 and he just turned 61. With Covid-19 and all, and Father’s Day being something we do celebrate—I want those grey clouds and halos to disappear, but I wasn’t sure how.
... like a mini fireworks of doom and gloom. Image credit: Shutterstock
He’s been puffing away for over forty years, oblivious to how that has affected me, my Mum, and my younger sister. Don’t get me wrong. We all love him to death (no pun intended), but even as the oldest child, I couldn’t seem to muster up enough courage to tell him what I really wish he would do—to quit.
When we talk, it’s superficial talk, like “how’s your day?”, “eat dinner already?”, “Ma not home yet?”. I miss the earlier days when our conversations were deeper and lasted more than 10 minutes. Maybe it’s because 5 minutes into our conversation, his habit would kick in and my mood changes.
There goes the white-and-brown stick hanging loosely between his lips, like a mini fireworks of doom and gloom. Then he would stare off into the distance, even if I was sitting right in front of him, exhaling circles and smoke-clouds like I didn’t exist.
His eyes would glaze over, his breathing would slow, and he would gather his thoughts, blinking as if waking up for a second time, before slowly but surely starting his day for real.
“Okay Jody,” he would say in his heavily accented Teochew voice, “Daddy’s going out now.”
""Okay Jody ... Daddy's going out now."" Image credit: Shutterstock
Two years ago, my mum was diagnosed with breast cancer. Not only were we in for the shock of our lives, my Dad included, but it became a wake-up call for us to re-look at our health, mortality, and make some really hard life choices.
Her immunity was compromised due to breathing in secondhand cigarette smoke, resulting in bad headaches and who knows what else. I (kinda) snapped. The stress from my Mum’s cancer treatment and my wish for my Dad to quit smoking for the past two decades finally exploded out of me.
I pointed out his behaviour prior to my Mum’s diagnosis, when he was always at the balcony smoking away. Not only was the smell bad, it stunk our living room and bedrooms. His family was being put in harm’s way due to his addiction to smoking.
So the night I visited my Mum at the hospital, I sent a text message to our family WhatsApp group. I told my Dad to stop smoking in our house. Just go out and do it. I still love my Dad, but I wish I was brave enough to tell him face-to-face.
Maybe it’s because we’re a typical Asian family, where we don’t usually air our grievances or problems. My WhatsApp message got my Dad so angry, he left the house whenever he needed a smoke. For nearly three weeks, he would disappear to catch his smoke breaks and we would not see him for hours. Sometimes we worried if he would return home.
I even felt guilty for snapping. It wasn’t something I was used to doing.

Eventually, he grew tired of “disappearing”. He got lazy and decided to cut down. It was like an unspoken gesture of apology from him to me, and I readily accepted it. We hardly exchanged words about it. The lingering scent of secondhand cigarette smoke lessened over time, and we were appreciative of it.
When my Mum’s cancer went into remission and she was finally discharged, we were all sitting around the dining table. The topic of him quitting surfaced. Sparks flew, and my father turned defensive. Things became heated once again.
“Why are you and your sister always picking on me?” Dad asked.
“We just want what’s best for you Dad! We’ve seen you smoke for years but we never say anything hor. Your cigarette smell has been wafting into my room for months and I only brought it up once!”
“Whatever lah!” he responded and stomped off.
Then I discovered that my younger sister had picked up smoking 5-6 years ago. She had been trying to hide her habit from my family (and me) but got found out. While that made me angrier, it jolted my Dad even more. Something cracked in his logic after this double whammy of family events. He finally took my sister aside and opened up. It was so unlike our father to do that.
He spoke about his regret for not trying harder to quit, and why smoking is harmful and addictive. If I could hazard a guess, he probably blamed himself for what was happening to my sister. He didn’t want her to go down the same road he did. Thankfully, she eventually quit.
What got me thinking was why he finally opened up about his struggles with his smoking addiction. I know my Dad, and I know it wasn’t easy for him to confess like that. It was a maturity in him I never expected.
While my sister was able to wean off her addiction, my father’s road to quitting wasn’t going to be as easy. We’re talking about flushing out 40+ years of nicotine addiction from his system.
Being the older sibling, I researched the prospect of alternatives to smoking. I asked my sister to broach the subject with our father, since they spoke about his addiction. I asked her to talk about Nicorette for instance (since we don’t have chewing gum in Singapore anyways).
“Huh? Nicorette? What’s that?” my sister asked me.
“Aiya, it’s a nicotine replacement lah. In chewing gum or patch form. It’s an easier way to wean off addiction. Better than see him go cold turkey right?”
She agreed to be the point person. I was ready to be her wingman, just not physically present but WhatsApp-able. After what felt like a gruelling one hour wait, she texted me back.
“He said he’ll think about it.” That was her message. I was about to scream inside when she followed up with a second text. “But he also said he’ll need our help.”
While my sister was able to wean off her addiction, my father’s road to quitting wasn’t going to be as easy. Image credit: Shutterstock
The fact that my dad was willing to open up to my sister about his smoking habit and listen to us after my mum’s illness was the first step. It brought a smile of relief to my face. Finally, the good news is that we’re making progress and his journey will need all of our support.
Together with our mum, my sister and I agreed we’ll be there for him every step of the way. We’ve tolerated his smoking for close to 30 years, my mum probably more. It felt great to learn (through my sister), that he’s willing to go on a Quit Journey and be receptive to a smoking cessation aid like Nicorette.
Maybe someday, I’ll muster enough courage to sit down with Dad and have a serious and honest conversation about his addiction and his journey to quit. It would be like when I was in primary school and our light-hearted banter now held greater weight and concern.
I want to tell him I will support him no matter how difficult the journey gets. I don’t want it to be this deep, dark family secret we all know of but don’t discuss openly, not even at the dinner table.
This Father’s Day, I want to look him in his eyes and tell him I love him for doing this with us, despite it being difficult for him. Because that’s what family does. We stick together like chewing gum.
This article is brought to you by Nicorette.
Do something amazing today. Quitting smoking or helping someone to quit smoking is one of the most amazing things one can ever do. If you know of anyone you love who smokes, nominate them to receive a Nicorette Support Experience Pack today.
The journey to a cigarette-free lifestyle is hard, but when it’s done with someone they love, the burden is shared, and the rewards truly greater.

Cancer and Covid-19: 10 Questions With Medical Oncologist Dr. Choo Su Pin,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-10-questions-medical-oncologist-choo-su-pin/,23-May-20,"Top image: Sissi Kaplan
Singapore currently has over 30,400 cases of Covid-19 and 23 deaths. While we grapple like the rest of the world with a global pandemic, medical professionals have faced unprecedented challenges in the diagnosis and treatment for serious illnesses during a lockdown.
Dr. Choo Su Pin, a medical oncologist who specialises in gastrointestinal cancers, and is the current President of the Singapore Society of Oncology, spoke to RICE about what’s happening with cancer patients (in Singapore and the region) during the circuit breaker period here.
Vinita: What were some of the most significant changes you witnessed for your patients and for yourself as a medical oncologist when Covid-19 was declared a pandemic by WHO?
Dr. Choo: The drop in numbers of cancer patients. About 50% of the cancer patients I see come from the region, largely ASEAN, though there are several from countries further away like India and Bangladesh. All my foreign cancer patients can no longer enter Singapore because of travel restrictions both here as well as in their home country. There have been less local patients too.
Dr. Choo Su Pin talks to RICE Media
For local patients, there are less new cancer patients nowadays which implies that there are less patients being diagnosed with cancer. Cancer still happens but where are the cases?
This is likely due to the avoidance of hospitals by patients themselves for fear of Covid-19 and the risks at healthcare settings, as well as due to the postponement of non-urgent health screening programs like screening colonoscopies in patients without symptoms.
For existing cancer patients, they have had to adopt social distancing rules which means they cannot come to the clinic with more than one visitor. Their friends may not be able to visit them as well, so it’s a lonelier cancer journey for them.

There are no delays in treatment due to resource issues at my hospital so far, so I’m thankful for that. We have changed treatments where possible, as long as it doesn’t compromise outcomes, to reduce patient visits to the clinic.
For foreign patients, it is trickier as some have no access to some of the drugs that they are on. We try and courier drugs to them where possible but with lockdowns in their countries too, sometimes we have encountered issues.
So, I have had to find local oncologists in their home countries to help look after these patients.
For example, I had a patient in the Philippines who needed a drug that was working well for his cancer. We tried to courier the drugs to him but couldn’t because he lives in a city that had no flights in and out.
I also have patients overseas who have delayed scans by more than 2 months because of the pandemic. Their cancer markers are creeping up so it’s worrying because I don’t know if their cancer is growing.
It’s been difficult for them to get scans and also there is quite a bit of fear about getting Covid-19 if they go to the hospital to get a scan.
A distressed patient called me in tears as her treatment plans in Singapore were disrupted. She was stuck in her home town and could not fly out. She was so worried that her cancer would spread and she would die. I had to find an oncologist in her hometown to help give an alternative therapy. It was not the ideal treatment, but we had to make do.

Some of my patients who were hoping to get onto clinical trials have also been told that clinical trial recruitments are on hold so they cannot participate in these trials. We couldn’t offer them alternative options. So we had to make do with other mediocre therapies or stop treatment altogether.
Vinita: With the worldwide lockdown, did any of your patients, particularly from overseas, have to make difficult decisions on receiving care?
Dr. Choo: I have had a few patients who were in Singapore when the lockdowns happened and they were faced with the decision about whether to stay on in Singapore for the next few months for treatment or fly home and not be able to return to Singapore for treatment until the borders opened up.
One foreign patient of mine with an advanced cancer has been here in Singapore with her daughter for more than one month. Her cancer is not curative and I wonder whether it’s better for her to go home and spend time with her family even if it means compromising her anti-cancer therapy or stay on here with no other friends or family except her daughter.
Vinita: How did your day-to-day operations change when Singapore introduced circuit breaker measures to stem the spread of Covid-19?
Dr. Choo: The way we run our clinics has shifted. We have to assume that every person including ourselves can be Covid-19 positive and make changes based on this. We have had to change our workflow to ensure continuity of care in case any of our staff gets hit with Covid-19.
Photo credit: Sissi Kaplan
For example, we have been pretty obsessive about cleaning and hygiene in our clinics. We try and avoid crowding in the clinic so patient appointments are spread out. We use teleconsultations where possible. We have an app to monitor patients’ blood pressure, temperature, oxygen saturation and heart rate at home, we have segregated our staff etc.
Vinita: How has it affected caretakers, with the introduction of safe distancing measures (i.e. caretakers are not allowed into ATUs, for example)?
Dr. Choo: Most cancer patients have several family members and friends rallying around them during their fight with cancer. With social distancing, patients cannot be with many of their friends and family. You can no longer have a cup of tea and talk things out with a bosom buddy.
Technology helps us to connect but it is not the same as being able to give someone an encouraging hug or a pat on the back. The silver lining to this perhaps is that each cancer patient can spend more quality time with their immediate family since we are stuck at home.
Vinita: Has there been a psychological impact on your patients because of the pandemic?
Dr. Choo: For sure. Not only are they dealing with having cancer, the side effects of cancer treatment but also the fear that they may be more susceptible to the Covid-19 infection. Then you add to that the restrictions on visitors at clinics and hospitals, and social distancing. So they have less support with them during their cancer journey. There may be other socio-economic stresses at home we’re not aware of too.

Vinita: In 2018 alone, more than 26,000 people were diagnosed with cancer and the mortality rate was over 13,000. Cases have also been increasing over the years. What sorts of additional risks does Covid-19 pose for cancer patients?
Dr. Choo: We know from Chinese data that cancer patients who are infected with Covid-19 have a higher mortality rate. This is not surprising considering that many cancer patients are on immune-suppressive drugs and that just having an underlying disease (cancer) makes them more prone to complications of Covid-19.
Vinita: What are the challenges you are facing, when current treatment protocols could potentially be complicated by a virus we are still struggling to understand and for which there is still no vaccine? (i.e. prevention of hospital-acquired infections)?
Dr. Choo: We are adjusting treatment protocols where possible. For example, if there are two effective therapies but one causes immunosuppression while the other does not, we may pick the latter option.
Or if we can give a similar therapy in oral form instead of injection form so we can reduce patient visits to the clinic, we do that.We also encourage patients to keep healthy with adequate vitamin C, D and zinc in their diets and to exercise to maintain health. If we were already planning to give a patient a chemo break, this would be a good period for that break.
Vinita: The government announced on May 19th that it will be gradually lifting the circuit breaker measures in phases. As of June 1st, healthcare services such as specialist outpatient services, medical procedures and cancer screening can resume. Are you expecting a sudden spike in the number of patients who’ll be coming to see you and how do you plan on preparing for this next phase?
Dr. Choo: I’ve been worried that my patients may become infected with Covid-19 and that there are cancer patients in the community who have not being diagnosed in a timely manner because they are avoiding hospitals or because hospitals have become less accessible.
So this is good news. There might be a backlog of cases that we have to deal with but we have capacity to deal with it. If needed, we will just have to prioritise more urgent cases over less urgent.
Every crisis forces us to recalibrate and band together on many levels. And with every crisis, there is opportunity too. For me, personally, this crisis has reinforced the need to be adaptable no matter what the situation is.
Are you, or your family members, anxious about pre-existing conditions and access to treatment during this period of crisis? Tell us at community@ricemedia.co.

Why Transgender Singaporeans Turn To Buying Hormones Off The Online Black Market,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-transgender-singaporeans-buying-hormones-off-online-black-market-diy-hrt/,23-May-21,"Top image (composite): individual photos courtesy of interviewees.
RICE does not endorse or recommend DIY HRT.
Last year’s circuit breaker was tough for everyone, but Audrey*, a 19-year-old trans woman, remembers it as two months that literally changed her life.
Then in her second year of junior college, she had been quietly struggling with gender dysphoria for years. Coming out to her parents—whom she described as ‘conservative’ and ‘sort of transphobic’—was out of the question, and seeing cisgender girls in school every day only reminded her of the body she wished she had.
“The thoughts just kept recurring that I didn’t look like them and couldn’t blend in,” she said.
When school closed in April 2020, with nothing to distract her from her spiralling thoughts, her condition worsened rapidly. “I was quite badly dysphoric, verging on suicidal,” she said. “I tried to push ahead, but I felt that if I had to keep waiting before I could get care, I might not survive that long.”
In a bid to regain control, she turned to the Internet. While she’d read a lot about transitioning, she hadn’t heard much about self-administered hormone replacement therapy (HRT), believing the medication could only be obtained from a doctor. But after talking to other trans people on a Discord server and reading up online, she decided to take the plunge and buy hormone pills without a prescription. She ordered Estrofem, a brand of estrogen pills, from an online pharmacy in Portugal, crossed her fingers, and waited.
Audrey is far from the only trans person here to have attempted ‘DIY’ HRT. I couldn’t find any local data on the topic, but numerous anecdotal accounts from trans people, as well as LGBTQ+ community workers, indicate the practice is not uncommon in Singapore, and has been around for decades. While it has evolved over the years, its causes have remained constant: desperation born of stigma and discrimination, and difficulties with accessing trans-affirming care.
“It didn’t really occur to me how stressful it could be [when I started], because I wanted so badly to do it,” said Audrey. “I just felt, if the chances of me dying without HRT are higher than me dying from it, I might as well give it a try.”
A screencap from an online pharmacy selling HRT.
Even if you don’t know where to look, it’s not difficult to track down illicit HRT online. You don’t even need to go on the dark web. With some time, patience, and Reddit sleuthing skills, you can find a wealth of information about buying HRT, be it from unregulated online pharmacies in Russia or the Philippines, or mainstream marketplaces like eBay and Taobao.
Amelia*, a schoolmate of Audrey’s, began ordering HRT off Taobao when she was only 14 and still living in China. She subsequently switched to ordering from a ‘more legit’ online pharmacy headquartered in Vanuatu.
Now 18, she has been DIYing for almost four years. Over coffee, she took me through the ins and outs of buying HRT online, explaining how vendors would change the names of the drugs to avoid being picked up by marketplaces’ filters.
While feminising treatments like estrogen and anti-androgens can be bought online relatively easily, masculinising treatments—mainly, testosterone (T)—are more challenging to find. Dacre, a 20-year-old trans man, explained that this is partially because anabolic steroids are tightly regulated, given their potential for misuse. But also, unlike estrogen, T mostly comes in liquid form, which is taken via injection.
Although he now has an official prescription under the public healthcare system, Dacre started off buying T from a fellow trans man he met at the gym. That friend, in turn, got his supply from an online pharmacy in Malaysia, which he claimed was ‘lab standard’.
When I asked Dacre how he decided it was safe enough to use—the Internet is rife with horror stories about how fake T (in one alleged case, petrol) has been linked to the deaths of trans people—he grinned sheepishly.
“I had done some research, but in the end I guess I was kind of half-assed about it,” he admitted.
“I just trusted that his T was safe, because it worked for him. And I was desperate and curious. [My thinking at the time was], if it works, it works, if it doesn’t, nothing too bad can happen…right?”, grimacing while I winced. He continued buying T off his friend for a couple more months, before eventually ordering his own online.
Medical opinion is unequivocal: DIY HRT can be extraordinarily dangerous. To better understand this, I spoke with Dr. Lakshmi Ganapathi, a Singaporean doctor who studied and trained here, and is now a practising paediatrician at Boston Children’s Hospital, the first centre in the U.S. to establish a gender multi-speciality service for children and youth.
She laid out the risks for me over email: potential interactions with existing health conditions, especially unknown ones; counterfeit or poor-quality drugs; difficulties with establishing potency; inappropriate dosages; and risks associated with injection, all compounded by the lack of professional supervision.
“Patients receiving HRT need careful titration of doses that balances many factors, as well as short- and long-term monitoring of risks,” she said. “They need to have the opportunity to discuss it with a trained provider who can be vigilant about risks and guide their overall care.”
Dacre and Amelia found this out the hard way. When they eventually went for blood tests at the insistence of their parents, who had found out they were self-medicating, the results showed they’d been overdosing. Their testosterone and estrogen levels, respectively, were off the charts.
While trans advocacy and support groups generally do not condone DIY HRT—TransgenderSG, for example, ‘strongly cautions’ against the practice—they nonetheless understand why individuals might feel driven to it.
First, the lengths to which Audrey, Amelia, Dacre, and many other trans people go to obtain HRT need to be understood against the dangers of untreated gender dysphoria. Multiple studies have shown that without appropriate and timely treatment, trans- and gender-non-confirming individuals are at much higher risk of depression, anxiety, self-harm, and suicide. Against these, like in Audrey’s case, experimenting with treatments can start to seem like an acceptable gamble.
While trans-affirming healthcare, including HRT, is available in Singapore under both the public and private systems, many trans people face difficulties accessing it, both as a result of structural and technical reasons as well as stigma and discrimination.
According to Leow Yangfa and Alexander Teh, two representatives from Oogachaga I spoke with, trans people of all ages and backgrounds have been known to attempt DIY HRT. However, a significant push factor here, especially amongst younger trans people, are the age restrictions controlling access to HRT. In Singapore, it is generally not available to anyone under 17, and between the ages of 18 to 21, both parents’ consent is needed to obtain it.

The basic rationale behind age restrictions is straightforward: to ensure patients can give informed consent to medical treatment.
In medicine and law, competence is well-established as a fluid and multifactorial concept, where age is neither the sole nor primary determinant. That said, because there is no singular and reliable way of applying this, many countries still default to age-based thresholds in practice. (In Singapore, this is generally 21.)
Nonetheless, according to Dr. Ganapathi, professional paediatric bodies do recognise that most adolescents develop the capacity to provide informed consent by age 16. One test for assessing this, known as Gillick competence, is used by doctors in specific circumstances, and has generally been accepted in Singapore.
Within the field of transgender healthcare especially, it gets very complicated very fast.
A trans teenager may have been certain of their gender identity from an early age, but may not necessarily be able to appreciate all the effects and risks of starting HRT, such as fertility loss. Because the treatment can induce permanent physical changes, it needs to be carefully considered. At the same time, starting it late—even after 18—can make socially transitioning harder.
Timely intervention can also help reduce the risk of adverse mental health outcomes, especially the trauma of puberty-induced gender dysphoria. Naturally, many trans teenagers are keen to start HRT as early as possible, but this brings us back to whether they can give informed consent in the first place.
In any regard, stressed Dr. Ganapathi, “each teenager’s capacity to consent, particularly for partially irreversible treatments like HRT, needs to be assessed individually.”
All three of my interviewees admitted (often, with some embarrassment) that, in their desperation, they had taken more risks than was probably wise. Audrey, for example, reflected that she had been “pretty cavalier” in hindsight.
“I just read what I could and took the lowest dose possible, and adjusted my dose based on the changes I observed in my body,” she said.
While DIY HRT dramatically improved Dacre’s mental health and quality of life, he struggled to come to terms with some of its effects, which he only learned about after seeing a doctor.
While he didn’t regret it, “you really need to think carefully before starting, because you can’t take these things back,” he wrote in a follow-up text. “I actually grieved about not being able to have kids [when I found out]. It really tore me from the inside.”
Keira Bell, one of the plaintiffs in a UK High Court case which challenged the prescription of puberty blockers to under-18s. She began taking them at 16 before eventually detransitioning. The judgment is being appealed.
While there is no one-size-fits-all test for informed consent, the dual-parent requirement also bears scrutiny. It’s easy to see how this can be onerous for many people looking to start HRT—not just those who come from single-parent households, or ones whose parents don’t get along, but those whose families may be unsupportive, uninformed, or hostile towards their child’s gender identity.
For Dacre, Audrey, and Amelia, knowing their parents were unlikely to consent was what drove them to DIY HRT in the first place. (For that matter, none of them felt they would have come out to their parents, had they not been discovered self-medicating.)
“I understand that parental consent is to ensure that children are acting in their best interests, but in the context of Singapore, where so many parents are transphobic or uninformed, involving parents can sometimes erect a barrier between the child and their treatment,” said Audrey. “I don’t think denying, effectively, a child access to potentially life-saving treatment can be in their best interests anyway.”
In Singapore, according to Dr. Ganapathi, several medical procedures (e.g. sedation) only require one parent’s consent. “Given the legal precedent for one parent to consent in many other situations, and the many challenges patients may face in getting both parents’ consent, medical practitioners need to develop broader consent frameworks with the input of the legal fraternity,” she said.
Another consideration is puberty blockers, which are not currently available in Singapore. The treatment, which is provided to transgender pre-teens in many countries, works by suppressing the onset of puberty and halting the development of secondary sexual characteristics, such as breast growth and facial changes. Significantly, their effects are fully reversible, which makes them a compelling precursor to HRT.
While medical opinion largely backs their use (with appropriate assessment and parental consent), the long-term effects of puberty blockers are not fully understood, such as on bone density. Last December, in a controversial decision, the UK High Court ruled that under-16s would be unlikely to give informed consent to their use, which is also being walked back in Sweden and several US states. (I wrote to the Health Sciences Authority and Ministry of Health to seek comment about their stance on puberty blockers, but did not receive a response in time for publication.)
Nonetheless, between the unavailability of puberty blockers here and the challenges of obtaining HRT before age 21, there is a very real risk of trans teenagers facing harm either way: potentially going without treatment, or resorting to self-medicating.
Dr. Ganapathi opined that while puberty blockers—like any other medical treatment—need to be carefully studied, opposition to their use is often grounded in misinformation or implicit bias.
“Often, you get people saying that all this is happening because of the media or Western influence, stuff like that,” she said. “While there is greater awareness of trans issues and therapies now, thanks to the Internet, people’s positions on puberty blockers and trans healthcare tend to be rooted in their fundamental beliefs about gender.”
She pointed out that puberty blockers have also been used—to much less violent objection— in contexts outside gender dysphoria treatment, such as in children who begin puberty too early. (HRT, too, is prescribed in contexts outside gender transitioning.)
“If people recoil against these in the context of trans kids specifically, it’s possible that their real concerns don’t have to do with the medication or its safety profile, but the purpose it’s being used for,” she said.

In this, age restrictions are only one aspect of a larger problem. Although access to trans-affirming healthcare has improved over the years, many significant systemic barriers remain.
As a starting point, it must be noted that unlike many other countries, HRT is relatively affordable in Singapore. Under the public healthcare system, both HRT and related consultations are available to Singaporeans and PRs at subsidised rates. From what I could ascertain, these are not prohibitive: a vial of T costs around $15-20 and lasts several weeks, while a month’s supply of feminising treatments costs around $30-$60. (Both the medication and consultations, naturally, cost much more in the private sector.)
Of much greater concern are bottlenecks in the system: long wait times, coupled with a lack of providers who are both medically and culturally equipped to provide trans-affirming care.
At present, the main clinic providing transgender healthcare services is the Gender Health Clinic at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH). When it opened in 2017, it was the only clinic in the public healthcare system believed to specialise in gender dysphoria. Its predecessor, NUH’s Gender Identity Clinic, closed for good in 2008, leaving a nearly decade-long gap.
While reviews of the quality of care at IMH’s clinic have been uniformly positive—both from trans people I interviewed for this story and others, as well as online accounts—a common grouse is that wait times for an appointment can be as much as 2-3 months, if not more. This increases the likelihood that patients, desperate for help, might turn to DIY HRT in the meantime.
To the best of my knowledge, the IMH clinic is staffed by only two doctors, one who sees under-18s and one who sees adult patients. Meanwhile, according to Dacre and Amelia, COVID-19 has made the wait for a slot even longer.
More recently, however, at least one other public hospital—Changi General Hospital—appears to have opened a gender dysphoria clinic.
“There are clear resource bottlenecks, and at the same time, we do know that transphobia exists in the healthcare system, as it does in society generally,” said Yangfa, the Executive Director of Oogachaga.
He speculated that problems may also lie upstream, with a lack of doctors who are trained to provide trans-affirming care. “It may well be circular, for example, psychiatrists who can’t diagnose GD (gender dysphoria) because they’ve never learned about this or seen a case. If you don’t see, you don’t know.” While the issue of gaps in medical education is not unique to Singapore, it merits dedicated attention and commitment to solving.
Either way, he added, “the need is clearly presenting itself, so insufficient demand cannot be cited as a reason. Trans people need to be treated equally, and trans healthcare, like access to healthcare for anyone, is a human right.”

Thorny as the debates around consent, puberty blockers, and HRT may be, they can all be linked to a common structural challenge: massively inadequate access to information around gender identity issues here.
DIY HRT, after all, is only one example of how this knowledge gap works against trans people’s interests. While the Internet has helped increase awareness about gender identity issues (and enabled trans people to connect and seek support), this has been accompanied by a flood of misinformation, some unintended and some malicious. (Dacre, Audrey, and Amelia all shared that their families had sent them false information about HRT and trans-ness at some point.)
In this climate, when legitimate concerns about under-studied treatments can bump up against blatant lies and fear-mongering, the need for reliable information is not only critical, but urgent. Arguably, the single biggest step toward improving trans healthcare in Singapore—and possibly one of the simplest—would be to ensure trans people, especially youths, can easily obtain the information they need to make informed decisions about their own lives.
I remarked to Yangfa and Alexander that researching this article, from combing the Internet for resources and piecing together information from word-of-mouth, felt like it’d given me a small taste of what the process might be like for trans people considering HRT.
Even without the personal stakes, it felt like I was preparing a dissertation on a topic I’d never studied, ploughing through incomprehensible medical literature at times, falling down Reddit rabbit holes at others. An off-hand comment Amelia had made during our interview came to mind: “Your best friend is the Internet, and other people who’ve gone through the same thing.”
“The knowledge barrier is very, very real,” said Yangfa. “It takes so much effort to find out everything, especially if you are not connected to the community.”
In Singapore, MOH does not publish public guidance about gender dysphoria, although this is available for many other conditions (the entry for HRT only addresses it in contexts outside gender transitioning). Similar guides, for example, are published by the health authorities in the UK and Australia. At present, the most comprehensive local guide is maintained by TransgenderSG, an NGO.
Remarkably, even the two specialist gender clinics in the public healthcare system—at IMH and CGH—are not clearly advertised or signposted on the hospitals’ websites, and are most easily found by a direct Google search.
Better access to information would do wonders not just for trans people, but their families, too. Yangfa, Alexander, and Dr. Ganapathi were all adamant that holistic trans-affirming care takes a village. Beyond a broader suite of services (psychosocial support and speech therapy, for example), medical social workers are often needed to counsel patients’ families, especially where they are unsupportive or ill-informed about gender dysphoria.
“Family-centred care is so, so important. Parents need the resources to be able to support their kids,” said Dr. Ganapathi. “And they have a right to information too, be it about therapies or service providers.”

While Audrey, Dacre, and Amelia don’t regret DIYing per se, they all felt they would have benefitted from advice and oversight. If anything, having had time to reflect on their choices has made them reluctant to encourage others to do the same.
“Do I feel DIY HRT was worth it? Yes,” said Dacre. “It helped me through a very dark period of my life, becoming who I really was. But I wouldn’t tell people ‘go do it’, because it’s extremely dangerous.”
Audrey, the only one of my interviewees to have never sought medical supervision, continues to DIY, taking as low a dose as possible to avoid alerting her parents. While she hopes to get an official prescription eventually, she is resigned to lying low till she turns 21.
“I guess one thing that stands out to me is the loneliness of the whole affair,” she texted me a couple of hours after our interview. “Medically transitioning should have been an exciting process where I get to celebrate who I really am, but instead I have to hide the changes and what I’m doing every day, and that’s disconcerting.”
“Perhaps coming from an unsupportive household compounds it, but I’m really doing this thing on my own without anyone to look out for me or monitor my safety, and it’s scary knowing that no-one’s taking care of me.”

This Singaporean Accidentally Fell Into Business With the Italian Mafia & Almost Started A Family War,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-singaporean-man-business-italian-mafia/,18-May-21,"Illustrations by Ansh Sirohi.
Alan Lai Chong Meng.
Giuseppe Calvaruso.
Alan Lai Chong Meng is a wealthy Singaporean businessman who was investigated in an international police operation between Italy and Singapore. In 2018 and 2019 he invested in projects in Sicily that were found to have ties with mafia figures, including Giuseppe Calvaruso, who was arrested in April 2021. While Lai was not aware of his investments falling into the hands of the mafia, it made the police investigating Calvaruso suspicious to see a wealthy foreigner involved in his operations.
This is the story of how a Singaporean businessman unwittingly found himself at the core of a Sicilian mafia feud.
On the eve of Easter 2021, Italian native Giuseppe Calvaruso was arrested in Italy after returning from Brazil, where he had been residing. The 44-year-old was found to have become a prominent leader of Cosa Nostra, the Sicilian mafia in Palermo, a Sicilian city, since 2018. His charges included mafia association, extortion, kidnapping, and fictitious registration of assets.
Cosa Nostra, or the Sicilian Mafia, is an organised crime syndicate dating back to the 19th century. It’s made up of a loose network of groups, each known as a ‘family’ or ‘clan’ that takes ownership of different villages or neighbourhoods.
Historically, government presence in Sicily has been scarce due to it being one of the poorer regions of the country. To fill the gaps left by the government, mafia groups began providing local populations with basic necessities—policing, individual and property protection, contract setting, loan services, and so on. As a result, they also flourished.
But since their early days, Cosa Nostra has evolved into an international crime organization, and is now involved in everything from drugs and arms smuggling to political corruption.
As waves of Italians migrated to the United States in the 19th century, the syndicates spread internationally, resulting in multiple ‘mafia wars’. The first took place in the 1960s between the American and Sicilian mafia, and involved shootouts that injured innocent bystanders.
Mafia clans are now spread even further, with Calvaruso being proof of this. From Brazil, Calvaruso had started managing the international investment and business plans of Cosa Nostra. What surprised investigators tracking Calvaruso was how far he cast his net of interests, from South America, Europe to now Asia.

From Italy, Brazil, To Singapore: The International Network
When we think of mafia operations, we imagine criminals covered in tattoos smuggling drugs between borders—you may also have seen Korean drama Vincenzo which has ranked #1 on Netflix in Singapore for a few months now. In reality, they operate under the radar of most regular people, occasionally trapping unsuspecting individuals.
One recent victim of this was a Singaporean by the name of Alan Lai Chong Meng.
It would not do this story justice if we did not begin in the romantic ruins and sundrenched beaches of Sicily, which is where Alan’s journey started.
58-year-old Lai had been meaning to make this trip for a while, especially after being friends and business partners with Sicilian Salvatore Catalano for years. Catalano runs Lai’s restaurant Ristorante Palermo at Keppel Bay. In the past, they worked together on Trattoria Amanda that operated at 14 Stanley Street.
After decades of living in Singapore, Catalano was yearning to foster deeper connections between his homeland and the tropical island where he was now residing. Naturally, he brought up the idea of investing in Sicily to his business partner, Lai. It made sense—Lai had the funds, and Catalano the know-how of maneuvering the country as a native. Lai responded positively.
The Sicilian Connection
It was June 2019 at this point. Summer in Italy was in full swing, and Lai was itching for a getaway. He entrusts Catalano to plan an itinerary in Palermo, the capital of the island, and they depart.
Upon arrival, Catalano sets up meetings with Sicilian connections who could introduce Lai to possible investment opportunities. After a few days of relaxation and sightseeing, Lai finds himself at a beach side aperitivo with none other than Calvaruso, the recently arrested mafia tycoon.
Also present at this meeting at a bar named ‘Touring Cafe’ in Mondello, a beach town: a few unidentified foreigners, and Giovanni Spano’, another mafia-linked individual who was arrested the same day as Calvaruso. But we’ll come back to Spano’ later.
While enjoying cocktails overlooking the glistening waters, the Italians sold Lai a plot of agricultural land that was up for grabs in the countryside of Sicily. They also mentioned an antique building for sale in the city of Palermo. Calvaruso even spread out floor plans and photos on the table.
At this point, Calvaruso was already under investigation by the police. Unbeknownst to Lai, they had followed the suspected mafia boss to this meeting.
Blissfully unaware, and impressed by the propositions, Lai and Catalano agreed to attend a site inspection of the antique building. In the following days, there are multiple meals in scenic spots around Palermo, where the group continue to discuss property acquisitions over exquisite traditional Italian cuisine.
Mondello, Sicily.
From Pristine Holiday To Property Shopping In Italy
On the 8th of June, just a few days after the first seaside encounter, the police intercept a call between Catalano and Calvaruso, where Catalano makes clear what Lai’s intention is with the property.
“I saw the contracts … 750!?” Catalano exclaims as Calvaruso tries to calm him down.
“We’ll take the property for 500,” he says. “Then during renovations we will sit and discuss more numbers. This will be a business card for Asia.”
“Alright, alright, I’ll be able to get it for you for 500,” Calvaruso replies, agreeing to get them the property for 500,000 euros given the possibility to earn more after renovations commence.
Investigators believe that Calvaruso saw Lai’s investment as an avenue for more business from Asia, starting with Singapore.
At this point, it was also clear to the Italians that Lai was a businessman with the intention of making multiple investments—just the day before, on 7 June, he bought two apartments in a central avenue of Palermo for over 230,000 euros combined.
With that transaction complete and more expected on the horizon, the Italian police launch an international investigation into Lai and Catalano. They couldn’t help wondering how a wealthy businessman from across the globe had found his way to this mafioso.
Swiftly, the Singapore Police responds and confirms that both Catalano and Lai had clean records in Singapore, and confirms that Lai owns ‘Trattoria Amanda’ (now closed), where Catalano was hired as General Manager.
At this point, the Italian police begin to realise that perhaps both Lai and Catalano were clueless about who they were doing business with.

A month later, in July 2019, Calvaruso travels to Singapore, where he helps Lai plan another trip to Italy for September later that year. He also uses it as an opportunity to start exploring business avenues in the rest of Asia.
“The prospects are looking good,” Calvaruso tells a friend over the phone. “They are looking for high value real estate deals that usually can’t be found in the portfolio of regular real estate companies.”
The prospects turned out to be so good that on 12 February 2020, Lai buys another unit on the same road as the previous two for 13,000 euros. Then on 2 March 2020 comes Lai’s biggest investment yet—an antique building for over 1.7 million euros.
The Mafia Gets Involved
Now, remember Giovanni Spano’, who we mentioned earlier in the story?
At this point, Lai is back in Singapore and Calvaruso is travelling between Brazil and Italy. The police are also monitoring Spano’ and Catalano, who are closing deals around Palermo on behalf of Calvaruso and Lai respectively.
In more conversations the police intercept between the two, it comes up that Lai had already bought an agricultural plot of land in Misilmeri on the 16 January of 2018 for 710,000 euros, suggesting that business relations between the parties had started earlier than thought. But it is also likely that Lai had bought this first property through Catalano’s connections without first visiting the site.
The plot of land Lai acquired, showing the entrance and the ruin that needs renovations.
Investigations into that first transaction later reveal that the real estate company that facilitated the sale was owned by a woman called Francesca Sucato, daughter of Giusto Sucato and Vincenzo Sucato, two men charged for being key pieces of the Misilmeri mafia family. On top of that, one of the men who acted as a proxy for both Lai and Catalano was one Paolino Dalfone, Catalano’s cousin who has been previously been charged with robbery, theft, and the illegal possession of weapons.
Lai didn’t know it yet, but the mafia had long been entwined in his investments.
Worse yet, Dalfone, the real estate company, and Calvaruso were all part of different mafia families, placing Lai at the centre of a family war just waiting to explode.
In September, Catalano returned to Sicily to check on the progress of the agricultural land. In a phone call with a business consultant, he said: “Alan [Lai] doesn’t want to put his name [on the papers], neither those of his daughter, because he said: “Italy is a strange place.”
In the same call, they discussed alternative options, like setting up a trust or ad hoc companies to put the properties under.
The ruin Lai planned to renovate.
How Catalano Found Out He Was In Bed With The Mafia
On the whole, Lai has pretty much left Catalano to deal with the entire project. The plan is to restructure the plots—one of which has olive plantations that need revival—to then sell again for profit. But when Catalano starts looking for companies to grant the construction contracts to, things get sticky.
Calvaruso wants his construction company to be awarded the contract. However, Spano’ advises Catalano against this. The reason? Calvaruso was possibly facing jail time for mafia related charges.
Catalano’s world starts falling apart around him—had he been involved with the mafia all along? And worse, had he dragged his own trusted business partner into this mess? A wiretapped conversation from Spano’s car records the moment Catalano realises the extent of the situation.
Cruising through Palermo’s old alleyways, Spano’s Mercedes comes to a stop by a newsstand, where a monthly mafia newspaper titled ‘S’ sits outside their window.
“This is S! Do you see it? … It’s all about the mafia,” Spano’ says to Catalano.
“And what do they say about Calvaruso?” Catalano asks in a suspicious voice.
“The fact that he was … he was a … a real …”
“A what?” Catalano interrupts. “Someone’s right hand?”
“A predecessor,” Spano’ replies in a soft voice.
“And this means he is the boss!?” Catalano shouts, to which Spano’ confirms his suspicions.
“Fuck! What kind of people do you introduce me to?” Catalano says, raising his voice. “When you asked me to go out for a coffee when I came to Palermo, I wish we had never started this! It was all a mistake.”
Catalano and Spano'.
With all this finally out in the open, Catalano and Spano’ agree it would be unwise to grant Calvaruso the contract—if he suddenly went to jail, the project would be stalled indefinitely. At the same time, however, neither of them is willing to test Calvaruso’s boundaries by saying no to him.
So they come to a solution: they grant the contract to a man named Gaspare Scarpitta, who in turn subcontracts the project to Calvaruso’s construction company. This way, everyone gets a slice of the pie while Catalano can rest assured that the project will go on even if Calvaruso is incarcerated.
Lai, who was in Singapore at the time, remains in the dark about these developments.
How Does The Mafia Work?
It may be easy to say that Lai should have known better, but the reality is that Sicily works very differently than the rest of Italy and the world. One of the reasons the mafia has thrived is that it understands local Sicilian culture better than the central government. There are certain nuances in the way people operate there that they are just better able to maneuver.
For example, each mafia clan takes ownership of a certain neighbourhood, town, or region. Often, as ‘town leaders’, they are involved in every operation that happens in their zone of influence—sidestepping them is not always an option.
The full extent of this influence can be seen in what happened when the US invaded Sicily during World War II to liberate Italy from Fascist control. The US military went to Salvatore Luciano—also known as Lucky Luciano, a top mafia boss in both the US and Italy—for help. Luciano got his associates in Sicily to help the US navy draw maps of Sicilian harbours, and even acquired snapshots of the coastline. The mafia also aided the US military with interpretation, consulting, and with getting the local population on the side of the Americans.
Essentially, to do any sort of business in Sicily, one must understand that on the island the mafia is everywhere. They hold power over many local communities, so for businessmen who are aware of these dynamics, it is often in their best interest to work with them, rather than against them. For those who stumble on Sicilian shores with little understanding of the local context, it may not be unusual to become unwittingly involved.
The ruin.
The Big Mistake: Getting Multiple Mafia Families In On The Same Deal
With the construction contract ordeal out of the way, Calvaruso and Spano’ discuss architecture, floorplans, carpentry, and various other plans to do with the property. This happens over several days, and just as things get going again, another individual reappears, itching to get involved with the renovations: Dalfone, Catalano’s cousin.
When Dalfone finds out he hasn’t been awarded the contract, he chains up the gate of Lai’s property so no one can enter. According to investigators, this was a ‘clearly intimidating mafia-eque message’.
Confused, and seeking explanations about this, police tap Spano’s phone again for possible answers—which they get.
Spano’ reveals to a man that Dalfone had been extorting money from the investment.
“What the fuck does he want? Wasn’t what he stole from them [Lai] enough?” the man says, alluding to how Dalfone had taken a cut of that first agricultural plot purchased in 2018 when acting as a proxy.
“He is making them [the Singaporeans] not want to invest here!” Spano’ continues.
The entrance to the property that was chained.
Soon after, it becomes apparent that when acting as a proxy for the sale, Dalfone hadn’t settled things with the mafia in Misilmeri, where Lai’s property was located. Considering territorial mafia dynamics, this would explain why the clan got aggressive about operations continuing in ‘their area’.
Spano’ also says that Catalano had given Dalfone 6,000 euros to get Lai’s newly acquired land cleaned, money he kept without completing the job.
Extremely fed up at this point, Catalano tells Spano’ that Lai is seriously considering withdrawing from the project entirely: “These people are fed up because they want to do something nice, but now they don’t want to invest. They are good people, and now they are in a tank of sharks.”
What Will Lai Do Now?
Currently, Lai still owns the various properties in Sicily. He told RICE that renovations have not progressed since last year with Covid-19 erupting, and most recently, due to the arrest of Calvaruso and Spano’.
All Lai wanted was a simple, straightforward business holiday. When he saw how beautiful Sicily was, he saw the potential to invest. This all came crashing down for him when just one month ago the arrests of Calvaruso and Spano’ brought the entire mafia ordeal to light.
When RICE first reached out, Lai said that “the situation is bad enough and I was hoping I could at least help Italy with the projects. Everything that happened then sent a chill through me.”
Now, he needs to decide on what his next steps will be. Continue with the projects and hope to stay clear of the mafia? Or sell and withdraw from everything entirely?
While not an easy decision to make, this scenario is proof that to make it big, one must take risks. Lai is a businessman who has invested in companies internationally and locally, from ship brokering to dance and music, F&B, spas and wellness, and many more. In many ventures he has succeeded, but what happened in Sicily is proof that to win some, you may lose some.
Things may not always work out, but sometimes, you get a cool ass story about dealing the mafia you get to share with your grandchildren someday.

The recent #blacklivesmatter protests brought to the world’s attention the racial crisis in America, where racism can be a daily occurrence, with even killings and police brutality taking place. In contrast, we here in Singapore live in relative racial harmony, and racial differences here in our sunny island thankfully do not have such a savage calibre. However, before we pick at how our neighbours do the dusting, we might need to ensure that we, first, have a clean house. In this OP-ED, I hope to check under the proverbial rug and see if, perhaps, there are unconscious racism and racial stereotypes ingrained in our culture, and why it is important to address them.
To have privilege refers to having certain social advantages, prestige or respect by virtue of belonging to a certain social identity group. In Singapore, the Chinese make up 76.2% of our population. As a majority race, I wonder if we have what is commonly dubbed as “Chinese Privilege”.
To put things into perspective, I found this checklist online by The Octant to help determine if we have “Chinese privilege”:
I can turn on the television or open up the newspaper and see people of my race widely represented.
When I am told about our national heritage or about civilisation, I am shown that mostly people of my colour made it what it is.
I can go into a music shop and count on finding the music of my race represented, in a hawker centre and find the foods that fit with my cultural traditions, into a cinema and find films in my mother tongue or at least subtitled in it.
I can choose concealer, blemish, cover or bandages in flesh colour that more or less match my skin.
When I went through the checklist, I realised that I myself tick all the boxes, and thus recognize that I do have Chinese Privilege. I grew up in a very Chinese household and watching Channel 8 dramas was a big part of my childhood. Every newspaper I saw in my house had a Chinese actor printed on the front page. I never felt that I was not being represented enough in the mainstream media. Most recently, in school, because of COVID-19, many canteen stores closed early, but I never needed to worry about not eating something that suited my taste buds. However, my classmates of other races and religions couldn’t say the same. When the only two stores that sold food that they could eat closed early, and they had to settle for something that either didn’t make them full, or just drink a cup of Milo, or have nothing at all for recess.
Next, I took to Twitter and asked my friends from the minority races to message me if they had experienced any struggles that their Chinese counterparts didn’t. I got a few messages sharing their various experiences.
Faith (not her real name) shared with me that she had to throw away her food because her Chinese classmates said it smelled “weird”.
Vivian (not her real name) said that sometimes she feels that she doesn’t fit in, and that growing up, she felt that people didn’t take her culture seriously, and saw it as a “joke”.
Li, who is not Singaporean, but has lived in Singapore for a while, said that she felt a lot of discrimination, self-doubt and her mental health took a huge toll as a result. She said: “Unlike most Singaporeans, who had a “Singlish” accent, I had a very “American” one”. When I was still going to a local school, I would get bullied for my accent and appearance. I continuously bullied myself for how I looked as well. I was ashamed of myself and felt as though I would never be as pretty as the Chinese girls in my class with long black hair and pale skin. The bullying got to the point where I wanted to end my own life.”
These honest, and perhaps not often heard, sharing made me reflect on how I treated or acted around the minority races while I was younger and ignorant. I myself made racist jokes, thinking that they were just jokes that meant no harm. I laughed and added on to the jokes that my mainly Chinese friend group cracked. Until this day, I still have things to learn. The truth is, we all still have things to learn.
The government has tried many ways to promote “racial togetherness” such as making Racial Harmony Day compulsory in most mainstream schools. The Ethnic Integration Policy (EIP) implemented in all HDBs in Singapore established ethnic quotas for HDB neighbourhoods and blocks, and aimed to ensure a better racial mix in HDB estates. However, in our modern society, many Singaporeans do not interact or even acknowledge their neighbours. According to a Straits Times face-to-face poll of 3,066 Singaporeans, permanent residents and non-residents, only 23 per cent said they exchanged greetings with their neighbours more than three times a week, down from 29 per cent in from 2016
So this begs the question, does the EIP really prove effective in ensuring that different races mingle together? Or do Singaporeans still continue to mingle with people of the same race and continue to ignore their neighbours of different races, effectively defeating the main aim of EIP?
Casual racism can even extend to the workplace. While the Ministry of Manpower encourages fair employment practices, for many ethnic minorities in Singapore, even something as simple of having a “Malay sounding” or “Indian sounding” name can be a direct turn off to the employer, and they may not even have the chance to get an interview. According to a CNA survey, a large proportion of minorities – 73% of Malays, 68% of Indians and about half of others, which includes Eurasians – felt that they had experienced discrimination when it came to applying for a job. In contrast, only 38% of Chinese felt that way.
To get into the specific details and obstacles minorities face when applying for jobs, I interviewed some of my friends. I asked my friend, Karen (not her real name), about the struggles she faced finding a job. She shared: “My old agency which managed part time banquet workers saw that I was a Muslim and asked me if I wore the hijab, and said that it would be good if I didn’t wear one”. In another instance, when she checked with her employer if the food was halal, the response was “it should be”. However, when she was eating her food, “I realized the sausages were weird. They had some weird plastic wrapping around it and I remembered my friends telling me how pork sausages looked like that. I spat out my food and worked on an empty stomach at 7am.” When she emailed the agency, her concerns were dismissed.
Despite all the lengths the government has gone to make Singapore as “racially harmonic” as possible, the grim truth is that ridding Singapore of any form of racial discrimination or casual racism is not something that can happen overnight, in the next couple months, or even years. Racism is a systemic thing – there is not a single person or entity to blame for this. However, systemic racism shows a lack of concern for the needs of the minorities, and creates an environment where those of minority races in our society can feel neglected and disrespected.
However, having privilege does not mean that we need to have “privilege blindness”. So, what can you do to help out, as someone with Chinese Privilege?
Firstly, recognize the fact that you have privilege. Educate yourself on the privilege you have and what you should or should not do. Call out friends and family who are being insensitive and cracking racist jokes or are being casually racist, and educate them on why they should not do these things. My own classmates have personally made many of these “casual racism jokes”, and I have tried to call them out and educate them, and those that refused to listen were dealt with strictly by the teachers.
Secondly, weaponize your privilege. Make your voice heard, and speak up for those who might feel silenced by society. When you see someone being racially discriminated against, be it online or in real life, do not hesitate to step in. Utilize your privilege to stop and disengage whatever discrimination was going on.
Together, with each step forward, I believe Singapore can be a better place for all, where everyone is valued and judgements are made based on one’s character, actions and values, not someone’s race, religion or ethnicity.

"In Phase 2, Migrant Workers Battle Financial Fears And A Mental Health Crisis",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-migrant-workers-phase-2-financial-fears-mental-health/,4-Aug-20,"All photos in this story were taken before the circuit breaker.
The last time Feroz* set foot outside his dormitory was in early April. For nearly four months, he has not been to Little India, the shipyard where he works, or even the other end of his dormitory compound.
After the circuit breaker kicked in on April 7, Feroz, a Bangladeshi migrant worker, watched as chaos descended on his Tuas dormitory and the place went into lockdown. With cases climbing day by day, he was moved to a room in another block in mid-April, meant for residents who had been exposed to the virus.
He has been there ever since.
For the last four months, he and his roommates have left their room only to collect their meals and use the bathroom. From his window, they can see barricades lining the compound; the blocks have been separated into red, green, and yellow zones depending on residents’ status. Optimism is in short supply.
“Still we don’t know what going on, and next day where we will be,” he tells me.
After Covid-19 hit the dormitories, early response efforts might be best characterised as disaster relief, focused on testing, controlling the outbreak, and keeping everyone fed and provided for. These initial challenges have been gradually resolved, only to be replaced by a different set of problems—some deadlier and harder to tackle than the virus itself.
Getting back to work
On July 25, it was reported that all dormitories are finally expected to be cleared of Covid-19 by August 7, apart from 17 blocks in several purpose-built facilities still serving as isolation quarters.
An MOM representative confirmed that this covers all migrant workers in purpose-built dormitories (PBDs), factory-converted dormitories (FCDs), and temporary living quarters. Due to the size of the PBDs, the biggest of which house tens of thousands of workers, clearance is done on a block-by-block basis to avoid holding the whole dorm up.
Although the process is nearly finished, and more men are expected to go back to work soon, being ‘cleared’ simply refers to a dormitory (or block) being declared free of Covid. It does not mean that men can immediately start work.
Nazmul*, who lives in a cleared PBD in Woodlands, estimated that around 30-40% of his dorm’s residents’ had returned to work at the time of our conversation. (He was not among them.) Being stuck in limbo has been agonizing for men like him and Feroz, who tested negative some time ago, but still don’t know when they can resume work.
The agencies involved have been working on a mammoth task under several constraints, and with extensive testing efforts, things have improved in the last few weeks. Nonetheless, migrant workers, employers, and community advocates I spoke to alike, while acknowledging the immense scale of the clearance process, expressed deep frustration over how it was managed.
By their accounts, the last few months have been a confusing mess, hampered by multiple communication failures and information gaps.
Several sources brought up inconsistencies and delays in how swab test results were communicated, particularly between the May—July period. (Accounts of administrative errors and delays with test results have also been reported elsewhere.)
Men were not always promptly informed that they had tested negative, adding to the chaos. They assumed this only because they had not been sent for treatment or heard otherwise, sometimes for as long as a few weeks, until their Covid status was confirmed. (Migrant workers can currently check this in an app, FWMOMCare, which allows them to check their health status and request teleconsultations.)
Even then, positive test results were not always promptly communicated. An owner of an engineering construction company, who asked to be known only as Ms Lee, claimed that her workers did not know they were Covid-positive for nearly 3-4 weeks after their swab tests.
They only learned this in mid-July, when they received letters from MOH explaining that they had in fact tested positive, but were no longer infectious because the isolation period had ended. The company had not known either, and only found out when the workers told them about the letters.
“You can’t imagine, we were all so angry and disappointed. I understand the dorm is locked down and not cleared yet, but as a mark of respect to the individuals … If someone’s positive he deserves to know, and not only tell him after he’s recovered,” she said.
After a dorm (or block) is cleared, a three-part administrative process must be completed before the men are allowed to work. Complicating matters is that even after this, work clearance status can change day-to-day, depending on whether the migrant worker has been re-exposed to the virus.
Ability to work has to be monitored daily via an app feature called Accesscode: green means go, red means no. (The feature was one of several apps, like FWMOMCare, which were rolled out by MOM and MOH to help improve access to information.)
While the measures are understandable, in view of preparing for a further wave of infections, the volatility has also caused headaches across the construction industry.
Ms Lee described how, just on the morning of our interview, her workers’ Accesscode statuses had all turned red around 6:00AM. “We all panicked, because work had already been arranged and scheduled,” she said.
They later learned that some residents at her workers’ dorm had been found to be infected, so the entire dorm was closed off as a precautionary measure. Ms Lee’s workers, who were not in the affected block, were eventually released around 10:00 or 11:00AM.
“You have to rearrange transport, explain to the clients … it affects business very badly,” she said.
A director of a construction company I spoke to, who declined to be named citing nondisclosure restrictions, shared that he had heard accounts of similar incidents. The disruptions, he added, were particularly ruinous for sub-contractors, for whom flexibility is key.
“I wouldn’t necessarily call [the response] heavy-handed, because if I were in the government’s shoes I would probably do the same thing,” he said.
“But I feel there has been a lack of empathy for what contractors are facing. And it’s hard on the workers. It’s hard for everyone.”

The deeper crisis: mental health
Beneath the battle against the virus is an even darker contagion.
In late May, migrant worker NGOs I reached out to unanimously expected their casework loads to rise, highlighting mental health as a major area of concern. They anticipated that delays in returning to work, the spectre of job losses, and a growing sense of powerlessness would be devastating for migrant workers’ mental health.
All this has unfortunately come to pass. Since April, NGOs and aid groups have seen a rise in migrant worker suicides, suicide attempts and ideation, and self-harm. Reports of such incidents have also been circulating in the press and on social media.
Sharif*, a migrant worker who is actively involved in volunteering within the community, and has helped counsel many fellow migrants, put it this way: “The situation is getting more normal day by day, but mental health is getting worse.”
(The morning of our interview, a video began circulating on social media of a migrant worker, allegedly from the Leo dormitory in Kaki Bukit, attempting to jump from his block. Two nights later, while I was working on this piece, a source closely involved in aid efforts informed me that another man attempted suicide on Sunday morning.)
Representatives from Healthserve told me they had observed a spike in anxiety amongst workers in June. While there was a slight drop in case numbers going into July, the intensity of the cases increased. The NGO has counselled around 700 migrant workers between mid-April to July.
They cited various reasons for this, including financial woes, worrying for their families back home in Bangladesh and India (where Covid-19 cases have ballooned), and the lack of information. However, what many have found most distressing is the absence of a clear timeline, causing a growing sense of helplessness—even abandonment—as the wait drags on, and on, and on.
Similar to how many Singaporeans felt when the circuit-breaker was extended in May, many migrant workers have been agitated by a sense that the goalposts keep moving. The Healthserve representatives shared that many workers were confused when their Stay-Home Notices expired, but they could not return to work—and when the circuit-breaker itself was lifted in June, and still nothing changed. Though the end might finally be in sight, the August 7 announcement was yet another double-edged sword.
“They keep using the dates as something to look forward to, like a checkpoint, but when it doesn’t happen and they don’t get released they feel so frustrated,” they said.
“Some have said things like, “We’ve been left to die, we feel like prisoners, we’re trapped.” Others don’t even want to talk to their families any more, because they feel low and don’t know how to explain what they’re going through.”
“Right now, mental health support is more important than food.”
Confinement has been particularly brutal for men in isolation in hotel rooms or cruise ships, where an endless wait— with no company but their own thoughts—wears away at even the strongest. Sharif described it as ‘worse than jail’.
Men in these facilities were mostly moved out there on account of being over 45 and high-risk. Those who tested positive were later moved out for treatment, but those who were negative were kept there—largely because, Sharif suspects, there might not have been anywhere for them to go. “If their dorm is still not clear, then they can’t go back. But where to put them?”
He described an attempted suicide case he had helped with just a few nights before, involving a man who had been isolated in a hotel room for nearly three months.
“I was very worried. When I talk to him he is not balanced, it’s like his brain can twist in a few seconds and he will jump,” he said.
“He told me, I’ve been living 3 months alone in a single room, I cannot tahan any more, I cannot sleep. If someone doesn’t bring me out tonight, I would rather die than stay here.”
According to the Healthserve representatives, the number of suicide assessments they conducted tripled in the week before we spoke. (They stressed, however, that the cases they see represent the extreme end of the spectrum, and that self-harm and suicide ideation have increased nationally, not solely within the migrant community.)
Still from I Dream of Singapore (2019).
Despite months of intense community lobbying, it is unclear how, or when, the government plans to increase support for migrants’ mental health.
To date, there has been no explicit governmental action plan or timeline for one. When contacted for comment, an MOM representative referred me to their response to a Parliamentary Question from ex-NMP Anthea Ong from June 5, which mostly mentions NGO-led efforts.
Anthea, a prominent advocate for both mental health and the migrant community, believes that the mental health sector should be roped in to boost early-intervention care. Employers and operators also need to be involved in developing suicide prevention protocols.
“A holistic and coordinated response is urgently needed with upstream and downstream measures,” she told me, stressing the importance of educating migrant workers on early detection.
“Simply giving them hotlines to call without ‘teaching’ them how to identify warning signs in themselves and others is not going to effectively prevent more tragedies.”
Healthserve has also recommended that migrant workers’ access to both Covid-19 and mental health support be increased, and that cross-sector escalation and referral workflows are developed.
Echoing Anthea’s sentiments, Sharif emphasised that migrant workers’ mental health must be urgently prioritised.
“You have 300,000 workers. Some are strong but not all. Even the organisations who are involved can only help a few at a time. What is there now is not enough to be effective,” he said.
“After 3-4 months you need to help normalise the stress and anxiety before people can go back to work. All this is happening now because the longer the wait the higher the stress, they need help to transition,” he insisted.
“Right now, mental health support is more important than food.”
Still from I Dream of Singapore (2019).
Freedom of movement
While more migrant workers will be able to go back to work soon, the community will continue to face movement restrictions for some time.
On June 2, amendments to the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act (EFMA) in the form of subsidiary legislation took effect. Key amongst the changes are clauses which state that migrant workers cannot leave their dormitories except with the permission of MOM and their employers, for medical treatment, or if required to evacuate. (They also make it a legal requirement for workers to ‘practice good hygiene’, ‘minimise physical interactions with other individuals’, and ‘keep their living space clean and tidy’.)
NGOs and migrant advocacy groups, while acknowledging the public health concerns, have been deeply alarmed by the changes.
These include fears over abuse of power, given how the changes effectively give employers absolute discretion over workers’ freedom to leave their dormitories, and whether adequate consideration has been given to their impact on migrant workers’ welfare and mental health.
“Migrant workers have faced far more draconian measures than everyone else … They know their employers forbid them from leaving their accommodation, and many have been threatened with severe punishments including deportation and blacklisting. This definitely instills fear, compounded by uncertainty. Clarity is lacking, not only in communication, but in the law itself,” said representatives from HOME.
Beyond the distress of confinement, movement restrictions have already caused significant difficulties for many migrant workers. Nazmul, for example, told me that his Work Permit expires in early August, but he has not heard if it will be renewed, and is trying to find a new job from his dorm.
HOME shared that they have heard from men facing similar difficulties, as well as others who were prevented from attending medical appointments or going to seek help at MOM.
MOM has since clarified that employers must ensure migrant workers only leave their dorms when their AccessCode statuses are green, to seek medical treatment (regardless of AccessCode status) or where required to evacuate, but cannot unilaterally restrict their movements for any other reasons. They also stated that the changes were communicated to employers, dormitory operators, and migrant workers.
Nonetheless, advocates remain worried over how aware migrant workers are of the measures. There is also a lack of clarity over how long the measures will remain in place, given that they have been formally entrenched in legislation.
MOM has indicated that the measures should be temporary, stating that the restrictions will be eased when infection levels within and outside the dormitories have remained low for a sufficient period of time, and that they will “amend or remove the work pass conditions when they are no longer relevant or necessary.”
However, it is unclear when this might be, or what it will be conditional on—or the toll the extra wait might take.
Salaries and job losses: the worst is yet to come
On top of all this, there is a consensus that the full brunt of Covid-19 has yet to be felt. Beneath the desire to get back to work are deeper, more disquieting fears: will we be paid? Will there even be jobs to go back to?
Of the four migrant workers I spoke to for this piece, two had received their basic pay for April to July, while the other two had pay cuts of 25%—50%. Although the latter felt the reductions were understandable, given that they had not been to work—and all of them were glad to have been paid at all—they were extremely anxious that things would deteriorate.
HOME shared that they had seen cases of unpaid wages over the circuit breaker, on top of workers who had had their permits cancelled shortly before and were left destitute. Similarly, both Ms Lee and the anonymous director, while stressing that they took their salary payment commitments seriously, were worried about the sustainability of the situation.
“Construction is basically cash flow management,” the director told me. He explained that main construction projects are paid monthly, while payments for subcontracting work arrive about three months afterwards. As a result, up till June, his company was still receiving money for work done between January to March.
But since no work was done from April to July, unless they can start work soon, they will have zero income for July to October. In essence, the company is hemorrhaging money, but none is coming in.
To help the beleaguered sector, the government waived the foreign worker levy and provided rebates of up to $750 per worker between the April—July period. (On August 1, shortly after my interviews, it was announced that the waiver and rebates would be extended till December 2020 and September 2020 respectively following industry pressure.)
While the assistance has been critical, it is unclear whether it will be enough, particularly once the levy is reinstated and the rebates are reduced to $90 per worker. The director pointed out that this amounts to only a fraction of the levy, and will not even cover a worker’s accommodation fees. To cover his outgoings, he has had to take out bridging loans, on top of the government assistance.
The bitter upshot of all this is that job losses are inevitable. When flights to India and Bangladesh resume, he anticipates that many companies will send workers back. NGOs fear that after months of anxiety and desperation, this could prove the tipping point for even more men.
“The construction sector was always headed for a meltdown, but Covid brought it forward,” the director said. “I would assume that most employers want to treat their workers well, though not all do. But in this climate, I think a lot of good employers are going to be forced to do things they’re not proud of.”
The worst part, he added, is that recently-arrived workers with little experience are likely to suffer most.
“Migrant workers are often the breadwinners for their families, but as a boss, if you have to let someone go, of course it’s the new guy rather than the one with 8 years’ experience,” he said.
“And you know how much they have to pay in agent fees to come here. The new guy probably won’t even have paid off his debts.”

Feroz eventually tested negative for the virus around late June. Today, he and his roommates continue their wait for news: whether they will be moved out, when they can go back to work. In the meantime, the days tick by identically.
On the morning of Hari Raya Haji, I ask if he’s planning to celebrate in any way. “Nope, just morning I pray, and [sleep] back”, he texts back, adding a laugh-crying emoji.
Months of unstinting grimness have driven many migrant workers to the brink. For men accustomed to hard labour, they are not immune to despair or grief; they have their moments of hopelessness like all of us.
Still, while their suffering must not be normalised, the crisis has also brought out the community’s extraordinary resilience.
There’s Sharif, taking calls from desperate countrymen in the middle of the night. Nazmul, who insists that he loves Singapore, and wants to stay here and work. Nasir*, another migrant friend, tells me that dance has kept him sane through the darkness of the last few months. “I can’t explain … only I know when I dance I [feel] very happy and enjoy. Nothing come my head inside,” he texts me (also adding a laugh-crying emoji).
To pass the time, Feroz writes songs, or studies for an engineering course he’s taking. In the evenings, he plays Bengali folk songs on his guitar to try to lift his roommates’ spirits.
“I’m all right, cause I have my guitar with me I can make music … I’m used to stay alone cause I’m a lyrics writer, I have my own world,” he texts me.
“But I dunno about the others. They look so different. Worried. Mentally [their] situation is not good.”
We reached out to MOH for comment, but did not receive a response in time for publication. We will update the piece accordingly if a response is received.

As National Day Approaches, A Fresh Grad Reflects On 'Non-Essential' Art In Singapore",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
"Covid-19 News is Making Some Singaporeans So Anxious, They’ve Blocked It From Their Newsfeeds",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-covid-19-news/,23-Mar-20,"All images from RICE File Photos unless otherwise stated.
All names have been changed to protect the individuals’ privacy.
Singapore’s nightly Covid-19 updates used to give Joash anxiety attacks. As 8 PM approached, he would get nauseous, lose his appetite, and obsessively refresh CNA and his Twitter feed. When the number of new Covid-19 cases was released, his anxiety would spike as dread mutated into despair.
Seeking reassurance, he would proceed to peruse additional resources on Covid-19: progress on a vaccine; the fatality rate for specific age groups; transmission rates in different climates … The internet is inundated with Covid-19 content, so he loses himself in the process for up to an hour.
But the material is rarely positive. So his anxiety feeds on itself.
One day, he decided to stop reading any news about Covid-19.

When Joash told me about his struggle with Covid-19 anxiety and his self-prescribed medication for it, I felt a surge of bile in my throat. Isn’t it the socially responsible thing to stay updated on the prognosis of the pandemic?
It’s not that I have no sympathy for Joash’s anxiety. A pandemic is raging across the world. Hospitals, lacking sufficient ventilators, have to choose who lives and who dies. Anyone who doesn’t feel anxious is a robot or a coronavirus in disguise.
Indeed, the Singapore Counselling Centre tells RICE that they “have seen an increase of clients seeking assistance to overcome their fears and depression over the Covid-19”.
Similarly, The Guardian reports that Crisis Text Line, a text-based counselling service in the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada, has been swamped by new clients who are dealing with Covid-19 anxiety.
But I don’t know if running away from the source of your anxiety is the best way to deal with it—and I’m saying this from the perspective of someone who has spent months of his life in a counsellor’s room trying to figure out why he’s so fucking anxious all the time.
So I ask around to find out how other people are coping with Covid-19 anxiety. To my surprise, Joash isn’t alone in banishing Covid-19 from his newsfeed because of mental health concerns.
Daniel, a 28-year-old accountant, used to keep up with Covid-19 updates daily by reading The Straits Times and other news sites. About a week ago, however, he decided to avoid Covid-19 news because his sense of defeat and futility was growing with every article he read.
“I feel a bit jaded at this point … I’ve accepted that things will never be the same again.”
The reason why Xiu Fen, a 27-year-old lawyer, has muted all Covid-19 news is as straightforward: reading about it made her depressed.
“Every day, it’s just numbers and deaths getting higher and higher … Nobody really knows anything,” she says.
I reply, “But you won’t know if people know something if you don’t read about Covid-19.”
A moment passes as she fiddles with the straw of her milk tea.
“I know this year is bleak. I don’t need someone to tell me that.”
After checking out of the Covid-19 narrative, Joash, Daniel, and Xiu Fen are much … well, they’re not happier. Not reading about something doesn’t make it go away.
But they can go about their days without being paralysed by the sense of helplessness which previously pervaded their lives. The anxiety still burns, but it’s now low and slow, like an ember, not an inferno that stops them in their tracks. Instead of obsessing over the abstract fear conjured by news reports, they can focus on practical ways to manage the viral threat, they say.
My initial impression, then, is wrong: not reading Covid-19 news is not a socially irresponsible act.
Yes, combating a pandemic is a community effort. Everyone needs to stay updated on the virus’s modes of transmission, mitigation measures like social distancing, proper personal hygiene, and so on.
But do we really need to know about the hoarding situation in Milan, how the US is not adequately testing people, or what the daily Covid-19 number is?
After my conversations, I realise that, at this point of the virus’s progression, we already have at hand all the information we need on how we as individuals can help to combat its spread. All three people I spoke to are doing their part to flatten the curve. Any extraneous information is purely, well, extraneous. An additional log of firewood you throw into the blaze.
Image from WHO's advisory, ""Coping with stress during the 2019-nCoV outbreak"" / WHO
They might not have done it with the World Health Organization’s advice in mind, but during the course of writing this article, I found out that limiting our consumption of Covid-19 news is exactly what it recommends.
“A near-constant stream of news reports about an outbreak can cause anyone to feel anxious or distressed,” the WHO reports, so “avoid watching, reading or listening to [them]” and “seek information mainly to take practical steps to prepare your plans and protect yourself and loved ones.”
There’s nothing irresponsible, then, about avoiding Covid-19 news. Nor should there be any shame or stigma attached to that, with the big caveat that you are adequately informed on mitigation measures and do not act like one of those idiotic people who were taking holidays in Vietnam because “tickets very cheap now”.
The pandemic is reminding us how valuable our physical health is. But, as Joash, Daniel, and Xiu Fen have made me realise, it should not come at the cost of our mental health. There’s no shame in prioritising our well-being; it’s completely fine to exit the Covid-19 conversation to take care of ourselves.
Watch a movie under the blanket, drink a cup of hot chamomile tea, and mute all mentions of Covid-19 on your newsfeeds.
And stay home.
If you are feeling anxious about Covid-19, you can schedule a video counselling call with the Singapore Counselling Centre or Silver Ribbon or have an online, text-based session with Fei Yue Community Services.
The Guardian also has a list of things you can do to help manage any Covid-19-related anxiety.

Schools Reopening During Covid-19: 2 Parents at RICE Debate MOE’s Decision",Yeo Boon Ping,TRUE,TRUE
The Myth Of The Filthy Migrant,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-the-myth-of-the-filthy-migrant/,12-Apr-20,"This week, as 140 cases doubled into 287, we were forced to take a sobering look at the dismal living conditions inside worker’s dormitories like S11 Punggol.
Two very different responses emerged. On one side, anger and dismay. On the other, people blamed the migrant workers themselves. The dorms were dirty, they argued, not because we have crammed too many people into inadequate facilities, but because the workers themselves are inherently disgusting and irresponsible. They have “different hygiene standards” from Singaporeans, and “they should learn to clean up after themselves”.
This is some next-level irony. Singaporeans telling migrant workers to clean up after themselves when they are employed here precisely because we cannot clean up after ourselves. As if our toilets and airports owe their gleaming reputation to some magical Singaporean instinct for hygiene, rather than a ready supply of migrant labour.
It’s hard to keep communal spaces clean. Harder still if the spaces are overcrowded and ill-equipped to begin with. Why we can accept this for public toilets in shopping malls, but not for public toilets in dormitories, I cannot say. However, I seriously doubt that 160 Singaporeans sharing a single toilet will somehow produce a radically different outcome. Last I checked, we are not a nation of rainbow-farting unicorns.
“Incurably filthy”
What should really dismay us is not the latest round of accusations, but how the idea of ‘The Filthy Migrant’ has persisted for centuries in Singapore. For as long as people have been immigrating to Singapore, others have been accusing them of disgusting habits and lax sanitary standards.
Many of the comments this week would not be out-of-place in 1843.
In colonial Singapore, the main target of such accusations were Chinese coolies, who came here to work— to die—in the thousands. Packed into airless shophouse cubicles, they succumbed to cholera, dysentery, tuberculosis, typhoid, smallpox, and a host of other infectious diseases. The conditions were so bad, coolies would often flee their lodgings when their colleagues began dying, or else they would dump the corpse unceremoniously for the police.
The response from the municipal authority was a mix of hand-wringing and racism. While some health officers advocated for reform, many others blamed the coolies instead of their living conditions. In Contesting Space In Colonial Singapore, Prof. Brenda Yeoh provides a thorough account of how blame was heaped upon the ‘asiatics’.
Failed social distancing, China street. Source: Roots.sg
Sir David J Galloway, founder of the Straits Medical Association blamed many epidemics on the Chinese “talent” for “huddling together”—as if coolies were agoraphobics who preferred windowless shophouses to spacious mansions. He also claimed that “Chinamen” were “the most insanitary of mortals”. Chinese cities, which he had not visited, were nothing more than “instances of filth”.
Where it was not possible to blame just the Chinese, colonial officers broadened their criticism to a notion of “Asiatic insanitation”. Asiatic habits, like a dislike for “air in his dwelling-house”, and a “carelessness regarding the removal of excreta”, made Singapore a hopeless “pigsty”.
What’s remarkable about such filthy stereotypes was their total incoherence—even by the standards of the early 1900s. In one telling anecdote, our Dr Galloway condemns Muslims for their poor hygiene and accidentally criticises himself in the process. In his report, he writes that there was “nothing in the Mohammedan religion which tends towards sanitation”, citing “frequent ablutions” as an example of how the Muslims were contaminating the water supply.
So, the Chinese were filthy because of their “scant love for soap and water”, while the Muslims were filthy because they washed too often, and thus fouled up the water. There’s really no way to win this game, is there?
Estate workers. Source: New Straits Times
However, the British Empire was nothing if not an equal opportunities bigot. What’s interesting is how the stigma of filth shifted according to circumstance and necessity. When the Spanish flu swept through South-east Asia in 1918, it hit the Tamil migrant population in Malaysia particularly hard. The death rate amongst Indians was 83/1000, or more than double the mortality rate for Chinese or Malays.
The narrative shifted accordingly. The Indian migrant populace, which had previously been a ‘model minority’ in terms of hygiene and public health, suddenly found themselves under attack and transformed into filthy animals.
It was their “unhygienic eating and bathing habits”, alongside their “racial weakness” which accounted for the high infection rates. Perak’s medical officer, one Dr. J.W. Field blamed the death rates on the Tamil community’s “unhygienic and imbalanced dietary habit”, as well as their “natural indolence”. The colonial media likewise suggested that the Spanish flu had spread from “the Indian subcontinent via migrant workers”.
No evidence was ever found to support such a claim. In its panic, the British Empire even got its racial stereotypes mixed up. The ‘lazy’ Malay and the disgusting ‘Chinaman’ combined to become the lazy, disgusting Tamil. One wonders, of course, how these negative traits had eluded them before the pandemic. The reason should be quite clear: filth is never about filth, it’s always about politics. By blaming the flu’s spread on the ‘unhygienic’ personal habits of Tamils, it effectively absolves the government from blame and future responsibility.
Not only is it not their own fault they died, you also don’t have to address the root cause of the infection’s spread: overcrowded, poorly-built housing. After all, why make the “financial sacrifice” when “oriental stubbornness” and “hereditary Chinese instinct” will undo all of your good efforts by “clinging to dirt”?
You can’t fix broken people, so the colonial government never did. Many of the diseases remained endemic until independence.
“These People”
In conclusion: The Filthy Migrant is an incredibly versatile figure. Not only can he absolve you of your responsibility, he can also change his race/religion according to what you require. If your Chinese population is diseased, he is a Chinaman. If Covid-19 is spreading like wildfire amongst the Bangladeshi and Tamil S-pass holders, then he is an “irresponsible” man who “cannot clean up after himself” and has a “generally lower awareness of hygiene”.
Sadly, The Filthy Migrant does not actually exist—except in the racist imagination.
Some migrant workers are dirty. Some are clean. One worker I spoke to was utterly dismayed by the number of cockroaches inside his dorm. However, to label “these people” or any group of people filthy is plainly bad. Unfortunately, it is also very profitable, or else it would not continue. Such narratives of filth served the British well when they wanted to avoid costly public health reforms. That practice persists today. The Filthy Migrant is here so we do not have to shoulder the financial burden of reform; so the cost savings can be had and shared.
As the historical record shows, almost every group has been stigmatised at some point. The filth is not inherent to anyone. We’ve just failed to provide sanitary conditions for migrant workers—for approximately 200 years. We’ve celebrated the bicentennial, but we’ve yet to disown the beliefs we inherited from the British. And as the current crisis in worker’s dormitories shows, we’ve got a long way to go yet.

“There’s Nothing to Lose”: Why Two 21-Year-Olds Set Up Their Own Vintage Clothing Store,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-vintage-clothing-21-year-olds/,13-Aug-20,"All images by Thaddeus Loh for RICE Media.
“When I interned at Bosch during poly, I felt so lost in the hundreds and thousands of people, and I just did the same thing every day,” Gayle laments, “Being my own boss … I don’t feel like a slave to anyone.”
She’s 21 years old this year and co-owns Jiggythings, a vintage clothing store that has been around since April 2018.
Andy*, who’s also 21, chimes in, “I definitely don’t want to work an office job. I want to be on the field. My intern (sic) during poly was at Audi. I did SAP and ERP system, it was damn boring, I couldn’t take it.”
“I guess having a 9 to 5 job is practical since you will have a stable income. But I don’t want to be there just for the pay … then everyday go home feel so dried out. And by the time you realise you’re already in your 40s,” Gayle adds.
This mentality is characteristic of Gen Zs. A Universum Global study found that 36% of the (50,000) Gen Z respondents fear being stuck in careers that limit their opportunities for development. In other words, they don’t want to be restricted or defined by their jobs.
“We didn’t start Jiggythings for the money. We started out by sharing our personal favourite vintage collections on Carousell, so that we could clear our closet as well.” From there, they realised there was a market for selling what they love.
They also didn’t have any financial support to start Jiggythings. Instead they relied on their own savings.
Andy used to re-sell Supreme during poly: “I saved up on that money and used it to do this. All the money I earned was pumped back into this, I didn’t keep it for myself.”
As a brand that prides itself on providing relatively affordable vintage clothing, I wondered how the business managed to stay afloat as well.
“I don’t think we saw green for the first five to six months,” Andy says.
“We make minimal profit from our items … and focus on quantity. Just like a supermarket, you know? That’s how I’d like to think of the business. Lower the price a bit but the turnover is faster, so more items can come in,” he explains.
He goes on to elaborate on their strategy by comparing their prices to H&M or Cotton On, since they’re all reasonably priced. While browsing through the clothes in their store, I’m surprised to see most shirts priced within the 20 to 30-dollar range. The same shirt would’ve easily cost around $50 in other vintage stores.
Gayle clarifies, “It’s not that we don’t care about money, but we don’t want to be entirely profit-driven. Profit isn’t our main goal. We just want to have something we enjoy as our job.”
To her, building relationships and interacting with their customers are the best parts of the job: “It’s like we’ve built a community.”
For Andy, it’s the satisfaction of serving their customers, especially after they send out a package each time.
As idealistic as Gayle and Andy’s “do what you love” attitude may seem, they’ve managed to open their own physical store earlier this year in March, after two years in the vintage scene.
Unfortunately, they had to close the store three weeks after opening due to Covid-19. But they believe Jiggythings continued doing well because of their strong online presence.
“It’s hard to come across someone our age without Instagram nowadays,” Andy says. And those who use Instagram are usually within their target audience, around 15 to 25 years old.
But even with social media at their disposal, it took a process of trial and error to figure out what worked for their business. They started out with Telegram and Carousell, but found using too many platforms a hassle.
“Especially with Carousell now, you need to key in more details about the product. It used to be faster last time, where you could upload the product in 30 seconds,” Gayle explains.
They used to have a website as well but realised most of their customers still prefer Instagram.
The rise of these platforms has allowed setting up and running the business to be a lot more smooth-sailing. As of January 2020, 140 million businesses use Facebook and its related apps, such as Instagram, to connect with clients and market themselves.
“Honestly, if you want to do it [start a business], you can just use Google or YouTube to learn,” Andy says.
They both studied Business IT in Ngee Ann Polytechnic, but claimed that what they learned wasn’t “all that practical”.
Andy laughs, “You don’t need to go to school for this kind of thing, or at least that was the case for our store.”
But surely, setting up Jiggythings wasn’t as easy as they make it out to be right?
“Maybe in the initial part, we faced some stigma, like vintage is very ‘dirty’. My grandma always says, ‘This might be a dead person’s clothing,’” Gayle sighs, “Older gens won’t understand.”
Andy’s parents were nonchalant about his passion: “Asian parents don’t really show how proud they are, especially for such an unconventional business. I think they thought it wasn’t a big thing, probably just some side hobby. But now it’s my income.”
The business began when both Andy and Gayle were still in polytechnic. They’d have activities going on in the daytime, and come back at night to post and pack items, only sleeping at 2 or 3 am before going to school the next day.
Andy pauses, realising—on hindsight—that there hasn’t been a day he did nothing.
“It wasn’t that I was sacrificing my studies, it’s just that I was spending my free time doing this. I didn’t really study a lot anyway.”
What about the challenges they face now?
“Once in a while, we get problematic customers.” Gayle mused about the time one customer tried to scam them. He photoshopped the Paynow receipt to try to avoid payment.
“Or if the customer is dissatisfied with the item’s condition or if the mail gets lost,” Gayle adds, “Then we’ll have to compensate them by giving them another item or store credits.”
And that’s why they insist on thoroughly checking every purchased order, making sure it’s sent out on time, and that the customer receives them. To them, the biggest takeaways from doing business are responsibility and accountability to customers.
There are also stocks and sales-related issues, such as when the current stocks aren’t moving which results in them having to sell them at a lower price. Or when they only sell 10 (out of the 30) clothes they post on Instagram that day.
Besides that, they’re also competing with many more vintage stores in the scene now. A quick Google search gives me around 24 other shops in Singapore, such as The Fashion Pulpit and Loop Garms, and this excludes those who don’t have a physical store for themselves.
This increasingly saturated market is likely due to vintage wear’s comeback in recent years, and Gen Zs are most commonly the ones buying into it. I remember a sudden surge in interest in old Western shows four years ago, like Friends or That 70s Show.
“Highly influential celebrities, like Travis Scott and Kanye West, also popularised vintage. Plus they’re affordable,” Andy surmised.
Suddenly, everyone around me was into everything old; from oversized graphic tees, to pleated skirts, to denim on denim.
They believe they grabbed the opportunity at the right time when there were only five or six other shops then. Now, their turnouts when they hold events have lowered. And these events are usually when they (used to) earn the most profit.
Andy adds that they’re looking for more owners (of other vintage shops) to hold events in their shop. He cites this as a win-win situation since both businesses will be able to gain exposure to more customers. But Covid-19 has made this difficult.
The pandemic has also affected their stock supplies. In the first few weeks of the virus, their suppliers experienced a shortage of stock.
There has also been a significant increase in shipping timings, and some couriers have implemented an additional surcharge for shipping items. As a business that relies on online sales, they always need to have stock on hand. And the surcharge has resulted in a three to five percent increase in their costs.
Fortunately, businesses for their suppliers have resumed ever since their countries’ cases lowered, and Jiggythings remains in touch with them.
“Paying a three percent premium is still reasonable to me … It could’ve been a lot worse if everything stopped,” Andy said.
Moreover, their sales have surprisingly increased during the pandemic and, in fact, dipped a little ever since the Circuit Breaker ended: “Maybe because there are lesser people on their phones now.”
It goes without saying how important their online presence continues to be even after all these years.
Business aside, they both tell me that their personal lives have taken a backseat since they opened the store.
They work on weekends now, and Gayle is going on to her second year of university. “Sometimes I think: ‘I could be getting wasted or going cafe-hopping if I wasn’t doing this.’”
Luckily, she’s not one to party much, and she enjoys running her business.
Andy agrees, “I don’t regret this being part of my youth.”
They’re also grateful for the friends who come to visit them at the store, especially after opening hours.
“I feel like this shop has actually brought our friends together,” Gayle says.
Andy smiles as he speaks of their friends who are mostly in the vintage scene as well, and how they understand what it’s like to do this business.
I reached out to one of them, Greg, a 21-year-old who owns Retrovage, another vintage clothing store. He was able to pay for his own expenses and be more self-reliant. Meeting new friends and building customer relations have also been the most rewarding aspects of the business.
For those who wish to pursue a career that is unappreciated or undervalued in Singapore, he suggests thinking international: “Find ways to reach an international audience via online means.”
Andy and Gayle agree, “You’re still in your youth, you don’t have many responsibilities. Even if you were to lose you won’t lose much.”
They reflect on how they learned most of the ropes along the way, without anyone to teach them. Now, even with Covid-19, they have suppliers from all over the world: Thailand, US, UK, Malaysia.
Before Covid-19 hit, they’d fly to countries in the region to visit them and show their gratitude. “‘We like doing business with you’ kind of thing, you know?” Andy says.
As for the future of Jiggythings, they hope to keep it a side job: “Even if we make it full-time, there’s not much else we can do.”
But vintage, to Gayle, will never die out, and there will always be a market for it. She mentions the number of customers who like to collect vintage clothing, including 50-year-olds. They also wish to continue catering to their existing loyal customers.
“We don’t want to have multiple stores with many employees, if not it’ll lose its touch,” Andy affirms, “When people buy from us, we want to be the one serving them.”
As for their future plans, they admit that they haven’t thought that far ahead.
For Generation Zs like Andy, Gayle, and Greg, they’re happy with where they’re at now: they’re not stuck in the drudgery of a nine-to-five desk job; they’re enjoying the hustle while finding meaning in what they do.
Like it or not, this generation of Singaporeans will play a key role in the country’s future. Not all of them will fit the ‘risk-averse’ and ‘strawberry’ prototype commonly associated with Zoomers.
Andy*’s name has been changed to protect the interviewee’s privacy.

Remember The Circuit Breaker? Many Singaporeans Actually Miss It",Abigail Lee,TRUE,TRUE
"When It Comes To Disability Inclusion, Every Action Matters",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-features-when-it-comes-to-disability-inclusion-every-action-matters/,29-Dec-20,"Disclaimer: This story is based on the experiences shared by those we interviewed, and may not necessarily reflect the entirety of all Persons with Disabilities (PWD).
All images by Zachary Tang and Feline Lim.
Minutes into our conversations, Pearl and Boon Keng, both individuals with physical disabilities, make the same request—for this to not be another “pity story”.
Due to the lack of exposure, I’ll admit that I’ve never really known how to interact with or behave around PWDs. Sometimes, interactions can be nerve-wrecking due to my fear of unintentionally offending the other party. More often than not, this leads to avoidance.
I know that I’m not alone. But as shared by the profiles in this story, it’s completely normal to feel awkward; it’s only problematic if we allow that unfamiliarity to remain a barrier.
The upside is that tackling this unfamiliarity is a lot easier than we think. We must first have a sense of disability awareness and basic etiquette. In conjunction with Maybank’s #HeartofSG campaign, we sought to debunk some of the current myths and misconceptions that surround PWDs.
1. It’s individuals first, disability second.
Even from afar, I felt drawn to Pearl’s warmth and jovial personality. Decked in a bright, yellow dress, she greeted me with a smile and we hit it off almost instantaneously.
She’s in her 30s, and currently a community and partnership manager for a global community platform for HR professionals.
“I have bowlegs where I walk in a v-shape, severe scoliosis, and restrictive lung disease which affects my breathing,” she tells me.
“But I’m also not defined by my disability. Contrary to popular belief, PWDs aren’t that different. We have similar needs.”
The day after, I met Boon Keng, a 30-year-old digital marketer and motivational speaker. Unlike Pearl, he was initially more reserved. But it didn’t take long before he brought up the importance of seeing PWDs as individuals first: “I’m an ordinary guy just like everyone else, other than my disability.”
Since young, Boon Keng has been diagnosed with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy, the more common and severe form of Muscular Dystrophy (MD). MD causes muscles to gradually weaken, leading to a loss of physical ability over time.
Many times, people see these disabilities first, and forget that individuals like Pearl and Boon Keng are people with their own aspirations and goals.
Boon Keng shares, “My wish is for people to go beyond understanding disability as a problem, but understanding the person as a friend.”
“We must know that PWDs are a huge community and there is a spectrum of disabilities. Often, we forget to go deeper to understand each person.”
Hence, the importance of practising the golden rule—treat others the way you’d want to be treated.
I wondered if people ever appear physically uncomfortable around him. After taking a few moments to breathe, Boon Keng adds, “I like it when people speak directly to me and not at my caregiver or wheelchair. There are some who look at my chair instead. Once, someone complimented my shirt. It’s always nice to be seen.”
Today, Boon Keng is looking to write a book and to conduct more motivational speeches, where he can share his life story and empower others.
Similarly, Pearl wishes to give voice to others like her so that they can unleash their fullest potential.
“I’ve personally experienced what it is like to have someone who guides and believes in you. Being in a community of HR leaders and PWDs, I would love to have conversations or facilitate these conversations with PWDs and organisations. For those who would like to connect, I can be contacted via Linkedin.”
2. Ask before helping.
Having witnessed many awkward interactions in the past, I asked out of curiosity: “So … when should we extend help? And is that a good thing?”
Like with anything, it boils down to consent.
Pearl explains, “In context, being helpful is a good thing. But being unhelpful is also good because many times PWDs are able to do things on their own and it’s respectful when others allow us to continue unless we ask for help, or when in emergencies.”
Generally, we shouldn’t touch or push a mobility device without the owner giving the go ahead. “Well, unless it’s an emergency,” qualifies Boon Keng.
He then adds: “It’s always best to ask before helping. Sometimes, helping in the wrong way can make things worse. The device I’m using is too heavy to be pushed around or carried up the stairs. It really depends, so never assume. My fear is if my wheels get stuck in the MRT gap and people start messing around with the buttons or controller in the wrong way.”
3. Support is important and people are enablers.
The way we view ourselves is often shaped by society and those around us, be it in school, home, or at the workplace. This is no different for PWDs.
For instance, if a PWD grows up in an environment where words like “less capable” and “unworthy” are tossed around loosely, that gets ingrained in them. It’s hard to step out of that toxicity.
“Exactly. People matter. For a lot of things, it starts from the family core. Words construct realities. It’s also in the unsaid. I am lucky to have been around those who believe and support me,” Pearl says.
She also recounts several positive experiences, noting that people hold more power than they think they do. “It can be as simple as holding the door, or giving up their seat. I am also grateful to my colleagues, bosses and life coach as they saw my potential. Because of them, I am able to look beyond the labels I have.”
It was tough for Boon Keng to make close friends in Secondary school, but that changed entirely when he met a group of friends in Polytechnic who saw him as just another one of them.
“Before, whenever it came to project work, I try not to make the active choice in picking teammates in fear of being a hassle,” addresses Boon Keng.
He beams when recounting these stories, of times when his poly friends chose to accompany him on long breaks between lectures. “They could have easily picked a further place to go, but they stayed with me. It meant a lot.”
Apart from schoolmates, Boon Keng also acknowledges the strong familial support that he has. “My family gives me the freedom to explore what I want without pressuring me, even when they know of my physical challenges.”
When we talk about PWDs, it frequently defaults to “us” and “them”. In an ideal world, both Pearl and Boon Keng hope to see people coming together and making the conscious effort to break some of these conventions.
4. Inclusion is in the everyday things.
As a society, we talk a lot about diversity inclusion. Unfortunately, talk doesn’t always translate to action.
“I have been working in a global company. What I’ve seen is that diversity inclusion is high on their agenda. In smaller local companies, perhaps that is still not the case. People are still unaware of how to approach the matter, even in their hiring practices,” shares Pearl.
In 2018, Pearl travelled overseas for the first time. “It was a dream come true. Before that, I thought it was impossible for someone with my medical and physical condition to travel and I only saw these places through TV,” she tells me.
I observed her gleaming expression as she explained, “When I was in Taiwan, I had the most amazing experience with accessibility. At Yang Ming Shan, there’s actually a smooth path that you can take! All the places that I thought I couldn’t go, they’ve made it possible for me to. Accessibility is improving in Singapore, but it’s not quite there yet.”
On this topic, Boon Keng recounts, “I often find roadworks or temporary provisions not wheelchair-friendly, such as uneven or bumpy surfaces. The gaps between tiles makes it bumpy and hard to navigate. When I know that, I’ll avoid the place. Even the gradient of the slope matters. The steepness has to be just right.”
At one point, Pearl visibly perks up and adds, “Oh yes, look at the shoes I’m wearing? My legs are of different length and I require customised shoes. I used to order them from a shop in the U.S, but it has since closed down. It’s so hard to find an alternative or options in Singapore.”
It’s also sad that we have to wear ugly and unfitted clothes. Why can’t we wear ones with nice designs too?
It was a wake up call. Shopping is merely shopping for most of us. But for individuals like Pearl, shopping leaves barely any room for consideration. Rather, it is simply wearing whatever is available, even if it looks bad. How can this be inclusion? Clearly, responsibility lies with every single person, from policy makers, to designers, engineers, architects and more.
Through all this, I wondered about their take on love and relationships. Is it taboo or are we just too afraid to talk about it?
Pearl shares, “During Chinese New Year, relatives would typically kaypoh about my cousins’ love life, but they’d naturally skip me. Does that mean I’m not worthy or expected to have a life like that?”
She speculates that this “discrimination” stems from fear of offending the other party or overstepping boundaries. There could also be fear of association, where “abled” and “disabled” must be clearly set apart. “It’s not a bad thing, it’s normal. But if people are willing to include us in these little things, that is the window for positive change to occur.”
Likewise, Boon Keng shares that he was pleasantly surprised when two of his friends invited him to their wedding. “It was very meaningful to me,” he says with a note of relief, “I realised that I can also be included in such normal festivities.”
After pondering, he adds, “To me, it’s not taboo. The dilemma of having MD is that we know that our bodies are getting weaker. We don’t want to burden anyone. But what happens if your heart yearns for a partner and to be loved? In the book I’m working on, I hope to touch on such personal experiences.”
Apart from formal workshops, it’s also important to have organic discussions between friends and family, he shares. Through that, we can then normalise things and remove their stigma.
According to the World Health Organisation, over 1 billion people — about 15% of the global population, live with some form of disability.
Life for the physically disabled may be a constant battle, but we must be careful not to peg them as heroes. Pearl and Boon Keng were never always this confident, and they made it clear that there will always be moments of anxiety and self-doubt.
At the end of the day, we are all human beings who struggle; sometimes succeeding, sometimes failing.
The challenge remains in not only introducing schemes and policies, but also in changing existing stigmas and discriminations.
The last thing anyone should do is treat PWDs as objects of charity. Instead, treat them as individuals who deserve the same dignities we expect for ourselves. And what is dignity? From our conversations, I gathered that dignity is a sense of feeling valued, a sensation of self-worth and belonging.
Often, its absence is noticeable only when in short supply. To make a difference, we must ensure that we educate ourselves and play our part in little ways so that it doesn’t get taken away.
Centred on the spirit of giving, Maybank’s #HeartofSG campaign seeks to unite everyone from different walks of life and empower our communities in need. The campaign is in line with Maybank’s mission to Humanise Financial Services, shining a spotlight on those in need as they weather the onslaught of Covid-19.
For every dollar you donate or fundraise this month, Maybank will match it 1:1 up to S$180,000 for 5 supported charities under the President’s Challenge Empowering for Life Fund (ELF). Fundraising campaign ends on 31 January 2021. The supported charities are as follows:
– Club HEAL
– Movement for the Intellectually Disabled of Singapore (MINDS)
– Muscular Dystrophy Association (Singapore)
– SPD, a local charity that serves persons with disabilities
– WE CARE Community Services
No dollar is too little, and no action is too difficult. You can be someone’s reason to smile by helping to raise funds and contributing in little ways too. Find out what ‘making a difference’ means to Maybank here.

Is It Possible to Ditch the Daily Grind? 3 Singaporeans Tell Us",Eve Lock,TRUE,TRUE
There’s More To TikTok Than Dancing Xiao Mei Meis,https://www.ricemedia.co/more-to-tiktok-than-dancing-xiao-mei-meis/,5-Mar-21,"Photography by Wallace Woon.
I recall the early days of social media when things were simple.
Friendships were built over hours of conversation on MSN Messenger, and an “aesthetic” photo just meant slapping on any stock filter. It was a time of pure, unadulterated joy.
In 2021, social media is an entirely different game. Most platforms showcase curated feeds of people leading perfect, cheery lives. Out of all these, TikTok has become the social network to be on.
Like many of my peers, my knowledge of the platform was previously limited to cringey xiao mei meis (XMM) dancing in booty shorts. Accordingly, I couldn’t help but wonder if this might create a false sense of reality for other impressionable teens, many of whom may be struggling with issues around self-esteem and confidence.
Wouldn’t such content lead to a negative impact on their mental health?
Bullied But Not Broken: On Spreading Body Positivity & Self-Love
Of all the TikTok content creators I spoke to, Jeynelle (@BuffBaby88) was probably the purest embodiment of Gen Z. At first glance: a bubbly 20-year-old in a trendy outfit with make-up on fleek.
Behind the lively persona is just another one of us — a person with a fair share of insecurities.
Growing up, Jeynelle had an unhealthy obsession with society’s beauty standards, which led her to develop bulimia. While her condition has improved significantly, recovery is a non-linear process, she tells me.
Like most of us, she struggles with the unhealthy habit of upward comparison. It’s hard to believe that even someone this assertive goes through bouts of self-doubt.
“Social media is a double-edged sword. It can be good, but there are dark sides to it. It sets unrealistic body standards of what girls should look like: flat stomach, big breasts, and all that.”
These experiences now shape the content that she creates on TikTok.
During the Circuit Breaker last year, Jeynelle began documenting her weight loss journey; a personal project that has since grown into a safe online community where users come for solace and inspiration.
“Some strangers have even told me that my videos saved their life. They’ve learned to eat better and to love themselves.”
At one point, Jeynelle picks up her phone and shows me a pep talk video that she created. It’s raw and unfiltered, and I can see why it resonated with people. Self-love: it’s a reminder we all need.
“To be honest, creating videos like the one on belly pouches is my way of coping too. I want people to know that they’re not alone. We all have imperfections.”
Inclusivity and Representation: A Role Model For Women in Tech
Ain (@AinLovesCode) is a first generation coder in her family.
“It was hard to find role models around me, especially in the media,” she explains with a shrug, “Being the first in my family to not only study in university but also pursue a coding career, I had to figure things out almost all on my own.”
According to her, it’s hard enough to find a female software developer who’s Malay and Muslim — let alone one who creates TikTok content related to tech and coding.
“When I received this interview request, I thought: how do my videos relate to mental health at all?
“But then I realised one thing—it isn’t so much about the content I create, it’s also because of how I present myself in my videos. I wear the Hijab. My name is Malay. A big part of my brand is incredibly relatable to minorities like me.”
Pointing to the lack of representation in mainstream media, Ain aims to present an alternative narrative for minority women in tech. Through bite-sized videos on basic coding tips and career advice, her goal is to inspire others looking to join the field. “They’ll think: if I can do it, they can too.” “In fact, I’ve received DMs from people telling me that I’m the role model that they needed and wanted to see more of,” she adds with a smile, “These things keep me motivated.”
Repeatedly, Ain emphasises the power of knowledge. After all, her interest in coding began years ago, back when she ran an anime fan fiction blog. Though it might have been a hobby, she managed to pick up basic HTML and CSS skills
Now that she’s entered the industry, she seeks to spread a simple message: coding can be accessible.
Despite being active online, the 22-year-old also recognises the downsides of excessive screen time. This isn’t surprising, considering how studies have shown the associations between screen time and mental health.
Ain tells me that poor video performance and negative comments used to overwhelm her.
Over time, she learned to grant herself occasional breaks, citing features like TikTok’s screen time restrictions, content warnings and comment filters as effective measures that protect both the creator’s and user’s mental well-being.
“People can be unnecessarily hateful online. I’ve developed thick skin, but this isn’t the case for everyone. If anything, we should be able to isolate ourselves from screens when needed,” she concludes.
Tackling The Problem Of A Sleep-Deprived Nation
It was mid-afternoon when I met Zoe (@SgSuperNanny) at a cafe. She’s a 41-year-old mompreneur and sleep expert.
Packed with infectious energy from the get-go, she opted for a non-caffeinated drink. Is this what good sleep does to a person?
Health specialists are often pegged as stoic intellectuals, but TikTok has changed this impression entirely.
Offline, Zoe is a professional who provides sleep training for both babies and adults. Online, she condenses information into fun, educational videos that cover a wide range of topics pertaining to sleep.
Limited to 60 seconds, she offers easily digestible answers to questions like “What are the effects of bad sleep?” and “What types of food aids in sleep?”
The goal was never to trivialise serious sleep conditions, but rather to provide nuggets of information that might help others in a similar predicament.
“When I first became a mum, I knew nothing about sleep. Once, my neighbour saw my panda eyes and told me to explore sleep training. I was initially unconvinced, but since she was a well-rested mother while I was a tired, grumpy mother of twins, I started doing a ton of research.”
As a mother of four today, Zoe tries to limit her children’s consumption of screens, but admits that it’s tough in this day and age. “I tell them: disconnect to connect. I don’t mind them going on their gadgets, but they must learn to cut off and be fully present when needed.”
“So, what’s the most common cause for poor sleep?” I asked, curious.
According to Zoe, a majority of her clients point to stress as their root cause. While that may be true, there are a multitude of other factors that go unnoticed, like one’s food intake and the habit of scrolling through phones before bed.
She stresses how blue light from our devices reduces the production of melatonin, a hormone that makes us sleepy. Over the course of our conversation, I caught myself grumbling to Zoe about the difficulties of getting good sleep. I suppose she has that effect on people.
“For starters, maybe it’s best not to consume caffeine at 4PM,” she points teasingly towards the iced latte by my side.
That night, I surprised myself by reading an actual physical book before bed instead.
Normalising The Conversation On Mental Health Issues
Chances are, you’ve had days where you just want to crawl into a hole and disappear.
This is so even for Priyahnisha (or Nisha), a counsellor at a social service agency and co-founder of the non-profit organisation (NGO) Mental ACT.
“Once, I went on a rampage of deleting social media apps off my phone. I always come back to it eventually, but I become more conscious of the type of content I expose myself to.”
Founders of Mental ACT: Nisha (left) and her partner, Devan (right).
It’s clear that we all struggle with social media consumption. But cutting it off completely? It’s unthinkable for most. Call it FOMO, kaypoh, or the need to connect.
In 2018, she started Mental ACT together with her partner, Devan, a social worker. While still fairly new, their goal is to bring together a pool of like-minded mental health professionals, specifically those from the Indian Community.
“Through research, we’ve learned that people generally feel more comfortable opening up to others who can resonate with their own culture.”
“As Indians who grew up here, we’ve witnessed the stigma surrounding mental health within our community,” she explains. “We want to raise awareness and provide better resources for those in need.”
Nisha and Devan, along with their team of volunteers, dance to popular tunes on their TikTok (@Mental_ACT_Singapore) while listing signs and symptoms of anxiety. They remind others of the need to stay positive and bring up problematic issues like excessive comparison and the lack of boundaries within families.
Odd as it sounds, it has been an effective way for them to reach out to a younger audience.
To their surprise, a particular clip blew up one day; it has since garnered close to 26 thousand views. It was a video on the societal pressures placed on men, and their fear of appearing vulnerable.
At the peak of Covid-19, a wave of calls came through their 24-hour crisis hotline. “Some called us just to rant, but we also dealt with more serious cases where crisis intervention was needed.”
Nisha’s concern for youths was apparent; it was evident in her tone: “We’ve had several young callers share stories of cyberbullying on social media. It’s a problem unique to this generation.”
But as impressionable as teens can be, she believes that it’s important not to shelter them completely.
“Social media has a mind of its own. Ultimately, I just wish that it can be a safer place. For some, that is already the case. We have to keep that going by setting a good example.”
Uncertainty & Possibilities: Lighting The Way For Young Creatives
Finally, there’s the surreal works of visual artist Aundraj (@Assthrowknot), which have caused quite a stir online. After all, a typical post on his account features unearthly creatures set against the backdrop of everyday Singapore.
Ever seen a colossal Evangelion robot in your neighbourhood? What about sharks passing through Marina Bay Sands? Anything is possible with augmented reality.
“I like making it as weird as possible,” he tells me. “That gets people guessing.”
Beaming, he clarifies: “The creatures are all fake—of course they are! I’m glad that it gets people excited.”
This goes without saying, but Aundraj’s videos are remarkably creative and out of the box—certainly not what you’d expect.
“When I posted my first video on TikTok, I had to mute my notifications. It was hilarious, people were squabbling in the comments.”
“It’s interesting because we don’t often see such works on a social media level; it’s typically found in higher budget advertisements and films.”
It strikes me that for someone as talented as Aundraj, humility is still a distinct quality. He was shy to receive compliments and expressed an insatiable hunger for growth.
Turns out, he majored in engineering and took a complete turn only after graduating from university. With complete candor, Aundraj shares that he went through a phase of anxiety. “I struggled with the idea of having it all together. I felt lost and took a break because I didn’t know where I was going in life.”
What’s even more mind-blowing than his work is the fact that everything was self-taught.
“During my break, I scoured the net for information, anything from video tutorials to articles.” To him, knowledge is key. Through his videos, he hopes to open the minds of young creatives who have yet to realise their potential.
“I don’t think I’ve beaten anxiety completely; it’s always lingering. But it’s great that we have so much resources online these days. If you need help, there is help.”
Unfortunately, numbers can function as a ruthless tool of measurement. Surely, a creator’s worth must go beyond analytics. Once a victim to these metrics, Aundraj has since had a shift in his mindset.
“When I first started out, I related the number of likes to whether my art was good,” he admits,“It made me frustrated and kept me from enjoying the process.”
“Social media is literally in the palm of our hands. It creates the illusion that it’s part of you. When glued to our screens, we get caught up in the small things.”
“But with more people speaking up online, things are changing. Hopefully, it’s all for the better.”
Who knew that an app made solely for short-form fun would benefit people in so many ways? The recounts of these creators contain touches of humanity that are noticeable in the way they turn personal struggles into raw, relatable content.
Toxicity is inescapable online, but there also exists diverse groups fighting to bring just a bit of joy and light—both things that we sorely need.
In a time of social distancing and isolation, social media can be an invaluable tool for us to keep in contact with friends, loved ones and the world. Learn to take breaks, filter your list; whatever it takes to stay sane. Most of all, remember that kindness never hurts.
With Covid-19 dominating the most of 2020, most of us have been spending a lot of time online as we are cooped up at home. Amid the excessive scrolling and screen time, it’s easy for people to overlook their safety and mental health. TikTok is committed to navigating these challenges, first by creating a safer internet. The launch of initiatives such as the #MoveforMentalHealth and #NEDAwareness, for instance, serve as ways to kickstart a bigger conversation surrounding mental wellness and body positivity. On top of that, policies are continually strengthened to further protect the well-being of the community. Learn more about them here.

On Honesty and Uncertainty: What A Polyamorist Has To Teach Us About Relationships,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-honesty-uncertainty-polyamorist-teach-us-relationships/,4-Dec-20,"30-years-old young. Unmarried. One 3-year-old boy.
Works as a content producer in travel and fashion. Dates predominantly Caucasian men.
Talks frankly of having 3 partners—one of them almost 40 years older than her. None are the father of her child.
I’m guessing the first epithet out of your mouth wasn’t a positive one.
As Janice’s story illustrates, sugarcoating your promiscuity is not morally equivalent to calling yourself polyamorous.
Yet none of this bothers Janice Leong, a self-proclaimed polyamorist who uses her social media channels to discuss open relationships. She’s encountered verbal abuse in the past, but these days, her viewers are more curious than antagonistic; less critical and more interested to learn about the ups and downs of her unconventional lifestyle.
To set things straight, Janice educates me on the precise definition of polyamory. It is, as Wikipedia and other resources explain it, “the practice of, or desire for, intimate relationships with more than one partner, with the informed consent of all partners involved.”
More crucially, it is about participating in a non-monogamous relationship in a responsible and ethical manner.
But before getting into all that, how did it happen that Janice, who was brought up in a strict Catholic household by a mother who wanted her daughter to follow the conventional matrimonial route, found herself here? How did she find herself leaping from the stable universe of monogamy into the colourful world of polyamory? And assuming that you are a diehard monogamist, what instructive takeaways can we glean from studying her tumultuous life?
Like many of the life-changing decisions we ourselves might have made, it started with heartbreak.
The First Cut is the Deepest
Her first relationship began at 15-years-old, followed by another when she was in JC.
“It was mainly lots of cuddling without any sex,” she shares.
The next relationship turned out to be her last monogamous one. At 22, she started what would become a 3 year relationship with a partner 19 years older than her. Upon breaking up due to incompatible differences and being cheated on, she felt something was wrong, given this string of romantic failures, and decided to investigate the science of relationships. Her voice chokes as she reveals how her then-boyfriend had cheated on her.
“I really felt like something was wrong with me,” she tells me. “I thought about whether is cheating so natural and what could be done to prevent from feeling hurt. You know I have been cheated on and have cheated. Everyone has come across the impact of cheating once in their lives. And I was looking into how to tone down and buffer that pain.”
“Argh, I don’t like the feeling at all,” she sighs.
This exploration was pivotal to unearthing the world of alternative relationships. For her, Stepping Off the Relationship Escalator by Amy Gahran was an informative and critical resource that facilitated her turning away from society’s ladder of “customs for intimate relationships: monogamy, living together, marriage until death do you part.” The book also explores uncommon relationship choices, from “consensual non monogamy (including polyamory and swinging) to asexuality, pause/play relationships and more.”
Like in the LGBTQ community, there’s an assortment of terms to define one’s relationship style. There’s monogamish (a relationship that is mostly monogamous, but occasionally exceptions are made for sexual play), solo-polyamory (having multiple relationships without a primary partner), or open/closed triads or quads (a polyamorous relationship between 3 or 4 people; can be open or closed to the group).
It’s a dizzyingly entertaining read if you’re interested in the diverse arrangements people have found for themselves. For Janice, she concedes that she lived a promiscuous lifestyle for a brief period after that first heartbreak. This was, to her, needed catharsis. When the novelty of casually dating multiple men wore off, she decided the next step was to draw some limits.
“Cheating is like a disease in the relationship. And the cure or antidote, if you will, is working through a mutually agreed definition of the relationship terms, because everybody is going to define infidelity in different ways.”
It’s been approximately 5 years since that decisive turn. After that chapter of casual dating, she is now in a polyamorous relationship with 3 men. For easy reference, we will refer to them by their preferred monikers, Mr USA, Mr UK, and Mr SG. With two being long-distance and one local, each relationship speaks to a unique lesson on the nature of relationships.
If you think that this story is all about threesomes or sizzling sex with 3 different men, you couldn’t be more wrong. Instead, with two out of three being non-sexual in nature, each relationship fulfills a special role in her life.
The Never-Ending Search for ‘True Love’ (The Case of Mr USA)
Janice in Miami, where she spent time with Mr USA.
Out of the three relationships, Mr USA—of which is the longest running at 4 years—is unfortunately on its last legs. Nevertheless, Janice explains that Mr USA was pivotal in supporting her during the early years of her pregnancy and childbirth. She had met him in Bangkok, where they spent a few “amazing nights together”. She didn’t think that she would see him again when they left for their respective countries.
But after becoming pregnant (with another man), and the father disowning his responsibilities, Mr USA got involved. Himself being a single father to children from 4 previous marriages, he visited Janice in Singapore a few days after her son was born. Through his companionship, she found the strength and resolve to handle the challenges of pregnancy, and he never abated in his kindness and affection for her.
She recalls an endearing incident during her visit to the United States. Asked by the immigration officer about the purpose of her visit, she answered cheekily, “I’m here to tell a boy I love him.” Like a scene out of Notting Hill, she was deeply in love.
Unfortunately, that love did not blossom. Despite being aware of her stance on polyamory and her disinterest in getting married, he proposed to her. Flashing the emerald ring to me, she bemoans the asinine nature of it all.
“He was looking for a monogamous relationship and said we were not serious. But how do you define what is serious? Cohabitation? Does he expect me to stop all my relationships and migrate for him? He asked me, isn’t that enticing enough? But to forsake my relationships like that is very selfish of him. Not to mention he has 4 ex-wives with children from each one. I asked him, what can you do to ensure I won’t be the fifth?”
Puzzled by his persistent efforts to seek marriage at all cost, despite being in his forties with his oldest child at 26-years-old, I ask why.
She replies, “He thinks he hasn’t found the right one.”
The emerald ring that Mr USA proposed to Janice with.
His refusal to accept her polyamorous lifestyle has diminished the quality of their relationship. He has not spoken to her for about a year, and tried recently to rekindle their relationship. She is still visibly enraged at him for not showing her more respect.
“I was really mad at him for texting Happy New Year after one year of not speaking. To cut me off and act as if nothing happened shows how much he treats our relationship. And to demand for marriage even now! We communicated and tried to meet in the middle but he can’t accept my free-spirited character. That’s the thing about relationships; you have to have a consensus about what the relationship is about. Nothing kills a relationship like the change of ideals and character.”
Change is the only constant in life, as they say. Yet it appears some people don’t change, as evident with Mr USA’s unending search for ‘the right one’. Wouldn’t it be far more reasonable to confront the truth of whether you are marriage-worthy material in the first place?
Divorce is now increasingly common, but the stigma of being a divorcee persists because—consciously or not—it suggests a moral failure on the individual’s part. After all, shouldn’t the vows uttered ceremonially, combined with the extravagant wedding bonanza, count for something? True love should conquer all, we believe. Whether it manifests in marriage or not, we want to believe that our partner’s commitment to us will always be unwavering.
‘Unwavering commitment’ is a beautiful ideal, yet a philosophical unknown. How much financial instability can a spouse take? How much physical and mental illness can be tolerated before it adversely affects the quality of life for the other partner? Putting aside these extreme contingencies, couples have split over far more trivial reasons, typically citing irreconcilable differences as the go-to cause.
And even before getting to this point, shouldn’t we re-consider the idea that a relationship can only be real if it lasts forever? Isn’t it more important to determine not only how compatible we are, but also whether marriage is necessarily the most sensible arrangement simply because two people want to be together?
Staying Honest Is About Constant Communication (The Case of Mr UK)
If there is one thing that we often use to benchmark the intensity of a romantic relationship, it’s sex. Yet we have a complicated relationship with it, feeling embarrassed to talk about it openly while simultaneously downplaying its importance when determining the significance of a relationship (“oh, it’s not about the sex”).
In the case of Mr UK (who lives in a nearby Asian country), Janice admits that sex was the main draw. Having met him 4 years ago in Singapore, along with the father of her child (they are acquaintances), their attraction to each other can only be described as electrifying. After getting to know each other, she would fly over to see him every few months for weekend trysts involving classy dinners, dizzying romancing, and the obvious.
“It’s always novel every time I meet him. Some people live together for years and it gets bland, but with him, the constant flying and rekindling made every experience fresh. You know, no one needs to give instructions like “damn it, do this!” Sexual compatibility is a big foundation. It’s been more than 3 years but there’s still a strong romantic attraction. It’s a state of mind.”
That state of mind, I learn, is called limerence, which results from “a romantic attraction to another person and typically includes obsessive thoughts and fantasies and a desire to form or maintain a relationship with the object of love and have one’s feelings reciprocated”.
Perhaps this is a more apt explanation for “love at first sight”.
Janice has a knack for changing her hairstyles.
These days, a pre-requisite of modern relationships is that good sex should exist. When friends are in a relationship that’s on the verge of ending, we often ask, “How’s the sex?” If an affair occurs, we condemn the one who strays as weak or flawed, and talk about how the one who was betrayed deserves someone better. Infidelity shatters reality for those who have a wholesale belief in the sanctity of monogamy.
But as Kate Figes wrote, “a close loving relationship ought to be the one place where we can be flawed and still feel loved”. To expect True Love to work its magic is a failure of our moral imagination to see ourselves as complex beings with contradictory needs, desires, vulnerabilities, and flaws.
Janice had interrogated her UK lover who was married: “How much does your wife really know you?” Should he have gotten married in the first place if he knew himself to be a profligate lover?
Was getting married an attempt on his part to tame his inner hedonism and aspire to something better? Did he need to dip knee—and soul—into the unexplored waters of marriage to test his resolve?
From one-night stands to emotional affairs involving chatting intimately with a co-worker, cheating can be ubiquitous and pervasive depending on how we define it and what we can tolerate. All the more crucial is communicating with our partners clearly and distinctly about our boundaries and levels of trust.
In this sense, it could be argued that polyamory allows for a wider range of freedoms, although, as the relationship between Janice and Mr UK illustrates, it also leads to messier conversations about how much you know yourself or your partner.
This project of communicating with oneself and to your partner is an eternal one, for we are constantly evolving as individuals. A one-night stand could be a mere slip-up, not indicative of a person’s character overall. What matters is how we navigate these mistakes, and whether we aspire to becoming more genuine individuals and lovers.
Pre-COVID, Janice travelled frequently for work.
Today, Mr UK is no longer married. Likewise, sex has changed for Janice.
“Sex, to me, means something different than before. I like to describe it as an emotional chastity belt. I’m not forcing myself to be sexual but I’m demisexual meaning I need to form an emotional bond before having sex. I grew out of that phase where we go on dates and meet new people. Now I don’t end up naked in bed all the time.”
She alludes to how some men have labeled themselves “polyamorous” just to give themselves permission to sleep around. But applying a label doesn’t absolve anyone of remaining accountable to their loved ones. As Janice’s story illustrates, sugarcoating your promiscuity is not morally equivalent to calling yourself polyamorous.
Ubiquitous Jealousy (The Case of Mr SG)
Out of all these relationships, the most surprising one might be with the local fellow, Mr SG. Significantly older than Janice, she recognises that they are an odd couple, earning looks from passersby when they hold hands and hug in public. Aside from these little displays of affection, their relationship is strictly non-sexual.
This does not prevent him from getting jealous of her other partners, particularly Mr UK. Janice laughs and elaborates, “Don’t think that because he is way older, he would not get jealous. He can be sarcastic and tell me things like don’t see him, you may catch Covid-19, or don’t come back pregnant.”
Janice reading 'The State of Affairs: Rethinking Infidelity' by Esther Perel
Janice isn’t spared from jealousy either. Self-assured as she is when it comes to her identity and desires, she can’t deny feeling jealous when she hears the sordid details of Mr UK’s sexcapades. I’ve teased her about it since it clearly demonstrates that honest communication is no panacea to one’s emotional vulnerabilities.
She concedes that deep down, she needs to know the sex they have is special. Janice acknowledges, “It’s the classic catch 22 situation. Ask or don’t ask, either way, it can backfire and I end up feeling insecure.”
Janice’s relationship with Mr SG strikes me as the sort of affection that develops commonly between a teacher and student. She sings praises of him guiding her in matters of business and life.
That said, Mr SG is married and Janice is deadly cautious about overstepping her boundaries. Fundamentally, it is a non-platonic relationship regardless of its non-sexual framing. Living between two realities—Mr SG with Janice and Mr SG with his wife—there is natural cause for any party to feel insecure about not being able to provide completely for their partner. Jealousy, hence, becomes the price for managing the competing needs of two different selves.
Still, given the long stretch of not seeing Mr UK in person, along with the possibility of Mr SG leaving the country in a few years, Janice has shaken off some of the jealousy. She admits that it’s been several months since she’s had sex, and she’s learned to tame her expectations of everyone in her life. Simply put, the cure to jealousy is to lower your expectations.
“I find it safer to go to a relationship with expectations as if it’s a night stand otherwise you’d be sad and disappointed. Sure, things can blossom as it did with Mr UK but things can change again, like the person may leave the country or find someone new. Don’t drown someone in your expectations because you can kill a relationship that way.”
Uncertainty and New Possibilities
Turning 30 this year, Janice has braced herself for more changes to come. While the future is uncertain, some things like non monogamy have become a cornerstone of her identity.
“It’s very easy to return to monogamy, but it’s not worth it. I had to unlearn or recondition myself in my beliefs and values; it’s literally reprogramming my mind.”
As of now, she’s open to new partners. In fact, two new people have recently entered her life. One, whom we shall dub Mr. Sweden, is asexual. Despite him having no interest in sex, he has a intrinsic need for physical intimacy, as evidenced from their first meeting at a ‘Coffee & Hugs’ event last year. Since then, they have traveled and spent weekends together like a regular family.
Recently, Mr Sweden found a new romantic interest, which has led to Janice educating me again on another new term: compersion. That is the “joy associated with seeing one’s partner have a joyful sexual or romantic relation with another”.
She describes in detail their respective love languages, how he thrives on physical touch whereas she is smitten with acts of service, demonstrating how intimate they have become.
Compersion might sound as bizarre as an alien language, but one might compare it to feeling joy at seeing an ex-lover find a new lover. As Sting once sang, “If you love them, set them free.”
And this is how Mr Sweden reciprocated Janice’s feelings of compersion: when they were at Tanjong Beach Club, an interested stranger chatted her up, and Mr Sweden gave his blessings for her to fraternize with him.
She dubs this other person Mr Comet because it describes “a person that passes through your life repeatedly who is intense and awesome, and when gone you are still in contact with that person in some way, but they are not a continuous partner.” Even though they haven’t so much as gone on a date, they retain a regular schedule of chatting online, with the promise that when times are better, she will accede to the dinner date he’s been asking for.
Janice as she currently is, taking things in stride.
On a Different Path, Still the Same Milestones
In telling Janice’s story, I’m acutely aware of the risk that accompanies the public sharing of a person’s sexual history and psyche. Some can appreciate that finding love is a messy affair, and that we are all entitled to pursue it idiosyncratically. On the other hand, there are those who will leave with a one-dimensional opinion of Janice, dismissing her as hopelessly delusional or starved of meaningful love and sex.
Sexuality is not food, but analogous to tasting a novel dish, how are we to really know our proclivities and preferences without dabbling in it? As instructive as Janice’s story has been for her (and hopefully for you to read), let me contrast it with the story of Neil Strauss—the infamous author of The Game, the eponymous ‘guidebook for picking up chicks’.
Finding himself incapable of committing to a meaningful relationship, he attempted to adopt polyamory into his life, with entertaining and uncomfortable results. But unlike Janice though, Strauss found polyamory disagreeable, and settled for a monogamous relationship, and is now happily married.
Concluding his thoughts on relationships, he writes, “[O]ur commitment today is to neither monogamy nor non-monogamy. Those are other people’s values and dichotomies. Our commitment is solely to nurturing, supporting, and honoring three important entities in our lives: me, her, and the relationship. Whatever it takes and however we may change.”
In response to his wife’s astonishment at how much he had changed, Strauss realised, “In the end, love is not finding the right person. It’s about becoming the right person.”
Ultimately, no matter what you read about human sexuality (and I have read plenty), whether we are biologically predisposed or socially conditioned to be monogamous or polyamorous, we are all sexual omnivores. There is no natural way to be in a relationship because our instincts for freedom, self-determination, and searching for meaning—for better or worse—afford us myriad ways to relate to one another.
And why should the search for a romantic partner(s) be the sole determinant of our values and self-worth? Sharing her plans to celebrate her 30th birthday by visiting a child orphanage in Jakarta with her son, Janice explains how she has grown out of clubbing and meeting men for kicks.
Janice with her son.
These days, I find her more buoyant when she speaks about her son’s judo and swimming classes. While all that talk about the vicissitudes of lovers, romance, and sex makes for salacious gossip, judging by her passion, it’s clear her heart is completely invested into the well-being of her son. (Lest you raise concerns about the well-being of children living in polyamorous household, here’s evidence showing otherwise.)
She’s also open to having a second child, but is committed to looking for the right father, and is even considering the sperm bank. The father of her son (dubbed Mr. C as an online alias) hasn’t paid child maintenance all these years, leading to a contentious long-drawn legal battle in Hong Kong (where he currently lives).
No matter who we partner with in life, they can all come and go. I have seen couples divorce after a long marriage, middle-aged men in a constant merry-go-round dating young women, and married folks engaged in extra-marital affairs. Loving someone remains, because it isn’t written in nature that anyone belongs to us forever.
Marriage is a beautiful ideal. Despite the concept of marrying for love being relatively modern, we are all the better for normalising the incomparable freedom to autonomously pursue our hearts’ desire. Janice recognises this, and advises accordingly, “Even if you choose monogamy and marriage, do it on your own terms. Don’t get caught up with only the blissful moments. Take into consideration even the most mundane of issues like sleeping on the same bed because the slightest difference can amplify over time.”
So when someone comes your way, be sure to love honestly and with all your heart.
No matter how you choose to arrange it.

Singaporean Youth Are Looking Beyond Our Shores For Success",Douglas Oh,TRUE,TRUE
Is There Even A Point to Comparing Singapore to Hong Kong?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-comparing-singapore-hong-kong/,14-Nov-19,"Top image: The Independent UK
All other images by the author unless otherwise stated.
Just don’t wear black. In early October that was the pre-arrival instruction I received from friends enmeshed in that modern urban war zone, Hong Kong.
“Don’t worry, you can wear black, nobody will think you are a protestor,” rebutted Tang, the jovial cabby in his fifties who picked me up from the airport, gesturing at my brown skin. But for Cantonese locals like him, wardrobe options have indeed become limited.
Black for protestors. White for their opponents. Red for China. Blue for the police, i.e. those alleged to have tortured some “blacks”. “Also no pink, no green,” Tang joked, lest he be mistaken for a homosexual or a bleeding-heart environmentalist.
“So I wear yellow. Yellow is safe.”
Tang rattled off other jokes—“Where is the most dangerous place in Hong Kong? The police station”—while glancing at his smartphone, which beamed a digital buffet of protest updates, video clips, cabby chatter, and yes, even the occasional phone call. Tang’s calmness, coupled with the quiet on the roads, put my mind at ease.
A few traffic jams and subway closures aside, the next week would prove one of the smoothest and most enjoyable I’ve had in twenty-five years of visiting Hong Kong. I discovered new nooks, traipsing around the lush Sai Kung pier in the northeast, alongside hikers and tourists from China and the West, and slurping up beef tendon noodles draped in a rich restorative broth, in a Cantonese joint near the Aberdeen Centre in the far south, not a word of English exchanged.
The dramatic television scenes of petrol bombs, shattered storefronts, and masked protestors clashing with police seemed a world apart from my visitor’s bubble.
Hong Kong’s protests over recent years have often been led by precocious adolescents who have persisted despite the annoyance of the older generation.
This year the generational divide has narrowed. “We will be gone in thirty years,” said Tang. “They have to fight for their future.”
This includes his daughter, who has just graduated from university in Savannah, Georgia. She had wanted to return to be with her friends after seeing the million-person demonstration this past June against a proposed extradition bill, the spark for this year’s protests.
“I said sure. But you pay for yourself [her air ticket]. Is that fair or not?” he asked me rhetorically. “Fair right?”
Alongside this acceptance of youthful idealism is a more sober expectation of short-to-medium-term economic pain. “Yes, business has dropped, some days maybe fifteen to twenty per cent less,” Tang admitted. “But then there are no more mainlanders around. So am I happy or sad? Hahaha.”
It has become commonplace in multicultural societies around the world for older immigrants to cast scornful eyes at prospective ones, for instance with second-generation Indian Americans supportive of Trumpian border control. It is one of the many bizarre symptoms of a world in which liberal ideas of nationhood and identity are being seriously challenged by nativist ones, against the backdrop of yawning economic inequalities.
Nowhere is this impulse stronger than among Hong Kongers, who have turned sharply against the land of their ancestors, less than an hour’s drive away. The prejudice can be vile, expressed in physical attacks and slurs like “cockroaches”.
Indeed, some of the fiercest Sinophobia one might experience around the world occurs in two of its richest Chinese-majority territories: Hong Kong and Singapore.
The cities’ differences and similarities offer a prism through which to better understand their relative fortunes, as well as the impact of global capitalism on Asia.
Comparisons Between Hong Kong and Singapore Since the 90s
Which Chinese-majority, East-meets-West, Asian Tiger city-state do you prefer: Hong Kong or Singapore? Over the past few decades each person’s answer to that has fluctuated in tandem with China’s emergence onto the world stage.
Right before “the handover” to China in 1997, many Hong Kongers left for Singapore, my birthplace, fearful of an uncertain Communist future and lured by Singapore’s immigration policy that gives preferences to ethnic Chinese.
(Ethnic Chinese comprise over 90% of Hong Kong’s 7.4m population and over 70% of Singapore’s 5.6m. Most of the former trace their lineage to Guangdong; most of the latter to neighbouring Fujian.)
By the mid 2000s, the mood had shifted dramatically. Hong Kong was brimming with confidence, its economy buoyed by a rising China, which was fast shedding its communist skin to reveal capitalist blood. The “one country two systems” philosophy underpinned (what seemed like) a vibrant cosmopolitanism. Locals, eager to ascend the property ladder, were no longer looking to switch cities.
Some foreigners were. “Hong Kong in your twenties, Singapore in your thirties.” Party hard in the city that never sleeps, and then settle down in the one where your children always will. Yet “Hong Kong vs Singapore” was always a sort of casual schoolyard bickering, nerdy Asian exam rivalry actualised at a city level.
Yet over the past decade it has been clear that the pendulum is swinging back to Singapore. Hong Kong’s property prices have continued to spiral—doubling in real terms from 2010 to 2018—making it difficult today for the young to even get on the ladder. Meanwhile locals have felt even more disenfranchised by Beijing’s increasing control over the city, itself symptomatic of the centralisation of power under China’s leader Xi Jinping, who assumed office in 2012.
This coincides with important milestones on the road to this year’s conflict: the 2012 protests against the proposed mandatory National Education course and the 2014 demonstrations triggered by electoral reforms that would enable China to decide which candidates could stand in the 2017 election to be Hong Kong’s chief executive (won by soon-to-be-replaced Carrie Lam, whose utter incompetence in office is the only truth that unites the city).
Coupled with China’s other apparent attempts to undermine Hong Kong’s autonomy, including the extrajudicial arrest and detention of five booksellers in 2015, it has become clear to many Hong Kongers, even before this year’s mooted extradition bill, that their leaders can never be fully responsive and accountable to them—rather, only to their overlords in Beijing.
This volatile atmosphere has been inflamed by communalism, spawned by an existential tussle over Hong Kong’s identity. The blackest Hong Kongers are content to watch their city burn, for theirs is a noble cause, one for future generations. And the reddest Chinese are happy to watch Hong Kong burn, ridding it of its British colonial hangovers and bastard children.
Between these two incendiary poles lies a spectrum of Hong Kongers with mixed emotions, people who feel pressure to choose between minor and major identities. The same nationhood typhoon that over the past century has swept up Kashmiris, Acehnese, Scots, Uyghurs and most recently Catalonians—if you speak Castilian Spanish, you are one of them—is now buffeting the territory known as the Pearl of the Orient.
“Are you a Hong Konger or a Chinese?”
“Why not both?”
“Why MUST both?”
This is the intractable identity repartee of our times. In the tea room at my former office in Tai Koo Shing, three middle-aged female colleagues frown, bursting our long-time-no-see bubble, when I tell them I might soon be seeing Joshua Wong, one of the protest leaders, speak at a conference.
“Not all of us agree with what they are doing,” one says. “But we keep quiet. Otherwise [others will say that] we are not real Hong Kong people.”
Yet there is little tension in the air, rather a sort of grudging acceptance of an interminable battle ahead.
Tiananmen redux? Bah. In 1989 an insecure China fretted about Western eyes gazing in. Today the West fears losing Chinese eyeballs looking out. A growl from Beijing has seen the world’s most highly-paid and fearsome athletes kowtow. Le Bron may be the king, but we now know where the emperor at.
China, in other words, is acutely aware of the numerous market levers it now possesses, its ability to slowly suck the air out of Hong Kongers and their sympathisers abroad. Who needs tanks?
Faced with the seemingly unbridgeable divide between the protestors’ demands and Beijing’s space for compromise, investors, people, businesses and money are fleeing Hong Kong with newfound fervour.
Singapore is again benefiting (some US$4bn was transferred in the past few months). But ironically these very inflows might ratchet up the same incipient pressures—gross inequality; a property market tilted towards the elite; a dwindling of trust in political processes; and a tension between minor and major identities—that have cumulatively pushed Hong Kong into the abyss.
Are the tensions of one global city simply being channelled onto another?

Socio-economic Twins, but Political Opposites
To understand why this yo-yoing between Hong Kong and Singapore occurs, consider that geographically, historically and economically they have much in common. In the first half of the nineteenth century the British developed both as colonial port cities with extremely open economies. As vital nodes in global transportation networks, people, goods and money have long flowed freely through them.
Hong Kong’s and Singapore’s wealth and importance to the world grew under the British Empire. As administrative, financial and trading hubs, they were the manicured fronts that sheltered their inhabitants from exploitation near and far. This partly explains the relatively romantic view of colonialism and the West still prevalent in both cities.
Over the past fifty-odd years their economies have moved in sync rapidly up the industrial ladder, from textiles and electronics manufacturing to services. They have served as reference points for East Asia’s remarkable economic transformation, the leading edge of a supersonic jet, with per capita incomes growing over twenty fold since 1975. Today both are rich global cities with large financial services sectors and some of the world’s worst inequalities.
This is partly a symptom of them being the only global cities without obvious (domestic) hinterlands. So, on the one hand, they welcome huge inflows of capital and talent which, while spurring dynamism, also raises the cost of living and exacerbates inequality. On the other hand, there is nowhere for lower-income citizens to trade down to. Unlike New York City, Hong Kong and Singapore have no New Jersey.
Everybody is stuck in the same pressure cooker. Moving to neighbouring mainland China or Malaysia, respectively, as politicians routinely recommend, is for many an unconscionable option, an ejection from one’s own soil to a foreign land with weaker rule of law and temperamental locals.
To mitigate these innate tensions, the political and business elite in Hong Kong and Singapore have long tempered their liberal economic instincts with some more socialist policies, including in public healthcare, education and pensions.
Widening inequality is rationalised by the preservation of minimum standards: it does not matter how many Lamborghinis race down the streets, as long as the workers can afford jeans while being glued to their smartphones.

Yet the opiates of our generation cannot conceal the drastic shrinking of personal space (and dignity). Hong Kong has some of the world’s smallest apartments. The record paid for one of these “nano units” was HK$34,315 (US$4378) per square foot for a 198 square foot place, or a total of HK$6.52 million (US$830,000) for a space smaller than a garage parking lot.
Ordinary Hong Kongers believe they are at the mercy of a triumvirate of real estate players—a land-owning oligarchy that controls many prime parcels, particularly in the verdant New Territories; developers unafraid to bid up prices; and a local government dependent on land sales revenues—that has benefited from the property bubble.
(One of the many delicious ironies surrounding this year’s events is that Hong Kong might be pining for the sort of land reform that market-oriented mainland China has long outgrown.)
Many Singaporeans, meanwhile, may come to believe that their own government—like in Hong Kong, the biggest landowner—has misled their investment decisions. Since independence in 1965 the government has sold public housing with restricted 99-year leases, repeatedly promising, in the words of Lee Kuan Yew, the first prime minister, that their value “will never go down”.
Most assumed the government would reacquire them at fair value. Only recently, following Lee’s death, has it flip-flopped to confirm what some feared: the properties will be worth nothing at the end of their leases. (At which point the government can redevelop the land.)
Put another way, for almost ninety per cent of Singapore’s population, their largest assets and nest eggs, some worth over S$1m (US$740,000), will start to shrink relentlessly to zero at some point during their (or their heirs’) lifetimes.
By contrast those in the upper ten odd per cent, including most politicians and senior civil servants, have wisely purchased freehold homes, many now worth tens of millions of dollars. Their assets will presumably keep appreciating long after their descendants have inherited them (with no estate duties). Singapore appears to have created an intergenerational time bomb of Pikketyan proportions.

Meanwhile, the middle and lower classes in both Hong Kong and Singapore believe their employment prospects have been squeezed by an assortment of threats, real and perceived, including: Westerners who speak better English; Chinese and Indians who are better corporate liaisons to their motherlands; Bangladeshis, Nepalis and Filipinos willing to work for less; and technological advances, in its many job-replacing forms.
High immigration has been necessary, politicians argue, because Hong Kong and Singapore both have one of the world’s lowest fertility rates, at 1.2 births per woman (well below the replacement level of 2.1). With one of the world’s highest migration rates, over the past thirty years Singapore’s population has doubled. Native-born Singaporeans are now well in the minority.
In 2014 Singapore’s former chief planner suggested an ideal population of 10 million. It may not be long before the hoi polloi are forced into Hong Kong-style shoeboxes. (Currently Singapore’s smallest unit is 258 square feet, thirty per cent larger than Hong Kong’s.)
In order to manage these numerous contradictions, both cities have relied on political models that offer their citizenry limited rights, but in opposite ways. Singapore has electoral democracy, in the form of regular elections, but none of the other substantive pillars present in liberal democracies, such as a free press, freedom of association and a vibrant civil society. Hong Kongers, by contrast, have minimal electoral rights but enjoy all those other facets of a free society. The Economist recently labelled Hong Kong a liberal autocracy; and Singapore an illiberal democracy.
This is more than a cute aphorism for policy wonks. It explains the differing political pressure valves in both societies. This is why Hong Kongers have long taken to the streets to voice their displeasure with their representatives, including the leftist riots of 1967, which ultimately led to social reforms under the British; and why Singaporeans, conversely, have an aversion to public protests, knowing they have the power, even if rarely exercised, to punish the ruling People’s Action Party at the ballot box.
Hong Kongers, in other words, are on their toes every day, watching vigilantly for government overbearingness or corruption. Singaporeans keep their heads down, store up any angst, and tally a mental report card once every few years before voting. Between elections Singaporeans, some of the world’s richest and most educated people, display a stunning degree of apathy toward civic and democratic participation.
There is a connection between their respective political identities and the vigour today with which Hong Kongers and Singaporeans assert their respective cultural identities.
Anti-immigrant sentiment (especially the sort aimed at foreign expats) in Singapore has risen in recent months, although the reality is that most migrant workers are here to do the jobs Singaporeans won't. / Rice File Photo, Zachary Tang
The Nativist Hong Konger
Possibly the most stirring exhibition of Hong Kong’s resurgent local identity occurs ever so often around lunchtime in shopping malls. Crowds press up against the glass barricades overlooking an atrium, like theatre-goers split across multiple levels, to sing Glory to Hong Kong, a new Cantonese song that has quickly become a quasi national anthem (since few sing China’s official Mandarin national anthem).
Malls, oddly, offer an acoustic experience not unlike the echoey splendour of old churches. At Festival Walk in Kowloon Tong, I watched people emerging from a session energised, like devotees who had just received their daily manna.
“The ultimate emblem of capitalism converted into a Hong Kong identity shrine,” noted Rubio Chan, a former Hong Kong civil servant whom I first met during the 2014 Umbrella Movement. Despite all the short-term problems the city is facing now, Chan believes that the togetherness, the sense of belonging, “the Hong Kong spirit” is arguably stronger than at any point since 1841, when the British arrived.
Over the past few years, as Hong Kongers have become more politically active and aware, their interest in other socio-political models has increased, he says. To tap into this, Chan co-founded GLO Travel, a specialised travel agency that takes Hong Kongers on unorthodox “socio-political” type travel, including trips to Iran, where they listen to discussions on Islam and Zoroastrianism, and North Korea, about which he has co-authored a book and filmed a travel show.
But when Hong Kongers visit North Korea, Chan says, it is one of the few times they shed their Hong Kong identity, and unashamedly boast about their Chinese identity, celebrating their blood-ties to the superpower that props up the hermit kingdom.
Some will find it reassuring that beneath all the waffly trappings of identity ensnaring Hong Kongers, a strain of Chinese pragmatism still burns strong.
Rubio Chan.
The Globalist Singaporean
Singaporeans are much friendlier than Hong Kongers, say visitors. We smile, we speak in (better) English, we very rarely snap in Cantonese—or any Asian language—with disdain.
Yet that also reflects the progressive de-Asianisation of Singaporeans over the past five decades, as we have been turned into identity-thin globalists. English and Mandarin, the lubricants of the globalised economy, have been prioritised over all else, including Chinese dialects; Singlish, our creole; and Malay, the language of our neighbours and geographic ancestors. Mother tongues and “ethnic” dresses have become party tricks for public holidays.
When Singaporeans sing Majulah Singapura (Onward Singapore), our Malay national anthem, it is arguably the most mindless demonstration of nationalism in the world today. Five decades on, perhaps three-quarters of Singaporeans still mispronounce their anthem’s words, its meaning lost on them. In sharp contrast to the visceral connection Hong Kongers feel to every word of Glory to Hong Kong, Singaporeans unconsciously parrot Majulah Singapura.
The ill-defined Singapore identity is at best a random assortment of public slogans, from hard work to multiculturalism, and at worst a bare, pragmatic, transactional idea, one about safe streets, low tax rates, and a passport offering unrivalled access to other countries.
In a world riven by identity politics, some might cheer this evisceration of deep ethnic culture, this evolution of pragmatic homo economicus. The Singaporean is, in many ways, a creature moulded to plug neatly into the borderless, soulless, profit-seeking multinational juggernaut.
The surprise to many in Singapore has been that the Hong Kongers—how dare they!—have had the temerity to promote cultural and linguistic nationalism, to try to forge a more local identity. Hai ah, hai ah. You’re meant to be materialists in a global city ruled by Mandarin speakers. Forget Cantonese already.
“Do you think what’s happening in Hong Kong will ever happen in Singapore?” asked an Indian American fund manager who had relocated his family to Singapore several years ago, one of the footloose global elite.
Unlikely, I told him. We do not have a similar sense of communal Singaporean identity.
He was relieved. I felt some regret.
Is This About Freedom, or About People and Corporations?
Hong Kong and Singapore have grown and evolved in concert with the diktats of a globalised economy. While many are tempted to view recent events in Hong Kong purely through the lens of China, it may make more sense to see it as a warning light for unfettered capitalism and globalisation.
For decades the leaders of Hong Kong and Singapore, infused with a neoliberal fervour that might make Reagan blush, have courted multinationals and foreign investors with successive generations of tax holidays and ever-lower tax rates, with promises of easy immigration, with the delivery of essential services like international schools and cheap maids for the “Hong Kong in your twenties, Singapore in your thirties” set of expatriates on a global tour. (Some argue that this is essentially an extension of the structures put in place by the colonial East India Company.)
Any negative impacts on local society have long been downplayed. Darwinian meritocracies coupled with a still-persistent belief in trickle-down economics have ensured that successful locals sneer at those left out, those who “failed” at life. The dwindling of shared spaces means that each person’s experience of the global city differs greatly, the rich insulated from the poor by their chauffeured limousines and guarded country clubs.
“My world is very small,” said a protestor in August. “It consists of Tin Shui Wai and occasional trips to Mongkok and Causeway Bay. I don’t even know the convention centre or Kowloon Bay. This is my home.” This clinical segmentation of life is why privileged visitors like myself can still breeze through Hong Kong unscathed, picking at siu ngor fan, roast goose rice, at leisure while ignoring how the plate came to be.
But one thing Hong Kong this year has proved is that we cannot simply expect the proletariat to hum along in a stressful existence with the bare minimum, coupled with an increasingly small chance of social mobility, and with little say in how they are governed. The age of robots is not yet here.
What all this also means is that the real autocratic impulses facing Hong Kong and, to a lesser extent, Singapore, may not always emanate from local leaders but the arbitrage-and-profit-seeking corporations and the market-oriented ideologies to which they subscribe.
It makes, for instance, Singapore-style high immigration defensible. Consider the vicious cycle: low resident fertility has prompted politicians, drunk on the elixir of GDP growth and chivvied by MNCs threatening to leave, to welcome ever more immigrants; wage and population pressures have in turn forced residents into smaller apartments, further dampening their ability and desire to conceive; making migration even more crucial for the needs of global capitalism.
The very MNCs that depend on harmonious inter-ethnic workplaces are the ones, through their incessant demands on governments for more migrant labour, that unwittingly foster nativism and ethnic strife within “global cities”. In Singapore middle-class professionals from India are the current target of vitriol from locals.
(To be clear, this is not a critique of migration per se, which at a sustainable level is not just economically expedient and socially palatable but morally right.)
One observes the same corporate pressure, implicit or explicit, when it comes to tax rates, labour rights, and much else. This is a world increasingly dominated by technology giants who, more than any other corporate form prior, seem to view humans as replaceable digits.
Thirty years ago it was the sneaker sweatshops of Indonesia. Today it is the service sweatshops all around Hong Kong and Singapore.
Many in Singapore doubt if our Randian leaders, seduced by plutocrats in hoodies, can harness the technology sector’s promise while tempering its excesses. It’s no surprise that the world’s cryptocurrency merchants have made a beeline for Singapore.

Two Cities Drifting Apart
The day after I met Joshua Wong I got into a cab with a thirty-five year old driver whom I will call Li. I spent two minutes trying to tell him about my meeting with “Joshua Wong”. He did not recognise the name, and I wondered if he was feigning ignorance because he did not want to be associated with the protestors.
I showed him my wefie with Wong.
“That’s Wong Chi-Fung! That’s Wong Chi-Fung! How did you get to meet him? You must be a journalist, right?”
Joshua Wong or Wong Chi-Fung? Even the name of a protest leader exposes the linguistic divide. I was the outsider looking in.
Li was amazed at how “cheap” apartments in Singapore are. He lives with his parents in a one-bedroom apartment that is worth HK$6.5 million (US$830,000). He cannot afford to move out and, with his fourteen-hour days, has neither the time nor money to date.
He asked about my favourite cities in China. I named a few: Chengdu, Qingdao, Xi’an.
“Oh Xi’an! Many different people there.”
“Yes, a bit like Hong Kong.”
“There are a lot of Muslims there. I know because they are the cheapest brides. You can get one for ten thousand Hong Kong dollars [US$1,280].”
In that one statement I felt a condensation of so many contemporary Chinese themes: urban anomie; the pragmatism of love and marriage; the preference for some kinds of Muslims (e.g. Xi’an’s Hui) over others (e.g. the Uyghurs); and even the occasional unity of the Chinese sub-continent, stitched together through social media and other modern networks. (Xi’an is over 1,400km from Hong Kong.)
Li and his parents could live decadently if they sold their flat and moved to any number of Chinese provinces. Unsurprisingly they choose to stay in the only city they’ve ever known. As such, their inflated paper wealth is a meaningless statistic.
Yet barring some major crisis in China, we all know where their story will lead. Come 2047 Hong Kong’s (apparent) benefits under the “One country, two systems” will expire. It will likely reintegrate with the Chinese mainland, perhaps as just another city in the planned “Greater Bay Area”, what is shaping up to be the largest conurbation in human history, with already well over 100m inhabitants.
With Joshua Wong.
And therein lies the final curious contrast between Hong Kong and Singapore. Larger socio-political forces of the past few decades mean they are moving in opposite directions vis-a-vis their cultural siblings.
As Hong Kong moves grudgingly but inexorably closer to China, Singapore continues to float gently away from its Malayan roots, as it makes connections to territories and people far away. This is why Hong Kongers are feeling the desperate urge to solidify their hyper-local Cantonese identity; while Singaporeans are comfortable being led by the itinerant, indiscriminating flows of global capitalism and culture (never mind the symbolic nationalism).
Nativist vs globalist is a gross simplification of the complex identity tensions many societies are facing. Yet the fates of Hong Kong and Singapore may offer clues to this thorny issue. Which society will be more successful? Which happier?
And, most importantly, in which would you rather live?

We’ve Lived Through 5 Pandemics in the Past 100 Years. Is Covid-19 Any Different?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-feature-singapore-pandemics-covid-19/,5-Mar-20,"Top image: Former Mandalay Road Hospital, Roots.sg
Now that Covid-19 has hung around long enough for Singapore to implement a nation-wide strategy preventing its spread, commentators are starting to draw comparisons between it and the government’s response to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) pandemic of 2003.
Yet, with the emphasis on SARS, it’s easy to forget that Singapore has been seized by six pandemics (four flu, two flu-like) within a century. That’s an average of one every 16 years; someone born in the 1950s would be living through their fifth pandemic right now.
What interests me, then, is how Singapore society has reacted to these pandemics. Have we learnt anything from past outbreaks? Are we more prepared to tackle the viral outbreaks, more educated on the mechanisms of transmission? Do we know how to take care of each other better?
Or are the French right in saying that the more things change, the more they stay the same?

1918 – 1919 Spanish Flu
What? The 1918 Spanish flu is one of the deadliest pandemics in history. Caused by the H1N1 influenza virus, the flu killed more than 40 million people around the world. It reached Singapore on 18 June 1918; by 8 November, it had subsided.
Numbers? Hard to say—medical and bureaucratic structures were undeveloped then, so it’s impossible to get accurate numbers.
In a paper on Singapore’s influenza pandemics, associate professor of public health Vernon J. Lee, et al., put the number of deaths in Singapore at 2870.
How did we react? Although Singapore’s population was ravaged by the Spanish flu, it seemed that we were spared the worst. The Malaya Tribune, a daily newspaper published in Singapore at that time, reported: “We are not suffering as badly as other countries … Many who have acquired the disease are now back to work and one does not hear whole firms having to close down owing to the lack of staff or whole families being swept away as has occurred elsewhere.”
Clearly, our obsession with the health of the economy (sometimes at the expense of our own) is not a recent phenomenon.
Nor is the practice of racists using the pandemic as a pseudoscientific reason to discriminate against other racial or ethnic groups.
The fatality rate of the 1918 Spanish flu was “disproportionately lower in several more privileged groups like the European communities,” writes Kai Khiun Liew, an assistant professor of communications and information at the Nanyang Technology University.
This led many a racist—like F.W. Field, then Medical Officer of the Malay state of Perak—to speculate on theories of “inherently unhygienic habits” of certain races or going so far as to see the flu as a process of “natural selection” in action.
These are garbage we still hear spewing from the mouths of people—Singaporeans and non-Singaporeans alike—today.

1957 – 1958 Asian Flu
What? The Asian Flu caused an estimated one million deaths around the world. It was first detected in Singapore not on the mainland, but on Pulau Brani on 5 May 1957. But in just three weeks, the Ministry of Health declared the “flu bug beaten”.
Numbers? Again, it’s hard to come up with concrete numbers for the total number of people in Singapore who came down with the Asian flu.
But a case study—or what we think of as a “cluster” today—provides some hints. At the Singapore Naval Base located in Sembawang, a total of 2493 people were infected by the Asian flu, out of a total of 9020 workers. This translates into a 27.6% infection rate, which we can use as a rough benchmark for the whole of Singapore society, as no quarantine measures were put into place.
The total number of deaths was 680, estimates Vernon J. Lee, et al., in the aforementioned paper.
How did we react? First, the positives. Singapore’s scientists, it seems, have always been at the top of the biomedical game.
In 2020, Singapore scientists developed the world’s first test for Covid-19 antibodies.
In 1957, the Asian flu virus was first isolated by a Singaporean doctor, Professor K. A. Lim. This discovery gave us the dubious honour of having the Asian flu termed after Singapore: its official name is Influenza A/Singapore/1/57 (H2N2).
Unfortunately, Singaporeans have always been kiasu and kiasi as well.
In response to the outbreak, Singapore’s then-Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Health, Dr M. Doraisngham, advised Singaporeans not to wear face masks as they would not prevent the virus: “I don’t want to give false hopes to anyone by asking them to wear it.”
But no one paid him any heed: “dispensaries were packed from early morning until late afternoon”, The Straits Times reported on 7 May 1957.
And, in the 1957-version of supermarket hoarding, “hundreds of Chinatown housewives [bought] carrots and green Chinese olives” after hearing a rumour that the juice of these vegetables could cure influenza.
The one thing that was different is the role The Straits Times played in the pandemic.
Evidently forgetting about the Spanish flu that killed an estimated 2870 people in Singapore just 40 years ago, the paper ran an article with the headline: “SINGAPORE FLU SCARE” and described the Asian flu as “the worst [epidemic] in the Colony’s history”.
It’s a little strange to think that, before the era of POFMA and The Newspaper and Printing Presses Act of 1974—which greatly curtailed press freedom by limiting “management shares” of newspaper companies to government-approved individuals—The Straits Times was as naughty as some of our online publications today.

1968 Hong Kong Flu
What? As its name suggests, this pandemic was first detected in Hong Kong on 13 July 1968, and eventually went on to kill an estimated one million people worldwide. It was first mentioned in local media in a 14 August 1968 The Straits Time article, which described it as “a mild outbreak of influenza”. Like the Asian flu, the Hong Kong flu ran its course within a month, and by early September, had virtually disappeared.
Numbers? No hard numbers exist … yes, it seems keeping an accurate number on diagnosed cases was not our government’s strong suit back then.
So, like the 1957 Asian flu, we have to extrapolate from specific case studies. At the University of Singapore, 19.2% of the entire population—i.e. ranging from students to non-academic staff—was infected by the Hong Kong flu.
A Ministry of Home Affairs report entitled “Preparing for a Human Influenza Pandemic in Singapore” estimates that “540 people out of a population of 2 million were killed” by the Hong Kong flu.
How did we react? The Hong Kong flu didn’t cause that much a stir in Singapore because it was, till then, the mildest flu pandemic to dock in Singapore. As the numbers above demonstrate, it was the shortest flu pandemic, least transmitted, and least fatal.
In fact, the Hong Kong flu caused so little stir in Singapore that its arrival was announced only on page 6 of The Straits Times, compared to the hysterical front-page pronouncement of the same paper a decade earlier. Neither did the government impose any quarantine measures of school closures.
One thing that the flu exposed was the schisms money wedged between people. According to Vernon J. Lee, et al., “attack rates were lower for [people] with higher socioeconomic status (6.0% – 20.4%) than for persons with lower socioeconomic status (29.0% – 29.8%), which suggested that socioeconomic status had a possible role in disease transmission.”
Perhaps richer people could afford to stay away from work, to see doctors, or knew more about transmission methods because of their education status. The reason for the disparity in numbers isn’t definitive. But what is definite is that this socioeconomic divide in responses to a flu pandemic still exists today.

2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Pandemic
What? SARS is technically not a flu pandemic as it is caused by a coronavirus (like Covid-19), not the influenza virus. Still, patients exhibit flu-like symptoms, so, for purposes of this article, it will be considered in tandem with the other flu pandemics.
The first SARS case was confirmed in Guangdong, China, in November 2002. By the time it fizzled out in July 2003, it had killed 774 people out of 8098 confirmed cases.
SARS arrived in Singapore almost exactly 17 years ago, on 1 March 2003. The first SARS patient was a woman who contracted the virus while in Hong Kong.
The pandemic hung around Singapore for approximately three months: the World Health Organisation declared Singapore SARS-free on 30 May 2003.
Numbers? Finally, some hard numbers. A report from the Ministry of Health puts Singapore’s total number of “probable SARS cases” at 238; the first case was reported on 25 February 2003, while the last case 5 May 2003.
A total of 33 people in Singapore died from SARS.
How did we react? With the usual fear, paranoia, panic: we stopped watching movies; we stocked up on healthcare supplies; we avoided beverages with names suspiciously similar to the virus. (The Corona Beer of SARS is … Sarsi. Not kidding.)
But SARS taught us that Singaporeans aren’t all that bad. Set up in 2003 to “provide relief to SARS victims and healthcare workers and their dependents” (among other objectives), The Courage Fund received over $15 million in donations from corporations and the public.
Chua Mui Hoong writes in A Defining Moment: How Singapore Beat SARS that, apart from money, anonymous people also donated fruits and flowers to healthcare workers at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, which was then the epicentre of SARS.
17 years later, the generosity of Singaporeans is playing out the same way. According to Today, about $3.2 million has been raised for The Courage Fund, which will, this time, assist frontline healthcare workers, volunteers, and victims of Covid-19. And, as we keep hearing in the news, people are also handing out free masks and hand sanitisers to strangers who need them.

H1N1-2009 Pandemic
What? More commonly—though inaccurately—known as swine flu, this pandemic is a resurgence of the deadly 1919 Spanish flu virus, though very much milder. In Asia, it infected close to 400,000 people, causing 2000 deaths. Our first case of H1N1-2009, a Singaporean who had returned from New York, was confirmed on 26 May 2009. But it never really went away—more on that later.
Numbers? Around 415,000 people in Singapore were infected by H1N1-2009 within the span of nine months.
Out of this 415,000 people, there were 21 deaths.
How did we react? As the numbers suggest, even though H1N1-2009 was incredibly virulent, it was also remarkably mild. In fact, this particular strain of the flu virus is still in circulation now, and has now become one of our usual seasonal flu variants.
Therefore, no real measures were taken, nor did we react in any extraordinary way, despite DORSCON being raised to Orange for a good two weeks. I suppose that’s extraordinary in itself.

Covid-19 has shone a spotlight on the “psychological defence” aspect of our Total Defence ethos, prompting much commentary and speeches from ministers on the need for Singaporeans to remember the lessons SARS taught us and be resilient/heed advice/go on staycations etc.
Yet historical precedence tells us that Singaporeans have been exhibiting the same patterns of behaviour across all six flu-like pandemics that have struck our nation in the past century. No amount of conditioning, so to speak, can change the way we react to a sudden outbreak of disease on our shores.
In other words, maybe we haven’t really learnt anything. We will continue to be fearful, prejudiced, and stock up on healthcare products unnecessarily. But also generous, grateful, and selfless to strangers we hardly know.
These five pandemics—and its latest appearance, Covid-19—tell us that, for better or for worse, we haven’t changed in 100 years.
Note: A pandemic is simply an epidemic that has obtained a passport and is now globetrotting. At the point of publication, Covid-19 is still considered an epidemic, but for purposes of this article, Covid-19 will be treated as a pandemic.
An earlier version of this article erroneously labelled SARS and Covid-19 as flu pandemics. This is inaccurate: even though they cause flu-like symptoms, they are not considered influenza as they are not caused by the influenza virus, but by a coronavirus. We apologise for the mistake and thank a reader for pointing it out.

"Banned In Singapore, This Film Asks Necessary Questions About What It Means To Love Your Country",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-to-singapore-with-love/,7-Aug-20,"Images courtesy of Tan Pin Pin / ‘To Singapore, with Love’
Char Kway Teow is a famous hawker dish that is ubiquitous in Singapore, but it is not a Singaporean invention. It has roots in Chaozhou, in China’s Guangdong province, and was believed to have been brought over by Teochew immigrants. In fact, the dish is popular across Southeast Asia, with notable variants in places like Penang.
But ask any Singaporean and they would describe some traits that define the dish locally: the ratio of flat noodles to yellow noodles, the dark colour, the sweet and savoury flavour, the inclusion of ingredients like beansprouts, eggs, cockles, and lap cheong (Chinese sausage). Singaporeans have been called foodies and, indeed, the local hawker and food culture has been celebrated as a source of national pride, going as far as to be nominated for recognition on the Unesco Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity.
Director Tan Pin Pin understands this as she opens her film To Singapore, with Love with a man living in London cooking Char Kway Teow.
“It’s partly how to cope when you’re abroad, not to feel defeated. You still try to cook your own Singapore food,” he explains as he stirs the wok full of noodles and prawns.
Wait, prawns? He admits with a knowing smile his version is a little different from the one back home. We learn his name is Ho Juan Thai, a political exile living in London. Given that he has not returned home in decades, it is understandable his Char Kway Teow looks a little different.
To Singapore, with Love grapples with dark spots in Singapore’s past, with events whose historical truths have been hotly contested and remains a difficult conversation topic, a conversation that was avoided in 2013 when the release of the film was banned in its own country. Singapore’s Infocomm Media Development Authority justified the ban by stating the film gave “distorted and untruthful accounts” and would “undermine national security”.
A Human Experience
In an interview with Pin Pin, the director explained how state archives for historical events recounted in the film had not been released, so she had only first-hand accounts and newspaper reports to go on. That is not to say these accounts are not factual or worth considering; they certainly are. Even so, the film is not very interested in verifying this time in history.
It doesn’t linger on investigating the actions of the government or the supposed conspirators in those operations. It is not a polemical film asserting who was right and who was wrong. Instead, it is a humanist film that lends voice to people who have been silenced.
Humanism is a broad way of thinking that can stretch into philosophy, the arts, and humanities. Its basic principles include human reason, ethics, and justice, often looking into individual human experiences to draw meaning and uphold human dignity. True to the humanist tradition, To Singapore, with Love recognises its subjects’ basic dignity to let them speak, lingering on their experiences, thoughts, hopes, and dreams. Besides interviews, we see these people live their daily lives: they cook meals for their families, they interact with colleagues in their workplace, they play with their children, they reminisce about the past through old photographs and possessions. What’s most telling about these people, and what informs the film’s title, is that they long to return to a country in which they are being persecuted. All of them still love Singapore.
In a 2014 statement about the film on Facebook, Pin Pin described it as a portrait of Singapore seen from an external view—from exiles recounting their memories living in Singapore, and literally as the film closes with shots looking at the island from across the causeway in Johor Bahru. The film is as much about these people as it is about the Singapore People who make up the island nation.
Notions of national identity are raised when these exiles are forced to live abroad—in one instance, Ang Swee Chai recounts being questioned by an Internal Security Department officer who warns her of life in exile, that she would be nobody overseas—and the film interrogates the idea of the nation to ask “What is Singapore?” It is a searching question that our supposedly young nation still asks itself today (was Singapore born in 1965, 1959, 1819, 1299 or some other date?). Without giving any clear answers, the film gives us some clues through these stranded Singaporeans.
Cultures Make Country
The first clue is delivered right from the opening of the film. Singapore has a self-professed love for food indulging in a diverse range of local delicacies. This food euphoria is emblematic of a shared culture grown within Singapore; it came about as a result of the intermingling of various peoples who built a community together.
Nations are constructed by its people and are malleable entities that change with the tides of history. This is evident where civil conflict is rife as communities of people band together or resist one another. What binds these communities together is the notion of the nation which can be broadly split into a political domain regarding the political system that governs the community, and an ethno-cultural domain that is built from shared language, ethnicity, tradition, culture, religion etc.
Given Singapore’s multiracial demographic, her national identity isn’t built based on race but on other cultural characteristics like food, Singlish (an invented vernacular based on the assimilation of languages from different ethnic groups), and being Kiasu (a fear of losing out). Though Singaporeans like to claim these traits as uniquely Singaporean, they are also found across Southeast Asia and other diasporic communities.
For instance, Malaysia has many similar versions of hawker delights and ways of speaking. Nonetheless, Singaporeans have adopted these traits as their own through invented traditions and shared living experiences.
My Family, My Home
Traditions are the stuff of families; habits, games, and rituals are passed down a familial lineage to create a strong sense of belonging to one’s family. What the people in To Singapore, with Love miss most is their families and this is explored through Swee Chai and Juan Thai.
Both often think about their mothers—Swee Chai ponders the heartache her mother must have endured for her daughter’s sake, and we see Juan Thai celebrate his mother’s birthday remotely through Skype. Swee Chai doesn’t have children, fearing their safety if anything happens to the exiled parents. Juan Thai also shared this fear but eventually settled down with his own family in his 60s. The love he has for his children is moving—he calls it a wonderful thing that he hopes all Singaporeans can experience. Despite being born and raised in London, he still wants his sons to be Singapore citizens, to grow up and serve Singapore’s conscription army; the connection to his homeland extends that deep.
The idea of a nation is built over generations of people who lived and died on the land, who have had families that carry on their tradition. For a lot of people, where we grew up is the same as where our families grew up, so the space that we inhabit becomes synonymous with family and home, thus countries are often referred to as one’s ‘homeland’.
Swee Chai still remembers the exact address of her childhood home in Serangoon after decades away. Others like Chan Sun Wing, who now lives in Thailand, also remembers his homeland fondly; in a poem, he cites the many roads and sites in Singapore that were stomping grounds in his youth.
Connections to space are explored in geography, and for a humanist film that explores the lives of people, it is useful to turn to humanist geographer Yi-Fu Tuan for insight.
Tuan is famous for popularising the distinction between place and space; put simply, place refers to the physical geography in which we live, and space refers to the meanings attached to the place by our individual experiences of the place. Nations are such spaces where meaning is constructed and associated with the geographical land by communities that reside in them. This also suggests that the nation is an unstable category that can be changed based on the individual’s experiences.
The ideal of the American Dream, for example, embodies such a shifting concept of national identity where even immigrants can call America their new home. Though their circumstances differ wildly from hopeful migrants, the people in To Singapore, with Love have also lived in different countries and built formative experiences there. Juan Thai started his own family in London, Swee Chai had personal moments of revelation attending demonstrations held in London, Tan Wah Piow has set up his own law firm in London. Yet, they still have strong connections to Singapore. Taking a humanist perspective, it is easy to see why.
Sharing Personal and National Histories
The former members of Barisan Socialis and Communist Party of Malaya seen in the film have all been part of key historical moments in modern Singapore’s formation. Their personal experiences of struggle are the same struggles that formed Singapore. Political ideologies and historical “truths” aside, these people grew up in and have a close affinity for their homeland, taking part in struggles that have been pivotal moments in their individual and communal histories.
In the same poem by Sun Wing, he tells of his experiences during the Japanese Occupation and Singapore’s independence from British rule, cheering ‘Merdeka’ at the old Kallang Airport.
The shared history of people and country is also seen in the other interviewees; former student leaders and activists like Juan Thai who advocated the preservation of ethnic languages and Wah Piow who campaigned for worker rights, all of whom took active part in shaping the trajectory of their country in the hopes of bettering society. These people were present at the birth of the Republic of Singapore, they were the Merdeka and Pioneer generations of Singaporeans, their personal histories enmeshed with the nation’s history.
Much in the same way Singaporeans today belong to the nation by sharing historical moments—living through national hardships like economic recessions and health pandemics, or celebrating victories in international sports competitions—the people in To Singapore, with Love have a deep sense of belonging to Singapore by their lived experiences in the nation that remains their home.
Who is Singapore?
As Singapore, and the rest of the world, continues to live through the Covid-19 pandemic, nations are shying away from globalised networks and turning inward. We, in Singapore, have celebrated some triumphs against the pandemic while other problems have surfaced that test our ideas of community and who has membership to the country, casting light on this very important question: “What is Singapore?”
In the same 2014 statement on Facebook, Pin Pin said she made To Singapore, with Love because she wanted to better understand Singapore.
Indeed, after viewing the film, a response to “What is Singapore?” can be more clearly articulated, but it is a question that cannot be definitively answered. It needs to be continually discussed and reimagined, it needs to include voices of people who have been marginalised but have as much a stake in the national conversation as any “regular” Singaporean. Singapore has historically been a place that supports diversity, built by diversity, and must continue to thrive on diversity.
The film ends with an original song by the late Francis Khoo; it is a folk song titled “Anak Pulau Singapura” and, like all good folk music, it is simple but carries heavy wisdom that serve us well to remember.
I am a child of my island, the fairest island by far
Selatan tanah Melayu, anak palau Singapura.
(In the south of the Malay land, the child of the island, Singapura)
Inilah riwayat kita (This is our story); we have a story to tell you
Of how we worked hard to make this part of our tanah air ku (motherland).
Our fathers came from the mainland and other lands far away.
They made the old Sri Temasek the thriving city of today.
Dari dulu sampai sekarang, siapa yang membina sekolah dan mendirikan bangunan?
(From then until now, who built schools and erected buildings?)
Ialah semua rakyat kita (They were built by the people).
So as a child of my island, I know the ink is not dry
Our story’s still yet unwritten, today I’ll join my people’s cry.

Conversion, Circumcision, And An Angry Mum: The Journey of One Couple’s Interracial Marriage",Zu Xiang Ng,TRUE,TRUE
"Red, White, and Black: The Lives of African Singaporeans and PRs",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-african-singaporeans-prs/,4-Apr-20,"Images by Dennis Khung, Cheryl Tang, and Zachary Tang.
“If you’re black, being in Singapore is a blessing,” Theresa Mindi Saguda tells me over a meal of Swahili fish curry (mine) and Moroccan lemon chicken tagine (hers). “I feel like we encourage a culture of tolerance and acceptance here. People aren’t fazed by different races as much.”
I choke in incredulity. Or maybe it is the sour-spicy hit of the habanero and tamarind that just hit the back of my throat.
Unperturbed, Mindi, whose family comes from Tanzania, goes on, “Anywhere else would be tough. I’ve had family who have experienced racism even in other African countries.”
Surprisingly—to my cynical heart, at least—this sentiment is not unique to Mindi. Over the past few months, I’ve been hanging out with various Singaporeans and Permanent Residents of African descent to find out more about this community.
Talking to them, I learnt that, despite the microaggressions and stereotyping they face occasionally, all of them appreciate the inclusive racial policies in Singapore that we often take for granted. Furthermore, even though only one out of four have attained citizenship (two of them are still in the process of applying for it), all of them consider themselves Singaporeans, so I will respect the terms they use to describe themselves.
A caveat: I’ll be the first to admit my ignorance. Prior to writing this story, I didn’t even know there was a community of Africans who have sunk their roots into this tiny equatorial island, so far from the continental landmass that is Africa.
Any knowledge I had of black Singaporeans was limited to what I had learnt from watching Ayer Hitam: A Black History of Singapore, a 2019 play, and the occasional viral posts on social media, such as this Tweet imploring us not to throw the “N-word” around, or Alvin Philemon’s TikTok videos documenting his crazy versatile accents and Tweets documenting his crazy versatile parents.
These social media posts offer us voyeurs living in our bubbles (one we ought to burst) a glimpse of what life is like for this community. Beyond the 30 seconds of a TikTok video or 280 characters in a Tweet, however, there is so much more to them that I—like many other Singaporeans—remain blind to and even insensitive towards.
What’s it like for black Africans to live in Singapore? Why did their family choose to emigrate here? How do they stay connected with their cultural roots? What are some things we always get wrong about their heritage and culture?
Most importantly, do they like durian?
Theresa Mindi Saguda, who prefers to be known as Mindi, in Kafe Utu, a restaurant serving African-style cuisine.
“I LOVE durian,” Mindi enthuses.
All right, that’s it, interview’s over, I think. I know everything I need to know about Mindi. She’s more Singaporean than all my traitorous friends who have applied for a restraining order against our holy king of fruits.
Then she continues: “My dad LOVES durian too. We first had it three years ago at a church event—durian ice cream, durian mochi.”
It seems apt that Mindi’s dad is as big a patriot as she is, seeing as he was the one who decided to fly his family to Singapore in the early 90s. However, like so many life-altering decisions that we make, his move was not born from logic but a whim.
“There was no cool, real reason,” Mindi says, laughing. “He saw Singapore on a map and just decided to go.”
Mindi’s necklace has a pendant in the shape of the African continent. Continent. Not country.
About ten years after he settled in Singapore with his wife, Mindi was born. At 21 this year, Mindi is a Permanent Resident (PR), but fully intends to apply for citizenship because of how she feels about living in Singapore.
“I definitely consider Singapore my home,” Mindi says. “Born in Singapore, raised here my whole life, went to local schools: CHIJ, Crescent Girls’ School, junior college, and now I’m in NUS studying political science.”
“When people ask me where I’m from, I tell them ‘Singapore’.”
“And when they reply, “Where are you really from?” Mindi mutters, a dark cloud drifting across her face, “I tell them, ‘My parents are from East Africa, if that’s what you’re asking.’”
Doesn’t Mindi feel some form of attachment towards Tanzania, though?
“Actually, I feel even more foreign in Tanzania than in Singapore,” Mindi reflects. “People there can tell I’m not Tanzanian by the way I dress and walk.”
How do Singaporeans walk?! I ask her.
“I don’t know, I’m Singaporean, so I can’t tell the difference!” she retorts.
Fair point.
“Walk faster? Like aunties on the MRT?” she suggests.
Her words conjure a determinedly striding auntie with a tote bag kiapped by her armpit, pushing the MRT doors open with sheer strength. Yes, that’s Singapore. So I concede the point to Mindi.
Mindi goes on: “I don’t know the culture, I don’t speak the language … when I go back to Tanzania, my relatives speak to me in Swahili, but I can’t respond and they get confused.
Kafe Utu is decorated with art and artifacts from various African countries.
Listening to Mindi, I feel an odd sense of solidarity with her. I, too, was unable to talk to my late grandparents or relate to their culture because they spoke in dialect, a language lost to me. Indeed, it seems that the immigrant’s complex relationship with their “home” and “host” culture and language is a universal struggle, regardless of “where we come from” (itself a problematic concept, as Mindi’s annoyance with the question demonstrates).
“Or I respond in Chinese because Swahili and Chinese are both very unfamiliar [to me] so for some reason they gel together in my mind,” Mindi says, throwing a spanner into my thoughts.
Wait—Chinese?
“I was forced to learn Chinese for 12 years, till I was in JC,” she grumbles. “My dad was like, ‘China is coming to Tanzania, the language is a good skill to learn. You can help the people there.”
“你的中文一定比我好. [You are definitely more fluent in Mandarin than I am],” I say.
Laughing, Mindi takes the bait and demonstrates her prowess: “一点点而已。 没有啊， 不会不会. [I only know a little bit; not that much better than you.]”
Her enunciation is immaculate—if I had closed my eyes, I would have thought those words came from a Tanjong Pagar OL.
“My Chinese is better than my Swahili! But honestly, the [best] use of Chinese is to flex to the uncles and aunties at the hawker centre,” Mindi admits. “So I can get a bigger portion when I order black carrot cake and satay.”
More artwork and books at Kafe Utu.
Mindi’s integration into Singapore culture hasn’t come without a cost, however. As she explains, she feels as if she has lost touch with her parents’ Swahili culture and language. Her mum, who is currently living in Tanzania, sends her elementary school Swahili textbooks in the hopes that Mindi will pick up the language again.
And even though she might see herself as a Singaporean, other Singaporeans may not, at least on first glance. It is only when “they realise I’m Singaporean that they treat me the same,” Mindi says.
Mindi doesn’t blame them—she acknowledges that she “doesn’t look Singaporean”. (Though, to me, physical looks should play no part in determining someone’s affiliation to a community unless it’s a cosplay or drag queen group or something.)
“There is a schism between who I am and who others see me as,” Mindi says. “Although I may feel Singaporean, do everything Singaporean, sound Singaporean … although this is home, people around me don’t see me as Singaporean, as part of them.”
This disconnection between inner identity and outer appearance—something every adolescent struggles with during puberty—was hence amplified for Mindi as she was growing up.
I was bullied a lot because of my hair [which is naturally dense and curly]. So I straightened and rebonded my hair every two months, so I would look more Chinese. But my hair refused to cooperate. It started to break off.
Because of how distinct her hair looks, it would always attract unwanted attention in public as well, making Mindi feel like “an exhibition”. She recounts to me a particularly egregious encounter:
“I remember in May 2019, I was in the toilet in Jewel and this auntie came up to me, touched my hair, and she said, ‘Negro hair.’ And I was like …”
Mindi is then lost for words; her face takes on an expression that I can only describe as “?????????!!!????”
Thankfully for Mindi, she found solace in Instagram. When she was in secondary school, the app was launched and introduced her to the world of black culture. She started following black women and black artists—in short, black role models and representation, painfully scarce in “a sea of Asian people” in Singapore.
It was then that Mindi started to take care of her hair and embrace her identity both as a black woman and a Singaporean. She has since reconciled the two aspects of her identity—a synthesis-through-struggle that, I suspect, many of us second- or third-generation immigrants in Singapore have to undergo.
“You create your own culture,” Mindi declares. “It can be said for most Singaporeans as well. You can’t connect to mainland China, India … you just do the ceremonial Chinese New Year.”
And in what is perhaps the best encapsulation of who Mindi is, she suddenly exclaims, “Oh! Actually, my prom dress was like a low-key cheongsam.”
“People say it’s cultural appropriation.”
“But no. I’m Singaporean. I can’t appropriate my own culture.”
Rolu Oyekanmi tucking into a hearty plate of roast meats at Rong Liang Restaurant, which, according to him, serves the best char siew in the west of Singapore.
I next meet Rolu Oyekanmi, a 25-year-old chemical engineer and Singapore citizen who says he’s from Nigeria but who I think is really from Muscle Beach, California, because his biceps and pectorals are struggling to burst free from the teal shirt he has on.
The truth about his background lies somewhere in the middle. Rolu is half-Nigerian and half-Filipino; he first arrived in Singapore 15 years ago, when his late father was sent here to help set up the Asia-Pacific headquarters of his company. Prior to that, Rolu grew up mostly in the Philippines, with some time spent in Nigeria.
Rolu, then, is an immigrant playing on hard mode. Unlike the typical dichotomy most immigrants face, he has to negotiate between three identities: Nigerian, Filipino, Singaporean.
Keeping up with the cultures takes time and effort, but Rolu puts in the work. One way he keeps his Nigerian side alive is by cooking Sunday rice—so termed because it is often eaten after church on Sunday. Rolu is particularly fond of Jollof rice, which he describes as “a tomato-based fried rice [that is] the Nigerian national dish”. He also constantly visits his mother, who currently lives in the Philippines.
Those are not all the cultures Rolu juggles.
“Sometimes my Chinese friends invite me for Chinese New Year,” he says, “and a lot of my friends are Malay so I have gone visiting for Hari Raya too.”
In other words, Rolu is multiculturalism personified. This is most evident in the number of languages he speaks. In addition to English, he speaks Yoruba, Tagalog, and French (which he took as a third language in secondary school).
“I also speak Singlish!” he insists.
“One thing that’s very similar between Singapore and Nigeria is the fact that people use a lot of pidgin language. In Nigeria if you don’t speak in the pidgin language people will be like, ‘Ah you’re a foreigner.’ In Singapore, if you’re Singaporean-looking and you don’t speak Singlish, people will be like, ‘Ah you jiak kantang.’”
“That’s because a pidgin language is the best way to understand another person’s culture.”
Rolu is a really cool dude.
Going by that logic, Rolu—with his “jiak kantang” and “eh bro you do this can already” thrown casually into our conversation—is as much a Singaporean as any of us.
Rolu confirms this: “I grew up here. Singapore is my home; I see myself as Singaporean.”
I wonder at the strength with which he pronounces that statement. I’m not trying to cast doubt at his sentiment, but if I had a tri-cultural background, my struggle in figuring out Who I Really Am would have been a lot more protracted and angsty.
Wagering a guess, I ask him if National Service played a part in nurturing this unambiguous sense of belonging in him.
“Oh hell no!” Rolu fires back immediately.
We chuckle in commiseration, the shared misery of all Singaporean men 18 and above from 17 March 1967 resurrected in that laughter.
After this brief moment of trauma (for me) passes, Rolu clarifies: “NS just cemented what I already knew [about my identity].” Indeed, is there anything more quintessentially Singaporean than a bunch of middle-aged men nursing a nascent beer belly reminiscing about their BMT days over a round of Tiger beer?
(We were not drinking beer then, and you’d have to replace the beer belly with abs [on both Rolu and me], but that was essentially us.)
“I experienced a lot of stereotypes in NS,” Rolu laughs. “People always think black people run really fast. Especially in BMT, they were like, ‘This guy is going to run 2.4 in 5 minutes.’”
Swipe right.
So did he?
“I did mine in a … respectable time.” He refuses to tell me what this “respectable time” was.
And even though it was a stereotype, Rolu doesn’t think it was done in malice.
“Nobody … used any slurs or negative stereotypes. It’s always been like a joking thing. You could argue that jokes could still be offensive. But it’s more like a casual jab directed personally to me instead of people of my colour.”
After he ORD-ed, Rolu applied for citizenship and was granted it during his freshman year at NUS. He invited his friends from Tembusu College to witness his citizenship ceremony: the oath-taking, pink NRIC acceptance, and all that. However, it was not a momentous occasion, Rolu says.
“It was just paper confirmation. I’d always thought of myself as a Singaporean.”
“After that, we had dim sum at Tim Ho Wan.”
Alvin Philemon and his mother Angela Verah in their Hougang HDB flat.
There are two types of parents in the world ...
There are two photographs of Alvin Philemon at his Passing-Out Parade (POP) ceremony.
In the first, Alvin is posing with his mother, Angela Verah. She affectionately lays her head on his shoulder, puts her arm around his shoulder; her caption of the photograph reads: “What an honour to see you marching like a real Soldier 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾”
His father, Walter Philemon, is standing beside him in the second. Walter’s face is stoic but hides a smile, as if anticipating the dad joke that is to come in the caption: “Sometimes I need armed bodyguard,”.
Juxtaposing these two photographs with each other, Alvin tweets: “the difference between an african [sic] mom and dad”.
In real life, however, I quickly realise that Angela has the same wry but warm humour as her husband.
When I ask Angela how she feels about her son’s viral fame, she confides in me, “POP is not a big deal! I went to the army in Tanzania for one year, it was compulsory. I trained for combat … we did everything ourselves, even cooking!”
Beside me, Alvin sits on the couch, on his face the tight grimace-smile all children unconsciously put on whenever their parents crack a deprecating joke at their expense.
A series of photographs of the Serengeti (I think) in the Philemon’s home.
Some context: Alvin has graciously invited me to his house, so here I am in an HDB apartment in Hougang, talking to her and Alvin.
Their house oozes a sort of African chic. It’s bathed in a warm orange light reminiscent of the sun setting on the Serengeti, of which there is a series of posters hanging on their wall. Tchotchkes with tribal designs dot their house. From the decor of their house, it’s evident that the Philemon family—who hails from Tanzania—has dressed up their house to remind them of their old home.
Angela and Walter decided to move to Singapore in the 90s because Walter was invited here by his cousin.
Angela’s response upon learning that they were to move to Singapore was: “Oh my gosh, I didn’t even know what was Singapore. I asked my friends to find Singapore on the map for me. It was just a tiny dot!”
“There was one person who knew Singapore very well. He said, ‘It’s Singapura. Not Singapore.’”
Like all the other black Singaporeans and PRs I hung out with, Angela (who is a PR) eventually integrated into Singapore society—so well that when she goes back to Tanzania to visit her relatives, she finds it hard to adapt.
“In Singapore, we are taught manners, taught to queue up. So when I go home, I try to bring that. It’s not working. My sister tells me off, ‘Don’t bring your Singapore style here!’”
Some groceries that Angela stocks up on whenever she visits her relatives in Tanzania.
Her one complaint about Singapore is how difficult it is to find groceries she uses for traditional Tanzanian cuisine. Thus, whenever she goes back to Tanzania, Angela stocks up on bags of traditional maize flour and spices, which she commands Alvin to retrieve from her kitchen cabinet to show me.
This is not to say Angela only cooks 100% ‘authentic’ Tanzanian food while in Singapore—it’s only brought to table “when we really really really really really miss home”. As an avid fan of cooking shows on Food Network, she cooks all cuisines, from African, to Italian, to Indian, to Chinese … (“Lucky you,” I mutter to Alvin.)
Angela sums up her cooking skills: “My cooking is anyhow: put in this, put in that.”
Which, I think, is an apt analogy for how Singapore society was formed: put in this, put in that.
Angela bemoaning Alvin’s disconnection from his Tanzanian roots, like how my mum scolds me for not knowing Teochew.
Yet, as with any immigrant family, the connection to your homeland (a term that I am using loosely) becomes more and more tenuous with each new generation born in your adopted land.
“Alvin knows nothing about African culture,” Angela laments.
“I’m learning!” Alvin interjects.
“He’s learning. Can’t even speak the language. So if he goes home now, it’s really hard for him to adapt … here, he is taught not to talk to strangers. But at home, there are no strangers. You must say hello to everybody. Even people you don’t know. You must. It’s culture.”
The gulf between Alvin and his parents’ culture is not that surprising. Like Mindi, Rolu, and many second-generation immigrants, his bond to the place he grew up in is much stronger than that to an abstract cultural homeland he has visited perhaps once a year through his whole life.
Alvin’s expression is the expression all of us take when our parents nag at us.
At the same time, like Mindi, Alvin can’t shake off the feeling that he’s only Singaporean on the inside.
“I think of myself as ‘Singaporean-ish’ … I feel Singaporean but I’m a PR, but I’m serving in the army and went through a local primary and secondary school, but I don’t look like Singaporean … that kind of thing.”
I blink at him for a bit, and he elaborates: “You know my whole code-switching thing? Sometimes when I meet new people I speak in Singlish or Chinese to them, and they get kind of confused because of how I look. Then I’m reminded that … I’m an African. Oh ya, I forgot that I’m Singaporean-ish.”
Alvin says this in a humorous, self-deprecating tone, but—maybe I’m projecting—I hear, and feel, an undercurrent of sadness in his voice, that of someone who has yet to find unconditional acceptance from the place he calls his home.
Even Angela, who has lived in Singapore for more than 30 years, who has worked in multiple jobs, seen the MRT system develop from “just two lines—red and green!”, raised a family in a HDB flat in Hougang, still doesn’t feel entirely at home.
“Singapore is home away from home,” she says.
Like all HDB homes, the Philemon’s apartment has a collection of trinkets and random magnets accumulated over the years.
As I am tying my shoelaces, preparing to head off, Angela suddenly bursts out: “How could I invite you to my house without offering you some African food or drinks! You like masala tea?” (Masala tea is very popular in East Africa; in general, East African food is heavily influenced by Arab and Indian cuisine, according to Angela.)
I nod.
“Next time, you must come back. You ask Alvin, and I will cook you a meal.”

At the end of all three of my conversations with these Singaporeans and PRs of African descent, I ask them what some misconceptions about their heritage other Singaporeans tend to have, or what we should be aware of when we think about the countries on the African continent. Their responses were, by and large, identical:
“Africa is not a country.”
“African is not a language.”
“We don’t live in trees. We live in buildings. Big ones!”
“We have roads. People drive fancy cars. We have Lamborghinis.”
“African-American is not the same as African.”
And most fundamentally:
It’s not cool to say the N-word. Shows how ignorant you are.
As their experiences demonstrate, African Singaporeans and PRs do not find straightforward acceptance in Singapore. They still encounter microaggressions and ignorant stereotypes directed at them.
Mindi encounters people who comment on and fondle her hair without invitation. Rolu is teased about his body. Angela and Alvin contend with people staring at them like they are an exotic sight.
These grievances aside, all of them—Mindi, Rolu, Angela and Alvin—expressed how rooted to Singapore they feel.
One reason for their attachment to this land is gratitude. They are grateful that they don’t face the sort of racism against black people that is interwoven into governing structures and ingrained by historical circumstances. (What we have here is an improvement over that, but it’s a low bar that we are clearing and we can, surely, do better.)
Another is that they genuinely enjoy the character of Singapore and Singapore society.
Rolu likes the cosmopolitan and multiracial aspect of Singapore society, especially because we get “lots of holidays in a year” thanks to all the different festivals we celebrate (he says this half-seriously). Mindi, as mentioned at the start of the piece, thinks that “being black in Singapore is a blessing”.
And, in Alvin’s words, “whatever you are, whatever you believe in, Singapore is a safe place for you”.
Ordinarily, I would have cringed and made some dry heaving noises if I heard that statement from an organisation or government body. I can immediately think of some demographics that would disagree with that assertion.
But this time, it comes to me straight from the mouth of someone from an ethnic group usually discriminated against. Who am I to question the sincerity or accuracy of his statement and lived experiences?
What matters, at the end of the day, is that this community has found a home in Singapore, and we are enriched by their presence.
This piece is brought to you by the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth (MCCY).
Everyone wants to feel at home—but this is easier said than done. MCCY’s mission has long been to make Singapore the best home for everyone by fostering a sense of identity and belonging to Singapore. Part of this also involves promoting inclusivity, empathy and understanding of the different communities that make up our society.

Singapore is Still Burdened by its Experience in the Vietnamese Refugee Crisis,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-ricexdialogic-singapore-burdened-experience-vietnamese-refugee-crisis/,21-Jul-20,"This is a Shortlisted entry in the Rice Media x DLS Op-Ed competition.

Singapore’s stance regarding refugees and asylum-seekers has long been the same — refugees are not welcome here.
As a multicultural society with no shortage of residents and tourists from other parts of the world, one would think that Singapore is a global city open to foreigners. However, this is not the case. While immigrants and foreign talents — who are perceived to be able to value-add to Singapore’s society and economy — are granted entry into our borders, many refugees find themselves firmly on the other side of the metaphorical door.
The reason often cited by the government for their closed-door policy towards refugees has always been that Singapore’s limited land and natural resources mean that Singapore is ill-equipped to accept refugees.
In 2014, a spokesman for the Ministry of Home Affairs said that, “As a small country with limited land, Singapore is not in a position to accept any persons seeking political asylum or refugee status, regardless of their ethnicity or place of origin.”
Indeed, Singapore’s significant lack of land space is not to be dismissed. According to National Development Minister Lawrence Wong, in order to fit future generations, Singapore has to “[go] upward, downward and seaward.” With limited land and resources, it may seem more plausible, and more responsible, that the government allocate these resources to areas such as housing, healthcare and education in order to ensure the long-term welfare of its citizens.
Another argument commonly put forth by government officials is that before we concern ourselves with international issues, Singapore should first look inward and address the numerous domestic challenges present.
While these may appear to be valid concerns, Singapore’s supposed inability to support an influx of refugees is directly contradicted by the Population White Paper published in 2019, which predicts a possible population trajectory of 5.8M to 6.0M by 2020 and 6.5M to 6.9M by 2030. The Paper states that Singapore will be “able to support the larger population while preserving a high quality living environment for all Singaporeans” by “reclaiming additional land, developing some of our reserve land, intensifying new developments, and recycling land with lower intensity uses such as old industrial areas and some golf courses to achieve higher land productivity.”
Through continual advancements in infrastructure and increases in physical landmass via land reclamation, Singapore has the ability to host an increasing population. Why then, does Singapore’s government remain so staunchly against offering refugees protection within our borders?
Perhaps the government’s resistance towards welcoming refugees can be traced back to Singapore’s unpleasant historical experience in the 1970s in assisting with the Vietnamese refugee crisis during the Vietnam War. Under the 1989 Comprehensive Plan of Action (CPA) for Indochinese refugees, Singapore was left disillusioned after being ‘burdened’ by rejected asylum-seekers, many of whom refused to return home voluntarily for years, and even engaged in hunger strikes or attempted suicide. Seeing as a guarantee of resettlement within 90 days was an underlying precondition for Singapore’s acceptance of refugees from the region, it is understandable that Singapore felt ‘betrayed’ by the experience — to the point of maintaining a policy of almost complete disengagement from the global refugee discourse after the incident.
A necessary question to ask, therefore, would be: for how long should Singapore remain hung up on the past?
Denying refugees entry into Singapore is to deny them of a chance to make a life for themselves. These individuals have a special need for protection that should afford them equal, if not priority, consideration. With lives hanging in the balance, there is a necessity for Singapore to reconsider its position in the lens of its current status as a globalised and developed city.
With ambitious projects to accommodate an increasing population already underway, Singapore should be capable of allowing at least some refugees in.
In light of the steady decline of Singapore’s birth rate in the past decade, as well as our growing aging population, Singapore has been accepting more immigrants in the hopes that they will settle down and start families in Singapore. As a country lacking in physical size and natural resources, Singapore’s most crucial resource has always been its people.
As a nation with the resources to support a larger population and a need for an influx of foreigners, we have no reason to turn refugees away from our borders. Rather than living in the past of Singapore’s unpleasant historical experience and restricting the entry of refugees and asylum-seekers, we should instead choose to adopt safeguards to avoid a similar outcome.
Much like immigrants, refugees can prove to be an important human resource. Singapore could give refugees conditional work permits and offer them long-term contracts, providing them with job opportunities while strengthening our workforce and encouraging globalism. Taking it a step further, Singapore could establish an asylum recognition system to adjudicate the claims of applicants, set up a clear repatriation process, and outline the rights of applicants whilst in the country, allowing us to offer refugees protection and job opportunities.
Singapore, like many other countries, is not exempt from responsibility-sharing in responding to the effects and consequences of global displacement as a part of the international community. Though we should not forget our past experiences with such issues, it is not justification enough to remain disengaged from social issues that are still very much relevant.
Let us instead learn from our historical experiences and not let it affect our present decision-making, and move towards being a more globalised nation.

"The Journey of Singapore’s Toilets, From Man Carrying Bucket To Man Pressing Button",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-singapore-toilets/,9-Apr-20,"Top image: A night-soil man in the past. Courtesy of National Archives of Singapore.
This account is a piece of creative non-fiction that tracks the development of Singapore’s toilets from the 1930s to the present day—from the days when our excrement had to be carried out of the house and dumped into processing tanks at treatment plants, all done manually by night-soil men, to the seamlessness and efficiency of today’s sanitisation system, in which a press of a button flushes our waste away automatically.
Our protagonist, Lim Heng Kiat, is a fictional character amalgamated from several different primary and secondary sources, such as newspaper reports, books like Report on the Sanitary Condition of Singapore by W.J. Simpson and The Singapore Water Story: Sustainable Development in an Urban City State by Cecilia Tortajda, Yugal Joshi, and Biswas Asit K, and an oral history recording of Lim Hong Cher, a coolie who started working as a night-soil man in 1956.
Even though Heng Kiat did not exist in real life, everything he experienced and all dates and numbers are based on fact and are footnoted or hyperlinked with the relevant source.
1930s – 1960s
Lim Heng Kiat is a coolie living in Chinatown, and he earns 75 cents a day carrying people’s excretions out of their homes.[1]
Every morning before the sun rises, he walks into their houses through their front doors, heads straight to their toilets—a room with a hole in the ground, and under the hole, a corroded tin pail that collects all their waste—and empties its contents into his waiting iron bucket.
Water is scarce. Clean water rarer. So Heng Kiat rinses the emptied pail with as little water as he can. Still, it’s enough water to create a river flecked by stray pieces of excrement that flows from the toilet through the house, all the way to the street drain.

With the bucket in one hand, he wades through the kitchen and living quarters, leaves the house, and loads the bucket onto a truck waiting outside.

The truck will then transport the buckets and buckets of waste to a cleaning depot, where night-soil men will dump the day’s collections into a central tank, which will pump it to a treatment facility such as Kim Chuan Sewage Treatment Works. Thereafter, the waste product will be mixed with sludge, and finally pumped to Serangoon Sludge Works for disposal.[2]
But Heng Kiat doesn’t bother himself with any of that. Right now, his only job is to carry human excretion out of homes and into the truck. So he braces himself, heads upstairs and, on each subsequent floor, repeats the process of emptying another family’s night-soil pail.
That’s one house done. Another 63 buckets of human waste to replace before a new truck, with storage space for more buckets, comes. Another eight hours till 2 PM, when his job ends.
It is dirty and back-breaking work: a full bucket weighs around 1 KG.[3] And the stench—the first time Heng Kiat caught a whiff of it, he ran to a drain and vomited immediately. But work is work. Heng Kiat grew to take pride in being efficient and not disturbing residents when he carries out his job. He recalls, with pleasures, the praise Madam Lim, who lives in Joo Chiat, showered on him: “You work so fast, I didn’t even know you came already!”[4]

Still, pride cannot feed him. Five years ago, Heng Kiat could sell the faeces he collected to farms and plantations that would use it to grow their rubber trees and pineapple plants.
Now, there are too many new immigrants to do that. Singapore is producing too much human waste; there is more faeces in this city than farms and plantations can use. The English health officers, growing wary at the prevalence of water-borne diseases like dysentery in Singapore, have also made it illegal to sell human faeces as manure.[5] So that’s one source of income dried up.
Over the years, Heng Kiat has seen the colonial government try to improve the situation in Singapore—which means putting people like him out of a job. They made it compulsory for people living within 30 metres of a sewerage system to install flush toilets, sinks, and so on.[6] For homes located too far from a sewerage system (which are still a lot, considering the state of sewerage presently), the Singapore Improvement Trust (SIT) built back lanes so night-soil men like himself would not have to wade through the place with buckets full of excretion.
Heng Kiat is angry at the state of things, of course. With the stricter rules on selling night-soil and the legislation on mandatory toilets, it’s become harder and harder to earn money as a night-soil man.

Heng Kiat’s friend, Kim Wah, is one of the lucky people who has managed to rent a new flat in Kampong Tiong Bahru, built by SIT in 1961. Taking Heng Kiat on a tour of her new house, she gushes, “Look, got bed, sitting room, and behind got kitchen and toilet. And the rent is $20 only.”

The affordability of rent astounds Heng Kiat, but, to him, the real marvel is the toilet. It is also a hole in the ground, but there is a pool of clear water in it, so clean that Heng Kiat thinks he can drink from it.
Even public toilets in Singapore’s working districts, like the one within the elegant rotunda at Clarke Quay, still operate on the night-soil-bucket basis.

“How to use?” Heng Kiat asks.
Kim Wah takes a square of toilet paper, throws it into the water, and pulls a metal chain. Immediately, a flood of water sweeps into the hole from all sides of the squat toilet. The toilet paper swirls as if in a whirlpool and is sucked into the hole, before a pool of fresh water reappears in the hole.
“So convenient, right? The flushing so easy to use, nobody teaches, but everyone just knows.”[7]
Heng Kiat is dumbstruck: at the magic of the mechanism, at the amount of clean water used to wash away waste, and at the terror that he will be out of a job very, very soon.
His fears are unfounded. Towards the end of the decade, the government decides to build and maintain six sewage treatment plants—located in Kim Chuan, Ulu Pandan, Bedok, Kranji, Seletar and Jurong—as part of its Sewerage Master Plan. But it is only a plan, not yet a description of the world Heng Kiat is living in—it would take a few decades before the comprehensive sewerage system Singapore has today comes to fruition.[8]
The reality of the situation is that, in the late 1960s, the main public sewerage network only serves 57% of the Singapore population, like Kim Wah.[9]
Therefore, even 15 years after the SIT flats in Tiong Bahru—complete with flushing toilets—are built, Heng Kiat is still working as a night-soil man.
1980s

The demographic of his customers, however, has changed. He used to serve families who lived in shophouses at Kreta Ayer; now, he mainly plies the Kallang Basin and Singapore River. There are still squatters living in these areas, and Heng Kiat feels grateful—but also guilty—that they have not progressed from the hole-in-the-ground, night-soil buckets for their defecation purposes.

Competition with other night-soil men is stiff because of the rapidly improving sanitation system in Singapore, but there are enough squatters still defecating into buckets for him to make a living. Heng Kiat estimates that there are around 10,000 night-soil toilets left in Singapore, which serve the 40,000 squatters in the Kallang area, and 4,000 around the Singapore River.[10]
He estimates that he can continue working as a night-soil man for another decade or so.
1990s

It is 1992, and Heng Kiat has retired. Which is just as well, because the night-soil man is now extinct in Singapore: the last night-soil disposal station at Lorong Halus was closed five years ago, in 1987.[12]
Even though he saw the changes of the past 60 years with his own eyes, Heng Kiat almost cannot believe them.
Under the directive of Singapore’s first prime minister, the Kallang Basin and Singapore River—previously the heart of his livelihood as a night-soil man—transformed into sparkling oases of clean water as a result of ten years of clean-up, completed in 1987.
Likewise, the buckets that once collected waste have been replaced by toilets with water as clean as our drinking water. Thanks to the concerted efforts of then-Public Utilities Board (now known as PUB, Singapore’s National Water Agency) in ensuring a constant supply of clean water, building a functioning sewerage plan, and researching methods to treat waste water, by 1997, all of Singapore is served by a modern sanitation system.[13]
If someone had told him in 1930s that this—an automated system where waste automatically disappears and gets transported to a central processing plant at the press of a button, without any need of human intervention at all—would be what defecating would be like in the future, Heng Kiat would have laughed his head off. Singapore? Where opium is more readily available than clean water? Where the rivers running through its land is made not of water, but of a combination of sludge, waste, and animal carcasses bobbing about?
Today, he laughs in gratitude, and amazement, when he sees clean water flushing away his excrements. But his sense of mild outrage is assuaged as he remembers his daughter telling him that her flat—a new HDB apartment built at the beginning of the year—employs a low capacity flushing cistern, which reduces each flush of 9 litres by half.[14] He is reassured that Singaporeans are not taking all this clean water for granted.
Indeed, in the next 20 years, till the present day, Singapore will continue to ensure they use less water for sanitation. For instance, old toilets like Heng Kiat’s—which still use 9 litres per flush—will be replaced for free by PUB with more efficient ones, saving him up to 10% of his monthly water bill. The nation is also closing the water loop by recycling water so that whatever scarce water we have is not wasted.
Wastewater will be transported and handled by an underground superhighway system, called Deep Tunnel Sewerage System (DTSS), located up to 30 metres underneath Singapore—deeper than all but two MRT stations in Singapore. Water that once went down the sanitation pipes will emerge sparkling clean from our taps as NEWater.

Had Heng Kiat, and the other night-soil men who kept Singapore’s toilets functioning, lived to see these changes, they might have laughed at the sheer incredulity of the situation, at how rapidly PUB has managed to revamp Singapore’s sanitation system within a few decades, despite this island’s thirst for clean water.
Where they once had to carry a 1kg bucket of waste on each shoulder, the excretion is now funnelled by gravity to a water reclamation plant under Singapore.
Where excretion and wastewater was once sold to farmers to use as fertilisers, it is now transmuted to potable water, almost miraculously.
The night-soil men would have thought, water, like life, is an endless, unbroken cycle. But only if used well.

Why It Sucks to Be An Expat In Singapore Right Now,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-why-it-sucks-to-be-an-expat-in-singapore-right-now/,2-Oct-20,"Photography by Marisse Caine.
After 13 years in Singapore, 22-year-old Callum Dunne was forced to leave in May. He lost his job, his visa expired and he couldn’t find new employment, leaving him with no option but to return to the UK.
“My entire life is in Singapore,” he said. “My family, my friends, my colleagues. It’s hard to be given a couple weeks to pack up your life and go.”
Callum has built a strong support system of friends here. They took care of him and his family during these difficult times, and he said they were the most “difficult to say goodbye to”.
“I broke my own rule of ‘it’s never goodbye, it’s a see you soon,’ because I really didn’t know when i’ll see them again.”
Many expats have found themselves in Callum’s position. In the first 5 months of this year alone, 60,000 foreigners lost their jobs in Singapore. Foreign employment fell by 5.7% in the first half of 2020, compared to 2.7% in the local workforce. And for the first time since 2003, Singapore has seen a shrink in the population, largely due to non-citizens leaving because of the rising barriers put in place for hiring foreigners.
Scrolling through expat groups on Facebook is a good indicator of the exodus. Dozens of users post daily about moving away, selling furniture, and asking for travel advice.
The majority of expats I spoke to that lost their jobs have built roots in this country, and therefore hope to return soon. But new job opportunities are difficult to come by—foreigner quota restrictions have tightened and minimum salary requirements have increased.
Callum doesn’t blame the government for these regulations that put Singaporeans first. “Many Singaporeans lost their jobs, and they need them back,” he said. “And many of us wouldn’t have jobs if Singaporeans didn’t have theirs.”

After years in this country, Callum has come to terms with the fact that being a foreigner in Singapore comes with the burden of always having to be prepared to leave. While many assume that expats get visas easily, it is actually the opposite.
He first moved here when he was only 6, after his parents got jobs in Singapore. After his PR was rejected, he switched between a Working Holiday Visa, Dependents Pass, and most recently, an S-Pass.
“Even getting that S-Pass was so hard,” he said. “I worked as a football coach for about a year and a half. They didn’t have the quota to keep me so I lost that job. Then a bar in Boat Quay wanted to hire me but they also didn’t have a quota for foreigners. I finally found a job which could sponsor me in December last year, but I lost it because of the pandemic.”
After spending some of the most significant years of his life in Singapore, Callum hopes Singapore will eventually welcome foreigners again so he can return.
“Foreigners are essential in any country, they help with building cultural awareness,” he said, “From essential work to tourism, foreigners are involved in every aspect of Singapore. They help the country grow and thrive day to day.”
“Whilst there are some negative stigmas about foreigners, none of the companies I have worked in would be at the same level without the diverse workforce they have had behind them.”
When Australian Kym Grieve decided to leave Australia and follow her partner to Singapore in late 2019, she was forced to give up her career as a successful executive. But she tells me she didn’t plan to be a “trailing spouse for long.”
“I was going to be the ‘support crew’ while we got settled in 2019. My plan was to get a job in 2020 … yeah right.”
Kym has lived in Singapore before, so she is familiar with the obstacles foreigners face when seeking employment. But the hostility towards non-Singaporeans has definitely grown.
In 2011, Kym moved to Singapore to open a retail mobile tech startup with her now ex-husband. The company went on to open in 5 countries across Asia, and by 2016 it worked with approximately 4000 stores and 1500 retail brands.
When I asked Kym why they chose Singapore as the building ground for the company, she said that “Singapore was a very forward thinking place for tech startup development”.
At the time, the government attracted startups to Singapore with grant opportunities. In turn, these companies would create opportunities for Singaporeans and make the local market more competitive.
Beyond the business itself, foreigners like Kym brought a diversity of perspectives and management styles that come from international experience—an attribute many Singaporeans lack.
In 2013, the then-managing director of Microsoft Singapore Helene Auriol said that “MNCs need to connect with the rest of the world … and it’s very challenging to find strong (Singaporean) leaders with a real international background.”
Speaking at the same human resources conference as Auriol, the then Canon Singapore president and chief executive officer Kensaku Konishi said that Singaporeans find it hard to adapt to new environments: “They just complain that it’s different from Singapore.”
If it weren’t for expats coming to fill certain international market knowledge gaps, the urgency for Singaporeans to travel abroad would be much higher.
“The industry in Singapore thrives because expats are ready to work here,” explained Rohan Raichand*, a 28-year-old who recently moved to Singapore for a consulting job. “If they didn’t, locals would need to go overseas for such jobs, leading to brain drain. That would also have a negative impact on the economy.”
Rohan was managing a team in Singapore, and he trained them to apply many of the skills he acquired abroad. Now that he has lost his job, he plans to return to Australia where he was living before.
“Singapore is a place built for a lot of foreign companies to thrive,” he added. “As expats we not only bring talent, but we bring in a good business into the country from where we were before.”
Beyond a personal level, international companies as a whole also contribute to the local economy.
Around the time that Kym opened the startup in Singapore, many MNCs were also expanding their presence in the region, using Singapore as a hub.
Diageo, Kellogg, Nestle, and Unilever among many others made similar moves into Singapore. On top of creating employment opportunities for Singaporeans, many local companies who worked with the international MNCs saw their incomes grow.
Singapore remains a competitive place for international talent, but I don’t know if Kym would feel comfortable opening a company in Singapore (as a foreigner) today.
“What is really messing with my mind right now is not only losing my identity as a successful executive in my own right, but having to actively ignore the anti-foreigner comments online on job opportunities, EPs and so on,” she said.
“These are so misaligned with what the real world looks like now. It seems that a lot of Singaporeans seem to think the expat world still looks like the 1990s ….. it’s not like that anymore.”
Kym is referring to the ‘expat contracts’ that were a norm in Singapore during the 90s and 2000s. These came with privileges such as a school and housing allowance, travel tickets home, a car, and so on. While these packages are rare to find today, the perception of expats among local Singaporeans remains that they come to the country on high payrolls, with the intention to leave after a few years. But research shows that more expats live in Singapore with fewer benefits now, often without employment guarantees from MNCs, and with a much longer-term intent to stay than ever before.
The integration of foreigners has increasingly improved over the years, but expats who have moved to Singapore in recent months have found it especially hard to do so.
28-year-old UX Designer Kate Sotnychenko moved to Singapore from Ukraine with her husband in 2019. She was retrenched in June, leaving her isolated from the rest of the country.
“Every day I wake up and I apply for new jobs. I send my CV to 10 or 15 companies per day. Some reply, most don’t. The majority of job advertisements say ‘Singaporeans and PRs only.’”
Finding a job in this climate has not been possible for Kate, but that hasn’t stopped her from trying to find her place in the community. Kate started volunteering at Project Luni, an organisation that helps street cats in Singapore.
Kate is also trying to get involved with other volunteering opportunities, but she was shocked to find out that some organisations don’t allow foreigners to participate.“Yesterday I tried to sign up for a beach clean-up volunteering opportunity,” she recalled. “But they said that only Singaporeans and PRs can clean the beaches. I was shocked. Why? If I want to help?”
Kate Sotnychenko.
“It’s very sad. We’re also a part of this country like everyone else. It’s a multicultural city. I want to work, I want to help and I want to be a part of the community. But they refuse me that, even if I’m doing everything I can.”
“I support the government’s decision to help locals, but I hope that in doing so they don’t forget about others who have made this place their home.”
“What the minister said about foreigners really saddened me,” Kate gushed, referring to when Vivian Balakrishnan said that “the only reason we have foreigners here is to give an extra wind in our sails when the opportunity is there.”
“Now we are in a storm, and we need to shed ballast.”
Earlier in June, The Sunday Times published a survey on people’s perceptions of essential jobs during the pandemic, which ranked artists as the number one least essential job.
“The government literally said we don’t care about foreigners right now,” she says, “And then the people said they don’t care about artists, so I felt like I don’t belong here … like I’ll always be a stranger.”
“I can’t even clean the beach because I’m not Singaporean.”
“I support the government’s decision to help locals in this time, but I hope that in doing so they don’t forget about expats who have made this place their home.”
While there is nothing wrong with scrutinising immigration policies—especially during a recession—what many foreigners in Singapore have experienced is an overwhelming sense of xenophobia. And the issue with the way these xenophobic sentiments present themselves online is that they turn a complex issue of immigration and people’s livelihoods, into a matter of numbers: How many foreigners are in a company, how many of the local executives are really PRs and not ‘true locals,’ how many of the foreigners come from a specific country and so on.
In the past months, the financial sector’s hiring practices have been placed under scrutiny for not training enough locals in executive positions. In light of this, various banks have come out and said they “keep a local core” in their workforce. In turn, netizens have pushed back by saying that PRs aren’t real Singaporeans.
This kind of discourse reduces people to the colour of their ICs. If yours is pink then you are 100% local and deserving of your job. If you are a PR, you need to prove your ‘localness’—and if you don’t have either of those, then you may as well pack your bags and leave.
People’s experiences cannot be divided so crudely. Many of my ‘foreigner’ friends who grew up here went to local schools and local universities. They maneuver Singapore better than many Singaporeans and have made immense contributions to the local culture and art scenes—yet their PR applications still get rejected. Online, they are reduced to ‘foreigners’ who come to ‘steal jobs from locals,’ because numbers don’t account for their lived experiences.
But beyond the visa status of a person, we need to ask ourselves why they are employed in the positions they are in. What competitive advantages do they bring to the company? Are they bringing with them a certain level of experience from a different market that is hard to come by locally?
And when a foreigner is employed, are they really stealing a job from a local?
Many foreigners who come to Singapore directly employ and create opportunities for Singaporeans. This can be in the form of direct employment, or by working with local companies and expanding their competitive edge, and in turn profit margin.
Others have made this place a home, so being kicked out of the country literally equates to them losing their identity. In a way, they are a local, so their visa status almost puts them in a more precarious position that any Singaporean could fathom.
If we shut the doors to the outside world, we limit the way in which we can diversify our society. Whether it’s a tech entrepreneur or digital artist, there’s a contribution anyone can make to the community—if only we let them.
As Minister Grace Fu said: “In the worst of times, it is easy to blame someone who is different from ourselves, when it is due to race, religion or nationality. What we must realise is that viruses do not discriminate, people do.”

140 Years of Remedies: The Untold Story of How TCM Got The Back of Singapore’s Early Immigrants,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-history-tcm-singapore-early-immigrant-eu-yan-sang/,23-Sep-20,"Top image: Dan Wong / A Good Citizen.
In 1900s Singapore, it was not uncommon to see people drop dead on the streets.
At that time, there were no laws governing workplace health and safety. Labourers and coolies—many of them immigrants seeking a better life in Singapore—would thus work as hard and as long as possible in harsh environments. Sometimes, they worked harder and longer than they could. With no one preventing them from doing so, working to death was a frequent, and expected, end.

For instance, the typical workday of a rickshaw man in pre-independence Singapore involved ferrying two adults under 35°C heat for hours. The job’s extreme physical demands, carried out under the oppressive sun, were enough to make a puller collapse out of heat exhaustion and cardiovascular strain, and die without warning.
The historian James Francis Warren describes one—out of many others—such episode:
Kwan Moh Kia, a seemingly strong, well-fed Hockchia, had passed by a Tamil house on Bukit Timah Road going towards Kranji pulling two Macao women as fares. When he was just beyond the house, Kwan Moh Kia dropped down between the shafts, on that March afternoon in 1906, when his aorta exploded like a roadworn tyre. Taju, a Tamil woman, said he never rose up again.
As if their working environments weren’t severe enough, the homes of these early immigrant labourers were just as fatal to their health. According to a 1906 housing survey, a single shophouse in Chinatown could house up to 45 people; each occupant of the shophouse squeezed their life into a tiny cubicle. Sometimes, their “room” was just a space along the common corridor, separated from others by a row of hanging clothes.
The bomb shelters in today’s BTOs would seem cavernous to these residents.
Thus, even if they were lucky enough to survive their workday, Singapore’s early immigrants still had to return to an overcrowded home that lacked ventilation and a plumbing system, factors which encouraged the spread of diseases like cholera, malaria, and tuberculosis.
Under such conditions, anyone who celebrated their 60th birthday was considered long-lived.
Without skills or education, these coolies and labourers could not find a job more conducive to staying alive. Nor could they, on their meagre pay, move to any accommodations that did not want to murder them.
Worst of all, they could not seek medical help from hospitals. Money was an obstacle, of course, but the main reason is that medical care in 1800s Singapore was highly segregated. According to the book Caring For Our People: 50 Years of Healthcare in Singapore, the General Hospital was “the preserve of European soldiers, sepoys (Indian soldiers) and the colonial government”, while government officials and Europeans had the privilege of private house visits from hospital surgeons.

The immigrant labour force of early Singapore turned to the only solution available to them—opium.
For these early immigrants, opium was not only a recreational drug but also an important medication. Because of its powerful pain-killing effects, opium was the drug of choice for coolies who regularly injured themselves while working and had to live with chronic pain.
In fact, opium was held in such high esteem by the 19th-century medical establishment that doctors worldwide prescribed it for conditions from cholera to bronchitis. Following their lead, Chinese sinsehs in the early 1900s would recommend opium as a treatment for illnesses that ravaged the immigrant communities in Singapore: tuberculosis, malaria, and venereal disease.
As a result, opium consumption in Singapore became widespread. The 1908 Opium Commission stated that 40% of coal coolies and rickshaw pullers smoked opium. But the Commission only surveyed people who “were visibly affected by the ‘disease’”, that is, opium smokers who were addicted to the drug as a form of recreation.
If we take into account non-addicts and patients who used opium as medication, Warren estimates that the proportion of opium users among rickshaw pullers, for instance, could reach up to 80%.

At that time, the discovery of alluvial tin in the northern Malaya state of Perak sparked a mining frenzy. Taking advantage of the demand for tin miners, an influx of labourers swelled into the state. Opium, too, became their drug of choice to remedy body aches and illnesses brought about by hard labour and harsh living conditions.
All this was observed by Eu Kong, who, in 1878, worked in a grocery store in Singapore. Trusted by his employer, he was tasked to travel between Penang and Singapore for business.

Eventually, the constant sight of tin miners, rickshaw pullers, and plantation workers succumbing to opium addiction moved Eu Kong so much that, in 1879, he decided to set up a provision shop that sold Chinese remedies to the labourers.
Eu Kong hoped that the shop would encourage labourers to use traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) instead of opium to treat their ailments; the shop was named “Yan Sang”, and was the precursor of today’s Eu Yan Sang.
Indeed, during the 19th century, TCM institutions, medical halls, and clan centres started to be established by rich Chinese merchants all across the Straits Settlements (namely, Singapore, Malacca, Penang, and Dinding [now part of Perak]) to help poor immigrants. Eventually, these TCM institutions grew so numerous that they formed the backbone of each country’s healthcare system.
Image credit: Dan Wong / A Good Citizen.
In Singapore, one of the first TCM clinics is Thong Chai Yee Sey (known today as Thong Chai Medical Institution), which was founded in 1867. A research paper on the history of TCM in Singapore describes it as a charitable organisation that “engaged Chinese physicians who provided free consultations … [to] the sick and poor”.
After the consultation, patients would receive a prescription for medicine which they could obtain at TCM medical halls (medical consultations and dispensations were separate at that time). These medical halls were essentially some of the first stand-alone pharmacies to be set up in Singapore, and were located near the homes of immigrants. For example, Eu Yan Sang’s first shop was at South Bridge Road, just a street away from the shophouses at Sago Lane.

These medical halls were not just dispensaries. The staff there also gave advice on how best to prepare and consume the medicinal herbs. As Daniel Foo Say Liang, author of “A Short History of a Long Tradition: The Resilience of Chinese medicine in Singapore”, remarks, “The importance of such medical halls should not be ignored given their role in maintaining the health of the workers who contributed to the economic growth in colonial Singapore.”
Among the most commonly prescribed medicine at that time were Axe Oil, Tiger Balm, and Ning Sun pills. All of them helped to combat symptoms of overworking. (No surprise why these treatments remain popular today.)
Even if patients could not afford to pay for consultations and medication at other clinics or pharmacies (which may charge a nominal sum), they could rely on their fellow clansmen in Singapore. Coolies and immigrants would chip in what little savings they had to help cover the expenses of any member who was sick, even if they were not related. For a rickshaw man who earns an average of $20 a month—of which three-quarters went to food (just rice and vegetables) and rent— this was an immensely generous gesture.
For instance, Warren describes how Tan Moey Teng, a rickshaw puller, “gave 10 cents daily to an elderly clansman, Tan Eng Song, to help him over the toil of the last years”; when Lee Tien, who “had no kindred in Singapore”, fell ill, his clansmen “gave him medicine regularly and arranged his funeral … when he died”.
As more women emigrated from China, more families started to be established in Singapore. The increasing number of births meant that infant-related ailments were a growing concern in the early 1900s. Prenatal and natal care were still in their infancy then, so TCM stepped up to the role of providing medical aid to expecting parents and their babies.
Two TCM formulations, in particular, stand out: Bak Foong pills—which comprised Chinese ginseng, deer antlers, black-bone chicken, and other herbs—are known to combat fatigue, anaemia, menstrual pain; and Bo Ying Compound, which contains pearl and amber, and helps to reduce phlegm in infants.
Through loneliness and hardship, the early Chinese immigrants of Singapore developed bonds that kept each other, and a millennia-old tradition of medicine, alive on a tiny island far away from their hometowns in China.

In post-independence Singapore, many expected the popularity of TCM to wane. By then, Singapore’s medical infrastructure was rapidly being modernised. Alongside, the government launched many health campaigns, like the Dental Health Campaign and the National Health Week, to educate the general public.
TCM, in contrast to these developments, seemed like an outdated, mom-and-pop small enterprise resistant to innovation and progress. Such a perception would not be wrong, honestly speaking. TCM formulation at that time was limited to raw or ground herbs and liquid concoctions. These preparations faced issues with consistency, safety, convenience, and precision in dosage control—things which the public, exposed to Western medication, expected from any medicine.
Yet, even today, Singaporeans are relying on TCM to alleviate their troubles. According to David Tang, Chairman of Singapore Traditional Chinese Medicine Organisations Committee, “about 76 per cent of the population has used complementary alternative medicine”, a number corroborated by the scientific paper “Complementary and alternative medicine use in multiracial Singapore”.
How did TCM continue to remain relevant at a time when many were predicting its demise?
Simply put: the TCM industry read the prevailing winds and modernised TCM to meet the evolving demands of the population.
One modern breakthrough is the technology of granulating TCM products. By turning traditional herbs into granules, TCM is not only more palatable to the modern consumer, it is also safer, more shelf-stable, and portable.
TCM education in Singapore is also at the forefront of the field. For example, formalised TCM education began in 1953 with the establishment of Singapore College of Traditional Medicine, years before any such curriculum was designed in China. Today, universities like Nanyang Technological University offer a double degree programme in Biomedical Sciences and TCM.

In 2009, Eu Yan Sang established Singapore’s first TCM laboratory with Nanyang Polytechnic. Some results of the partnership are Zerotox, a novel process that extracts impurities—that can cause herb-drug interactions with common Western drugs—from herbal products, and CholesFree, a capsule supplement that helps to maintain healthy cholesterol levels.
Additional TCM products that Eu Yan Sang has developed include: ginseng tea bags (which reduce hours of brewing to minutes of steeping); convenient pre-packed TCM soup formula; and bottled bird’s nest of a higher quality and free from stabilisers (adding stabiliser, a practice common among most bird’s nest brands, gives the impression of a higher content of bird’s nest in the bottle). All these products were introduced back in the 1990s, before most TCM companies thought to modernise their products.
Eu Yan Sang has also partnered other organisations, such as NUS School of Medicine and Parkway Cancer Centre, to publish two scientific papers that explain the interactions between TCM and commonly used western medicine.
These innovations encapsulate Eu Yan Sang’s focus on catering to the needs of the Singaporeans: a demand for scientifically proven safety and efficacy, comparable to that of Western medicine, in the preparation of TCM, and treating the conditions endemic to Singapore’s fast-paced society and aging population.
The fact that TCM is increasingly being embraced by people who live in a country that boasts the world’s most acclaimed healthcare system and the longest life expectancy at 84.8 years speaks of the important role it plays in society. TCM, to many, is not just a form of medicine that maintains health or improves quality of life, but a part of culture, history, and kinship.
Indeed, neither we nor Singapore might be here today if not for the role TCM played in Singapore’s colonial days, when medical care was scarce, and jobs could literally kill you.

The Art of Keeping On: 3 Singaporeans Tell Us What They Learned From Life’s Twists and Turns",Yeo Boon Ping,FALSE,TRUE
Should Singapore Let Foreign Investors Buy Permanent Residency?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-singapore-foreign-investors-buy-permanent-residency-global-investor-programme/,26-Jun-20,"Singapore is currently debating our migrant worker policy, but the other end of migration—investment migration by High Net Worth (HNW) individuals, has received far less scrutiny. Most might not even be familiar with what “investment migration” means, or aware that Singapore has investment migration programs at all.
Simply put, investment migration programs are programs where HNW individuals can acquire expedited access to citizenship or permanent residency via government-approved investment programs. Citizenship-by-investment and Residency-by-investment programs are not unique to Singapore: many other countries such as the United States, Germany, and perhaps most infamously, Malta, also have investment migration programs.
In fact, it is worth pointing out that Singapore does not have a citizenship-by-investment program—only residency-by-investment under the Global Investor Program (GIP). Under this program run by the Economic Development Board (EDB), eligible investors can acquire expedited residency.
Since the 1970s, Singapore has offered routes to permanent residency for investors. GIP is merely the latest offering in a long line of similar, but retired programs. Prior to GIP, Singapore also had the Financial Investor Scheme (2004-2012), which was retired amid criticism of the influx of wealthy immigrants and its impact on asset prices, according to sources from the Monetary Authority of Singapore.

Like most other industries, investment migration is highly competitive, and Singapore is competing with many other city-states for an extremely small group of ultra-HNW individuals.
Still, Dominic Volek of Henley & Partners, a leading investment migration consultancy, says that although the GIP is very complex and has many restrictions, it remains an attractive destination, particularly amidst Covid-19. According to Dominic, ultra-HNW individuals are now more concerned about countries’ healthcare systems, assessing investment migration decisions based on countries’ pandemic preparedness and management.
In this aspect, Singapore and New Zealand are held in high regard, in contrast to other countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom.
There are also push factors to consider: Brexit has led wealthy Britonians to consider alternative residencies, and closer to home, the Hong Kong protests have led to a marked uptick in enquiries. To meet expected demand, Henley & Partners, like other investment migration consultancies, has been working very closely with private banks such as DBS and Bank of Singapore, all of whom are gearing up their family office capabilities.
Dominic estimates that the GIP has attracted about 1,800 total applicants since its inception. Applicants have three options: they can either invest 2.5 million SGD into new businesses, park money into GIP-approved venture capital funds, or establish a Singapore family office. Those who meet the criteria are issued a Permanent Residency and re-entry permit at the end of five years only if they meet business milestones. They also need to spend at least half their time in Singapore to meet the 5 year renewal. If they cannot afford to spend so much time in Singapore, they can renew their entry for three years.

The term “investment migration” is a bit misleading, because most of the time, investors are not actually physically migrating. Investment migration programs function more like an “insurance policy”, where HNW individuals use investment migration programs as a way to hedge against political or economic uncertainty.
Said Dominic, “wealthy people like to have options—a second residency or alternative citizenship in multiple jurisdictions give them that. Sometimes, it’s seen as a luxury product—similar to the way the rich have multiple sports cars, houses, and so forth, HNW individuals like to own a portfolio of citizenships and residencies.”
But there are also pragmatic benefits to this, notably, the ability to circumvent travel restrictions. Every year, Henley & Partners releases a Passport Index that ranks global passports based on how “powerful” they are, according to the number of destinations their holders can access without a prior visa. Singapore consistently tops this ranking. Since most of his clients are international investors or entrepreneurs, they travel frequently to surrounding regions and emerging markets, and value the convenience that a Singaporean passport affords them.
Dominic said that Singapore’s program is considered the ideal standard of what residency-by-investment programs “should” look like. He praised the government for “always doing their homework and covering all their angles”, citing the recently revised minimum income threshold from $50 million to $200 million in March this year as an example of a “conscious decision” to ensure the government is attracting the “right applicants”.

He added that Singapore’s program is designed to attract investors who genuinely want to move to Singapore and raise families here. This is in contrast to most other investment migration programs, which have little to no physical residence requirements. Singapore, on the other hands, “wants investors to come not just to invest, but to consume, pay taxes, and hire locals.”
Notably, Singapore does not allow dual citizenship, so prospective investors who wish to acquire citizenship via the residency pathway would have to renounce original citizenship. Like other new citizens, their sons would have to go through National Service, or risk revocation.
I was more interested to find out: how did Dominic feel about the commodification of citizenship, particularly as the managing partner of a firm that profited from trading passports?
Dominic nodded quickly, with the practised tiredness of someone who has answered similar questions from other overzealous journalists.
“Good question. You know, we think it’s very old-fashioned, this idea of citizenship, which is based on arbitrary determinants, like where you happen to be born. We believe that as long as you are very skilled—successful, work hard, financially independent—you should be allowed to become a new citizen anywhere in the world.”
This glamorous depiction of investment migration as an enabler of global cosmopolitan citizenship deserves greater scrutiny. Notably, it is worth asking who is allowed access to this utopic, post-borders vision of the world that is supposedly colour-blind and egalitarian (read: a multi-multi-millionaire).
Dominic believes that “there is not enough done by the industry to tell their stories”, pinning criticism of such programs to “misguided negativity”.

He added that investment migration programs have been wildly successful for small islands, such as those in the Caribbean, and creates much social value for host countries. He noted that while several islands have been severely damaged by hurricanes, profits from investment migration programs have been used to create hurricane relief funds, rebuilding islands’ infrastructure, starting clinics, and so forth. In the process, it creates knock-on effects, such as by creating jobs for locals. These islands today have big budget surpluses and one of the lowest unemployment rates in history, says Dominic.
Whether these programs are equally beneficial to Singapore deserves wider scrutiny. After all, as Dominic observed, Singapore’s needs are very different from say, the Cayman Islands. It is worth asking if such programs actually have a net positive economic impact on our country.
When interviewed, NMP Prof. Walter Theseira, former expressed some concern about potential factor price distortions related to the effects of HNW residency in Singapore, notably, purchases of high-end property and related consumption and investment activities.
“In essence, it’s a decision to deliberately increase wealth and income inequality in Singapore, with the belief that as long as the source of the increase is ‘external’ and not caused by, say, a highly unequal structure of opportunities in Singapore, then it should have only positive effects.”
Lily Banse, via Unsplash
He added, “The problem for me is whether these programmes actually achieve their intended effect of benefiting the local population. There is also a secondary question of whether these programmes, on a global basis, are inefficient because they encourage corporates and HNW to abscond from their social obligations to pay fair rates of tax in the communities where they generate their wealth (which almost certainly isn’t Singapore).
“I am afraid that the extreme reluctance of the government to publish data on these programmes—not a flaw confined to the Singapore government, since these programmes are typically shrouded in secrecy worldwide—makes it really difficult to answer this question.”
(I had emailed a representative from Contact Singapore (EDB), asking if they could walk me through the policy intent behind revising the investment thresholds for GIP earlier in March, and if they could provide data, as well as an assessment, of how well GIP has met its stated goals. I did not receive a response.)
Beyond an economic standpoint, the commodification of citizenship also raises interesting questions on the meaning of citizenship itself. What does it mean to be a citizen, if/when citizenship can be acquired on the market for a fixed price?
Singapore, as a young nation-state, grapples with this question in a unique way I suspect most other countries don’t tussle with. In the post-war years, we had our fair share of existential angst and identity crises. Like most teenagers, we have since grown up to become a little surer of ourselves, but these anxieties remain. We have our national emblems: the Singapore flag, the pledge, the national anthem. But what does it mean to be Singaporean today?
Goh Rhy Yan, via Unsplash
Citizenship, of course, is only one aspect. One does not need to be a formal citizen to identify as Singaporean; similarly, being conferred formal Singaporean citizenship does not mean we identify as Singaporean. What investment migration programs do, in my opinion, is blur the boundaries between top-down, bureaucratically imposed definitions of citizenship, and more informal and loose self-recognition of what it means to be a citizen.
Prof. Theseira compared Singaporean citizenship to the United States, arguing that “as a society, we still lack a widely accepted values-driven theory of what it means to become Singaporean.” Whereas Americans broadly identify with “American values” (a strange and sometimes confusing mix of freedom, economic opportunity, and individualism), what being “Singaporean” means today is still relatively murky.
Unlike other countries such as Japan or South Korea, we are also not ethnically homogenous, and cannot draw upon ethnic values, cultures, and descent to build a “national brand”.
Ethan Hu, via Unsplash
In this context, Prof. Theseira explained that “the commodification of residency, and the prioritisation of economic contributions in residency decisions more generally, probably don’t help in the development of a values-driven immigrant Singaporean society.”
Or perhaps, what it means to be Singaporean is precisely that: this heady embrace of neoliberalism on steroids that means our national character is equally amorphous and chameleon-like, constantly adapting to fit the needs of global capital flows, in order to keep Singapore economically competitive.
Citizenship-by-investment (or its close cousin, residency-by-investment) has further implications on our democracy, particularly when the meaning of citizenship is so intricately tied to the right to vote and participate in a kind of imagined community.
Said Prof. Theseira, “In a democratic society where everyone has a stake in deciding who belongs, I think wealth and ability-based immigration programmes do raise important questions about how we define belonging. The principle that persons who wish to join a community must have something to contribute for the welfare of that community is not exceptional or inhumane—very few societies would accept completely open immigration or unlimited refugees, after all. But the way in which the concept of contributing is defined matters.”
“What you have highlighted is the creation of a system where economic contributing, in the form of one-off or limited economic transactions, acquires the same or often even greater value than contributing socially or economically over the long term. It’s a system where a migrant worker who helps to build up their employer’s business over a decade or a domestic worker who takes care of a generation of Singaporeans acquires less currency towards residency than someone who buys a condo and has some investable assets.”
MBS Hotel, Victor Garica via Unsplash
These clear discrepancies on who is allowed to become a citizen can seem grossly unfair when the stories of an elite investor and low-waged migrant worker are juxtaposed against each other.
Instead of skirting around the issue, some have addressed it head-on by pointing out the elephant in the room.
In a Facebook post on 30 May, former NMP Calvin Cheng wrote, “Is our immigration policy discriminatory? Yes. No need to tip-toe around it. At the top of the pyramid, we give priority to very wealthy people who can afford to invest 2.5m SGD. This is the Global Investment Programme. If they qualify, after they invest, PR is granted in less than 6 months and citizenship as fast as 2 years. The next in line are white-collar employment pass holders, typically graduates… If one is a blue-collar worker, things move far more slowly… And if one is a work permit holder, including domestic workers, it is impossible. We also do not accept refugees. This is our immigration policy which is elitist, ruthlessly hard-nosed, and pragmatic. I make no apologies for it.”
Mr Cheng’s spirited defence of our existing immigration model is worth unpacking in a separate article, but in brief, it is an unabashed celebration of neoliberal principles that ensure Singapore attracts only the top talent, and where rights are tiered according to how economically productive a person is.
At the very least, it points to how migrant worker policy is merely one part of a broader immigration policy that spans many interrelated, but separate, policy questions. Instead of thinking about immigration reform in parts, perhaps we should be thinking about it as an interconnected whole—for migrant worker policy and investment migration represent two ends of a spectrum, but are fundamentally informed by the same principles of neoliberal governance.
As Singapore debates our migrant worker policy, perhaps it is also time to review our immigration policy altogether, and ask if our current system serves our needs and interests (and indeed, interrogate what those needs are, and whose needs we should serve and prioritise, to what ends).
And if national debates thus far are anything to go by, we should know that there are no easy answers, only hard choices.

Forget what your English teacher told you. In 2019, a ‘mood’ isn’t an adjective or a state of mind.
It almost certainly isn’t a single word, but it could also be as many as you can fit into a tweet. It could be an image or a GIF. It’s social media slang, which is to say it could be anything; it could be everything. Some might even say it means nothing.
For example: as I write this, I’m hungry, cranky, and stressed out, but I am also Meryl Streep’s scream in Big Little Lies, a glass of wine on the beach, an obese Golden Retriever, a yawning hippo, Detective Pikachu drinking tea, Elmo shrugging, pink hair, a guy giving the finger, the weather, and a cat in a watermelon.
All of these are moods. Some are even big moods or mood AF, depending on how intensely you’re feeling it.
The term is so liberally applied that while browsing Twitter in the name of research, I came across everything from porn to puppies. When I checked a minute ago, #mood had clocked over 77 million uses on Instagram—not including instances where the term is used without the hashtag.
Madness? Of course, but there’s at least some method to it.
Broadly speaking, mood, as currently employed in social media parlance, is used in three main ways. There’s the literal sense, as in I’m feeling this way, and as an expression of want, as in I’m in the mood for this.
Most frequently, it’s used as an expression of like-mindedness or sympathy. Say you’re scrolling through Twitter on Monday morning and see that your friend has posted a photo of Spongebob being buried alive. You get it immediately. Mood AF, right there.
With Internet culture moving at the pace it does—new memes emerge virtually every week, if not every day—it’s hard to pinpoint when mood and its siblings, the reaction GIF and memes like TFW (‘that feeling when’), first made an appearance. The Daily Dot suggests this was around 2015, but the origin story of mood goes much further back.
To understand how we got here, with one innocuous word becoming shorthand for everything, we need to take a quick look at the history of feelings on the Internet.
Once upon a time, there was a site called LiveJournal.
If you, like me, grew up with the Internet through the 90s and early 2000s, this early blogging-slash-social-networking platform should ring some bells. For non-users, one of LiveJournal’s USPs, unlike competitor sites like Blogspot, was its ‘mood’ function. This allowed users to choose from a fairly comprehensive drop-down menu of moods—accompanied by matching icon—when making posts. There were moods from ‘bitchy’ to ‘geeky’ to ‘restless’ to ‘rejuvenated’.
This feature actually pre-dates the 2010 codification of emoji into the Unicode system, and even exceeds it in specificity (I’ve never seen an emoji for ‘nostalgic’ or ‘scattered’). The icons could also be customised: if a plain square with a face wasn’t ‘you’ enough, you could choose a kitten or an alien or a bouncing star. Nonetheless, there were only as many moods as there were adjectives to describe them: sleepy, hungry, drained, excited.
Social networks—Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Tumblr in particular—took this limitation and threw it out the window.
Consider their prompts and the open-ended way they’re phrased: ‘What’s on your mind?’ or ‘What’s happening?’ Being freed from the constraints of fixed mood options, or even a direct question, means being free to answer in whatever way you bloody well choose.
Want to tell the world you’re going crazy? Sure. But why stop there, when you can explain you’re going crazy due to the very specific reason of having Mr. Brightside stuck on loop in your head while trying to get work done?
The floodgates had been nudged open, and we didn’t even realise. Once we got over thinking of moods as states of mind, or ones that needed to be expressed as adjectives, they went from being a closed set to one with an infinite number of members.
But the second Big Bang of digital expression was soon to come, once users were given the option to add images to posts and databases like GIPHY waded into the fray. With the power of the visual to communicate piercingly specific, all-too-real sentiments, there was no turning back.
This, however, does not mean there are no rules regarding self-expression on the Internet. It might be a wild space, but it’s not a lawless one.
The first is that talking about yourself on the Internet—pre-mood, even pre-social media—has always involved a degree of self-consciousness.
Take MSN Messenger’s status function (remember that?). It was an invitation to express yourself, but that didn’t mean you spilled your feelings for the world to see. If you were feeling a certain way and wanted people to know about it, without needing to be asked, said feelings still had to be couched with a certain amount of obliqueness.
If you were sad, for example, you said it with a carefully chosen My Chemical Romance lyric, and prayed that someone would get the hint.
In the age of mood, this coyness has only increased. Life is far more complicated and messy than we ever communicate on social media, and what makes it there is often simplified or carefully reframed.
For instance, let’s say someone posts a photo of a fishbowl of wine, with the caption mood AF. Ostensibly, this says: I had a bad day. But what does this mean? They could be drained or exhausted or frustrated or bitter or blue or vulnerable, or some combination of all of these.
Yet the photo of wine doesn’t really capture this at all. In fact, it’s arguably less about saying ‘I’m feeling down’ than ‘Wine is the best coping mechanism lol, haven’t we all been there?’
Images, GIFs, and expanded character counts should have given us endless options, but paradoxically, moods only exist at extremes. The possibilities are at once infinite and more limited than when we only had words to draw on.
The key is to be ironic, self-deprecating, and above all, funny. In other words, all moods are feelings, but not all feelings get to be moods.
In this vein, as Slate has pointed out, a mood can never be bland.
Mood, like everything else on the Internet, is performative. It’s a means of broadcasting one’s cultural cred, a way to flex your pop culture muscle; it’s why so many mood posts involve celebrities or TV characters, from Beyonce to Arya Stark. Mood is a way of signalling that you’re in step with the zeitgeist, and you know how to wield this to maximise your cultural capital.
Within this, it’s interesting to consider the second variety of ‘mood’ posts—mood as I-could-use-some-of-that (or, to borrow other Internetspeak, #goals). Media under this branch of mood are aspirational, like a beach in Hawaii or a bottle of champagne or a photo of yourself on a good day.
But as such, both this and the more literal use of ‘mood’ have less to do with who you are and how you feel, and more with the vibe you want to create, or the person you want to be online. And more often than not, this person is you—but better, funnier, wittier, sharper.
The irony, of course, is that all this happened just as social media started to champion ‘authenticity’. This isn’t to say that mood, as a concept, is dishonest or insincere; after all, if a mood post goes viral, it’s because it’s rooted in something that people identify with.
But the element of deliberation—and more specifically, curation—lurking behind mood makes the swamp of online identity even murkier. It’s no longer just about saying what you think, but doing so in a way that draws maximum likes.
To that end, mood often isn’t about saying what you think, but repeating what somebody else already said. Having cannibalised someone else’s thought process and leveraged off their ingenuity, their mood is now yours too.
Or maybe you always felt that way from the start and they just said it first. Who knows? Does it even matter?
Which is all to say: mood might have started out in the literal sense. But as it grew with the Internet, it became less about personal expression, or even actual feelings—and more about feeding the relatable content beast.
It’s tempting to say that making everything a mood is making us shallow or inarticulate or lazy, but to do so would be to ignore the way the Internet works in the age of social media. If anything, the overwhelming ubiquity of mood is a reflection, not a cause, of how we ascribe value in this cultural moment.
Let’s take a step back for a moment and recall what Internet historians call Web 1.0: the early days of the Internet, characterised by websites that were primarily static in nature. Back then, users’ relationship to the net was one-way, passive; you visited websites to gather information and then moved on.
The arrival of Web 2.0 in 1999 changed everything. Bit by bit, the Internet became less about the relationship between a website and its users, and more about participation by and between the users themselves. One does not simply visit a website, much as one does not simply walk into Mordor. You upload media, leave comments, send messages, write reviews, and, to borrow Zuck’s favourite phrase, ‘create connections’.
A lot might have changed since the days of Neopets, Myspace, and Friendster, but the thread that connects them to still-thriving juggernauts like Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram is interactivity. Engagement was, and still is, the lifeblood of the modern web, helped along by websites that encourage the uploading and sharing of content as quickly and easily as possible. And the natural currency of such an economy is, of course, likes and shares.
Which brings us to the million-dollar question haunting every business engaged in content creation, this website and this writer included: what makes a perfect post in this age of social media? Is it standing out from the crowd through sheer ingenuity, or creating something that 300,000 people will identify with? Or is it about doing both: trying to be unique by being exceptionally relatable?
When examined against such a backdrop, the rise (and rise) of mood makes more sense. It’s the perfect vehicle of rebloggability, hitting all the targets in one go: maximum relatability, creativity of expression, and minimal personal investment. Given how it’s no longer clear what social media is really for—sharing how you feel, or sharing in how everyone else feels—mood’s got all your bases covered: real but aspirational, sincere but ironic, precise but general.
Confused? Unimpressed? Thoughtful? That’s all cool. Whatever you’re feeling, it’s a mood.

Mandarin Was Never Our Mother Tongue. Here's Why This Matters",Sophie Chew,FALSE,FALSE
A Brief History of Lao Sai in Singapore,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-brief-history-lao-sai-singapore/,26-Jun-19,"In 2009, during a holiday in northern China, I caught a mild case of dysentery from eating unclean food. Though mild by historical standards, it was still the most painful experience of my coddled life thus far.
For about 2 weeks, I squatted over a toilet for 15-20 times a day, legs shaking, slightly delirious. By the end, the diarrhoea had turned into a reddish, mucus-like cappuccino froth, while the pain in my asshole was so intense that I wedged my head against the toilet-paper dispenser to distract from what felt like a gradual disemboweling down south. I cursed god, the restaurant, and then-President Hu Jintao. I swore that I would never again visit this fucking provincial backwater called Beijing. Never was I more happy to land at Changi, with its pristine bathrooms and constantly-cleaned water coolers—its promise of sanitation and sanity.
Of course, Changi and Singapore wasn’t always this way. Years later, whilst reading James Francis Warren’s classic history Rickshaw Coolie, I was struck by the story of 1800s rickshaw puller and fellow dysentery victim Leong Koh Long—who was so agonised that ‘he slashed himself with a razor’. Not to suggest that my misery was on par with his, but I *sort of* understand why; the pain can be so great that any distraction would be welcome—even a secondary pain.

Changi was also, of course, the site of the infamous World War 2 Internment camp, where thousands of POWs suffered from dysentery. Lacking medicine or proper food, many would die as the incessant diarrhoea left them weak and utterly malnourished.
School-taught ‘Social Studies’ is a fairly sanitised affair. We learn about Britain, LKY, and the paramount importance of free trade. We also learn about food and the origins of Chicken Rice. However, what comes out is just as important as what goes in, because Singapore’s history is also a fecal history—of dysentery, nightsoil, quacks and more.
In short, it’s a story of shit.
Raffles might have his name on a hotel, but it is Lao Sai that made Singapore what it is today.
“Complaints of the Bowel”
In Singapore’s early days, diarrhoeal diseases were dismayingly rampant. The Big Three were cholera (‘the blue death’), dysentery (‘the bloody flux’) and acute gastroenteritis of the variety which still afflicts shoddy food establishments even today.
These diseases were not just widespread, but lethal. It is hard to imagine dying of Lao Sai in 2019, when the nearest hospital is twenty minutes by Grab, but I urge you to recall last year’s Spize-induced hospitalisations, as well as Unicef accounts of infant mortality. In places like Sub-Saharan Africa, diarrhoea remains the biggest killer of children.
In that sense, Singapore in the 1800s is not so different from say, Modern-day Northern Mali. According to Lee Yong Kiat’s Medical History of Early Singapore, a significant portion of hospital beds were devoted to the treatment of diarrhoeal diseases.
At the Singapore General Hospital (European Seamen’s Hospital, 1849-1850), dysentery was the second biggest source of patients after ‘fever’. There were 26 cases of dysentery, with 6 deaths.
Meanwhile, at Tan Tock Sing Hospital (The Chinese Pauper Hospital/Tocksing’s Hospital), the doctors treated 47 cases of ‘Diarrhoea’ with 15 deaths. The number seems low by contemporary standards, but TTSH only admitted 451 patients in total for that whole year.
In other words, about 10% of all patients suffered from diarrhoea.

Of the Big Three, Cholera—a.k.a Cholera Morbus, Cholera Asiatica, Cholera Biliosa, Vibrio Cholerae—was no doubt the deadliest and the most worrying.
Originating from Bengal, Cholera is a water/food-borne illness whose main symptoms are vomiting and severe diarrhoea. Not the post-Mcspicy shits that we’ve experienced, but diarrhoea on a scale that’s life-threatening if not treated correctly and with great haste. The average cholera victim passes out 1 litre of fluid per hour, and death can occur within 8 hours, usually as a result of severe dehydration and shock. In its final stages, the victim’s skin turns grey and they excrete nothing but ‘rice water stools’—a transparent liquid that is almost entirely of the dead cholera bacterium.
In pre-colonial times, there was no cholera in either Singapore, Malaya, or London for that matter. The sea journey between nations was simply too lengthy and most victims died before they could infect a new port. Thanks to the expansion of colonial empires and the invention of fast-moving steamships, Cholera became a globe-trotter. In 1817, the first Cholera pandemic broke out, infecting Syria, Bangkok, and Indonesia.
Singapore was mercifully spared from its worst because the island was too thinly populated and too ulu. There was, however, a close shave. In 1821, a sickly Austrian vessel—the ‘Caroline Augustus’—requested permission to disembark at Tanjong Rhu. After sending his M.O aboard to have a look, and finding evidence of cholera, Lt. Colonel Farquhar told the captain—in so many words—to stay away. Writing to the Austrian consul-general, he told the ambassador of ‘my desire that no communication may be had with the shore’.
Unfortunately, telling people to piss off is not a viable long-term public health policy when you’re in the entrepot business. Singapore would not be so lucky in the 1850s, when Cholera returned with a fatal vengeance and stayed with us for more than a century.
“Exhorting the demons”
In January 1851, Cholera made its grand/official debut in Singapore. The Police recorded 64 deaths in a fortnight, but the real number was likely much higher. Since there was no death registration and most of our cemeteries were first-come-first-served, it is impossible to count the true cost. The resident councillor gave an aggregate of ‘not under 200’ while The Straits Times estimated the death toll at between ‘300-400’.
(For scale, the SARS epidemic of 2003 killed 33 over the course of a year.)
While we might never know how many people died in that outbreak, we have a good idea of the reaction. Cholera, because of its sudden onset and violent progress—where you literally shit yourself to death—typically causes widespread panic wherever it strikes. When it visited the French Naval Base of Toulon in the spring of 1884, people from all walks of life fled the city in droves. The wealthy went to live in Milan or Paris or their Country piles. The poor slept in roadside ditches and under trees, desperately trying to out-pace the bacterium’s advance.
In Singapore, however, there was no place to run. A ‘great panic’ seized the population. European sailors in the Seamen’s Hospital died. Chinese coolies living along the river died. In Kampung Java, 17 people were carried off by ‘this alarming epidemic’ in one weekend.

The Straits Times editor—evidently a more pugnacious journalist than Sumiko Tan—went on the warpath, accusing the colonial authorities of willful neglect and racism. He suggested, perhaps correctly, that their ‘apathy’ was because the malady was ‘not of a character that extended themselves to Europeans’. (we shall revisit this later)
Amongst the worst affected populations were the coolies, the poorest of the poor who lived in densely-packed lodging-houses. In Rickshaw Coolie, Professor Warren describes the appearance of cholera as sending “a chill down everyone’s spine”, as each man became “frightened for their own life”.
When a tenant-coolie died of cholera, the terrified neighbours swiftly removed and dumped the body beside a road, where they were later discovered (though not identified) by police constables. When there were multiple deaths in one building, the tenants fled entirely, leaving the building empty for the next group of victims.
And like a scene from Boccaccio’s Florence, ties of neighbourly and clan-based kinship broke down in the time of crisis. Friends and comrades abandoned each other for fear of contagion. Where once they pooled money and took care of their ‘fellow pullers’ in times of sickness, Cholera taught them to treat their half-dead kin almost as lepers.
It was all the more frightening because nobody knew what caused the disease or how it spread. Some coolies, believing that Cholera was a demon or ‘gui’, started noisy processions to drive off the evil choleric spirits. Dressed in masks and armed with spears, they set off ghost ships laden with incense and paper money along Rochor Canal. Firecrackers were set off and Monks waved swords, ‘exhorting the demons’ to leave.
The Malay community tried something similar to scare away ‘Hantu’ Cholera. In one contemporary account from 1873, “A large crowd of Mohammedan natives last night paraded the streets of the Town, making the night hideous with their incantations to Heaven to avert the scourge.”

You can sense the British condescension in these accounts, though I’m not sure where their confidence came from. Prophylactic fire-crackers and incantations to heaven might sound silly, but it was surely an improvement over contemporary English methods of stopping diarrhoea, some of which were worse than useless.
Dr Thomas Oxley—of Oxley road fame—suggested that Cholera is best treated by inducing vomiting with ‘saltwater emetics’, while my alma mater—King’s College Hospital—recommended stopping diarrhoea with Castor Oil, a powerful laxative later favoured by Mussolini.
Meanwhile, the Royal College of Physicians recommended Ice Kacang as a treatment for cholera.
Yes, you heard that right—Ice Kacang.
In a report published by the Straits Times, it provided the following recipe/remedy: “Ice should be powdered by beating it in a coarse cloth or bag and then mixed with only as much water as will give it the appearance of a thin potable jelly. A little jam or lemon may be mixed with it to give it a flavour …”
I’m not a medical doctor, but safe to say—it was as refreshing as it was useless. In fact, once cholera made it into your GI tract, nothing helped. There was no cure, and precious little anyone could do about it. During outbreaks, medicines were provided at police stations, so friends of the afflicted could act as nurses. But since these medicines were brandy, calomel, and peppermint, it’s hard to say to what extent the mass placebo helped.
In one telling anecdote from 1858, Senior Surgeon Rose of the European Seamen’s Hospital departed for Penang in the middle of a Cholera outbreak. Naturally, everyone was quite peeved at this blatant act of mid-crisis chao keng.
In an angry letter dated April 22, Singapore’s governor demanded an explanation from his recalcitrant senior surgeon, arguing that he should have ‘deferred his leave’ until Singapore was cured.
Dr. Rose was not cowed. He pointed out that he had treated many Cholera cases on the frontline. His leave was ‘sick leave’, totally necessary because the good doctor had been suffering from ‘recurrent diarrhoea’ for months. The governor was satisfied with the excuse, but needless to say, how depressing to learn that your Chief Medical Officer could not control his own diarrhoea.
There is, however, a silver lining to all this death and despair. During the serious 1873 outbreak, which started at the lunatic asylum but quickly spread to the neighbouring areas of Kandang Kerbau (near KK Hospital for Women and Children), Rochor, and Kampung Glam. Patients in the General Hospital at Kandang Kerbau were moved because the swampy, poorly-drained area was considered a health risk. They were moved to Outram Road, a site which was spacious, close to town, and most importantly, well-drained, which ‘reduced the chances of a cholera outbreak’.
At the recommendation of principal civil medical officer H.L. Randell, the general hospital would remain at Outram thereafter, in the same place where SGH now stands.

The 1873 outbreak also proved to be a turning point for public policy. For the longest time, colonial authorities were happy to let the invisible scythe of Capitalism and/or Darwin work its magic. After the devastation and outcry of 1873, the government was forced to take a more proactive role in governing.
Three ordinances were passed. The first was the Registration of Births And Deaths Ordinance. The second was the Vaccination Ordinance. The third was the quarantine ordinance, which eventually led to the construction of a lazaretto on St John’s Island—where ships coming from infectious ports could be safely checked and quarantined.
They made it through the legislative process unscathed, despite the protests of a mercantile community who complained that quarantines would hurt business.
”More or less diluted cesspools”
The truly awful thing is, Diarrhoeal diseases were mostly preventable. Cholera’s means of transmission was understood as early as 1854 and a vaccine was available by the late 19th century. The same was true for dysentery and gastroenteritis. A Japanese scientist had isolated the bacteria in 1897.
But even in the absence of laboratory results, there was a good lay understanding of how to prevent Lao Sai. The health board—during a cholera outbreak—warned the population to drink only boiled water. Rickshaw coolies likewise preferred ‘hot tea with sugar’ because drinking it ‘bolstered their defences’ against ‘acute gastroenteritis’. This factoid showed that—both on the government and street-level—many people actually had a functional knowledge of how to prevent diarrhoea, even if they lacked a ‘scientific’ understanding of microbiology.
If this was the case, then why did people continue to die of diarrhoea all the way until after World War 2? Why was there, in Prof Warren’s words, ‘no sustained decline’ commensurate with the increase in medical knowledge?

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the answer was inequality. Diarrhoeal diseases continued to ravage the island because the means to prevent them were a luxury few could afford. For the poor, malnourished, and the people living in pestilential slums, firm stools was an aspiration as distant as a freehold condo in 2019.
Hot tea with sugar, for example, was—and is—a relatively effective means of preventing diarrhoea because boiling kills off germs. Unfortunately, few coolies could afford hot tea, at least not in sufficient quantities.
Driven half-mad by Singapore’s scorching weather and by the immense physical exertion of pulling a rickshaw on bad roads—sometimes running for more than 10 miles at a stretch—most coolies threw themselves at any available roadside well, ditch, or stream. After drinking from these contaminated sources out of sheer exhaustion, they fell sick and died.
Today, we would probably call it an ‘occupational hazard’.
Clean reservoir water was available, of course, if you happened to be a passing merchant vessel. According to Contesting Space In Colonial Singapore by Professor Brenda S.A. Yeoh, dirty well water was the norm for ordinary people. If you were a ‘native’ living in Chinatown or Kampung Glam, your daily water needs were met most by a backyard well. The upside was that water was free. The downside was that it was poisonous because these makeshift wells lacked impermeable linings to protect them from the surrounding filth.
Filthy groundwater and latrine discharge could contaminate the well and kill you. Nightsoil men, who washed their buckets by throwing them in the well, could contaminate the well and kill you. Diarrhoea sufferers who didn’t wash their hands before drinking could contaminate the well and kill you.
In a 1902 Municipal health survey of some 3,877 wells, 3265 of them were considered toxic. They were not wells per se, but in the words of one Dr. G.A. Finlayson, government bacteriologist, they were ‘more or less diluted cesspools’.
These diarrhoeal diseases were not just physically painful, but financially hurtful as well. Due to the lack of effective treatment, and an ignorance of (admittedly limited) medical options, bowel complaints were often left to god or nature. In the meantime, the sufferers were unable to earn a living and thus the disease sapped them of both their ‘strength and savings’.
Even after they recovered, many were too weak to work, or alternatively, worked extra hard to make up for the debts incurred during their illness. As a result, some of them fell ill again, thus continuing the vicious circle of poverty and diarrhoea.
Not the healthiest environment. Image credit: Roots.sg
The British response to this crisis was mixed, at best. While some government officials like Dr Charles Dumberton or J.T Thomson lobbied for a proactive approach to health, water, and sanitation, the overall response was a resounding ‘meh’. In Prof Warren’s judgment, the policy was one of “procrastination, wrangling and failures”.
Take, for example, everyone’s favourite jogging track MacRitchie Reservoir. Although it is named after Municipal Engineer James MacRitchie, the original funding for the project came from a wealthy Chinese philanthropist named Tan Kim Seng, who provided a $13,000 donation if the colonial government made a pinky-promise to deliver free fresh water for all and sundry.
Even so, the Thomson Reservoir took some 20 years to complete because of the usual bureaucratic stinginess. There was likewise no public money for well inspections, hospitals or a proper sewer system. Sanitation and health depended heavily on private funding.
Despite the increasingly hysterical municipal reports with sentences like, “It cannot be said that any serious attention had been given to this important branch of public health” (Dr Charles Dumberton) and “The lack of a proper and efficient water supply left Singapore open not to the chance, but the absolute ultimate certainty of epidemics” (Dr W.R.C Middleton), the government continued to drag its feet.
Part of the delay was not just garden-variety incompetence, but probable prejudice. Diarrhoeal diseases were often blamed on ‘Asiatic habits’. They were not crises to be tackled because they stemmed from the ‘insanitary and immoral lives of Asiatic races’. Since the ‘in-sanitation’ was a ‘hereditary Chinese instinct’, there was little and less the colonial government could do to improve things. Dirty people lead dirty lives in dirty places, and so it goes.
Dr. Middleton. The facial hair protects him from pestilence. Image credit: Root.sg
But as every academic of colonial Singapore would point out, such thinking was not only flawed but deeply self-serving.
It’s true that 80% of Cholera victims were Chinese, but filth is not genetic. It is easy to avoid diarrhoea when you live in a Tanglin bungalow with your own private water supply. Less so when you are sharing a latrine and a ‘diluted cesspool’ with 20 other people, with one water source for everything from bathing to cooking. By all accounts, severe overcrowding in urban areas was the principal reason why ‘bowel complaints’ were a leading cause of death.
However, by blaming the coolies for causing the diseased/filthy environment, rather than seeing them as the victims of a diseased environment which they were too poor to escape, the government could dodge the responsibility of carrying out oh-so-expensive housing and sanitation reforms.
What’s the point of building sewers and houses for the irredeemably ‘undesirable’ coolies? Why indeed, when the money could be spent on more profitable ventures? After all, cheap labour is cheap labour, and the dead could be easily replaced. Southern China had no shortage of human capital.
“Pineapple”
Every year, on Feb 15, Total Defence Day, Singapore educates its young by making them eat sweet potato porridge—a staple food of the Syonan years. I applaud MOE’s creative pedagogy but lament their lack of culinary imagination. At my own primary school, the canteen aunties worked wonders with white rice, tapioca, and sugar. Most of us were left full and happy and wondering what the big deal was. The Japanese occupation tasted alright, we told each other, grinning.
In retrospect, a more objective lesson in the horrors of war could have been had by giving the pupils a strong laxative, followed by a severe beating.
I’m joking, of course, but not about the historical experience. Secondary school social studies textbooks speak in abstract terms about the ‘suffering endured during the Japanese occupation’ and how the Kempeitai ‘tortured’ Lim Bo Seng to death, but they spared us the grisly, shitty details.
As you probably suspect by now, the severity of gastrointestinal distress increased dramatically during World War 2.
For one thing, diarrhoea might have been one of the reasons why Singapore lost in the first place. As any decent World War 2 historian can tell you, British forces in Singapore outnumbered the Japanese, and there was plenty of ammunition left in Fort Canning. The real problem was a desperate lack of clean water. The Japanese had already captured the main reservoirs, and through near-constant air-raids, ruptured most of the above-ground pipelines carrying fresh water. Municipal engineers were unable to repair them in time, at least not without the aid of anti-aircraft defences, which had already run out of ‘Bofors’ ammo.
Since “water failure was imminent and an epidemic threatened the overpopulated city”, the allied forces decided to surrender.
It is impossible to determine if surrender was the right humanitarian decision, but it was definitely insufferable for the British and Anzac soldiers who were taken prisoner. POW is a generous term for what they went through. I would use the word ‘torture’.
According to an oral history account compiled by Wellcome Institute for the History Of Medicine, much of this torture was caused by the proliferation of diarrhoea and dysentery at Changi, where there was neither water nor medical supplies.

By some accounts, upwards of 5000 people contracted dysentery in the atrocious, overcrowded camp, after up to 15,000 men were squeezed in a barracks designed for 800. Diarrhoea, according to Dr Geoff Gill from the Liverpool School Of Tropical Medicine, was a fate which few, if any, could avoid.
Hugh De Wardener was a Royal Medical Corp Captain who served in the dysentery ward before eventually getting dysentery himself. The pain of bloody discharge was so intense that he compared it to the experience of getting sodomized by a pineapple. To relieve the pain, he tipped the end of the bed up, allowing him to put his feet up, thus easing the swelling in his anus and providing some much-needed relief. In the absence of actual medicine, POWs consumed kaolin—porcelain clay—as a cure. It may sound bananas, but the clay did help, although it also had the unfortunate side effect of ‘bunging up’ one’s intestines.
Captain Wardener eventually recovered, but most of those shipped north to work on the Thai-Burma Railway were not so lucky. Those prisoners lay on the bamboo beds in their own excrement, all bones and skin, enjoying only the occasional beating from the Japanese soldiers who were incensed by the laziness of dying men.
A similar fate awaited war hero Lim Bo Seng of Force 136 in Malaya’s Batu Gajah prison.
According to the testimony of Tan Chong Tee, a fellow inmate and Force 136 volunteer, he had contracted bloody dysentery in the midst of a hunger strike protesting the prison’s abysmal conditions. He quickly became weak and bed-ridden. Tan Chong Tee was also suffering from dysentery, but he managed to rouse himself to plead his comrade’s case to the warders.
The plea fell on deaf ears. Instead, the Kempeitai dragged him into a block reserved for dying men and left him on the ground without medicine or water, where he lay for the next three days. His ‘tormented cries for help echoed through the prison compound’, before fading away after ‘midnight’.
When confronted with their murderous behaviour, the warders claimed innocence because they ‘did not receive instructions’ from Kempeitai higher-ups.
Outside the prison walls, an epidemic raged in the civilian population. According to the Annual Report on the Registration of Births and Deaths for the years 1940-47, deaths from dysentery increased almost tenfold. In 1940, 256 people died of dysentery. In 1944, the death toll climbed to 2,777. Due to the widespread malnutrition and ‘strict controls’ on medical supplies, many who would have otherwise recovered died of their illness. As it turns out, their deaths were completely avoidable. When the British re-occupied the General Hospitals in Penang and Singapore, they discovered massive stockpiles of medicine—an estimated one year’s worth was lying fallow in the store-rooms.

But perhaps the most damning of all diarrhoea-related trivia during World War 2 were the Japanese attempts to weaponise it. Japan’s wartime research into and use of biological weapons is well-known. (Just type ‘Unit 731’ into your Google search bar and prepare to regurgitate your breakfast).
However, less well-known is how the Imperial Japanese Army opened a franchise for their war crimes in Singapore called OKA 9420.
Its name sounds like a Japanese Pop group, but its activities were decidedly less wholesome. Housed in a wing of the Singapore General Hospital, OKA 9420 was staffed by some 600 people, including 150 doctors—apparently released from their Hippocratic Oath. The unit manufactured pathogens like cholera, dysentery, anthrax, smallpox, malaria, and typhus for military use in China and Southeast Asia. Although diarrhoeal diseases were featured, the Singapore speciality was apparently Plague fleas, which grew strong and healthy in our balmy weather. The late Minister Othman Wok, who worked as a lab assistant for OKA 9420, wrote in his memoir Never In My Wildest Dreams about ‘trapping rats’ for their fleas, who could then be infected with bubonic plague.
After the war, OKA 9420’s commanders were brought to justice and executed by a War Crimes Tribunal.
Just Kidding. Its commanding officer, Lt. Colonel Ryoichi Naito, never even faced charges. In exchange for sharing his research on biochemical weapons with the USA—and not those fucking Soviets—his entire unit was granted immunity from war crimes prosecution.
By all accounts, the good doctor returned to Japan and enjoyed a successful medical career, before founding a highly-regarded pharmaceutical company called Green Cross Corp.
He died peacefully in July 1982, at the age of 76.
“Keep Singapore Clean”
I don’t know how often Lee Kuan Yew thought about Lao Sai, but since he lived through World War 2, it’s safe to say that Ah Gong had seen and smelled the worst. Whether this experience influenced his later policies, we don’t know. My guess is yes.
It’s hard to imagine otherwise. LKY’s obsession with cleanliness and order makes a lot more sense with the benefit of historical context. As does his claim, made to the BBC, that: “a cleaner city would create a stronger economy.”
The prohibition on hawkers, the ‘Keep Singapore Clean’ campaign, and the millions collected in NEA fines may seem draconian—but not if you boast an intimate (or traumatic) acquaintance with debilitating diarrhoea.
It’s a disgusting, stomach-churning subject, but also an illuminating one. So much of the past is anchored by ‘great’ people and outsized personalities. As a result, we miss smaller players, like Mr. Shigella—the bacteria responsible for causing dysentery. He/she/it probably had a greater impact on the course of our history than those administrators whose names adorn our roads and public buildings.

Likewise, Lao Sai also proves a useful counterpoint to those who argue that free trade and colonialism is da best. It’s just a teeny bit more complicated than that.
The British left behind many great things—like sausage buns and Habeas Corpus—but their ill-conceived, let-it-be doctrine towards housing and public health also left a trail of corpses. Looking back at the Palladian architecture and the Raffles Long Bar, it’s easy to think maybe everything wasn’t so bad. It wasn’t—if you were European and rich. For the rest, not so much. It is sad to imagine the countless people—of every race—who died in their own excrement, without the company of friends and family, for the want of a few cents of clean water.
So the next time you are encamped upon a toilet because of too much McSpicy or improper vegetable preparation, don’t just curse the heavens. Take the chance to ponder your connection to the past: SGH was built where it is because of diarrhoea. Hawker centres came into being because of cholera scares, as did St John’s Island and Cold Storage. The river that runs through our past is not just a bustling canal of commerce and prosperity; it’s also a stream of excrement.
Don’t forget to wash your hands.

"To Singapore, With Love: How Overseas Singaporeans View Singapore",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-ge-2020-overseas-singaporeans/,8-Jul-20,"Disclaimer: RICE does not endorse or support any political party in Singapore.
This is a series of voter profiles by RICE where we speak to Singapore’s many disparate communities and find out the issues that matter to them.
There are currently 217,200 Singaporeans living overseas, a small but not insignificant amount of people considering our tiny population. As we head into the final days of GE2020, I was curious to find out how overseas Singaporeans were thinking about the upcoming elections.
Has living abroad and experiencing different political systems and societal cultures influenced the way they think about local elections or political culture?
Lakshmi Ganapathi, United States
Boston Public Garden. Image: Sahaj Bedi via Unsplash.
Lakshmi currently works as a doctor in Boston, US, and has been in the US since 2009.
She says that living in the US gave her an acute unawareness of what an uninformed voter she had been while in Singapore.
“My husband is American. I saw him be far more informed than I was. He had grown up learning about the constitution in school. I on the other hand realized I have no idea what the constitution says; I never learned it, I never cared to understand.”
Lakshmi says her time in the US has motivated her to improve her political knowledge and be more involved in civic matters and participate in civic engagement. Lakshmi attributed some of that to her local community culture: she lives in Jamaica Plains, a historic neighborhood in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with a long history of social activism.
“I saw my husband and friends were very involved in civic engagement. When local bills are passed, many of them engage with representatives, make phone calls, question representatives about how they vote, what their views are about legislation. In Singapore you have MP sessions, you go there to air your grievances or get specific help. But I never engaged my elected members on policy or legislative issues.”
Of course, there are drawbacks to the US political system as well. Lakshmi acknowledged that many bills in the US just get stuck in Congress and never get passed, due to political gridlock and ideological polarization. On the other hand, things get passed quickly in Singapore, but we don’t necessarily scrutinize what gets passed in detail. There seems to be trade-offs between efficiency and a more inclusive policy-making process.
Lakshmi noted that while Singapore’s government is very competent in delivering basic goods and services, our society lacks a free press and robust civil society. In contrast, the US has a free press (that is not always responsible) and a robust civil society, but lacks competent government.
Still, Lakshmi thinks that while we need to recognize that trade-offs in governing models or policies may be inevitable, Singapore needs to have more conversations on what those trade-offs are, who gets to decide the trade-offs, and how we make them.
Even while abroad, she continues to be engaged with local news and politics.
“If anything, being an active member of my local community has made me more motivated to contribute to issues that do concern many Singaporeans. Many people say, why? You don’t even live here. But even if I don’t live in Singapore, the people I love are still in Singapore. My parents live in Singapore. They are going to be there for the rest of their life times. And there’s always a possibility that I will be back.”
Toh Hui Ran, 26, Thailand
Lisu Lodge, 73, Ban Chang, Amphoe Mae Taeng, Chiang Mai, Thailand. Image: Dennis Rochel via Unsplash.
Hui Ran moved to Thailand a year and a half ago to work in a non-profit organization that dealt with ecosystem restoration and farming. She says that moving abroad has shifted the way she looks at how our society should be structured. “I’m not very aware of Thai politics, but it has made me think about the kinds of societies that exist out there, and the ways in which people can thrive.”
Hui Ran noted that Singapore has very little land allocated to things like farming, largely because of our land constraints. She really appreciates the kind of freedom that land affords, and regrets that people in Singapore don’t have that freedom or expansiveness of space. She particularly values the diversity of livelihoods that living in a country with land affords you, and admires how livelihoods such as farmers and craftsmen are respected in Thailand.
At the same time, living in Thailand has shown her how a tightly run government can alleviate the possibility of corruption. She said, “In Thailand, not all governance is as ‘clean’ as in Singapore. There are situations where you have to go under the table with people. I’ve heard of them. I’ve also witnessed and been privy to such occasions. In Singapore, that’s obviously not the case. This has taught me that a clean government does give its citizens more mental space, since you don’t have to constantly worry about how to navigate bureaucratic loopholes.”
She adds, “I never feel an oppressive military presence”.
The most prominent way the military features in her life is when she sees them functioning as traffic police. Hui Ran pointed out that although international media portray Thailand as being ruled by military junta, their presence is quite unobservable to the everyday person.
Still, Hui Ran acknowledged that her view of Thailand was highly curated by her experience as a foreigner. “As a guest, you only see the good sides. When I first moved here, I thought, Thailand is so perfect, so fantastic, things are so cheap. But I also realize more and more that a lot of it has to do with my privilege, and I’m in a unique position.”
In the end, Hui Ran acknowledged that her own encounters with Thailand have been very good largely because of her local situation (she lives in a rural town), and has quite little to do with the political situation in the country.
Like Lakshmi, Hui Ran keeps abreast of local politics even in Thailand. “I feel in touch through reading the news. Nowadays, sharing opinions online seems to be the dominant form of millennial activism. There’s a lot of political literacy stuff going on.”
Ash Kjelsnes, 28, Norway
Bryggen, Bergen, Norway. Image: Michael Fousert via Unsplash.
Ash moved to Norway when she was 24, and works as an intensive care nurse at a hospital.
She noted the main differences between Singapore and Norway were the different values placed on work life balance. “In Norway, we have very strict work hours from 8-4. You do not contact your employees after 4 or even on the weekends.”
She also cited Norway’s considerably more family friendly policies as a main reason why she moved there with her husband.
“What is nice about the Norwegian government is that they really invest a lot of money to make sure that you have support in maintaining your family. When it comes to maternity leave, you have like one year. School wise it’s all free. Especially for public schools, up to university. If your kid is sick, you do have rights to sick leave, when you want to stay home with your child. You get 16-24 days of paid leave. You have to pay in Singapore for childbirth, but here it’s free.”
Beyond familial policies, Ash also cited other examples of generous social policies that make Norway an attractive city. “Hospital surgeries are free. Those who want to go to school don’t have to pay, you can be a doctor even if your family is poor, and you get a student loan that is almost free: there are very low interest rates and you can pay them for over thirty years.”
More importantly, Norway has strong labour protections and low levels of income inequality. Said, Ash, “There are not many differences in the salary rates, because you have a minimum wage that is quite high, about $20+ SGD. That would be how much you earn in a store, or as a manicurist. And of course you have all the rights: rights to five weeks paid leave, one year maternity leave, on top of minimum wage. You can’t really see the class difference. You won’t see a 90-year-old man working at KFC. Most people after 65 are already pensioned. People are generally quite happy with how the government has been doing so far.”
While Ash hopes to see more discussion on these social policies in Singapore, she feels like our political discourse is still not very mature, as her impression is that most opposition candidates in past general elections were largely focused on negative campaigning. She observed that opposition politicians were more focused on trashing the PAP, rather than on giving thoughtful, constructive policy suggestions.
Still, perhaps this current election may signal a shift in the quality of opposition debate, particularly by larger parties such as the Workers’ Party, the Progress Singapore Party, and the Singapore Democratic Party. Ash herself has been keeping up with the general elections via Facebook and the rally broadcasts on CNA, and discusses it with her Singaporean friends who live near her home in Norway.
Nurhidayah Hassan, 36, France
Paris, France. Image: Nil Castellví via Unsplash.
Nurhidayah moved to France in 2018 with her two kids and husband. Currently, she works as a project officer for gender rights, working in a women’s rights organisation based in Brussels.
Nurhidayah stressed that moving to France has not changed her political leanings, nor her understanding of local politics in Singapore. She has always been interested in the socio-political affairs of our country in both a personal and professional capacity, as she formerly served as an associate lecturer teaching social sciences at the Singapore University of Social Sciences. Since her undergraduate days, she has been curious as to how policymaking, political ideologies, and Singapore history shape persistent social issues like income/class gaps, race relations and gender inequalities.
Nurhidayah notes that there are too many differences in terms of political culture between the two countries to enable a fair comparison.
She says, “Singapore has a single-party, authoritarian government that is consistently popular with the larger population, and our system is underlined by unwavering neoliberalism values. France is a social democracy that is still highly capitalistic but has strong social protection for its people. So I never try to compare both countries—we have very different histories, different political systems, different issues.”
“In general, the French value their right to express their political grievances and they can self-organise and mobilise support to advance their causes (ie: go on strikes and protests), hence they do not shy away from political discussions. Not to compare, but given the strict laws on freedom of expression in Singapore, people are naturally afraid to express their political opinions lest they overstep certain unknown boundaries.”
In the end, no societies are perfect, and no political system is perfect either. Extrapolating from one system to the next makes little sense, when every country has very different historical legacies, geopolitical and economic realities, and social compacts.
These Singaporeans living abroad were also upfront about how their own views of their host societies were skewed by their own positionality and privilege, and how they represent only one, out of many, scattered views about their host societies. The danger is when we hold singular views as representative of entire countries, or think it is possible to reduce complex lived experiences into a few short paragraphs from a single spokesperson.
Yet, what we can learn from their accounts is how leaving Singapore can make us more aware of her strengths and flaws, and open up room for different kinds of political imagination.
Living in Singapore, it may be hard for us to envision alternative social, political, and economic arrangements (as Ash some pointed out, the concept of “rights” didn’t resonate with her until she moved to Norway). While we cannot simply import and transplant values wholesale from one country to another, the act of moving can help us envisage new possibilities, and make us question existing assumptions about our home country that we may have taken for granted.
This GE, we’re not just interested in the winners and losers. Join RICE as we satirise, over-analyse, and dissect everything from how we talk about politics and politicians to what we think we know about how Singaporeans vote.

A Letter To My Tamil Singaporean Daughter About The Singapore We Want",Poh Yong Han,FALSE,TRUE
Companies Thriving Despite Covid-19: A Singaporean’s Reasoning,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-companies-thrive-covid-19-maslow-hierarchy-needs/,8-Mar-20,"Because of Covid-19, I’ve found myself sub-consciously becoming more like a hermit lately. My family and I eat out less. Our daughter’s outdoor activities are reduced. We’ve even stopped going to the movies, settling for Netflix, HBO, and Amazon Prime Video instead. When we’re hungry, there’s McDonald’s, GrabFood, FoodPanda and Deliveroo.
I’m sure many Singaporeans are making similarly small but significant changes to their everyday routines. The trickling effect must have impacted enterprises too, profit and non-profit. While experts forecast the Covid-19 situation to last at least another 4-6 months, companies in Singapore are buckling up and adapting. As more Singaporeans unwittingly participate in the country’s largest Business Continuity Plan (BCP) experiment, by staying, studying and working from home, so too must enterprises adapt to tide us through it.
Darwin is often quoted: “It is not the strongest nor the most intelligent species that survives, but the most adaptable to change.” This made me wonder: which enterprises are primed to adapt alongside us through these times? Do they understand our anxieties during home isolation or the routine changes we make? Can they help us survive?
So I crafted a chart modelled after Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and cross-matched our anxieties with products and services that assuage them. The silver lining I found is that these enterprises, through happenstance or foresight, are not only positioned to benefit, but could help us adapt, for much better days ahead.
Note: The survival checklist chart below can be downloaded and shared in high resolution if you’re a super spreader.
Find yourself staying home more often than usual? This handy visual checklist should tell you if you’re doing so because you fear crap, death, the government, your spouse/family, lack of money/work, losing out to others or your dissipating conscience. It’s usually a combination of the five (or six). Vector graphic credit: Shutterstock
Some enterprises are already offering products or services which address one of six different anxiety levels: coprophobic, physiological, safety, social, ego and self-actualization. Interpreted from a Singaporean perspective, they understand our discomfort from being stuck in isolation or adjusting to a sudden routine change. From having to deal with thirst/starvation/sickness (kiasi), being admonished by the authorities (kiachenghu), boredom, abandonment and poverty (kiabor/kiabolang/kiabolui), loss of self-esteem (kiasu) to apathy (kiabosim), these enterprises offer some solutions to overcome them. You’re probably wondering … what about coprophobia (kiasai)? We’ll touch on that towards the end, since it’s not just a Singaporean anxiety as we’d originally thought.
PHYSIOLOGICAL NEEDS (kiasi): ONLINE ORDERING SERVICES, HOME DELIVERIES AND CLEANING SERVICES
Most Singaporeans are well-stocked for emergencies (food, water, warmth, medical supplies). The more laissez-faire worry less. Simple. In Singapore, as long as I have Internet access and a mobile device, I know this anxiety can be easily taken care of—as long as my air-conditioning and fridge work of course.
RedMart for example, saw orders exceeding 300% of its weekly average when DORSCON level was raised to Orange on February 7. Shoppers were buying 4 to 10 times more food staples, 3.5 to 5 times more paper products and 2 to 6 times more personal care and household cleaning supplies. In some way, my wife and I probably contributed to this 300%.
“We experienced a spike in bulk buying and large orders on Lazada’s grocery arm, RedMart,” said James Chang, CEO of Lazada Singapore in a Rice interview. “As more consumers leverage our technology to shop at their convenience on their phones, we noticed an increase in customers recognizing the benefits of shopping for essential items online.”
According to James Chang, CEO of Lazada (which includes RedMart), the company has increased its fleet of vehicles and drivers to ensure customers’ orders are fulfilled timely. Image credit: RedMart (Facebook)
Chang admitted that Lazada sales for computer accessories increased by 40% when the first Covid-19 case was announced on January 23. “Laptops and network components saw sales growth of 10% to 15% after Singapore raised its DORSCON level to Orange. We believe individuals and companies recognize a need to safeguard themselves/employees and to find the right tools to create a more conducive and productive home working environment,” he added.
“In order to better manage deliveries, we have advised customers to add items to their existing orders, subject to availability, instead of placing another order and taking up another delivery slot.
“We have been increasing our delivery capacity and ensuring a strong supply of necessary goods during this extraordinary situation. This includes increasing our fleet of vehicles and drivers to ensure our customers’ orders are fulfilled in a timely manner and to uphold our standards of delivery. We are confident that these measures we have set in place will allow us to continue to service our customers and be able to fulfill their needs.”
SAFETY NEEDS (kiachenghu): SERVICES THAT COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT POLICIES
The government has made it clear that there is zero-tolerance towards fake news, excessive hoarding, and disobeying a quarantine/stay-at-home order. Agencies and third-parties which protect us from anyone who disobey them will gain priority in the interest of national security. Thermal scanners, thermometers, public information filters (scanning for fake news), security agencies serving and monitoring Quarantine Orders, contact tracing volunteers and protective equipment for front-line health workers are likely in high demand.
Speaking of health workers, there’s some worry if I develop mild cold symptoms but am unsure if I should join the queues at clinics and hospitals. Is there a home-based alternative resilient enough to ensure our healthcare workers are not overloaded with stupid-old-ask-a-lot-questions-me?
Apparently there is, and the ecosystem’s been in place for several years now.
“There has been heightened public health concerns over the virus outbreak. People prefer not to be exposed to other sick patients in physical clinics/hospitals. We have seen an approximate 60% increase in teleconsultations over the past few weeks (since DORSCON Orange). More doctors have joined our platform to teleconsult with patients too.”
This was shared by a spokesperson from Doctor World, a 24/7 video teleconsultation app (Apple AppStore and Google Play) for non-emergency illnesses (eg. common cough, cold, constipation, diarrhoea, acne, migraine, gout and eyelid problems). And yes, it’s for Singaporeans.
Lazy or afraid to step out of the house and join the rest at clinics and hospitals? There are several telemedicine apps now you can use. Some even deliver medicine and a printed MC to you within 3 hours. Image credit: Doctor World
As expected, telemedicine usage intensified when DORSCON Orange was announced. Another app service, Doctor Anywhere, saw usage surge 70% in the past six weeks.
“A significant number of the consultation and enquiries are related to acute upper respiratory infection (cough, cold, flu, etc.). There is no shift in trend, but respiratory disorders have always been the top condition we see for consultation,” said a spokesperson from Doctor Anywhere.

The app includes a health and wellness marketplace. “Products such as sanitisers and disinfectants are flying off the shelf, as are immunity boosting supplements and vitamins. Another popular Marketplace purchase is our home-based services, including domestic helper’s six-monthly medical examination (6ME) screening, vaccinations and so on. People are turning to home-based options for services that they would normally go out of home for,” she said.
“For checks that do require physical examination, a doctor can always ask patients to take readings under guidance. For instance, to check for fever, a doctor can ask the patient to use a thermometer during the video consultation. If the doctor assesses that the condition requires further investigation, he/she is trained to advise the patient to go for a physical consultation,” said Doctor World.
Well, with at least five Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPC) around my district, I think I’m more than prepared, medical-wise.
Image credit: Ministry of Health
On the education front, and if you have school-going children, be prepared for some changes. My daughter is already trialling a digital form of homework via her kindergarten’s app. A lecturer-friend of mine shared that polytechnics in Singapore are preparing to conduct lectures on an e-learning mode when the semester starts in April 2020. While tutorials will still continue, class sizes will be reduced from say, 30 to 25. If this is true, lecturers will probably need conversion tools to transfer physical, printed notes into digital form. Conversion software apps from Adobe, OCR scanners and interactive touch-screen-and-camera devices will feature more in education methods among teachers and students (if this is the way forward).
What about travel? What if I plan to travel to a country with a growing infection rate, end up getting quarantined there and the government has to spend resources to rescue me? A friend of mine booked a Singapore Airlines ticket to Melbourne in April. She’s concerned if this exact nightmare scenario would happen to her. At the time of writing, Singapore has blocked entry and transit for new visitors who travelled to Iran, northern Italy and South Korea within the last 14 days.
On the flipside, North Korea, Papua New Guinea, Qatar, South Korea, Taiwan, Sarawak (Malaysia), Israel, Saudi Arabia and India have issued travel advisories on travellers from Singapore. The situation remains fluid, and there is only so much our government can do to protect its citizens overseas (or planning to be). Even before she flies, my friend risks getting her flight cancelled or rescheduled. Fortunately, many local insurance agencies have advisories on making Covid-19-related claims from travel insurance. Allianz, Aviva, AXA, AIG, ERGO, Etiqa, FWD, NTUC Income, MSIG and Sompo stand to benefit from more travellers buying insurance but note their advisories on cut-off dates and countries covered, otherwise claims may become an issue.
SOCIAL NEEDS (kiabor, kiabolang, kiabolui): INTERNET & CELLULAR SERVICES, GAME & ENTERTAINMENT APPS, UNIFIED COMMUNICATION TOOLS
What’s worse than being stuck at home alone? Being stuck at home with your spouse.
Hear me out: For working couples who are used to not seeing each other until 7 PM on a workday, the idea of looking at each other more frequently now is going to take some additional getting used to. Of course, we can’t use excuses to distract ourselves by visiting hotpot restaurants, F&B outlets, shopping malls, cinemas, or public events.
So to keep ourselves socially engaged at least, we spend more time on Netflix, HBO, Amazon Prime Video, and now Apple TV+. Which probably explains why these home streaming services are seeing greater viewership and subscriptions on their platforms. Case in point—Lost in Russia, a cancelled theatrical Chinese film, saw its home-streaming debut viewed 600 million times by 180 million households in three days. Food for thought—maybe all movie distributors should consider a streaming strategy from now on (at least to recoup losses from empty seats in the theatre).

Since I’ve been working from home, I’ve also been video-conferencing my colleagues and bosses. Being at home doesn’t mean I can play truant and deliver slipshod work. Having a stable video conferencing service and Internet network at home is critical to surviving in an alternative home-based economy. The last thing I need is to miss an online boardroom discussion because of terrible connection or lousy software.
According to Mr. Samir Sayed, Managing Director for ASEAN & Korea of Poly (the rebranded company after Plantronics’ acquisition of Polycom), mobile technologies such as Wi-Fi, messaging, videoconferencing, and virtual workspaces, have made ‘place’ less important than ‘purpose’.
“In difficult times like these, businesses (must) consider business continuity by taking advantage of technology and empower employees to stay productive while being physically away from the office.”
Already, 84% of IT pros are using more than one cloud-based video conference solution. From Microsoft Skype, Google Hangout, Amazon Chime, Facebook WhatsApp, BlueJeans, LogMeIn to Zoom, employees are basically spoilt for choice. What’s more, with Singapore’s robust broadband and Wi-Fi network, it’s anybody’s turf really. The key thing, however, is that the platform keeps communication closely knitted, no matter how far apart everyone is.
US-based Poly (rebranded from Plantronics after it acquired Polycom) does video, voice and content solutions for remote communications. They’ve been supporting remote working environments since 1990, from regional e-meets, virus outbreaks to a potential zombie apocalypse.
“In times of crisis, remote working arrangements may be what keeps national economies afloat…employees should be enabled to do their best work wherever they may be, given their responsibilities, workload, and more importantly, how well they are feeling,” said Sayed.
EGO (not ECO) NEEDS (kiasu): BREAKING NEWS SITES, SOCIAL MEDIA AI TOOLS, INVESTMENT SERVICES, SITES WITH GREAT DEALS & FREE CREDITS
Good or bad, ego resilience has served us well from time to time. Queues for iPhones, queues for face masks, queues for Shake Shack, etc.
While I usually avoid queues, I know the kiasu aspect in me is a good alerting system of sorts—to suss out information before everyone else so I don’t end up being the last guy at the station. Breaking news sites are seeing more visitors and subscriptions, WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter and Google innovations and traffic surged, and AI tools are in demand, thanks to folks from GovTech (or is it CovTech)?,
If I’m the financial investing type, I’d probably look towards companies producing hand sanitisers, face masks, disinfectants and possibly vaccines. Companies like Gilead Sciences, Moderna, Regeneron, AbbVie, Johnson & Johnson, Vir Biotechnology, Glaxosmithkline, Sanofi, Roche, Illumina, Qiagen, Thermo-Fisher, Fuji Film Holdings and Cepheid are racing to develop a cure for Covid-19. Why? Everyone knows the one to develop the cure first wins (so consider everything being tested now as a maybe).
Even stocks of face mask and hazmat suit manufacturers like DuPont, 3M, APT, AHPI and Lakeland Industries are seeing spikes in trading, not to mention remote office apps like Zoom and Slack. I don’t know how long this run will last, but as long as demand and panic-buying continue, you know the rest.
It takes a long time to develop a treatment or vaccine for something like Covid-19. Pharmaceutical firm Gilead Sciences, is producing Remdesivir, an Ebola vaccine, as a possible treatment for Covid-19. Since January 31, its stock price has shot up from USD63 to USD76 on 5 March. Image credit: TradingView.com
A new but morbid development is the cryptocurrency coin—CoronaCoin or NCOV. Traders familiar with Bitcoin and Ethereum can bet on the coronavirus epidemic, based on how many people fall ill and die from Covid-19. Every two days, the coin supply diminishes based on the rate of global cases, which suggests a price surge if more people die from the virus. The silver lining is that part of the proceeds will go to the Red Cross for Covid-19 relief, just to make sure traders don’t feel so bad.

Personally, since I’m spending more time at home, I’ve been browsing courses available at the SkillsFuture site (got credits must spend right?). The idea is to use the time I have to upgrade myself and come out stronger when the economy stabilises (Uncle Heng say one). Companies listed on the site stand to benefit over the long-term, especially those offering courses within the threshold of available free credits (S$500 or less). If every Singaporean takes the opportunity to use them, at least we’ll see more bakers, app developers and flower arrangers once this is all over.
I think if there’s one form of resilience Singaporeans would excel at, it would be our ego.
SELF-ACTUALIZATION NEEDS (kiabosim): CHARITIES, PLACES OF WORSHIP, LIVE-STREAMING & ONLINE SELF-REFLECTION SERVICES
On the heart- and soul-searching front, contributors have been giving fund-raising sites a big boost amid the coronavirus outbreak. Giving.sg saw donations hit more than S$2.2 million last month, and the government has just launched the SG United Portal to rally Singaporeans to similar social causes. As Singaporeans soul-search for meaning in this vulnerable and turbulent life, so too must our small island-nation bring us together as one (cue patriotic National Day song).
But what do I do if I’m, say, a Christian soul unable to join Sunday service and praise God in a church? The answer? Live-streaming. Already pervasive in games (Twitch, Steam) and entertainment, it’s now become a go-to method for places of worship to reach out to their congregation, especially if they have to suspend mass or some worshippers fall sick.
On 14 February 2020, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Singapore suspended mass and large gatherings. Image credit: Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Singapore
“(The live stream) is a good thing for now, and could well be a catalyst for more regular family prayer. Especially during this season of Lent, it is sobering and focuses us well. At the same time, there are others who need physical and active participation in mass and the one we all lose is holy communion which we do spiritually. Either way, no right or wrong. It calls us to step up and keep our relationship with Christ,” said Annette, a Roman Catholic I spoke to. Annette mentioned to me that mass will resume by mid-March. NOTE: As of 12 March 2020, the lifting of the mass suspension has been cancelled.
Even for churches still running their weekly services, their live streams have spiked during these times. “People are generally more concerned about personal hygiene, so there has been this general worry about the spread of Covid-19. Some folks have decided to stay at home during this period,” said Eugene Low, a pastor from Grace Baptist Church.
Most churches have live-streaming services in place, with Grace Baptist Church being one of them. With the spread of Covid-19 and the recent Roman Catholic Church’s suspension of mass and gatherings, many devotees continued their worship from their homes thanks to YouTube and its ease of access.

“The numbers from our live stream have definitely increased. There is some fall in physical attendance, while the number of people watching the live stream has gone up. But now, we’re seeing people coming back again.”
Grace Baptist Church live-streams its Sunday service on YouTube. Compared to the previous year (green), LIVE viewers (blue line) spiked to about 100 on 9 Feb’s Sunday service (DORSCON Orange was on 7 Feb), then 450 on 16 Feb, and about 175 on 23 Feb. Image credit: Grace Baptist Church
“My advice is that (live-streaming) is a good fallback measure in times like this but relationships and connections have to be made in person. Say what you will about technology—it can supplement but it cannot substitute person-to-person interactions and contact. I feel that this is a stop-gap but it’s not something we would settle into as the norm,” Low shared.
So granted, for now, as long as precautions are being made in places of worship, live-streaming is still just a fallback plan. It is definitely a blessing if a devotee is quarantined or home-staying, thank God for that.
What I would suggest however, is for theatrical, exhibition and event organizers to seriously consider live-streaming or digital forms as a viable subscription/paid-access-only alternative. Who knows? It could open new forms of access and revenue as long as measures are in place to protect the stream.
COPROPHOBIC NEEDS (kiasai): SERVICES THAT LET ME DO MY BUSINESS QUICKLY
When Singaporeans were stockpiling toilet paper on February 7 and 8, I thought it was due to our fear of crap getting in the way of us being able to do more pressing matters (you know, I need to save lives but my-body-forcing-me-to-take-a-crap suddenly gets in my way). Some said it was due to supply shortage rumours from China, or our first-world need for a minimum standard of living, or a recurrent commodity stockpile in times of disaster since our Great Grand Ah Kong days. Whatever the reasons, I now know it’s not just a Singaporean thing. As the scourge of Covid-19 spreads into other countries, panic-buyers in the US, Australia and Hong Kong have swept up (and tussled over) carts of rolls from supermarket shelves.
Vinda International Holdings, the world’s second largest manufacturer of toilet paper, saw its stock price surged from HKD14 to HKD21 in less than two months. Kimberly-Clark, the world’s largest with brands like Scott, Kleenex and KleenGuard, is holding fine in the stock market, and is expected to announce better than expected quarterly results in 2020.
As the saying goes, ‘when you gotta go, you gotta go’ and the enterprises that satisfy this need quickly will somehow emerge unscathed by the outbreak.
TOTAL RESILIENCE THE GITLAB WAY
Interestingly, one enterprise which has mastered all forms of resilience is GitLab. The open core company develops different software for development lifecycles serving more than 100,000 organizations and 2,200 active contributors. It has a 3,000-page handbook and its central repository is its main bread-and-butter. In case you’re wondering, GitHub is a competitor.
“Remote is not a challenge to overcome. It’s a clear business advantage.”
–Victor, Product Manager, GitLab
GitLab’s all-remote work policy means it hires workers from all over the world instead of a central location. Flexible working hours are preferred over set working hours. Communication must be written down and recorded instead of verbally explained. Public sharing of information is preferred rather than on a need-to-know basis. Every document is accessible for editing by anyone rather than a top-down control. Asynchronous communication? Definitely. Interestingly, formal communication channels are preferred rather than informal ones.
Confused by how the company, valued at USD2.7 billion in 2019, does it? Watch this:
The question, of course, is whether it is possible for an all-remote work economy to extend across a country like Singapore. Not only do pockets of citizenry get better work-life balance, the reduction in fixed office facilities frees up land-scarce space for more communal and eco-centric infrastructure. It’s a bold concept, even without a virus threat.
ARE WE READY FOR ANOTHER WAVE?
So, from ordering groceries and electronics online, telemedicine, safety alerts, gaming and entertainment apps, video conferencing to self-upgrading, financial investing and spiritual enlightenment, it seems we do have services and infrastructure in place to keep us chugging along if forced to stay home long-term.
Social distancing will soon become a catchphrase here in Singapore, if the Covid-19 situation doesn’t ease up country-to-country. In South Korea, travellers are advised to refrain from going outdoors and avoid physical contact with others (use social media to communicate instead). Image credit: Seoul Metropolitan Government
In China, the public is advised to avoid dinner parties and public places. Image credit: China CDC
In China and South Korea—residents are already being advised to take a break from social life and adopt social distancing. As more countries report new cases and deaths, the term ‘social distancing’ will emerge as a key phrase in future government messaging. You’ll keep hearing it until your ears bleed.
Just two days ago, on 6 March, Singapore reported 13 new cases of Covid-19 – the highest daily jump since the outbreak started. The next day, on 7 March, 8 new cases emerged. We need to prepare ourselves if it gets worse. Singapore-based enterprises best be ready then, because if the situation worsens, the Singaporean need may be unprecedented on so many anxiety levels. Perhaps even greater than what we saw happened on the night of February 7.

Covid-19 Survey: Singaporeans Show Strong Trust in Govt, But Not As Willing to Help Each Other",Terry Ng,TRUE,TRUE
The Unity & Resilience Budgets Show Singapore’s True Colours,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-covid-19-2020-singapore-unity-resilience-budget/,2-Apr-20,"Indulge me in a post-Covid-19 fantasy.
It’s Sunday morning in Singapore. The sun is shining with the light of the most wanderlust-inducing Instagram filter. A husband decides to give his wife a mental health break by taking their four-year-old daughter out to the park. He sits on a bench, watching her play at a playground that’s absolutely infested with germs.
But no one breaks out the hand sanitiser and alcohol wipes. On this lovely virus-free morning, the only thing that matters is quality time between a father and daughter.
To complete this fantasy, the father decides to buy his daughter ice cream.
Should he buy from the ice cream uncle down the road or from a McDonald’s self-service kiosk?
On its surface, the father’s decision seems innocent enough. But what happens if everyone chooses McDonald’s over the ice cream uncle?
More money gets funneled into a multinational corporation and away from a local business. The ice cream uncle and the tissue auntie grow old, eventually fading from our collectively averted gaze and memory. The Golden Arches become a permanent fixture of Singapore’s landscape, much like MBS and Gardens by the Bay.
The personal touch. Do you want fries with that?
By now, you may have realised that this fantasy isn’t describing Singapore’s future, but what has already happened. Today, ice cream uncles are few and far between. Soon, they’ll disappear entirely.
This is the power of our economic choices. In our hyper capitalist and interconnected world, what we spend our money on today, is what we’ll eventually become as a society.
What the Unity + Resilience Budgets Tell Us About Singapore’s Values
In Singapore, nothing offers a better glimpse into a society’s values than government spending. After all, the government collects tax revenues from us through the tax system in the form of income tax and VATs, and redistributes this wealth to other priorities in a way that approximates the public interest.
The government also has the power to influence our behavior indirectly, by setting the rules and incentives that govern how businesses and consumers make decisions.
And similar to how a close brush with death might spark a complete reassessment of one’s life priorities, there’s nothing like the Covid-19 economic crisis to show us what a country truly values and how it chooses to express those priorities in the form of cold, hard cash.
1. Covid-19 Stimulus Part One: The Unity Budget (S$6.4 billion)
Covid-19 is a whole new beast, combining SARS on steroids with the complete economic devastation of the global financial crisis (hereafter GFC). At least during the GFC, restoring confidence in the financial markets allowed governments to slowly rebuild their economies. With Covid-19, the problem and its negative impacts doesn’t stop until we either discover a vaccine, or the virus decides it wants to stop.
When the MOF unveiled the Unity Budget on February 18, the situation in Singapore had not changed quite so drastically. The package contained the tried and tested methods favoured by policymakers: corporate tax cuts and rebates, plus an 8% wage offset through the Job Support Scheme. Yet even during this announcement, Singaporeans were already being primed for “additional measures” down the road.
Basically, the Unity Budget was like the Avengers assembling for the first time. Sure, S$6.4 billion is a lot of dough, but it all just seemed like one elaborate setup for a more expensive and highly anticipated sequel.
2. Covid-19 Stimulus Part Two: A New Resilience (S$48.4 billion)
Without rehashing the entire S$48.4 billion second stimulus in tedious detail, I must admit I was pleasantly surprised by the leadership and fiscal prudence on display during DPM Heng Swee Keat’s budget speech. PR move or not, credit must be given when politicians voluntarily take three-month pay cuts in a show of solidarity.
The immediate cash payouts to families and at-risk workers to help with groceries and bills was also a welcome sign. I even had to give the government props for their forward thinking measures for the self-employed and freelancers, even as the actual implementation of who will qualify remains to be seen.
That said, the resilience budget is far from perfect in two major and critical respects:
First, the actual incentives laid out in the resilience package overwhelmingly favours employers over employees; landlords over tenants.
To quote DPM Heng Swee Keat in his second budget speech:
“Employers getting a direct 25% payroll relief through the Jobs Support Scheme are strongly urged to do their part to hold onto their workers”.
Landlords getting property tax rebates of up to 100% in certain sectors are “highly recommended to do their part to pass on the savings to their tenants”.
See the problem here? Which party is getting direct economic relief and which one is left “hoping” that the right thing will be done? I can understand employers cheering after the budget speech, but it was perplexing to watch everyday Singaporeans acting as if their jobs had just been saved.
It’s naive to count on multinational corporations to show social responsibility and national solidarity. Last I checked, these companies do not have a fiduciary responsibility to “urgings” and “recommendations”. If this downturn lasts longer than their revenue projections and spreadsheets, Singaporeans will be laid off and tenants will be turned out.
When combined with government measures that have shut down ‘non essential’ entertainment venues until April 30 (inexplicably, malls stay open), not including rental relief in the stimulus package for small tenants is like sending them into battle against Thanos, who has all six Infinity Stones. One snap of the fingers and half of Singapore’s small businesses instantly turn to ash.
I will, however, acknowledge that even as I write this, steps are being taken in the right direction. Next week, the government is expected to announce rent deferment measures for commercial tenants, placing restrictions on landlords from terminating leases due to Covid-19. But until that announcement is made, the devil is in the details. For example, a six month rent deferment for tenants, if payable in full on the seventh month, would only serve to preserve cash flow for stronger chains/players while delaying the inevitable for small, often family-run businesses.
Second, migrant workers are notably left out of the resilience budget.
Look, I get it: Singapore First. But I’m not talking about the foreign workers making absurd sums of money at Google and Facebook. I’m talking about the ones who left their families to come to Singapore to take jobs most Singaporeans refuse to do. These workers pay taxes into the system. At some point, they’ve likely waited on Singaporean families hand and foot or built the public works we’ve all come to depend on.
Some Singaporeans seem to act as if this is a zero sum game; like we’ve already reached a point where there’s only enough ventilators to save ourselves. In reality, it wouldn’t take much to include lower income migrant workers in the existing Covid-19 Support Grant, which currently provides cash grants of $S800 a month for 3 months for lower and middle income Singaporeans who will lose, or have already lost, their jobs to Covid-19.
Without including at least some migrant worker protection in this budget, the Singapore government is unwittingly offering up some twisted incentives for employers. On one hand, they’ve made Singaporean and PR salaries cheaper and more competitive through the Job Support Scheme, increasing the likelihood of migrant workers being replaced. On the other hand, they provide no additional safety net for the most vulnerable foreign workers.
With these measures, Singapore is essentially showing these workers the door.
Are we sure we want to cast a vital segment of Singapore’s population adrift without lifeboats? If so, what does that say about Singapore as a society?
What Kind Of Singapore Will Emerge After Covid-19?
Singapore is a city state that has been accused of being ‘soulless’ before, an opinion I don’t personally share (yet). But moving forward, the stakes couldn’t be higher. Will Covid-19 further exacerbate social inequality and destroy intangible aspects of local culture? Are we all just going to cross our fingers and hope that employers and landlords will do the right thing? Are the jobs held by Singaporeans and PRs truly the only ones worth saving?
In the end, it really is up to Singaporeans. In 2019, consumers outspent the government by roughly 2.5 times as a percentage of national GDP. Every economic decision Singaporeans make today has an impact on our collective future.
But in order to create the Singapore we want, mere awareness of these life-or-death tradeoffs isn’t enough. They must be translated into economic action in the form of dollars spent; actions that are a closer reflection of the values we want to embody.
Perhaps this crisis might be Singapore’s once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to address structural challenges in society like poverty and inequality, or the plight of the voiceless and most vulnerable.
To echo the glass-half-full optimism of the writer Charles Bukowski: “If you’re losing your soul and you know it, then you’ve still got a soul left to lose.”

8 More Headlines You Missed Because of Covid-19",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
“The ministerial committee dropped the ball”: Dr Paul Tambyah On The Elections and Covid-19,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-ge-2020-paul-tambyah/,5-Jul-20,"All images courtesy of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP) unless otherwise stated.
Disclaimer: RICE does not endorse or support any political party in Singapore.
Dr Paul Tambyah is Chairman of the Singapore Democratic Party (SDP), President of International Society of Infectious Diseases, and Professor at the National University of Singapore’s Department of Medicine. Prior to joining the SDP, he was also a founding member of MARUAH, a human rights organisation based in Singapore.
In this year’s General Elections, Dr Tambyah is running in Bukit Panjang SMC.
Last week, RICE conducted a Zoom interview with Dr Tambyah. It has been lightly edited for length and clarity, with additional context, clarifications, and responses provided in the endnotes.
Why did you decide to enter politics?
I’ve been involved in public healthcare for a very long time. Singapore has some of the best doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in the world. And we have access to really good technologies. The trouble is, the healthcare financing system is all messed up.
I used to give feedback to the ministry. In fact, I joined Facebook because you could give feedback to the Ministry of Health (MOH) on their Facebook page. But you couldn’t give feedback on their website [when they first set it up]. Khaw Boon Wan used to tell people that I was the first doctor to give him feedback!
I’m also there at every town hall meeting that the ministry organises. It’s quite funny. Sometimes when they’re presenting something to senior doctors, they’ll present it, and then they’ll say, “Any questions?” Usually nobody asks. So the Minister or Perm Sec will go, “Paul Tambyah, do you have questions?” And then I will stand up and ask a question. Only after that people will start to ask questions too.
That’s all well and good. But, frankly, all they do is they listen very politely and they ignore you. And they do what they’re going to do anyway. So I realised that the only place where the minister actually has to answer you is in parliament.
Can you elaborate on your claim that the healthcare financing system is “all messed up”?
Unlike countries like Korea and Taiwan, which adopt the universal healthcare system, we seem to have followed the American model, which views healthcare as a for-profit-driven industry. It’s like a business as opposed to a basic service.
Before the mid-1980s, Singapore had a single-payer healthcare system run by the Ministry of Health, which operated all the public hospitals. When you went to a polyclinic, you paid $1 [$2.33 in 2019] for a consultation. You went to a hospital, you paid $5 [$11.65] for a consultation.
There was no longer a universal single-payer healthcare system after Alexandra Hospital became restructured. So what they did was they converted it into MOH Holdings. You’ve got the different clusters, you’ve got all these things where there are different companies—they’re government-owned companies. But it’s not the same as a government ministry.[1]
In fact, I have a parking label from I think 1993, which says, Ministry Of Health, Alexandra Hospital. And I keep it because, to me, that’s a memorabilia of Singapore’s outstanding universal healthcare system that died.
Unfortunately, Singapore seems determined to repeat every mistake of US healthcare in the last 20 years. That’s a big problem.[2]
You were recently appointed as the president of the International Society of Infectious Diseases. What are your thoughts on how Singapore has handled the Covid-19 pandemic?
To me, the big difference between the response to SARS and the response to Covid has been that in SARS, the medical task force was front and centre, and the ministerial task force was in the background. Whereas with Covid, it’s the ministerial task force that’s in front, and the medical task force is behind the scenes.
The ability to let professionals run the show and let the politicians make the policy calls is what happened with SARS. I think that’s part of the reason why SARS was successfully handled and this one was not so successful.[3]
Actually, I think that in February, the way Singapore handled the epidemic was outstanding. We did very detailed contact tracing, even among the migrant workers. For example, there was a cluster of workers at Seletar Aerospace. What MOH did was they quarantined all the workers’ contacts, they did tracing, they did isolation, and that outbreak ended with five people.
That didn’t happen in March. To this day, we don’t know why.
Those of us in the opposition think that the ministerial committee dropped the ball because they started thinking about holding an early election. We might be wrong. But that’s the appearance of it: that they didn’t do the same things in March that they did in February.
If they had done in March what they did in February, when the first few cases happened in the migrant worker dormitories, there’s no reason why it wouldn’t have worked. Instead of having 40,000 people infected, we may have had a couple thousand.[4]
Screenshot of SDP's AMA on Reddit.
What are your thoughts on the SDP being known, whether fairly or unfairly, as the “Chee Soon Juan party”?
That’s the nature of politics in Asia, not just in Singapore. During the last general election, it was very obvious that the PAP was selling itself as the Lee Kuan Yew party. That’s the way it is.
But there are a diversity of views within the SDP. Soon Juan can get outvoted in a CEC (Central Executive Committee) meeting. So, while he is obviously a significant personality and he’s been with the party for a really long time, there are others who have been in the party just as long as he has. They may not have as strong a personality or be as well known. But internally, they have just as much of a say.[5]
Does SDP have any plans to rebrand itself beyond Chee Soon Juan?
We have tried. I don’t think Soon Juan was present at any of the launches for the policy papers. We’ve been pushing the personal Facebook pages [of other SDP members]. We’ve been doing stuff like that.
But nobody bothers to report them: the mainstream media, especially, has a one-track mind.
Is this a symptom of the control the government has over the media in Singapore?
Definitely. You see, the media is familiar with Chee Soon Juan. They know when to drag out the smears, dredge out things that happened 30 years ago. It’s an easy approach for them if they can just do that. That’s unfortunately the way this thing works.
We think the NPPA (Newspapers and Printing Presses Act) should be repealed. The reality is, we think that Singaporeans are pretty mature. Even during the POFMA debate it was quite clear that if something is obviously false, it doesn’t have legs.
Even the CSIs [“Crime Scene Investigation”; internet terminology for digging up the background of an individual] that are being done right now for some of the candidates. Stuff that is real gets through; stuff that is not true gets shut down.
Screenshot of SDP's AMA on Reddit.
SDP has a reputation for being the most socially progressive party in Singapore. So I was disappointed to notice the omission of LGBTQ issues in your manifesto, as well as the lack of answers to questions about LGBTQ rights during the AMA you and Alfred carried out on Reddit.
The main reason is that the focus of this election is economic. This is not an ordinary election. It’s being held in the middle of a pandemic. We want to have a razor-sharp focus.
It’s not that other issues are less important. Singapore politics are such that the PAP will pick on some really tiny thing and blow it up and make you lose your perspective. They love to divide and rule.
That said, the SDP has been very consistent in its stand on social justice issues and we are not going to change.[6] The reality is, we need to address the super pressing issues first. And then one by one … We promise we will deal with the social issues as they come along the way.
Can I understand from what you said that SDP is for the repealing of 377A and equality of LGBTQ people in Singapore?
Again, we don’t want to go into this, because it’s going to get picked up and … our [LGBTQ] friends are just going to be used as a political football. I don’t think’s fair to anyone, least of all people who are affected by the legislation.[7]
Right now our focus is on the 4Y1N. And, like I said, the SDP has been a consistent party and we will deal with every issue as they come.
What do you mean when you say that the “PAP loves to divide and rule”?
For example, that’s why they implemented this Reserved Presidency. Nobody I know in the Malay community … has said we need a Malay president. The Malay community talks about having Malays in the air force, the navy, the commandos. There are so many highly qualified Malay individuals who don’t seem to get selected for the air force, navy, or commandos. And then the PAP turns around and says we need a Malay president. Trying to divide the population is just not helpful.
With your focus on economic issues this election, how does the SDP plan to appeal to younger voters, who may be more interested in social justice issues?
I hate to say this, but the social justice issues are pressing for middle class younger people. The average younger person is worried about getting a job. There are so many of the graduates we meet, even from the universities, who are looking at things in the gig economy, where there’s no job security, where there’s no benefits.
And so this is where the idea of retrenchment insurance, where you have money in your pocket, where you can get together with a bunch of people and form a small business … I think it’s time that we start doing something like that.[8]
Given its emphasis on prioritising the livelihood of Singaporeans, how can the SDP avoid veering into nationalism and xenophobia, such as what is happening with Trump and Brexit?
These waves of nationalism, they come and go. A lot of them are driven by economic factors, by restructuring. And the thing about the UK and US, there are huge corporate interests who are also playing a part in it.
The answer is not less democracy, but more. That’s why we need the independent media calling out the people who are funding the Brexit campaign or Donald Trump. During the Watergate scandal—what did they say?— “follow the money”. By tracing the trail you find out who are the people who profit from some of these so-called nationalism and things like that.
One last question: which international politicians do you admire?
I totally admire Nelson Mandela. And the thing I admire the most about Nelson Mandela is not his perseverance or his so-called forgiveness, but the fact that he was willing to give up power. He became president. After his term in office was done, he gave up power and started looking after grandchildren. That’s what a politician needs to do.
When you can do that, it means the institutions are strong.
So many other leaders in Asia clung on to power for way too long. But Mandela recognised that, for the good of the country, he had to step down. He had to let the process take place.
Endnotes
[1]: In Affordable Excellence: The Singapore Healthcare Story, the scientist and businessman William A. Haseltine writes: “A sweeping reform started in the 1980s, when the government embarked upon the restructuring of its public hospitals, giving them greater autonomy to function more like private hospitals than public institutions under a central control.”
According to Associate Professor of History Michael Barr, these reforms, started in 1984, also involved “the government’s reduc[tion] of ‘subsidies’ to hospitals and polyclinics … followed by overt government efforts to encourage the establishment of private hospitals, and across-the-board increases in hospital fees.”
[2]: The World Health Organization ranks Singapore’s healthcare system as the 6th best in the world, The Economist Intelligence Unit ranks it 2nd, and Bloomberg 1st.
However, in a 2018 article, Today reported that our healthcare system “falls behind most countries when it comes to providing access to healthcare due to shortages of hospital beds and skilled healthcare professionals.”
A 2013 case study published by the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy states that “the main deficiencies of the healthcare financing system are its poor coverage in terms of the types of people and the types of health risks that it covers. Healthcare may be unaffordable, especially if patients face catastrophic medical bills. The system also falls short in giving Singaporeans ‘peace of mind’.” (Though, having been written in 2013, it may not reflect more current financing schemes like MediShield Life.)
Associate Professor Barr also notes that “It is at the very ordinary level of affordability and availability that the system is facing the most strain. This affects the poor (especially the female elderly poor), the middle class and anyone with a serious chronic illness, meaning that everyone except the very wealthy … feels considerable vulnerability.”
Barr concludes: “one is left wondering if the key to the system is merely the government’s monopoly of information and its authoritarian control of political discourses. It seems highly likely that if one could examine the Singapore health system from the inside, one would find a fairly ordinary health system with some strong points and many weaknesses.”
[3]: A 2012 paper entitled “Combating SARS and H1N1: insights and lessons from Singapore’s public health control measures” mentions that the Ministry of Health “initiated a SARS taskforce to look into the mysterious strain.” It was following the findings of this taskforce that “the Singaporean government swiftly declared SARS a notifiable disease under the IDA”.
Professor Chee Yam Cheng, an editorial board member of the Singapore Medical Association, explains that this SARS task force “compris[ed] senior staff (doctors and administrators) of public hospitals … Later, the private hospital officials were also invited to sit in. It also had various representatives from WHO and from CDC. Chief of Medical Corps, Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) was also represented.”
[4]: On 5 July, National Development Minister Lawrence Wong came out to call Dr Tambyah’s accusation “baseless and false”, saying that “[medical professional] are an integral part of the team, we involve them in all our deliberations, and every time Mr Gan Kim Yong and I hold the press conferences we have the director of medical services (Associate Professor Kenneth Mak) with us.”
Factually, the government-run fact-checking site, also asserted that “The [Covid-19] Multi-Ministry Taskforce [is] led by the Ministers and staffed by senior public officials and medical professionals.”
[5]: At this point of our conversation, Dr Tambyah abruptly stops talking, picks up his phone, and excuses himself: “Give me one second. I’m going to mute myself.”
My curiosity is piqued. Could it be Chee Soon Juan updating him on election strategy? A foreign doctor asking his advice on tackling a Covid-19 crisis? The dean of NUS seeking his counsel on education policy?
Dr Tambyah returns to the call. Smiling sheepishly, he says, “Sorry, that was my mum.”
[6]: According to The Singapore LGBTQ Encyclopaedia, both Dr Paul Tambyah and Dr Chee Soon Juan support the repeal of Section 377A and equal rights for the LGBTQ community. For instance, Dr Chee has attended Pink Dot and IndigNation events. He also defended Vincent Wijeysingha against scurrilous attacks on his sexuality. As for Dr Tambyah, he said in an interview that “The SDP has been very clear about this–that 377A should be repealed”.
However, SDP’s 2007 article that unequivocally stated their support of repealing Section 377A is no longer on their website; only a version archived by a third-party website can be accessed.
[7]: During the 2011 elections, Vincent Wijeysingha, who was then an SDP candidate for the Holland-Bukit Timah GRC, was accused by the PAP team, led by Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, of “suppressing” a video that would “raise some awkward questions” about a possible “gay agenda”. In 2013, Wijeysingha made history by being the first Singaporean politician to officially come out as openly gay.
The SDP’s relative reticence about speaking up on LGBTQ issues this election, then, may be a consequence of the uncalled-for attacks they had to contend with during past elections.
[8]: The SDP’s 4Y1N campaign for the 2020 GE proposes providing retrenchment and retirement benefits. More intriguingly, it also plans to let “groups of 10 individuals to band together and receive their payouts in a lump sum as start-up capital to fund business proposals”, as my colleague writes. For more details on their 4Y1N campaign, see here or here.
This GE, we’re not just interested in the winners and losers. Join RICE as we satirise, over-analyse, and dissect everything from how we talk about politics and politicians to what we think we know about how Singaporeans vote.

Who’s Really Killing Singapore’s Bookstores?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-whos-really-killing-singapores-bookstores/,14-Sep-19,"All images by Zachary Tang and Cheryl Tang.
Kinokuniya. Times. MPH. Even Popular.
Bookstores in Singapore are closing at such a rate that, in a few decades, only the old will recognise these words. People will respond to them with the same nostalgic tilt of the head that mentions of DVDs or Heeren trigger in us today.
This is not a far-fetched dystopian future. Already, Kelly & Walsh, once the stalwart of bookshops in 20th-century Singapore—it was the first building on Raffles Place to be air-conditioned and was even visited by King Chulalongkorn in 1896—is all but forgotten.
And then there’s Page One. Harris. San Bookstore. Booktique.
Why are bookstores in Singapore in such dire straits? Are local conditions so hostile to books?
Or do Singaporeans just not read books?
As much as we might like to wallow in self-derogatory criticism about how the only culture Singaporeans have is of a bacterial nature, official statistics report otherwise. The National Library Board’s 2016 National Readings Habits Study found that almost 7 in 10 Singaporeans have read at least 1 book in the last 12 months—this is a higher proportion than in some Western European countries like Spain.
Industry players are likewise optimistic about reading habits here. Lim Li Kok, the founder and Managing Director of Asiapac Books, believes that more people are reading nowadays. While she acknowledges that online and social media form a large proportion of reading material, she also points out that books still have their value because “you need a printed document to stabilise the information”.
Moreover, book readers have a very different consumption pattern from other industries, Li Kok adds. It’s hard to produce a new cleansing liquid, for instance, so no one is constantly looking to make and buy a new type of soap. In contrast, readers are always looking to buy and read new books because each promises a different experience. A floral soap differs from a minty soap in scent and maybe sensation, but Lord of the Flies is completely distinct from the Lord of the Rings series.
Numbers certainly back her claim. Sales, revenues, and total number of publications across the world are still rising annually, despite detractors announcing the death of the book at the hands of social media, Netflix, or whatever new technological advancement.
In fact, Kenny Chan, senior store and merchandising director of Books Kinokuniya, says that the emergence of these new media has encouraged “new possibilities for bookselling, like YouTuber celebrity books, Instagram poets, game guides … [and streaming services highlight and sell books like] Handmaid’s Tale and Umbrella Academy”.
So far, so good. It seems that the bookselling situation in Singapore is thriving. So why are bookstores withering like our grass in a season of drought?
In conversation with Edmund Wee, founder and CEO of Epigram Books.
Admit it: you’ve walked into Kinokuniya, inhaled the smell of new books to rejuvenate your shriveled soul, eye-fucked the latest titles by Amanda Lee Koe or Margaret Atwood, only to return home to add them to your Book Depository cart.
The next day, when you read about MPH’s impending exit from the Singapore market, you beat your breast, wail, and write a moving eulogy about the inexplicable death of bookstores in Singapore.
I know you do this because I do it too.
Satirical self-incrimination aside, e-commerce—largely Amazon and its subsidiary, Book Depository—is cited as one of the biggest threats to bookstores in Singapore.
As Li Kok herself gushes, “They give you very good discounts … and you can buy at any time. At midnight if I suddenly wake up at 3 AM and dream of a book, I just click, and they will send it to me in 1 week.”
How can a conventional bookstore compete against such price and convenience? Realistically speaking, they can’t. At least not on these terms.
For one, brick-and-mortar bookstores have a corporeal body, unlike the ghostly existence of Amazon. By this I simply mean that Amazon does not need to pay rent at a prime area in Singapore—they can have a warehouse or office “at Woodlands, Changi, even in Malaysia, where they pay 1 ringgit per square foot for rental,” as Li Kok puts it, exaggerating for effect.
Everyone agrees this is the single most devastating cause of bookstores’ closures. Edmund Wee, founder and CEO of Epigram Books, says, “It’s not that Singaporeans don’t want to buy books. Bookshops are all closing because of the expensive rent.”
The manager of Asiapac Books, Chong Lingying, lays it out more plainly: “Everyone paying rent is dying.”
Chong Lingying and Lim Li Kok, manager and founder of Asiapac Books, respectively.
If Amazon were selling its books at the same price as local bookstores, the problem might not be so acute. But exacerbating it is the fact that Amazon’s prices are a lot cheaper than those in physical stores. For example, the Penguin Great Expectations is a whole $5 or 30% cheaper if you buy it from Book Depository instead of Kinokuniya.
Still, rent alone can’t explain the shocking discrepancy in price.
Lingying elaborates, “Publishers sell the same book at different prices in different markets. What Amazon can do is they buy books from the cheapest place, usually India, and sell it all over the world.”
Such a procurement strategy has led to the strange situation in which “international publishers in Singapore can actually find their book online on Amazon for cheaper than their staff rate”.
It’s not quite the same, but I imagine it must feel like someone breaking into your house and selling the cookies you’ve baked for your friends.
When faced with a nefarious cookie thief, what do you do? You try to nab the thief.
What if the thief has trained in a secret ninja school? Then you secure your house.
I might be pushing this terrible analogy too far—but from what I’ve gleaned from publishers, it seems that we are, paradoxically, throwing our doors wide open and teaching our dog to welcome said cookie thief.
In other words: our economic policies encourage the sort of barely legal market-loophole exploitation in which Amazon engages, to the detriment of our local bookstores.
From our Economics 101 classes, we all know that protectionism is bad. Just look at how the tariffs that the United States and China are lobbing at each other have depressed the international economy. On the other hand, free trade is good. It encourages competition, which in turn increases efficiency and lowers prices; the market, as a whole, benefits.
And where else is free trade more venerated, to an almost cult-like status, than export-oriented Singapore? Consumer goods from all over the world constantly flow in and out through our borders.
But some books we find on the shelves of bookstores, according to Edmund, “have no right to be sold here”.
“Books have territorial rights. If I publish an author, I have the Singapore or world right. In the case of America, most of them only have US right, so the book cannot be sold in Singapore. But because Singapore signed a free trade agreement, we have an open market, and anybody can bring in anything here.”
So you know how, in Kinokuniya , you’re sometimes confronted by two equally alluring but different covers of the same book? That’s because one is usually the US edition (e.g. published by Simon & Schuster) and the other the UK edition (e.g. Penguin). These migrant books are known as parallel imports or grey products because of their murky copyright and intellectual property statuses in international markets.
Edmund elaborates: “Technically, if they want to sell their book, they have to look for a Singapore publisher. They have to come to me and say, ‘Can you publish my book for Singapore?’”
But because of our FTA and open market, parallel imports are allowed. Local publishers are thus deprived of an enormous source of potential business. This has a knock-on effect on bookstores, because their profit margins on parallel imports are typically lower than books that are published locally, which partly explains why it’s becoming more difficult to survive as a bookstore in Singapore.
Grassroots Book Room.
The most damaging factor to bookstores, however, is perhaps not Amazon, or parallel imports, but government-enacted economic policies that reduce the profit of bookstores to a “razor thin” margin, as Kenny shares.
One of them is our perennially favourite topic: the Goods and Service Tax (GST).
“In most countries, if you buy books, you don’t have to pay GST. In Singapore you have to pay GST. Singapore’s a minority. It’s something that must be recognised by the policy makers because their policies have killed the book industry as much as real estate,” explains Lingying.
Indeed, a study by the International Publishers Association states that, “Globally, special VAT/GST/Sales Tax treatment for publications is the norm, not the exception, among the countries with VAT/GST/Sales Tax regimes. The large majority (84%) of the countries surveyed, established a favourable tax regime for paper books.”
For instance, Japan’s standard sales tax rate is 5%, but books are entirely exempted from tax. The price reduction is even more dramatic in European countries. Norway’s 25% tax does not apply to books, so books are, in effect, permanently 25% cheaper than they should have been.
Out of the 88 countries surveyed, only 13—including Singapore—do not have a reduced rate or tax exemption for books, putting us in the company of Bosnia, Yemen, Namibia, Peru …
As if that weren’t bad enough, section 34 of Singapore’s Competition Act prevents the bookselling association from fixing prices.
Lingying explains that because almost all books sold in Singapore are imported—which means their prices are subject to fluctuating currency exchange rates—“in the past, the Singapore Book Publishers Association used to set a standardised exchange rate for the book industry”.
“So that means Kino and MPH would sell the same book at the same price. But it didn’t kill competition—bookstores would compete in different ways.”
For example, Li Kok’s bookstore, which she ran from 1976 to 1987, offered a ‘buyback service’ to her customers, in which she helped readers resell their books and kept 20% of the proceedings.
“This extra service made us a very popular shop,” she recounts.
“But after they didn’t allow foreign exchange rate standardisation anymore,” Lingying continues, “One guy will sell at 13.90. The other guy will be like, ‘Oh shit I’m going to make losses here. But I’m going to sell it to you at 13.50.’ Then they start killing each other—they start having this kind of price discrepancy that leads to price competition.”
Li Kok adds: “When things are not controlled, the ones who got the cheapest gets all. It was a shock to us. When we had an association, one of the roles is that we standardise the exchange rate. After the law was enacted, if we discuss, we’re committing a crime. So we sit together and look at each other. The world has really changed.”
On paper, the lack of price fixing sounds great: a free market leads to competition and increased efficiency and lower prices, etc., etc., ad infinitum. In reality, the lack of control is precisely what is causing this chaotic market imbalance.
The book industry in other countries is highly regulated. Book prices are standardised—it’s why, at the back of any international edition of a book, you find that little box (noticeably absent on Singapore-published books) stating the price of the book in various currencies. Bookstores are obligated to sell the books at these prices, no more no less.
In countries like Japan, bookstores are not even allowed to give discounts on books. Meanwhile in Singapore, we have shops that run eternal sales.
Edmund Wee against a wall of local books, many of which are published by his company.
Such measures to control the market might seem draconian or economically illiberal. But books aren’t just inert consumer goods. Books serve as cultural artifacts that reify the identity of a nation; they have positive externalities in their potential to generate “broader society benefits in the form of education, [literacy,] … higher rates of political participation,” and so on.
These reasons justify the National Arts Council’s dispensation of grants to authors, publishers, and arts organisations in general.
Why not grants for bookstores too, then?
This is precisely what Edmund asked: “I told the government, bookstores are closing down everywhere … But you cannot have a city without bookstores—bookstores are so critical to the cultural life of a nation … How about you subsidise me? I open a bookshop, but in order to justify your subsidy, I sell only Singapore books.”
“The government said no.”
Their response, Edmund explains, is that bookstores are a commercial entity, and the government cannot subsidise a private enterprise. But he is clearly frustrated when he points out that publishing and writing a book are also commercial—yet these acts are the recipients of governmental money.
“What is the logic here? … I believe the circle should be completed. You write, you publish, [but if] you can’t sell, then what’s the point?” he grumbles.
To be clear, booksellers and publishers aren’t looking for handouts or an easy way to make a quick buck. Edmund is quick to point out, “You don’t become a publisher [or bookseller] to make money … The grant keeps you in the black. Without the grant we’re in the red. And we’ve been in the red for the last few years. But we carry on. For as long as we can. Until we run out of money, then we close shop.”
Lingying, too, stresses that she hopes for policies that “help companies to regulate market conditions”, not things like sporadic GST vouchers.
Even Kenny, director of the biggest (and most beloved) international bookstore in Singapore, thinks that “there should be measures to help booksellers as they are essential community hubs to promote literacy, culture, and beyond. Without the bookshop, new readers cannot be converted into lifelong readers as bookshops have done and is doing in the past and present.”
Despite the difficulties in the book industry, Li Kok and Lingying are optimistic about its future.
At the same time, bookstores should not be allowed to remain anachronistic artifacts stuck in the past. Like transport companies, they need to evolve with changing market conditions, stepping in time with new consumer demands and technological advances.
It is something booksellers are aware of. As Kenny alludes to in his response, bookstores are “essential community hubs to promote literacy, culture and beyond”.
In other words, they aren’t simply—and cannot afford to remain—commercial spaces. Bookstores have to play a refreshed role to crawl out of the shadow of Amazon.
Li Kok concurs: “You want people to come [to bookstores] to network. So you organise, every Saturday, a workshop, a discussion. People need to meet people. You can buy a book at any time. Buying books is not the primary objective [of visitors to bookstores] any more … Bookshops have to play a role where they become a cultural meeting place, a cultural forum … Because Amazon will not promote your culture, your local writer.”
More importantly, “patrons will buy a book immediately after an event”.
“That’s what BooksActually and Huggs-Epigram are doing … they use it almost like an event space,” Lingying observes—and she’s right.
Edmund says that, at Huggs-Epigram, “Every day we have AIA. Artist or author in attendance. They come here, they sit here, they spend the whole day to do their own work. But you can talk to them, buy them a drink …”
And hopefully buy their book.
But let’s not be hypocrites. As consumers, we benefit from Amazon’s ruthlessness, from the free-market and anti-collusion conditions of Singapore’s economy. It is a buyer’s market, and we are the ones receiving said stolen cookies.
My own book-buying habits can be clearly demarcated into two phases:
Ardent Kinokuniya fan who signs up for their membership annually and looks forward to the 20% sale with bated breath;
My books all arrive in my mailbox in a Book Depository cardbox parcel.
Sure, we can try to change this habit and make a conscious effort to patronise brick-and-mortar bookstores, but it seems counterintuitive to encourage people to fork out more money to buy the same product. Even after hearing first-ear the difficulties that bookstores and publishers face, I’m not sure, honestly, how much my buying patterns will change, because I just don’t earn enough to justify spending $5 more on each book.
The only thing I’m certain of is that books will never die—naysayers have been predicting their death since the invention of the radio, the television, the smartphone …
What is less clear is the livelihood of our bookstores, which, at the moment, hangs by a thread.

What r/Singapore's Love for Sunrises and Sunsets Tells Us About the Singaporean Identity",Yeo Boon Ping,FALSE,TRUE
We Wrote a Poem About St. Patrick’s Day & Tell You Where to Score Ice-cold Pints of Guinness This March,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-wrote-poem-st-patricks-day-tell-score-pints-guinness-beer/,13-Mar-20,"St. Patrick’s Day has always been a big deal all around the world, but it has never really had the same significance in Singapore. So, for St. Patrick’s Day last year, Guinness celebrated every Singaporean with ‘Pat’ in their name like a Saint—whether you were a Patrick, a Patricia, a Patsy, a Patel, or even an exPat.

This year, Guinness is proud to honour St. Patrick’s Day with a giveaway of 10,000 Guinness draughts on-the-house. Between 1-31st March, pretty much anyone (within permitted drinking age of course) can sign up to redeem half-pints from participating bars—at least until all 10,000 run out (trust us, this happens faster than you think).
Meanwhile, to celebrate St. Patrick’s Day this month, we thought we’d give you something you can rhyme, dance, sing to and follow in a drumbeat. And who knows, you might even learn a thing or two about the saint.
Here goes:
For the life of me, I’ve always wondered, if Sir Alec Guinness drank Guinness,
To reference lightness, to conquer darkness, but alas, no photo as my witness,
St. Patrick’s Day falls on 17 March, worldwide and in Singapore,
I thought an inspiring image would be poignant, to rouse up some celebrant roar,
So I trawled the Internet with a purpose, with a jig, twirl and a finger rub,
Alas, I found Obama, drinking Guinness like some bloke in a pub.

So, my curiosity made me a-wondering, as I backtrack on history,
Like when did it start, how did it begin? Why is everyone green and tipsy?
Look here, in Washington DC, White House fountain’s all green on display,
If I have one pint too many, would a jaunt and a soak make my day?

In Chicago, their river’s all green! A 50-year-old secret, based on some veggie-based dye,
They’ve done this since 1962, by accident it seems, thanks to bad sewage and outcry.
That’s the Chicago river, covered in 5 gallons of safe vegetable-based powdered-and-then-diluted dye (no it’s not Photoshop). Image credit: FreeImages.com
So, to know St. Patrick’s Day like a pro, so you can revel in its festivities,
It’s best to know how it began, like a bon vivant citing poetry,
The man who started it all, was born 380 A.D.,
His name was Maewyn Succat, a Brit with Roman pedigree,
At sixteen, he was kidnapped, by Irish marauders from the sea,
Sold to an Irish chieftain, he served as a shepherd for free.
At twenty-two he escaped, went home to his pa in England,
He began having dreams and revelations, including seeing Jesus in the sun,
He became a Christian thereafter, studying in France and becoming a Deacon,
He later asked the Pope to send him to Ireland, there are things there he wanted done.
He was renamed Patritius, or Patrick, which meant father of his people,
In Ireland he became the Liberator, enduring hardship while being humble,
In just forty years, Patrick converted all of Ireland, to become devout Roman Catholics,
The green of St. Patrick became a symbol, of his beliefs and his schtick,
The colour is linked to shamrock, a three-leafed clover in Ireland,
Some say it represents the Trinity, but I’d say it’s an ingenious excuse for good fashion.

So now you know the history, let’s jump ahead into festivities,
A look back at how far we’ve come, a segue into the twenties,
Here then are some photos, of Singaporean revellers in green,
Celebrating, cheering and drinking Guinness, like they’re happy kings and queens.

Singapore sure knows how to party, especially when it comes with a drink,
Throughout the years, we’ve done parades and river races, like we’re Irishmen with a wink.
So this year, don’t forget to sign up for your Guinness Draught,
Redeem your half-pint from participating bars in the month of March,
Don the greens, put on a smile, bring your special cheer to these pubs,
Hurry now lads and ladies, before all 10,000 are chugged!

Growing Up With Vitiligo, I Was Bullied—Until I Became A Bully",Terry Ng,FALSE,TRUE
The Surreal Experience of Travelling In and Out of Singapore During Covid-19,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-surreal-experience-travelling-singapore-during-covid-19/,5-Aug-20,"Top Image: Eugenia Clara / Unsplash
Changi Airport looked like a ghost town.
Less than half a year ago, you could barely walk through the airport without bumping into someone you know. The non-stop human traffic was a testament to its reputation as one of the world’s best airports.
But when Rachel* stepped into the airport on 2 June, there were barely any flights, let alone people.
The once-bustling airport was now a quiet shadow of what it was just a few months ago. An entire terminal had been shut down, the ever-present line of taxis was now dismally short. The departure board, which once flickered every few seconds because there were so many flights, now had more empty grids than flight numbers.
Even the iconic indoor waterfall was out of bounds. The vortex had been shut off, the rhythmic sound of water crashing down conspicuously absent.
As Rachel walked around an eerily empty Jewel, the silence was deafening.
Looks kinda like a giant glass eye.
Singapore to China
The last time Rachel returned home was during Chinese New Year. Back then, Covid-19 was still being dismissed as ‘just a flu’ by the international community.
In late May, she spent days deliberating about whether she should take the risk and fly home to visit her family. A family emergency had cropped up, and it was best if she could head back to sort it out in person.
But flying would also mean an entire month of quarantine—two weeks in China, and another two weeks in Singapore, on the return leg—and would put her and her family at risk of catching Covid-19. Even worse, the Covid-19 situation was incredibly volatile; things were quite stable in China, but could easily worsen in the blink of an eye, and lockdown measures were constantly changing.
Her mum worked in a hospital back in China, and she’d heard firsthand the stories that came with dealing with the frontlines of a pandemic. As early as January, she dutifully wore a mask in public, and learnt how to fold it properly so that it wouldn’t get contaminated.
Even when Rachel flew back to Singapore after visiting her family prior to Chinese New Year, she entered a self-imposed quarantine. She did not want to take any risks.
This time, things were different.
Lockdown measures and quarantines were actually mandatory, and the chances of contracting and transmitting Covid-19 were that much higher.
What if Singapore decided to ban all travel into the country while she was still in China? What if her PR pass got revoked, and she could never come back? What if she caught Covid-19?
In the end, after multiple WeChat conversations and a lot of stress, Rachel mustered the courage and booked a round-trip from Singapore to Guangzhou.
Imagine wearing full PPE, marching through a fancy airport with pillars flanked by house plants.
Breathe in, breathe out. Rachel willed herself to calm down.
She had made the decision to go home, and she was now here, in the middle of an airport, about to step onto a metal contraption with hundreds of strangers. But despite the anticipation of getting to see her family again, nervousness still roared loud in her mind. Excitement and anxiety, two emotional extremes, were interwoven.
At first, everything felt strangely normal. Other travellers milled about leisurely, wearing just masks for protection and nothing else. It was a bit too cold, the space was a bit too big, and everything smelled a bit too clean—just like another day at Changi Airport, except slightly quieter.
But everything changed when she passed through customs. It was, in some twisted way, like stepping into the set of Contagion.
Passengers started pulling out protective gear from their carry-on bags, donning white gowns. Latex gloves snapped against wrists as people struggled to put them on. Some even put up their hoods, obscuring their entire face.
Rachel felt naked next to them.
She had brought an extra jacket—a white windbreaker of sorts which, if you tried really hard, somewhat resembled the top half of a PPE outfit—and latex gloves, but even that wasn’t enough to distract from how exposed she felt. Despite being fully covered from head to toe to fingertips, she couldn’t help but shrink into herself every time she walked past another person.
This writer suspects the interior designer spent a lot of time at Cherry.
The scene seemed strangely surreal: people dressed in identical white suits, walking through electronic gantries, set against a backdrop of carpeted floors, indoor plants, and neon pink signs asking if you were “ready to take off”.
She felt like an extra in a Black Mirror episode. At first glance, everything seemed perfectly in place—people going above and beyond safety measures, staff doing their best to make the travelling process comfortable. But, as she took in her surroundings, there was that slight sliver of dissonance, like something was just that tiny bit out of place.
Things just got weirder from there on out.
On the plane, she found a plastic bag full of snacks in her seat that looked like trash a previous passenger had left behind.
Eventually, she realised that it was Southern Airlines’ idea of an in-flight dining experience. They weren’t allowed to serve hot food because of enhanced safety and hygiene measures, and instead resorted to a bag of snacks not much different from what you’d pack for a school trip.
Strictly Dumpling gives this a 7/10.
The flight attendants, too, were all clad in PPE, their white gowns making them indistinguishable from passengers. She would have mistaken the attendant for another passenger, albeit one with nicer hair and makeup, if not for her overly enthusiastic “Welcome aboard!”. The attendants had scribbled all sorts of messages on their backs—their names, “Pikachu”, words of encouragement—in permanent marker.
This particular flight was packed, because flights to China were incredibly rare.
Rachel was seated next to an old lady who was very chatty for someone travelling during a pandemic. Every time she leaned over to Rachel, just a little bit too close, Rachel’s throat would tense up. When she gave Rachel a light pat on her shoulder, she almost felt her soul leave her body.
Fun times.
Just chilling on a plane in PPE.
She spent four agonising hours on a cramped plane.
Logically, she knew that air was being pumped out at regular intervals, and that being on a plane really didn’t pose that much more of a risk. But she still fought to calm herself down, paranoia biting away at her whenever she tried forcing herself to sleep.
After arriving in Guangzhou, passengers were ushered out to a holding area, where they waited their turn for registration, a swab test, and immigration.
Everyone sat far apart, fiddling with their phones. The air of anxiety and tension gradually simmered down into something more akin to boredom. Even though she desperately wanted to get out of the airport, to take in some fresh air, she told herself that strict measures like these—implementing a swab test for every single passenger—were better than no measures at all.
To make the wait a little bit easier, airport staff wheeled around a trolley with coke and light snacks, but people barely even glanced at it. No one wanted to share food with strangers at an airport during a pandemic.
Waiting their turn.
During the swab test, the staff shoved a hard stick up her nose and stuck another down her throat. She almost gagged.
But everything moved surprisingly fast. QR code this, QR code that, and she was in and out of the arrival hall. Everything had been streamlined for maximum efficiency.
Even the baggage area had been transformed—everyone’s suitcases had been arranged by colour so that people could leave the area quickly and avoid loitering around. Rachel found her suitcase in mere seconds.
Pantone, but make it luggage.
On the bus to the hotel, the staff chirped: “Hui jia la, xin ku la.”
You’ve come home, you’ve worked hard.
Everyone had indeed worked hard. All the passengers slumped in their seats, barely responsive despite the staff’s valiant enthusiasm. The flight arrived at 9pm, but it was almost 1am when they finally got on the bus.
Rachel, too, could feel fatigue bite at her bones. She knew the processes had been necessary—a second wave could come at any time, and incoming travellers like her carried the highest risk of starting a new Covid-19 cluster—but that didn’t make the four-hour wait any easier.
Like the airport, the process of checking into the hotel had been streamlined to prevent people from interacting with each other. Everything was done via QR Code: entering the hotel, paying your deposit, and so on.
Fancy~
The room was luxurious, with carpeted floors and the fluffy pillows—as expected of a four-star hotel. She’d forked out her own money for the quarantine.
She dropped her bags to the floor and finally relaxed.
On the table, there were a few documents that provided surprisingly comprehensive information about her quarantine order.
Aside from pragmatic concerns like what she was allowed and not allowed to do, the brochures also included information on mental health, and even hotline numbers you could call if you felt anxious or stressed during quarantine. There were even fitness suggestions (qigong, apparently, is soothing for the mind and body) and a list of Covid-19 symptoms to watch out for.
Her days passed by in a blur. Trapped in a fancy hotel room, she drowned herself by scrolling through Taobao, watching dramas, and ordering takeout.
But, looming in the background, was that ever-present sense of anxiety. She would only know for certain if she’d contracted Covid-19 when the results of the final swab test came back. Even then, simply moving from place to place already put her at higher risk of catching the virus.
At the end of her quarantine order, staff came to the hotel to do one last swab test, before she was finally released.
She took the high-speed rail from Guangzhou to her hometown, relieved that, at least for now, she was in the clear.
“Let’s enjoy the charms of traditional Chinese fitness exercises!” this one brochure claims. Scan the QR code to get your daily dose of qigong.
China to Singapore
The flight back was surprisingly empty—not that many people wanted to travel to Singapore, it seemed. The attendant that greeted her was dressed in her regular uniform, shirt pressed cleanly and hair neatly tied back in a bun.
Except for the requisite masks, it felt like everything had returned to 2019.
But when the plane was about to land, the attendants started to put on their PPE.
Gone were the prim, proper stewardesses with perfect hair and make-up. Out came the biohazard scene specialists, all geared up in white suits, walking down the aisles to make sure everyone had their seatbelts on.
A pretty empty plane.
Entering Singapore was weirdly normal compared to entering China.
Changi Airport felt almost exactly the same, other than a few temperature sensors to scan passengers and make sure no one was coming in with a high fever.
The only noticeable difference was that the automatic queues—those slightly intimidating gantries that required your thumbprint to open up—were closed.
Rachel walked up to the immigration officer, who told her to pull down her mask so that they could check her identity.
Maybe she looked nothing like her passport photo, or maybe the officer just had bad eyesight, but by the time she was done with immigration, her mask had been off for almost four minutes. She grimaced as she walked away, trying to forget that she had been standing around without a mask for so long.
The lovely smell of airport.
Surprisingly, there were still taxis idling outside the airport, quietly waiting for someone to request a ride.
Rachel flagged a taxi—incoming travellers weren’t allowed to take public transport, which was a good thing, because no one wanted to become Patient Zero for a brand new East-West Line cluster.
Even the knowledge that everyone from the same flight had dispersed, scattering into different Grabs and Comfort DelGros, was worrying.
She was glad to be back. Her heart and mind were settled for now, and she had the next two weeks to Do Nothing before becoming a full-fledged working adult. But she knew that her mind would not be fully at ease until she received the results of her final swab test, at the end of her quarantine order in Singapore.
As she stewed in her own anxiety, watching the Singapore skyline zoom by through tinted glass, she asked the driver: why do you still come to the airport? What if you catch Covid-19?
“Zhong jiu zhong la,” he replied, with all the nihilism of a kopitiam uncle. If I catch it, then I catch it.

Open For Business: The Road to Recovery",Yin Lin Tan,TRUE,TRUE
7 Malaysians Tell Us How They’ve Coped With Homesickness For the Past 7 Days,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-7-malaysians-homesickness-7-days-mco/,24-Mar-20,"When Malaysian Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin announced the country’s Movement Control Order (MCO) on a live broadcast on 16 March, many were confused. Malaysians who do their daily commute between Johor and Singapore and back wondered if the restriction applied to them. On 17 March, as the midnight deadline drew near, reality set in: stick it out in Singapore till 31 March to retain your job, or head back to Johor and risk losing it.
Not only that, online chatter among Singaporeans seemed divisive. A portion portrayed Malaysians as foreigners coming into ‘our country’ to take our bread-and-butter, earn income three times the rate of their home currency, all while jamming up the checkpoints at Tuas and the Causeway. Others, however, were encouraging, even opening their homes and living spaces for these displaced workers to stay, providing food and amenities.
We found 7 Malaysians who shared their stories with us:
“Malaysians in Malaysia must follow government rules to stay home. (If they don’t follow), the government may extend another 1 or 2 weeks. What Malaysia is doing now (with the Movement Control Order) is good for both countries. So Malaysians back home, please, please, stay at home,” pleads Abdul Mazlan*, 36, one of the seven we spoke to.
Mazlan has been stuck in Singapore since 18 March, and he can’t go home till the MCO is lifted on 31 March (now, it seems probable this will be extended). Mazlan works as a Senior Manager in an interior design firm in Singapore.
Since 2010, he’s taken the early morning and late evening bus to and from the Causeway every weekday. Now, his only connection to his home in Johor Bahru is his heart-wrenching video calls with his 8-year-old daughter, whom he misses dearly.
“Dear all Malaysian.. Please stay at home.. I have a little child missing me in Johor… Don’t let gov MALAYSIA ADD MORE 1 OR 2 week..” said Mazlan in a Facebook post on the first day the MCO came into effect. Mazlan gave RICE permission to share this screenshot.
“I’m currently staying at a hotel. My employer has provided me with lodging, food and all expenses, including money to buy clothes,” Mazlan tells us. For the past one week, Mazlan has been consuming Malay food like nasi padang at his hotel’s nearby mamak stalls. He did not want to reveal which hotel he is currently staying at.
“Singapore food is okay, but not as good compared to my wife’s cooking lah. But I can survive and live with local Singaporean food, of course,” he added, after some thought.
Is he concerned about some Singaporeans’ attitudes towards Malaysians coming over and “earning 3 times their local currency”?
“Some (of us) will agree, some won’t. For me, I work here because I need to learn and improve my aptitude and skills, due to international standards of industry here.”
Mazlan misses home but knows he needs to continue working if he wants to stay relevant in this economy and support his family.
Many of the other Malaysians I spoke to echo the same sentiments as Mazlan. They already miss home since day one. Eda Ambon* is also 36, and hails from the Malaysian state of Sarawak, although he now lives in Johor Bahru with his wife (34) and three children aged 1.5, 5, and 10-years-old.
Eda’s youngest (who is only 1.5 years old), cries whenever his father video-calls him. The translated caption reads: Video call … cry … cry whenever see (my) photo. Eda gave RICE permission to publish this.
Since 2005, Eda has been providing electrical maintenance services for coffee shops, factories, and renovation companies in Singapore. He studied at ITE MacPherson and now runs his business in both Singapore and Johor Bahru. I asked how he feels about his decision to choose between sticking it out in Singapore or staying in Johor Bahru.
“What can I do? I have to face it. I’ve never stayed in Singapore before,” he says. Yet Eda is appreciative of some of the kindness he’s seen from fellow Singaporeans. In a Facebook group he’s in, a Singaporean invited Eda to Blk 682C Woodlands on 22 March, as there was extra bungkus of Nasi Briyani left over from his son’s wedding. Eda was grateful.
“Terbaik …” he chimed, showing me the invitation (terbaik means very good in Malay).
Mohd Zain*, a 37-year-old technician in a pharmaceutical manufacturing firm also had nothing but praise for Singapore and his company (he declines to reveal its name).
“Living conditions are good, thanks to my company and the Singapore government. The food here is not so bad but I really miss my wife’s asam pedas.”
“Expenses here are a bit higher than staying in Malaysia. I am still searching for a self-serve laundry service, but finding my way around Singapore shouldn’t be a problem,” he told me. He’s currently staying at the Grand Park City Hall Hotel and has been working here for 6 years.
Zain too misses his wife and children. He has three daughters (aged 8 months and 10 and 11 years old) and an 8-year-old son (whom he proudly declares is really smart).
“Through this period, I have to be strong (for them). Hopefully, Malaysia will open its border as soon as possible. I don’t know how to describe (the border closing) … just move on and take all this as a challenge, always pray and wait for good news from our government.”
Mohd Zain’s plea to his Malaysian brothers, hoping that the MCO will only last till 31 March and no later. He couldn’t sleep after he crossed the border and posted this on 18 March 3.35am from his hotel room.
Another Malaysian whose company put him up in a hotel is Jin*. Jin used to commute between his home in Pasir Gudang, Johor and Singapore on his motorcycle. He’s worked in the maintenance department for one of Singapore’s primary transportation systems for five years.
Jin's hotel room
“The company I worked for provided me with just a room in the Novena area. For meals, I have to buy them at my own expense,” he told me in Mandarin.
25-years old and single, Jin isn’t feeling as homesick as Mazlan, Eda, or Zain.
“On the first day, the company provided us with McDonald’s dinner. I managed to wash my clothes once, so I have to repeat it again today. After five days, my colleagues and I found a cheap place nearer to the hotel to pack our meals, like for dinner. We usually eat near where we work, which is in the Kranji area.”
Jin’s usual meal in Singapore—packet rice with chicken and pork. “Compared to Singapore, the food is cheaper in some of the more kampung places in Malaysia. Singapore’s cheapest is S$2 chicken rice, but the portion is only fit for a child.”
“Expenses-wise, I’m not as bothered. The company has subsidies (from the Singapore government), and I’m staying at a hotel. It would be a greater annoyance to some workers who do not have allowances. Managing expenses is also going to be a challenge (for them).”
At the same time, Jin wishes the Malaysian government had done something else instead of closing the border. To him, it is difficult to regulate and control everyone’s movements on such a large scale.
“They’re not going to be able to control crowds. Instead, the Malaysian government should look into widespread disinfection and treatment. Now they are just trying to catch something here, then catch something there next. I don’t think it’s effective for a country so large.”
I asked Jin if he’s faced any backlash from Singaporeans questioning his choice to remain in Singapore instead of staying back in JB.
He tells me frankly, “It’s three times the wages in my home country. In this world, you look at me, I look at you. (Neither of us) have real experience about what each of us do. Everyone’s free to use words to say three times is good. But really, it’s just good enough to spend. Even now, going up and down the Causeway is the same. Because now, in Johor Bahru, the cost of living is almost the same as Singapore. Most of us locals are just living day by day.”
When the MCO came into effect, there was a mad scramble for accommodation. Many of the Malaysians I’ve spoken to are generally well taken care of by the Singapore companies they work for. They are grateful the companies were willing to make efforts to make calls, find and pay for lodging; some even helping with food and daily expenses. It makes them feel appreciated.
Some of this relief has also come through the Singapore government. On the evening of 17 March, just hours before Malaysia shut its borders, Singapore’s Manpower Ministry declared a S$50 allowance per worker per night for 14 nights, paid to affected firms, as a way to cover extra costs. This is on top of assisting displaced workers with finding short-term housing at hotels, dormitories, HDB flats, and private residences.
Because now, in Johor Bahru, the cost of living is almost the same as Singapore. Most of us locals are just living day by day.
However, not all Malaysians are so lucky to have companies providing shelter, let alone food and daily expenses. Some Malaysians I spoke to shared horror stories of sub-par standards of living despite having worked for their companies for years. We’ve seen the news of workers sleeping at Kranji MRT station, so what could be worse than that?
The issue isn’t just about not having a place to stay, but how some Singapore companies perceive their staff, and the welfare they provide when their staff needs them most.
Miss Chi*, 40, works as a contract staff providing customer service at a nursing home in Singapore. Her contract is renewed every two years. On the day the MCO came into effect, she left her young children in the care of her mother in Malaysia to rough it out for two weeks here. Little did she expect that the accommodation her company provided was going to be a nightmare.
Situated in Telok Kurau, she had to share a room with 5 other people. Not only that, her mattress was filled with bed bugs and the shower facility was filthy.
Miss Chi stays with 5 other people in the same room. Her sub-par lodging includes mattresses with bed bugs, roaches, unsanitary amenities, and bad ventilation. She’s been with the company for 4 years.
Miss Chi's lodging conditions
“Most of my full-time colleagues and other Malaysian friends got hotels. This is the worst I’ve seen so far. I feel really disappointed with our management. I have no words. I mean, yes, I may be a contract staff, but this shouldn’t be the way a company perceives and treats me.”
For daily food and transport money, Miss Chi relies on her brother, who’s working in a different company in Singapore. She is doing this as a matter of survival. It’s also for her children, and to repay her loans.
“I miss my kids. If I don’t work, there’s no money and I’ll be in a difficult situation.”
Another Malaysian who hasn’t been so fortunate is Mr. Tung*. Born in Batu Pahat, Malaysia, Tung is 35-years-old and operates a lorry crane for a construction firm. He was only given a place to stay, which he tells me is nothing more than a wooden board on a bed-frame (with fans and a common cabinet to be shared among those in the room).
This is a photo Tung shared with RICE. This was what he got when he arrived—no mattress, pillow—let alone expenses for food and travel. That’s it. He’s worked for the construction firm for two years. He decided to sleep in his lorry instead.
He has to pay for everything else (expenses, food, laundry, travel), himself.
“Everyone of us has to eat out,” he says in Mandarin, “I’ve been working for almost two years, and this is what I get.” Five days after I spoke to Tung, I checked on him again. He tells me he’s now sleeping in his lorry.
I could hear the resignation in his voice: “I’m the only one who got out (through the Causeway). The rest of my family is in Malaysia. People’s livelihood is already non-existent, so I’ve nothing more to say to that.”
Finally, 26-year-old Wadia* works as an inspection engineer in a factory here in Singapore. He stays in Gelang Patah with his wife and one-year-old baby girl. Two of his hobbies are riding his motorcycle and playing DOTA. These days, he can do neither.
“I’m sharing a hostel room with three others in Geylang right now. The company is giving me an additional S$20 a day for expenses. I’ve heard other companies (like my friend’s), giving S$50 a day and free hotel stay. For me, I’m paying for my own daily travels with my own savings. The time it takes for me to get to my workplace from Geylang is about 40 minutes.”
Wadia currently stays at a room-sharing hostel for four in Geylang. His company gives him an allowance of S$20 a day and it takes him 40 minutes to get to work by bus.
To feed himself without overspending the allowance money, he’s been snacking on just bread and water. “I cannot afford to buy food. I need to save now. This is because we don’t know when we can go back to Malaysia. At lunch, I buy my meal for S$3. Laundry here is around S$8. I might save up and go to my friend’s hotel to wash my clothes there instead.
“I’m also worried about my family and my baby girl back home. Everyday I call my wife, asking her to stay home and be safe. I explained to her the border has to be closed because Malaysia is afraid of whoever is working in Singapore having the virus and bringing it into the country. I also have to assure her to be careful about thieves, especially when they come by my family home. She needs to make sure she locks everything.”
Wadia during happier times four years ago.
Wadia is sad that he cannot go back to Malaysia. Before he left Johor, he prepared food and necessities to last a couple of weeks for his wife and baby girl.
“I just hope there is no increase in Covid-19 cases in Singapore, or Malaysia.”
When I asked Wadia what he hoped for in the days ahead, he remained pensive: “I think the Muslim Hari Raya celebrations might be cancelled this year. We don’t know when we can kill this virus. It’s hard to know over these next few days. The symptoms don’t show up and usually take more than a few days to see.”
And what about Singaporeans here? Have they been friendly to him, considering he’s earning Singapore dollars and sending money home to Malaysia?
For a 26-year-old, he has a broad perspective on things.
“I just tell myself to be positive. Take it positively. Many Singaporeans also come into Malaysia to shop. We don’t say anything about that. Just a few lah, not all of them are bad. Malaysia also has bad people. So far, the Singaporeans I’ve met here are friendly and okay. I have no complaints. I just want to focus on my job and get home to my family when the MCO is lifted.”

Dreams: Do They Exist For Singapore’s Migrant Workers and Normal (Technical) Students?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-sgiff-2019-dreams-exist-singapores-migrant-workers-normal-technical/,11-Nov-19,"Top image from ‘I Dream of Singapore’ by Lei Yuan Bin; Image credits: Looi Wan Ping / Tiger Tiger Pictures
Rice is the official media partner of Singapore International Film Festival 2019.
From time to time, I return to this particular quote by local playwright Alfian Sa’at: “If you care too much about Singapore, first it breaks your spirit, then it breaks your heart”.
From Singapore’s steadfast refusal to demolish the colonial statute of 377A and the continued discrimination of LGBTQ+ members, to the tacit acceptance of casual racism with the brownface saga amongst many more incidents—it can be incredibly disillusioning to be a part of Singapore. In a country that constantly emphasises its economic vulnerability during national day rallies and parliamentary sittings, Singapore’s urban landscape and its people are constantly subjected to the rhetoric of upgrading, change and improvement. Notions of cosmopolitanism, inclusivity and belonging are pegged to specific caveats and inhibitions, where equitable treatment is anything but the truth.
The stories of two such marginalised groups, migrant workers and Normal (Technical) students, are highlighted in Lei Yuan Bin’s I Dream of Singapore, and Yong Shu Ling’s and Lisa Teh’s Unteachable in the SGIFF Singapore Panorama Programme.
Image credits: Looi Wan Ping / Tiger Tiger Pictures
I Dream of Singapore is a quiet exposition about the lives of migrant workers in Singapore and where they come from, focusing particularly on the Bangladeshi worker, Md Feroz Al Mamun. There is a particular moment that succinctly encapsulates how migrant workers are treated in Singapore. A mass of migrant workers stands on the pedestrian walkway by Serangoon road outside AB Mohamed Restaurant, waiting to cross the road. Hundreds are kept at bay by a single security personnel clad in a neon-yellow vest, his body language languid and relaxed as he swings his left arm and rests his right hand on his hip. The shrill of a whistle sees the mass beginning to cross the road, bodies naked to the hawk-eyed gazes of a larger security entourage.
A migrant worker leaps over the green fence by the side of the road, only to immediately face the brunt of another security personnel shouting directly in his face. Cornered by another security personnel, the same worker is shoved back into the sidewalk carelessly, as if he weren’t a decent human-being like themselves. Overlooked and othered, migrant workers are only valued for their ability to take up “undesirable jobs” that Singaporeans are unwilling to partake in at low (and unfair) wages, dispensing their hard labour to build landmarks on extreme ends of the spectrum: dispensable and easily demolished, as well as the next jewels of Singapore.
At the same time, Feroz has a 15 cm wound on his belly, a souvenir from his day job at the construction site. Denied “proper medical treatment” by his employer, the country Singaporeans proudly call home is built on the back-breaking labour and efforts of Feroz and many others. Yet, they are still treated with a lack of human-rights and derision—not even deserving of proper food necessary to nourish their labouring bodies. Recently, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted how the Changi Jewel epitomized “dream[ing] boldly” for Singapore, being a symbol of bold dreams. But these very dreams of a nation are supported by the individual dreams of migrant workers to attain a better future for themselves and their families back home.
Image credits: Looi Wan Ping / Tiger Tiger Pictures
If the value of migrant workers (in the eyes of Singapore) stems from the possibility to extract and exploit a much needed but severely underappreciated labour power from their naked bodies, Normal (Technical) students in contrast are almost seen as hindrances not worth helping. Unteachable focuses on an experimental teaching project introduced to Normal (Technical) students from Shuqun Secondary School.
During an internal meeting within the department of mathematics, the head of department states how the prospect of sacrificing “family time” to put in the extra effort to help out these Normal technical students is simply “not worth it”, thurs preferring traditional teaching methods. Embedded within such a statement is an almost quantitative application of a cost-benefit analysis, with the students being deemed as dispensable units as opposed to actual living beings with futures ahead of them. There also seems to be a thinly veiled insinuation that the children of these teachers are perhaps more important, warranting greater attention as opposed to their own students.
Shuqun secondary school subscribes to different mantras: from “Touching Hearts, Inspiring Learning” to “Dare to Soar to Greater Heights” and “An inviting school that brings out the Best in everyone” that are splayed across the school building. Yet, perhaps such mantras are less aspirational than perfunctory and performative in masking over the realities within the physical school compound.
At the same time, whilst schools seem reluctant to help out students in need, messages of high achievement are still continuously drilled into the students’ heads as they are constantly pressured to achieve good grades. Prior to the end-of-year mathematics examination, a teacher proclaims to the class “I expect nothing less than a distinction from everyone”. Another exchange, rather amusing, goes along the lines of:
Teacher: “You will do well right?”
Student: “No.”
Teacher: “Well, you’ll try your best right?”
Student: “Yes.”
With the exception of this particular student subverting the common expectation of good grades foisted on every child in the Singaporean education system, what is scarier is the normalisation of good grades as the standard to evaluate and judge our students. Being fixated only with the final results, we almost disregard the immense value of the learning process and the effort put in by the students. We seem to forget these Secondary two students are barely 14, placing immense pressures on them to achieve “good grades”. Indeed, certain forms of knowledge are privileged over others, regardless of whether their life aspirations match-up with the skills acquired.
The main character, Damian, expresses his earnest desire to be a chef. An understanding of surds and indices will not teach him to master cooking a bowl of say, prawn noodles. And yet, he valiantly struggles to grasp these mathematical concepts of basic algebra.
These fixations, however, gloss over the humanness of these individuals. Both films delineate the day to day lives of their subjects outside of their associated traditional spaces (work and school) all over Singapore. In Unteachable, Damian celebrates his birthday with his family by barbecuing at the BBQ pit, growing excited as he is gifted a bicycle as a birthday present. Jamie and Tenisha, two of Damian’s classmates, express a desire to become singers, with Tenisha exclaiming that “music is [her] everything”
Despite these dreams, their growing years are punctuated by an anxiety to constantly climb the ladder because their grades in Singapore are “almost the only thing that matters”. Damian recounts how he “cried” upon receiving his PSLE results when he was 12, expressing how he had “disappointed his parents”. Tina, a friend of Jamie and Tenisha, notes how the jobs available to N-Level qualifications “pay quite low” in an environment like Singapore, where education functions as a tool for social stratification.
Meanwhile in Lei’s film, migrant workers are seen visiting and taking photos of the Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands, two landmarks built on their very backs for everyone (i.e local Singaporeans and tourists) but themselves. In the Dayspace of Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), a non-profit organisation pushing for improved conditions for low-income workers, a small group of migrant workers have their eyes fixated on an LCD TV, watching the FIFA World Cup together.
In a secondary school, a migrant worker delivers a talk to a class of Singaporean students. Holding a Bachelor of Arts from the Bangladesh National University, he is also a poet back home. And yet migrant workers are subject to an odd flattening of identities as he is asked—“You are migrant worker right … How come migrant workers can write poetry?”—as if migrant workers can only be one or the other. Singapore can only see migrant workers for the cheap labour they provide, forgetting how these are human beings with families back home and identities outside of work.

This particular episode reminds me of a feature done by Channel News Asia on another migrant worker, Md Mukul Hossine. Having published an anthology of poems in Singapore, Mukul is portrayed in a disparaging manner for chasing his passion for poetry as opposed to working in construction — a field Mukul did not even expect to be working in upon his arrival. This echoes with many prior cases where migrant workers are duped into thinking that they will be doing something else. Chasing passions, something we tell our kids and citizens all the time, is not accessible to migrant workers. At the same time, streaming also cuts off the opportunity to pursue certain passions, as Normal (Technical) students are funneled directly into Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges that already restrict some pathways of progression.
In a country that chooses to celebrate past figures that had literally stolen and pillaged our lands for self-gain and opts to marginalise and push down on members of our community that very much made what Singapore is today, Singapore is a country full of contradictions. And whilst active steps have indeed been taken to deal with such issues, such as the introduction of the weekly rest day for migrant workers and the phasing out of streaming by 2024, more has to be done by the state. Greater structural change and the shifting of mindsets has to occur, where migrant workers are not thought of as bodies to extract labour power from and that academic results are not seen as the metric to gauging achievement.
If we truly believe that art can be used to incite social change, perhaps SGIFF’s 30th anniversary can be twofold in both commemorating the occasion and taking active steps to push for systemic change in the issues surfaced. We, as audience members, also share a larger collective responsibility in doing more. For as we are watching these films in the cinema, outside the screen, there are migrant workers and Singaporean students who are experiencing these lived realities at the very same moment.
‘I Dream of Singapore‘ and ‘Unteachable‘ are screening as part of the Singapore International Film Festival (SGIFF). The festival returns from 21 Nov to 1 Dec with over 90 films from 40 countries. Browse the full programme here.

The only time I genuinely “feel Singaporean” is during the 3 minutes and 45 seconds of singing ‘Home’ on 9 August annually. This year is exceptional, I’ll double the time to 7 minutes and 30 seconds since we sang it another time in support of our frontline and migrant workers. Aside from feeling small bursts of pride whenever I hear that my country once again topped global indices, truth to be told I do not possess a sense of national identity, let alone a strong one. As a Gen Z Singaporean, I struggle to identify a concrete commonality which I share with my fellow Singaporeans, one that patently distinguishes us from any other community on the globe.
Singapore, needless to say, is a state, and a remarkably successful one, in fact. Internationally recognised as a state with low corruption, one with a stable economy and fully functional government infrastructures in all aspects such as transport and defence, Singapore has more than succeeded in state building. But in nation building, I believe we have failed. To me, Singapore is not a nation, having a mere nascent national identity. Unlike other nation states such as Japan who have undergone centuries of nation building, Singapore is unequivocally a new state with an absence of a rich and extensive history, which already engenders difficulty in forming a significantly unified nation. Besides, Singapore lacks indigenous culture and arts, essentially being a melting pot of diverse cultures “borrowed” from other nations. Singapore, branded as a multiracial society, also lacks homogeneity— culturally, racially and linguistically— which is indispensable for citizens to become conscious of themselves as a separate national identity. Singapore is unable to achieve solidarity among citizens through a common culture, language, custom, ethnicity simply because we are so diverse.
Homogeneity is pivotal to identity in any community, a binding factor in times of civic unrest or crisis, where we reassure ourselves with these distinguishable traits. I mean, for example, a Korean will support another Korean in need because they are both Korean. The red ants will fight together for food against the non-red ants because they are red. You get what I mean. National identity is a Gorilla super glue binding us to society, crucial in ensuring national resilience and weaving a strong social fabric. Fundamentally, a strong national identity creates a cohesive and harmonious nation. To approach racial divides and inter-race animosity, we have to do so through building a strong national identity, not through making illegal the intent to hurt religious or racial feelings.
Singapore has grown expeditiously in her past 50 years of independence, from a fishing village in the 1800s to an extraordinary first-class cosmopolitan city today. When Singapore separated from Malaysia, Mr Lee Kuan Yew broke down on national television in front of millions of people. It was an iconic and significant uniting moment, at least that’s what my Grandmother said. Singaporeans realised they were vulnerable, left alone. So our pioneer generation built the nation with a crazily strong work ethic, weirdly seeking solidarity in the vulnerability of our country. Singapore formed a hardy society who emerged on top, entering the competition against other cities in the First World. This shared “trauma” bound Singaporeans together, but for upcoming generations, like me, without the same shared experiences, trauma no longer unites us. History, the only way for Singaporeans to have a shared identity, helps future generations of citizens to better understand who they are. Any revision of our history serves to threaten us as one united people.
For the past 50 years, it has always been a game of national survival, of Singapore fighting to ensure her sovereignty. Yet now, after we’ve triumphantly survived and bloomed into a first-world city, pragmatism is still predominant to the sentimental overtures of preservation, culture and identity, with Singapore always prizing economic development over the intangibles. The Singaporean system seems to be structured on perverse incentives that negates our human capacity for empathy, for real meaningful connection to our nation, to one another. Ok, too cheem don’t understand? Basically Singapore prioritizes the economy over the hearts of citizens. How exactly are us Singaporeans supposed to feel connection and affection for this very city versus any other city in the world? This connection really is weaker than Starhub’s.
Very understandably, public leaders sought to make Singapore a “cosmopolitan centre able to attract, retain and absorb talent from all over the world” to ensure that we remain globally competitive. A city sustained by global flows with the world as its hinterland, as well as one with the highest trade to GDP ratio, sitting at 326%, it is undeniably important for Singapore to keep its borders open and continually attract foreigners. But at the same time, this very expansion of Singapore as a global hub, where we have positioned ourselves at the intersection of global flows, further exacerbates the lack of homogeneity within us. With liberal immigration policies, we continually welcome new immigrants into our island, becoming even more socially diverse beyond our traditional differences of race, religion and language. In addition, to attract dynamic and innovative talents from all over the world, Singapore has cultivated a vibrant arts, culture and entertainment scene. If you look around you, you see brand-name Broadway musicals such as The Lion King and Wicked screened at the Sands Theatres at Marina Bay Sands, Pop concerts be it Michael Jackson or Guns N’ Roses held at the National Stadium, Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama’s exhibition at the National Gallery Singapore. But how many times have you seen Singaporean artists in these big venues? While these top global acts have brought in millions of dollars, it has also handicapped our local artists, who have to compete with globally acclaimed artists for consumers in their very own country. Singapore has often been dubbed as a cultural wasteland, with no indigenous culture, which is highly integral to national identity. Culture is something Singaporeans can identify with and pride themselves on. Culture has a hold on the hearts and minds of Singaporeans. Culture provides the emotional resonance Singaporeans require. Just look at how we fight to claim JJ Lin as Singaporean.
The recent buzz of the GE2020 showed various political candidates stepping up, sharing their manifestos filled with lofty ideals, for example, how to reduce social inequality through a myriad of policies and changes to Singapore’s wage system. Introduce a minimum wage? Say no to GST hike? Our leaders consistently introduce new policies to combat various state problems yet nation building does not receive the same level of regard. Admittedly, it is difficult to discuss something as intangible as identity and Singapore does have to be pragmatic to ensure progress as a 721.5 km² island. But I firmly believe that this is not a zero-sum game and that we can definitely achieve a balance between state and nation building. It would truly be remiss of us to solely focus on state building and leave the hearts of Singaporeans hollow. Forget about our GDP, let us shift our focus to rewriting, strengthening the Singaporean identity.
Singapore still has a long way to go in nation building. By nurturing our domestic arts scene for its intrinsic value instead of a vehicle for economic growth, we will slowly but surely develop our very own arts culture. Even if it may take centuries, even if it may seem irrational to sacrifice palpable dollars for something abstract and uncertain, it is worth every effort. Economic demands may be important but so are the demands of a nation’s soul. We, as a nation, are much more than our GDP or international rankings. To my fellow Singaporean reading this, do support local artists to strengthen our very own Singaporean arts scene. Government efforts would not matter without your support. Start listening to Gentle Bones on Spotify, catch a show by Cake Theatrical Productions, visit the Utterly Art exhibition space. Next, since we are racially, religiously and linguistically heterogeneous, we should utilize distinct Singaporean values as a shared attribute. Singapore should adopt a concrete national ideal which articulates the values that bind us, similar to that of The American Dream. This national ethos will give us a stronger sense of rootedness. At the end of the day, if our lifestyles are so uniform that our identities are not distinct from others, there really isn’t much of an identity at all.
I truly hope that one day, I will “feel Singaporean” not just when I’m singing an NDP song for 3 minutes, but endlessly. I will feel proud not only because my country is ranked the #1 most competitive economy, but also because of the special Singaporean arts and culture my country has. I will feel attached to my fellow Singaporeans not because we live on the same island, but because we share the same values and dreams. We need to become a nation, not just a state.
What about you? To you,

"In Singapore, Talking About Death Is Taboo. But That’s Exactly Why We Should Do It",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-talking-about-death-taboo/,22-May-21,"Top image Credit: Marisse Caine
Associate Professor Tan Kok Yang remembers the time he broke a bleak prognosis to his patient—an 80-year-old man with advanced stomach cancer—and his family. The cancer had already spread to other parts of his body. Things were not looking good for the octogenarian. He had only six months to live.
I was dreading to hear the next part of this anecdote. In fact, I had not been not looking forward to my interview with the good doctor in the first place, who helms the General Surgery department in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.
The 50-year-old senior consultant is also deputy chairman of the hospital’s Medical Board, and has been practising medicine for more than 20 years, specialising in colorectal surgery.
It was not because I was shunning healthcare workers amidst fears of Covid-19. Rather, like many Singaporeans, I am uncomfortable with discussing death. Many Singaporeans remain superstitious and regard death as an inauspicious and taboo subject.
For me, talking about death feels morbid, with negative connotations like fear, sadness, and pain attached. My aversion to the topic also stems from denial. Although I understand intellectually that the death of my loved ones is inevitable, it can be emotionally challenging to accept such an eventuality. I needed to cross this mental hurdle before feeling comfortable enough to even broach the subject.
Maybe this is why Prof Tan had a difficult time with that elderly man and his family. Perhaps, like many of us, they wanted to avoid talking about death.

All three parties were gathered in the room of Prof Tan’s clinic in Khoo Teck Puat Hospital. The elderly man was intelligent and knew what was going on. He understood what was about to come. Prof Tan had examined him previously, and explained the reason he was doing it.
Yet, Prof Tan says: “The family was very adamant that this person should not know the diagnosis.”
“The family said, ‘Oh, he doesn’t need to know the diagnosis, maybe we ask him to leave the room first and then you tell us.’”
Prof Tan was not happy. His opinion is that patients have the right to know, and the man wanted to learn of his fate. “If I had only a few months to live, I would want to know. I would want to do things that I have been procrastinating,” Prof Tan says.
But the family intervened and insisted the senior should not know about it, and they would find out on his behalf. With tears running down his eyes, the old man looked at Prof Tan and his face gave it away. He looked at his family and said, very lovingly: “It’s okay, I don’t want to know. I will leave the room.”
After that clinic consultation ended, Prof Tan was overwhelmed with emotions and wept.
He saw that even in the face of death, the elderly man respected his family’s wishes. The man left the room, knowing that he did not have much time left, yet not knowing the specifics of his condition.
Such a scene could have been avoided, if Singaporeans were open to talking about preparing for death.
As much as I am uncomfortable with discussing death, it is a topic we cannot run away from. And the opportunity to raise this subject came when a graphic novel commissioned by Lien Foundation on palliative care was released earlier in March this year.
The 72-page book, written and illustrated by local artist James Tan, focuses on the role medical professionals play in helping patients cope with the dying process.

Although Prof Tan has had his fair share of breaking bad news to patients since he became a qualified surgeon in 2006, the task has not gotten any easier. Neither has it desensitised him, even though he has to do it a few times a month.
While he grows and gains more life experience, and finds himself more equipped to empathise with his patients, he still does not have an SOP to help patients cope with death.
This is something we are not used to, in a society where templates, guidelines, and rules are de rigueur. Every case is different, he says. Ultimately, he has to consider the patient’s family dynamics and ensure the patient knows what’s going on.
Prof Tan also shares that it helps that more Singaporeans these days are slowly opening up to such die-logues, compared to more than a decade ago when 70 to 80 per cent of families did not want to do so.
That being said, it is still slow progress. Out of love, many keep their loved ones in the dark about their condition. These people believe their loved ones will find that sort of information too heavy a burden to bear.
However, Prof Tan questions if this is the best approach. That is why he is trying his best to persuade family members to discuss the dying process together, rather than shy away or withhold details from their loved ones.
When families exclude their loved ones from the discussion, the decision becomes a huge burden for them. Nobody knows the right or wrong thing to do.
Some do more by prolonging treatment because anything less, such as stopping treatment and letting the patient live out their last days, may be perceived as unfilial. But doing more may not necessarily be in the best interests of the patient.
Prof Tan shares a story with me: He had an elderly Eurasian patient, whom he called Amy, with less than a year left to live. What struck him the most was the control Amy had over her life, even after being diagnosed with cancer. She was with her family and well-prepared to learn about her fate.
“This is my life, this is me. I want to know everything and know how much I have left to live. I will decide from there and not burden my family to do it,” Amy said.
Prof Tan recalls having a good conversation with her over her prognosis and told her that the cancer had spread, with little hope for recovery. Maybe it helped that Amy was a religious person, as she was comfortable with the chat and ready to face death.
Amy took things in her stride and chose not to undergo any further treatment. Instead, she led the final lap of her life meaningfully by travelling and spending more time with her extended family.
Prof Tan remembers that even when she met him after her condition deteriorated, she still maintained a smile on her face. Amy died in October 2019.
“She was able to face death in a positive fashion, so did her family,” Prof Tan says.

Throughout our interview, Prof Tan constantly emphasises that the conversation about death is difficult for anyone to have, be it for dying patients or healthy individuals. Diagnosis should not be withheld, he extols.
But I still had my doubts. Surely it is easy for Prof Tan to persuade us to have such die-logues with our loved ones, when he has a lesser emotional burden. His patients are not blood-related to him, and to them, he is an outsider.
I turned the tables to ask him: Have you had such a conversation with your parents before, asking them about end-of-life issues?
This is when, Prof Tan says, he is no longer a doctor but somebody else’s son. “No matter how experienced a doctor you are, it doesn’t prepare you to be a son.”
Similar to many of us, it was not easy for Prof Tan to bring up the topic with his parents. Certainly not with his mother, who is 84 this year. But thankfully, his late father was open-minded enough to start the ball rolling before being diagnosed with dementia.
He spoke to his son about his final wishes, such as not wanting to be put into intensive care when the situation arose. Prof Tan adds that his father, who eventually died of pneumonia, also wrote him a letter to tell him that he did not want a funeral.
Instead, the elder Tan wanted to be cremated on the same day and have his ashes scattered in the sea, since he loved travelling. The family carried out his wishes when he died.

Like his father, Prof Tan has also written a letter and spoken openly with his daughter on how he wants to be managed in a life-and-death situation. He does not want to be in a vegetative state and burden the family.
Although his daughter is still a teenager, she understands what’s going on. He wants to make things clear to her because life is unpredictable. When push comes to shove, she can at least make an informed decision.
“No matter how experienced a doctor you are, it doesn’t prepare you to be a son.”
This is why this discourse on end-of-life care is so crucial. As recent developments have shown, life is unpredictable. Few of us would have expected the pandemic to last this long, nor anticipated another de facto circuit breaker till June 13.
It is precisely because we cannot foresee the future that we need to kickstart these difficult conversations with our loved ones, especially while everyone is still clear-headed. The last thing we want is to go through a conundrum when our parents are in a comatose state, and unable to express their wishes.
Other than having a die-logue, Prof Tan says, the more important thing is to establish a good relationship with your loved ones, so that when one is at the crossroads, you know that any decision will be made with love.

Doomscrolling Is The New Banana Bread in Phase 2 (HA)",Sean Lim,TRUE,TRUE
Universal Basic Income: An Interview with Prof. Walter Theseira & Dr. Ong Qiyan (Part 2),https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-universal-basic-income-inequality-interview-part-two/,19-May-20,"All images RICE file photos.
This is the second part of the interview; you can read Part One here.
Sophie: Earlier on, we spoke about why MUBI was designed to be financed via tax increases rather than drawing on the reserves. What would you say to people who would rather donate to charity at their discretion, rather than being made to pay higher taxes?
Qiyan: The first thing is that it’s not easy to decide where to donate our money. Most of us don’t have a lot of information about low-income families and their needs, or social services and how they are helping people. We may have information about one agency, for example, Agency A provides food rations; but we may not know how many other agencies are out there providing food rations. Would there be duplication? And so on and so forth.
So there are a lot of issues in deciding where to donate, and most people would probably put off donating. But even if they don’t delay, because of difficulties with information and coordination, money could be over-channeled to certain areas while other important ones are underfunded, creating gaps.
The current situation is also unique in that Covid-19 is not something anyone expected to happen. Most people who lost their income would have been retrenched. So is the best way to help them giving them donations in-kind, or giving them cash assistance?
Again, the general public may not understand this, and see their individual actions as isolated from others’. You might decide to donate food, on the basis that other people can provide cash. But if everyone thinks that way, then families will have a lot of food but no cash. MUBI would be universal, which would help these families pay for utilities, Internet, some food. On this basis, we can then think about how else we can help them.
Walter: I guess the more philosophical question at play here is: what do we think charity is good at, and what do we think government—meaning, I force people to pay some taxes to provide this service— is good at?
I think when you look at how many societies have progressed over time, there’s been a general sense that government is the best place to provide certain basic services and meet certain basic needs. Charity can do a good job of filling gaps around that, but I don’t think any functioning society would agree that it should be the primary way of meeting basic needs.
Take education. Until independence, education was seen as something which was provided privately. So there was no mass government provision of schools; there were many independent schools, and these were supported by charity, whether a clan association or church or whatever.
You might ask: well, if charity did such a great job, then why did we nationalise schools, and why do most countries do this? It’s because countries have realised that up to a certain point, education is a basic need, and if you leave it up to charitable provision, you don’t get even, universal coverage with certain basic standards in place. You end up with some groups being massively over-supplied, and others not supplied at all. So there’s a consensus in almost every country that education is something which the government taxes people to provide on a national basis.
MUBI aims to do something similar. It aims to provide people with a basic amount of income security at this time. Charity can do a lot of things to help people at this time, but to help everyone with basic income security—that’s not something I think charity should be aiming to do. And cannot do, in fact.
S: I noticed that your proposal only covers Singaporeans, and I’m wondering about groups who would thus be excluded from MUBI—say, migrant spouses on Long-Term Visit Passes, who might be married to Singaporeans, and are often in dire financial straits themselves. Why was the parameter set as Singaporeans, and what groups are left out by this?
W: Yes. PRs, people on LTVPs—these are all groups that would be left out by a policy like this. One reason why we conceived of it as Singaporeans is that this pretty much follows the same principle of other universal payments being made, like the Solidarity Payment, which are designed for Singaporeans only.
But you’re right, there is a gap there, and there is an interesting question about whether this gap should be met by governments or charities. I don’t have a good answer for this right now. But there’s a broader question behind this, which I don’t think this has been well settled in Singapore: to what extent should welfare benefits be conditional on nationality, versus you just having to exist as a person in Singapore for whatever reason?
S: We’ve seen that in Portugal, for example, social assistance schemes have been temporarily extended to non-citizens at this time.
W: Different countries have different approaches to this. There are some which take Singapore’s approach, where you only get welfare if you’re a citizen, but there are also other jurisdictions which say: if you show up, I won’t ask for your ID, but I will give you food or grocery vouchers or whatever. I don’t have a good answer for what the best approach would be right now.
Q: We proposed [keeping it to] Singaporeans because the focus would be between MUBI and other means-tested programmes, so we wanted the focus to be that rather than the population it covers.
This is not reflective of our personal positions on whether, say, foreign spouses should be covered. To me, we should cover everyone, because we are able to. But if this undermines support for a general social protection, then we have to bear this cost in mind. So once we get past the discussion about whether a more universal kind of social protection is good for the country, then we can start discussing the other groups we can extend this to, as you’ve pointed out.
There’s no reason why foreign spouses shouldn’t, beyond moral hazard, but that’s the thing about Covid: it makes moral hazard an obsolete argument, because no one expected this, and no one can control what’s happening right now.
So it really begs the question: are we only able to support other citizens after we support our own, or is that by supporting others, we definitely support our own?
S: On the general point about supporting others, are there other reasons why people—especially median to higher earners—should back MUBI, beyond just appealing to them to be empathetic?
The example that comes to mind is what’s going on now with migrant workers. We’ve seen that for a long time, for a lot of people, rights-based arguments haven’t been persuasive. Even with things as bad as they are now, moral arguments often have to be accompanied by more mercenary or practical ones: we need migrant workers because our economy needs them, and so on.
W: Well, if you’re a high-income earner, putting aside the arguments for doing this on social justice or distributive grounds, I think the most practical argument is that most high-income earners know that their asset values and ability to earn a high income really depend on social stability and the rest of society not suffering too much disruption. If there’s a lot of disruption, that either threatens the security of your assets and income, or leads to even more radical pushes for social change.
So there’s a practical reason for high-income earners to be interested in social protections that make people who aren’t as well-off better off. If you agree that you have a practical interest in that, then the question must become: how do I do this in the most efficient way possible? As a high income earner, you wouldn’t be interested in solutions which waste a lot of money.
I honestly think that at a time like this, MUBI isn’t a bad way of trying to solve this problem cost-effectively. Even though you end up giving everyone money, you collect it back through taxes, and you get to save money on the problems we mentioned earlier, like administrative costs and means-testing. You also free up resources to try and solve problems beyond just means-testing. So from an efficiency, self-interest perspective, I think there are reasons to agree with this even if you’re a high-income earner and you end up paying a lot for it.
For median-income earners, the argument is mostly mechanical. If it ends up that you don’t need MUBI, that’s all well and good. You end up paying about the same in taxes as you will receive in benefits. But if you do end up needing it, you’re going to be really grateful that we took the money from next year and gave it to you right now.
S: In the last few years, we’ve seen growing public interest in inequality and Singapore’s social compact, and I’m curious if you think Covid-19 has helped move the needle on this. Do you think that, as a result of Covid-19, we’ll see more appreciation or awareness of the need for social protections going forward?
Q: Covid-19 has been like a magnifying glass for many countries, not just Singapore. It really increases the visibility of gaps and the fragility of the systems we currently have, and how unprepared we are for a situation like this.
One of the things we were thinking about was this: suppose that we have a lot of social protections to tide us through Covid-19. When we recover from the pandemic, are we going to attribute our recovery to individualistic reasons, or social protections? This is very unclear. It’s just human nature to attribute success to ourselves, and not to structural support.
An example to ponder here is the Black Death. In England, after the Black Death happened, wages went up, but this was mostly because of the market. There were less people who could be hired to work, so you had no choice but to pay them more.
However, because some people really wanted things to go back to the way they were, especially people with more resources, the government started to curb wage increases in the end. So the Black Death, which was a really terrible situation, should have helped people to appreciate lower-income groups and the importance of their work. But in the end, people quickly reverted to self-interest, and things went back to the way they were.
[The sorts of changes we might see because of Covid-19] depend on how serious we are about remembering this experience. The problem is that social distancing makes a lot of experiences less visible, so we’re just reading about vulnerable people; we’re not really seeing the impact that Covid is having on them. Even though the situation is severe, there’s this counter-force reducing its impact. I’m honestly not sure.
W: I’m hopeful that the narrative people tell themselves about how they came through this time will be more socialistic and less individualistic. I say I’m hopeful, because I don’t know if this will actually happen.
The reason why I say ‘narrative’ is that in the end, our support for social policies, or the kind of government we want, is often based on the stories we tell about our own lives, and how we came to be successful or failed or whatever. If someone comes through this successfully, as Qiyan was saying, I would hope that the narrative is: I pulled through because of the support of society.
So okay, imagine the worst happens to you. You get Covid-19, a serious case, and you end up in the ICU. What are you going to say when you come out? Are you going to say, ‘oh, I pulled through because I’m a strong and healthy individual and I was fighting to survive’? Or do you say, ‘I pulled through because the doctors and nurses and my family rallied around me and never gave up on me’?
If as a society, all of us start saying ‘We survived because we were good, we worked hard and saved money, we did everything possible…‘ then I think we’re done for. Because in spite of this terrible situation, which we’ll only get through if we’re all in it together, we ended up still telling ourselves the same story that it’s just because of our own effort.
But if more of us start telling the narrative that we pulled through because we supported each other, because other people helped me survive, then I think we’ve got some room for change.
Q: This brings to mind something else: whether you attribute your success to social protections or your own efforts really depends on how generous the social protections are.
For example, Covid-19 patients who go to the hospital see the generosity of the doctors and nurses who worked tirelessly to care for them. This is very difficult for them to ignore, so they might really change their views. But in terms of financial assistance, if we keep doing this in dribs and drabs—$100 here, $50 there, from various people, with a lot of means-testing and judgement—then how would we not think that any sort of success is due to our individual efforts, rather than social protections or privilege?
S: Covid-19 has brought up a lot of talk about how this is a time to be ambitious, and to reconsider some of the things we’ve historically prioritised, like efficiency. So even if MUBI doesn’t get passed in this round, or it’s some time before we see action on this front, what sorts of shifts would you like to see in our social welfare policies?
Q: That’s a big question. Personally, I feel that in the long run, rather than focusing on who is taking advantage of the system, we should be more worried about whether hard-working people can have a good life in Singapore. If I don’t have a good education, but I’m hard-working, will I be protected in times of crisis? Will people help me, or will I struggle from one crisis to another?
Effective social policies should ensure that hard-working people do not need to struggle to make ends meet. Most people can tell whether they are working hard. When they are, and yet they struggle to make ends meet, it’s not right for us to turn our backs on them and convince them that they are struggling because they’re not working hard enough.
For example, we cannot tell someone who is working ten hours a day that they’re not working hard enough and they should get a second job. When we meet someone like this, we must wake up to the fact that there are gaps in our social policies and seek to improve them. If we are worried about that one person who tries to take advantage of our social assistance schemes, we should be doubly worried about meeting a hardworking person who is struggling to make ends meet, because our child may end up like him or her.
The current discussion often still focuses on gatekeeping public money, but I think the way to evaluate the effectiveness of any policy should also be whether hard-working people can make it, rather than what people might be doing to game the system. But it seems that we often focus on the latter rather than the former.
W: I think this is related to a rather long-standing debate on social mobility, and the argument we sometimes have in Singapore, which is that ‘all we really need is social mobility’. In other words, as long as we have social mobility, hard-working people will rise to the top and everything will be fine.
I think there’s nothing wrong with social mobility, but we shouldn’t let a focus on this blind us to the fact that there can be very severe problems with people who are in lower-income groups and work hard, but cannot access social mobility. We should not say that the system is fine just because a certain percentage from the bottom can rise to the top, if the rest of the people at the bottom are still doing extremely badly even though they’re working hard. That’s not quite right. So I think social mobility is an important metric, but we should never forget that we need to level up the bottom, even if some are able to make it to the top. You really do have to level up the bottom.

2 Weeks of WFH Convinced Me That This Is The Future Of Work in Singapore,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-wfh-singapore/,26-Feb-20,"Top image: Zachary Tang.
I’m writing this while lying in bed, still in my pyjamas (it’s 4:26 PM, if you’re wondering), and have just farted, which has earned me a disapproving stare from my dog.
You can say I’m living the life.
Because of COVID-19, the RICE editorial team, like employees in different companies across Singapore, has been instructed to work from home.
There were some initial trepidations: How would we conduct our morning meetings? Would it be difficult to communicate with each other? What would be the effect on our productivity?
After two weeks of working from home, I think I can say for the entire team that there has been no change in the way we operate. Or if there is any, it’s that we have, on the contrary, been more productive and engaged with our work. Drafts are coming in before deadline. People are volunteering to attend events to—gasp—network and maintain relations. The messages in Slack (the messaging platform we use) have changed from suicidal/murderous to peppy exclamation-mark statements!!!
That is to say, we are … happy? What is this alien feeling?
The positive results from this work-from-home experiment got me thinking: if we, as a company, have been functioning so well while working remotely, why shouldn’t we be doing this permanently? Or why shouldn’t any company, for that matter?

Remote working is, obviously, not applicable across all industries. You can’t work from home if you’re a chef or a sex worker, for example. (Though I hear from a cousin’s friend’s brother that something called the “cam scene” is booming. What is that???)
Even if your work is not tied to a specific site or oriented around a person, some considerations may stop you from working from home. For instance, people who deal with sensitive and confidential information necessarily have to work within a secure space, because we don’t want more leaks than we already had in 2019. Client-facing jobs are, well, client-facing for a reason: it’s hard to replicate, over an electronic medium, the process of feeling each other out and establishing mutual trust.
For everyone else, however, I don’t see why most of Singapore’s workforce shouldn’t be allowed to work from home—even if it’s only for one day a week.

According to a Gallup poll, “54% of office workers say they’d leave their job for one that offers flexible work time.” This sentiment is the same in Singapore. Not having flexible work arrangements is the biggest factor in employee resignation, a 2018 Ministry of Manpower report states.
It’s no great mystery why people enjoy working from home. By skipping the morning commute, you get an extra hour or two lying in bed and can wake up feeling refreshed instead of grouchy. You have the freedom to wear whatever you feel most comfortable in—tee shirt and shorts, your boyfriend’s OCS singlet and boxers—instead of constrictive and kinky business attire.
And in the words of an unnamed RICE employee:
ALSO WHO DOESN’T LIKE WORKING FROM THEIR BED?????
But if enjoyment doesn’t translate into productivity, all this would mean nothing. For the RICE team, there are very real gains in productivity. This is primarily because the team comprises a bunch of dysfunctional introverts, so the very fact that there are no other human beings around means we can focus on writing instead of trying to be sociable flesh bags.
Working from home, we are also spared the distractions that constantly crop up in the office, such as meetings that happen around us, angsty colleagues yelling expletives into the air because of writer’s block, or having an impromptu mangosteen party. (All true stories.)
In any case—pardon me for this gross C-suite phrase—happy workers are good workers! Working in a comfortable, familiar environment where you can be the slug you are is, by and large, beneficial for your mental health. And mental health is perhaps the most important determinant of work performance.
Source: Gallup poll, ""Is Working Remotely Effective? Gallup Research Says Yes."" I say yes too.
Anecdotal evidence from the RICE farmers aside, the benefits of working from home are evident across different industries and countries.
Ms Yvonne Li, the director of PR agency Tate Anzur, tells Today, “I would say that we have been more productive in this period. Since everyone is working from home and is easily reachable for discussion online, we were able to establish concrete plans with our clients quickly.”
Most Singaporeans can resist the siren song of their bed too. According to a CNA article, when working from home, people actually work outside official office hours because when you’re working from home, work and leisure blur together. (Whether that is a good thing is another issue altogether.) And the same Gallup poll found that Americans who work at home (or remotely) three or four days a week have the highest level of engagement with their work. The paper concludes:
Employees who spend some time off-site won’t suffer losses in their engagement and that there will be performance improvements that go with it … remote workers are more productive than on-site workers as well.
Yes, there are downsides to working from home. There are strange people who need human interaction through the day to keep them energised. Without some form of temperature control in Singapore’s humid, mid-day heat, it’s almost impossible to concentrate on work—the late Lee Kuan Yew himself declared that “without air conditioning you can only work in the cool early-morning hours or at dusk.” And, as aforementioned, when you don’t leave the office physically, it becomes hard to disengage from work mentally.
But it’s clear that the positives outweigh these objections; evidence shows that working from home provides tangible benefits to companies and employees both. It’s not often that a win-win situation crops up in capitalism.
Some important numbers and lines to prove my point.
Yet, in 2018, only 8.4% of companies in Singapore allow their employees to work from home. Why aren’t more companies in Singapore allowing their employees to be happier and more productive and engaged with their work?
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding...
If you have ever finished your work for the day at 5 PM but decided to stay in the office till 9 PM because you didn’t want to leave before your boss, who was still hammering away at whatever/whomever he was working on, welcome to the Singapore office. Where presenteeism, not productivity, is the buzzword of the … forever.
We have an infamously toxic work culture. Workplace politics can get more intricate and drawn out than the current anime betrayal happening with our upstairs neighbour. Managers value face-time and think that anyone who is not physically in the office and glued to their chair is out sipping a frozen margarita. In their world, there exists no concept of trust. Or humanity. They don’t believe that people can be self-motivated enough to do work without needing the Eye of Sauron perpetually trained on them. And if people are being paid for their time, they jolly well spend that time in the office and not at home!!!
Again, all this is purely anecdotal, drawn from personal experience, stories friends have shared with me, Reddit threads, and so on.
Source: Reddit user u/VPee.
Except for statistics like the number of hours worked (at 45.6 hours, Singaporeans worked the second highest number of hours a week in 2015), there exists no hard data on how toxic Singapore’s work culture is. It’s hard and counterproductive to assign a value on something as intangible as culture, anyway.
But I don’t think we need an in-depth study to tell us what all of us, having gone through such experiences ourselves, already know: unless you’re lucky, working in Singapore is a pretty shit experience. You’re more likely to get chummy with the CEO’s secretary than to be allowed to work from home.

For years, Singaporeans have been chastised about our low productivity. We are instructed to utilise technology to make companies more efficient. The government is constantly throwing money at us so we can take courses and become better workers.
But maybe we don’t need all that. We just need to be allowed to stay at home to do our work. And we’ll become more productive and happier people.
It’s sad that it’s taken an epidemic for most Singapore companies to allow their workers the opportunity to work from home. When COVID-19 gets scorched to death in the summer months, companies will, hopefully, remember the lessons learnt from COVID-19: emergency preparedness, hygiene measures, financial resilience, blah blah blah. All that, certainly. But also that working from home is not giving employees a vacation. It’s trusting in people to do their work, to manage their time, and to let them live their lives.
Being “future-ready” is another of those meaningless jargon Singapore statutory boards and schools like to throw around. Unless Singapore companies accept that telecommuting—i.e. working from home, the coffee house, on top of your toilet bowl—is the future, the only thing we are getting ready for is obsolescence.

Migrant Workers Need Masks and Hand Sanitiser, But These Won't Fix A Culture of Chronic Neglect",Yeo Boon Ping,TRUE,TRUE
"Singapore’s Foreign Policy Problem, As Expressed in Bad Fan-Fiction",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-singapore-foreign-policy-fan-fiction/,18-Jun-20,"One evening, Singapore and China walk into a bar. China has just closed a massive deal at work. A 300 billion dollar deal so it’s time to celebrate. Everyone gets a round of shots! Bottles on every table! All drinks on China!
Singapore is China’s best friend and wants China to be happy. After all, Singapore got a fat commission for brokering the deal, so cheers, here’s to a long and fruitful relationship. However, China is getting very drunk very very quickly. He is also groping the service staff and disappearing into the toilets to snort long lines of pure uncut Nationalism.
Singapore is worried. Singapore likes this bar, The Pax Americana, and doesn’t want to get thrown out. However, Singapore doesn’t want to upset his rich friend China either. So we hover around the party’s edges, nervously sipping our Gin & Tonic while everyone is going crazy pouring Grey Goose down their throats and tearing their clothes off and behaving like a drunken asshole in general.
Millennials and their filthy IPAs
Finally, the American bouncer has seen enough. USA ambles over to the table and tells China: “You’ve had enough for one night. Stop harassing your ex Ms Hong Kong and call a Grab.”
Drunk China does not take this well, especially not after spending 5 figures on booze. What happens between Ms. Hong Kong and himself is a private matter, and he’s not gonna take any fucking moral high-ground bullshit from a broke-ass bouncer with 2 prior convictions for domestic violence. China says as much (and more) to USA’s face. China is too high to notice that America’s face is getting redder and redder.
The entire room freezes to watch USA and China. At this moment, Singapore runs forward and tries to place himself between the two angry idiots, who are on the verge of coming to blows. “Guys chill it’s all just a misunderstanding,” Singapore cries, whilst holding back China from doing something truly stupid—like deck the USA with an empty bottle.
This is fan-fiction, but it’s not very far from the truth. 2 weeks ago, our government produced not one, but two different editorials for the foreign policy wonk press. PM Lee Hsien Loong published ‘The Endangered Asian Century’ behind the Foreign Affairs paywall, while ex-Ambassador Bilahari Kausikan wrote ‘Zeal and China’s ‘Wolf Warrior’ Diplomacy’ for the GlobalBrief.
The tone of the two articles could not be more different, but they expressed more or less the same anxiety: If the USA and China don’t mend their differences soon, Singapore is totally, royally fucked.
The editorials did not actually say we are fucked, but—let’s be honest—we’re 100% f.u.c.k.e.d by the ever-worsening China-USA relations. Singapore was already heading into a recession thanks to the 2019 trade war. Brexit, The Pandemic, and 4 more years of Trump are not likely to improve our position. That’s why Lee Hsien Loong is urging the USA not to view China’s rise as an ‘existential threat’ (Please respect how much money they have) whilst also urging China to respect ‘global rules and norms’ (Don’t nuke the golden goose just yet you moron).
Is that Minister Heng Swee Keat in the background
Bilahari’s article is a lot funnier (“the somewhat unfortunately-named Samuel Hoare”), but not all that different in its perspective. Under the pretext of discussing diplomatic ‘rules of engagement’, he is basically urging China not to overplay its hand because a USA in decline is like a cornered wild boar—more dangerous, not less. Best not to poke it with hurtful words and just let it bleed to death. (“Deng Xiaoping’s sage advice to bide your time and hide your light.”)
Yes, for China to adopt such a position would be in Singapore’s best interests, but that is a total coincidence. Not self-serving at all.
This is the unhappy predicament. We’re trapped between 2 great powers stuck in a toxic relationship, made increasingly worse by their own insecurities and substance abuse. It’s like when your two best friends break up acrimoniously and you don’t know who to side with.
That’s why PM Lee seems to have taken on the role of a pro bono marriage counsellor of late.
Unfortunately, he is no Esther Perel, and the pair is slowly edging towards a messy divorce. His editorial spoke of the Covid-19 Pandemic as “a stark reminder of how vital it is for countries to work together”, but that is a lesson no one seems to have learnt during this crisis. On the contrary, most leaders have doubled down on blaming other people to distract from their own failures. PM Lee seems to be the last globalist left standing in a world full of people addicted to jingoism.
We've all been there. Source: Guardian
The Pandemic will pass, but the breakdown of this much-beloved ‘rules-based international order’ might prove to be Singapore’s greatest challenge in the 2020s. Unlike other problems, there doesn’t seem to be a great deal we can do because they stem from deep-rooted domestic problems like China’s opium-related historic insecurities and USA’s increasingly polarised politics.
Perhaps Xi will experience a moment of zen while smoking his Panda cigarettes in the Zhongnanhai garden. Perhaps Trump will suffer a stroke, and Mike Pence will reveal that he was a foreign policy savant all along.
I won’t bet money on either.
Until then, the long-term prognosis is grim for all parts of Singapore: Cloudy with a chance of broken beer bottles. With a General Election coming, it might be wise to pay some attention to this pressing issue. Nonsense like the Ministerial salaries hog all the attention for no good reason, but their importance pales in comparison with what’s happening abroad.

To Shop, Or Not to Shop? An A.I.’s Dramatic Monologue",Pan Jie,TRUE,TRUE
"Singapore’s Landlords Need A Mindset Change, Or The F&B Industry Is Over",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-reit-landlords-singapore-mindset-change-fnb-industry/,8-Apr-20,"Image credit: Spa Esprit Group
“In my 24 years of operation, even during the Sars 2003 period and 2009 Global Financial Crisis, I’ve never had a landlord come and reduce my rent,” says Cynthia Chua, founder and director of Spa Esprit Group and chairwoman of WonderScape Holdings.
“It’s disheartening. While some landlords are proactive, many are detached from reality. We don’t feel the togetherness of working together.”
The landlords F&B operators deal with are familiar names: Capitaland, Far East Organization, Mapletree, Fraser, LendLease, NTUC, SPH REIT, Mercatus, Starhill, JTC, amongst others. They run a gamut of real estate from malls and commercial properties to residences and neighbourhood shops.
Historically, the landlord-tenant relationship has always been a tenuous, one-sided affair. Rentals and other costs are usually paid monthly via GIRO, and if a tenant fails to make payment, landlords charge interest and penalty fees, up to the rental deposit(s), minus reinstatement, before eviction. It’s arm’s length with legal eagles.
Now that Covid-19 has hit hard, F&B operators are feeling the heat. If landlords do not help, many operators will be left to fend for themselves, if they’re able to at all.
“(Covid-19) is absolutely the worst thing that has happened,” exclaims former-radio-DJ-turned-entrepreneur Daniel Ong, who runs the three Rookery restaurants at Capital Tower, China Square, and Hong Leong Building. Since going into F&B in 2011, he doesn’t remember anything that has impacted the business in such a way. Not even SARS, not even MERS.
In his words, “This Covid-19 situation has really been a triple whammy.”
Rookery’s Daniel Ong sent us several photos with a caption, “These are not pre- or post-closing shots. These are times in the day. There’s no one in the CBD anymore. :("" Image credit: Daniel Ong
Ong’s restaurants’ revenue has fallen 70 to 80% even before the no-dine-in rule on 7 April. He plans to liquidate some assets and put in more money to remain afloat. He recently took out a S$200k loan, but it’s not enough. He estimates he needs at least a S$1m loan for the next 6 months. After which repayment will be another headache.
“It is looking dire and I speak on behalf of hundreds of F&B operators who have talked to me.”
(Because of Covid-19), the F&B industry has been suffering since February. It’s been a slow death. If you want to resuscitate the patient, hopefully the patient is still alive. There will be many who will not survive till then. It may not be enough.
– SM Pang, COO of New Ubin Group
“In happy times, our rental was 9% of our sales. Now, those same rentals are 30-40% of our sales. It becomes difficult for us to live on that level,” says Pang Seng Meng (“SM”), COO of New Ubin Group. He describes the situation as a “perfect storm without respite”.
SM has been in the F&B business for 17 years, and the group operates the popular Singapore tze char outlets at Zhongshan Park, CHIJMES and Space@Tampines.
SM Pang, COO of New Ubin Group, has been cost-cutting by moving some operations to the cloud. He’s even introduced UbinEats menu for solo eaters, collaborating with GrabFood and his own for deliveries. According to him, business is so bad, rental costs take up 30-40% of sales compared to 9% previously. Image credit: New Ubin Group
When the government offered landlords a 15-30% property tax rebate during the February Unity Budget announcement, and then the full 100% during the Resilience budget announcements in March, it advised them to pass on these savings to tenants. Sadly, not all of them did. Some delayed their plans to do so.
Towards the end of March, F&B operators started arranging to meet with government officials on April 1 to highlight this.
Eventually, it was only through a government decree that all landlords were compelled to pass on these rebates to tenants. This would constitute about 1.2 months of rent (presumably for March). For tenants, this was not seen as a gesture of goodwill from landlords because the rebate came from the government. But the decree has at least made some landlords sit up and take action.
Beyond March, different landlords will be offering different things, most a full waiver for April, while others discounts till July. As I write this, things are still evolving.
Far East and SPH REIT (Paragon, Clementi Mall, Seletar Mall) will be charging select F&B operators up to 15% of their gross turnover, or GTO. This means tenants don’t pay base rent, which usually equates to roughly 15-20% of sales (on a good day).
Mapletree (Vivocity, Business City), SMRT, Capitaland (Bugis+, Bedok Mall, Tampines Mall), and Suntec are offering between 30 to 50% discounts on rentals over 1 to 3 months (from April or May). LendLease (Parkway Parade, Jem) and Ascendas (Changi City) are offering 10-20% discounts over 1-2 months (from March). Starhill (Wisma Astria) is first to offer a one-time 40% rebate to tenants who choose to stay on. Different landlords, different strokes.
For a few others, tenants are getting either delayed responses or radio silence. So far, tenants have yet to receive information from property owners behind NEX, Ngee Ann City, SingPost, Sun Plaza and many more. This might change over time for sure.
Beyond passing the government’s property tax rebates to tenants, CapitaLand announced additional rental waivers on its website. Together with Far East Organization and Mapletree, these landlords are some of the first few in the industry to act. Image credit: CapitaLand website
The prolonged delay in response is where F&B operators feel most frustrated, especially if they operate many outlets under different landlords. Not only are they seeing zero footfall and dine-ins (ie. circuit breaker), they are being jerked around and treated like cash registers, with the expectation they would pay up.
All tenants really want is for landlords to perceive them as life-or-death partners—waiving rentals in full if need be, or at best, charging rent based on GTO—to ride through this pandemic.
Without this mindset change, operators are left in the lurch.
After weathering between 30 to 70% dips in sales across their different sectors, Spa Esprit’s Chua is glad the government is helping operators, especially with the expedited rebates and enhanced job support schemes (50-75% subsidies). But she’s not sensing the same urgency with different landlords.
Together with Koon Beng (“KB”), CEO of WonderScape and director of Spa Esprit Group, Chua is protective of her brands, which include Tiong Bahru Bakery, boCHINche, NOKA, Ding Dong, The Tippling Club, The Butcher’s Wife, Forty Hands, Common Man Coffee Roasters and Open Farm Community. Besides Spa Esprit and Qi Mantra, Browhaus and STRIP fall under WonderScape.
So why are some landlords taking their sweet time to get their asses on the bandwagon? And why are some choosing to arrive later than others, if at all? Think what? Mafia entrance is it?
Despite three government relief budgets and circuit breaker measurements in place, some have still adopted a wait-and-see approach. Maybe some wish for Bloomberg’s yield forecast of 6.2% to miraculously materialise or harbour hopes of potential rebounds (wait long long).
Are they just sitting on a dragon-hoard of last year’s earnings, unable to see beyond their golden slippers?
Anxious F&B operators have to figure out new, inventive ways to sustain demand, what with new social distancing and circuit breaker announcements every other week. Image source: Open Farm Community Instagram
It is the nonchalance, or high-handedness towards their plight, that has gotten many tenants upset.
KB explains: “One landlord at first tried to do PR, claiming their board of directors is taking a 5-10% pay cut. Seriously, that has no impact whatsoever on helping us save on rent. Next, they planned to put a S$4.5m fund for tenants. They made almost S$200m in profits last year, so the fund is only 2% of that. Even if they give all of their tenants a 50% rebate, they would have made at least S$100m in profits. Just recently, another landlord I spoke to wanted a 6-7% increase in rent. After 3 rounds of negotiations, they said 3%. It’s ridiculous!”
“Landlords collect money passively; psychologically they’re distancing themselves from their tenants. To them, it’s “not their business.” It’s short-term thinking. They’re trying to protect their profits and projections. They should face the reality that last year’s projections are no longer relevant,” shares Howard Lo, owner of Empire Eats group of restaurants/bars like Tanuki Raw, Salmon Samurai, The World is Flat, Standing Sushi Bar and The Secret Mermaid.

For Lo and his wife, Hui Nan, their F&B operations have been severely impacted by Covid-19. They have two outlets at Changi Airport, which rely on traveller and tourist footfall. Many of their outlets in the CBD were affected a week after Dorscon Orange.
“Tenants pay high rents to shopping malls as it’s expected that the mall will draw crowds. The mall now has no crowd, yet we’re still paying rent as if everything’s normal. Aside from base rent, there’s a monthly “service charge” (maintenance fee), advertising & promotions, and various utility fees (electrical license renewal, gas renewal, etc.),” he tells me.
Beyond rent and monthly costs, mall tenants also have to deal with inflated prices when they first set up shop. Beyond the security deposits (usually 1-3 months’ worth), tenants are often forced to use only designated contractors, such as the landlord’s appointed lawyer, PE endorser, and so on. The cost to set up shop in a mall is usually 30-40% more than at a non-mall location, which is unfair to tenants from the get-go. It’s usually non-negotiable and locks tenants up.
For now, while the Ministry of Law is providing temporary relief for tenants who are unable to pay rent for the next six months (ie. eviction moratorium), many are concerned if they are liable to pay late-payment interest on top of deferred rent and accrued interest by the 7th month. It would be a death knell for all F&B operators, and the staff they employ.
“My hope is just survival. I feel for my staff. I employ 60 in F&B, 10 in my agency, and 20-30 people in construction. My businesses are small. But my hope is really just for survival. I’m not asking to make profits this year. That is impossible. I’m not asking to benefit in any way except for survival of the brand,” Rookery’s Ong says. He recommends setting up a government task force with the F&B industry so that everyone can come together quickly.
Chua adds, “I propose a lease forfeiture clause in tenancy agreements. Not only does it protect the tenants with an eviction moratorium, the landlord must meet the tenant, come together and agree on the rent price if they are unable to pay. Psychologically, the tone has to be different.”
KB suggests a legislation where the government imposes taxation on landlords if they do not provide one-for-one matching on government rebates.
Right now, what’s critical over the next six months will be cashflow and it’s important that landlords recognise that.
For his part, KB wants to free up security deposits to be bankers’ guarantees, talk to banks for bridging loans and drawdown when needed. He’s also looking at no-pay leave and MVC for staff contracts for business continuity. For all operators, the reality has already set in, and they’re neck-deep in it.
“We will be closing 1 or 2 small F&B brands. We need to keep our staff cost low. This is going to be a long-haul struggle, before the economy can get back on track. We are working on creative innovations, like pack-away sauces from our Open Farm Community, healthy food menus, effective delivery systems and adapting our business,” Chua explains.

“We are already in a cost-costing mode,” concurs New Ubin’s SM, “we’ve moved some of our operations off-shore. Our reservations, call centre, point-of-sale and accounting are now cloud-based. For us, our Tampines outlet in the heartlands has weathered this well. Kopitiams and canteens. People still need to eat.” New Ubin recently introduced UbinEats, a selection of dishes for solo eaters, with delivery provided by GrabFood or its own team.
Empire Eats’ Lo urges landlords to act now. He is hopeful landlords will support their tenants—they just have to navigate through layers of bureaucracy.
“There will be a minority of landlords who will not provide support. Worse, some might try to exploit their tenants. But with a community of commercial tenants coming together now, you can be sure it will be incredibly difficult for errant landlords to attract tenants in the future,” he says.
The detachment landlords seem to show towards the pain their tenants feel is made clear when some agree to only pass on property tax rebates (after a government decree), and nothing else. It shows their true colours. A few defray lost rentals by using tenants’ security deposits to fill up blanks in their monthly spreadsheets, masking them as deferred rent.
If you ask me, these guys are playing the short-term game. They’re moving numbers month-to-month to tide themselves through while keeping banks/shareholders/investors happy. It’s unfair to tenants. Especially when, according to Ong, 5 in 10 F&B operators or retailers are either closing or suspending. In a couple of months, we may see even more shutter, including our favourite food haunts.
Landlords need to be able to picture this before it’s too late. And they need to come together and act with unity, resilience and solidarity. Our government has done so swiftly—to the tune of S$60b in less than two months; the act itself is unprecedented. For some landlords, that’s probably the time it takes for a boardroom to debate over who they should invite to their charity golf event. As KB says, “Wake up!”
The #SaveFnBSG movement is one of many groups now lobbying for greater landlord support for F&B operators affected by the government’s Covid-19 social distancing measures. Image credit: #SaveFnBSG
Last year, Singapore’s 43 listed property trusts contributed 24% of day-to-day turnover of our stock market (they had a combined market value of S$119b). Some saw incredible annual returns (as high as 32%) and distribution yields (up to 9%). And these were just the SGX-listed ones—don’t forget the private ones.
2020, however, will be a very different year.
SPH REIT warned investors that dividends will be shaved by 78.7% year-on-year. Other REITS are expected to follow suit. It means landlords recognise their earnings will be taking a hit; it’s just a question of how long and who else along the chain will be affected.
With deferred rental income from tenants and lower payouts to shareholders, share prices will take a hit (after months of positive growth). With lower market values and annual distributable income, banks will naturally be concerned, especially with mortgage loans and interests to pay, and “margin calls” to make.
No longer is it just about landlords and tenants now, but everyone up the chain, including shareholders and banks. After 18 years, the entire S-REIT and its financial credibility is at stake … or is it?
The result of recent developments is that every action is now closely monitored by “watchdogs” like the Restaurant Association of Singapore (RAS) and the Singapore Tenants United for Fairness (SGTUFF). This has put a spotlight on how landlords operate behind the scenes, and how it’s usually a one-sided affair, especially for tenancy agreements in shopping malls.
The REIT Association of Singapore (REITAS) highlighted some concerns in a press release.
Ironically, one part reads: By preventing landlords from repossessing premises when tenants default on rent payment, we deprive new tenants who may wish to lock in attractive market rents from taking up space. Landlords will no longer be able to rely on a commercial basis to renew their tenant registers to improve the overall quality and resilience of the property. It is therefore critical that the assessment of rental deferrals be undertaken with objectivity and commercial fairness to both landlord as well as tenant before such deferrals are granted.
What’s clear is that landlords need to act now if they want to save the industry, but who else in the chain will they try to save? For some, it’s the tenants. For others, I’m not so sure. A mindset change is necessary across-the-board, and it has to be now. Otherwise, if they’re going to take days to respond and act favourably, they might be next in line with an expiry date.
I just hope they’re awake now to realise they have one.
If you want to support our F&B outlets, dabao or pick-up from #SaveFnBSG or Hawkers United – Dabao 2020.

DORSCON Orange Is The New Bleh: When You Can’t Be Bothered About COVID-19,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-dorscon-orange-new-bleh-covid-19/,19-Feb-20,"Top image credit: HanLin, Unsplash.
For the first time ever, there is no queue at Nakajima Suisan on a Friday evening. I waltz in, place my order, and am seated immediately. Less than ten minutes later, a waitress, her face half obscured by a blue mask, serves me my glorious miso-marinated Spanish mackerel.
As I’m in a Japanese dining establishment, I think it only appropriate to express my gratitude before the meal, as the Japanese do. So I whisper to the (metaphorically) virus-laden atmosphere around me:
Thank you COVID-19.
It’s about a month after the latest coronavirus on the block made its stunning debut first in China, and then on the world stage.
Tales of how Singaporeans have been responding to it are, by now, commonplace, and the stuff of legends: storming supermarkets and pilfering pharmacies; invading Johor Bahru and requisitioning their supplies; donning surgical masks everywhere in the closest approximation we will get to a political protest a la Hong Kong. But also: distributing free masks and hand sanitisers; initiating goodwill projects for healthcare workers and marginalised groups.
In short: Singaporeans’ reactions run the whole emotional spectrum.
Me? Apart from feeling grateful to our healthcare workers and concern for people whose livelihood or even health have been affected, I’m … eh, meh … amused, bemused, indifferent. I guess?

My relatives were over at my home for lunch last Saturday. It was the day immediately following the DORSCON-orange announcement, and the supermarket frenzy had begun in earnest.
We enquired around the table: are you worried? Have you been to NTUC? Are you stocking up on supplies and groceries?
The answers: no, no, no.
A part of my extended family’s reluctance to participate in the mania is simply because we’re lazy and have no patience to queue. Another is our aversion to crowds. And yet another can be attributed to our faith that the Singapore government has things under control. After all, it is precisely in crisis management that the qualities about our government we find overbearing—its omniscience, omnipotence, and omnipresence—turn from failings to strengths.
What if our faith is misplaced? What if supermarkets become devoid of food?
“We’ll just be one of the first to die,” my aunt chuckles.
“Ya lor,” my mum concurs. “What’s the point?”

My extended family’s blasé attitude sums up my personal response to the COVID-19 situation. (You can see where I get it from.)
As far as I know, my close friends seem unperturbed by the situation as well. They’re still going rock climbing, watching movies, and I have yet to receive from them any of those forwarded WhatsApp messages asking me to WUHAN or follow the 2M rule. (In fact, I only found out about them after reading my colleague Terry’s article describing his experiences being on the opposite side of the emotional spectrum.)
My fellow Rice content farmers have, like Terence, made adjustments to the way they live, such as wearing a mask when out of the house, taking the bus instead of the train to work, bringing hand sanitiser everywhere, or “not touching anything other than myself”. Personally, my daily schedule and habits have largely remained unchanged.
I do wash my hands more frequently and keep them away from my face, but these are hygiene practices that should be in place anyway, regardless of what colour is in season for DORSCON.

To be honest, I’m kind of enjoying this new world that the virus has been shaping.
Malls are no longer claustrophobic mazes made up of constantly moving human-shaped obstacles which I have to dodge. Empty chairs in food courts beg me to sit my ass on them, and I humbly oblige. Picking the ingredients—sitting in the open air, marinating in every accidental sneeze and cough—for my bowl of yong tau foo, I feel like a rebel. From the look on the stall auntie’s face, I can tell she agrees.
Outside, I can hear the birds chirping again.
The panic—sorry, caution—has infected my office. We’ve instituted telecommuting, i.e. working from home. Now that I no longer have to devote brain capacity to performing the role of a functioning, sociable human being who laughs politely and appropriately at jokes cracked by my colleagues (if any of you are reading this: love you all <3), my productivity has skyrocketed. (I’ve written 500 words in an hour.)
COVID-19, in other words, has disembowelled the city and wrapped in me a cocoon of silence.
It might be dystopian for some, but this version of Singapore is paradise for me.

Am I not worried about contracting COVID-19 and wheezing my way to death? Well—I don’t know how to put this without sounding fatalistic or complacent, but the prevailing mood at home is: if death comes, it comes. (There is a distinct lack of masks, antibacterial wipes, and hand sanitisers in the house.)
Personal experience has taught me that you can take all the precautions you want—enclose yourself in a hazmat suit, do cardiovascular exercise five times a week—but nothing can stop Mr Reaper from slipping under your door and whisking you away in the middle of the night.
Perhaps it’s also because I don’t have any liabilities, so I’m considerably less worried than, say, parents with young children, if anything should happen.
Sure, there are things on my bucket list, like try the needlessly extravagant “Marinated Botan Shrimp with Sea Urchin and Oscietra Caviar” at Waku Ghin (where the dish is served with a mother-of-pearl spoon because only plebeians let metal touch their tongue), or write an article so viral that even Ho Ching shares it with a personalised poem.
But if, because of COVID-19, I were to die within a week without accomplishing any of these goals, would I say my life were meaningless and unfulfilled?
No, because everyday I wake up and think, my life is already fulfilling.
Come in my mouth. Credit: @wakughin, Instagram.
Haha jk.
Life, to me, is inherently meaningless (That is not to say I’m unhappy. Meaninglessness =/= unhappiness.)
Having an umami explosion in my mouth or appearing on Ho Ching’s Facebook feed isn’t going to compel me to reassess my perspective on life, or make me feel as if I had lived a life worth living. Nothing I do will magically imbue my life with metaphysical weight.
And you can’t subtract zero from zero. So—
The point being: COVID-19 and its presence in my bloodstream or otherwise isn’t going to change my worldview. On the contrary, it only reinforces my sense of the arbitrary nature of human life. Therefore, given my particular circumstances, I don’t feel like there’s a point in orienting my life around COVID-19.
For instance, continuing to go to gym as usual means I’m touching a lot of surfaces groped by sweaty (and moist from other bodily fluids) palms, potentially exposing me to more virus, but I could just as well die from a freak accident like dropping a 100kg barbell on myself. And so on. So life goes on.
That said, my indifference to COVID-19 does not mean I don’t follow instructions on preventing its spread. But neither am I actively courting it like it’s one of those stupid people I always have crushes on.
At the end of the day, they always go away.

Lowering the Voting Age: Let’s Not,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-ricexdialogix-lowering-the-voting-age/,21-Jul-20,"This is a Shortlisted entry in the Rice Media x DLS Op-Ed competition.

If you are 18 and live in the United States, congratulations – you now have express permission from Uncle Sam to vote. But this perceived privilege exists not only in the United States, but in many other countries. In fact, Singapore’s 21 years entry age to voting is the black sheep among the flock. In this general election, the Workers’ Party proposed to lower the voting age to 18, while Progress Singapore Party’s Tan Cheng Bock also supported the idea last year in 2019. After all, isn’t this a good move? A move that would cast 130 000 new voters into the already existing and saturated pool of 2.65 million voters. A move that would give the youths a voice, a right and a say in our country’s future. However, also a move that would enable votes arising from misinformed decisions squeezing its way through the cracks into our ballot boxes.
Let’s face it. Youths at the ripe age of 18 are simply not equipped, both in maturity and experience, to cast votes. “One man, One vote” is thrown around frequently by political and human rights activists, and to be clear, I truly believe democracy is the way forward. However, at what age is a male truly a man? At what age? 16? 18? 21? The line is blurry and smudged and up to debate.
Youths in Singapore are fervent users of social media. In 2019, it is estimated that 4.4 million Singaporeans use social media. Statistics aside, should one decide to board the train or bus and find not a single person using the phone, that would be as rare as finding a non-air-conditioned bus in Singapore. To that I say good luck. News outlets in Singapore are struggling to appeal to the new younger generation by digitalizing in what appears to be a well-fought but unfortunately futile attempt. In my school, newspapers of all 3 languages are subscribed daily, placed on the wooden shelve that sits outside the multimedia room in the library. Occasionally I would read the papers with my friends and more often than not, we would find the newspapers lying on the shelve not creased at all; almost looking brand new. Newspaper outlets are not alone. In a commendable effort by the National Library Board, they are also “actively promoting reading in various formats”, according to Ms. Catherine Lau from NLB, responding to forum contributor Mr Teo Kok Seah and Mr Terence Teo.
The Straits Times conducted a survey in conjuncture with Singapore University of Social Sciences (SUSS) to “ understand who they are, how they view the world and what they want out of life”. In what appears to be an optimistic step towards youth having a greater awareness of current affairs, this survey may be insufficient to come to a conclusion that youths are indeed more well-read. The frequency of newspaper reading was not mentioned, and the readership according to the survey is around half. Therefore, would “around half” of young voters be aware of politics? Would they be able to analyse situations from many perspectives and not take a single politician’s word as the sole truth? Would they be able to not be easily swayed by well-designed advertisements found on social media? The fact that quite a sizable sum of youths are ill-informed and more political parties are mounting blistering online campaigns where youths’ residential areas are is a disaster waiting to occur. Can we allow half of the 130,000 new voters to cast votes based on misconceived views? Democracy dies in darkness. I want to add to that. Democracy dies in darkness; many lie in darkness. Critically analyzing whatever a party or politician proposes is important, yet many youths, are not able to do it at a ripe age of 18.
Yes, schools conduct social studies lessons. But that is all in the classroom; the classroom and the world outside the walls of school is vastly different. However, don’t take my word yet. Why don’t you find a youth, preferably around 18 and has studied social studies before, and ask him (or her): “Who is K Shanmugam and what post does he hold?”
Let’s say the youth is able to answer you correctly (presuming you even know the answer yourself), and for argument’s sake that all youths are well read and are sharp and intelligent and can critically decide who to vote for based on all the information provided to him. Research shows that males’ brain development is complete at 25 years of age, while females are around 22. That is to say that maturity may not be an asset an 18-year-old possesses, yet. Lee Kuan Yew once said, and this I remember fondly, “during those critical years, 35-60, people who carry twice as much responsibility should have two votes. This will make for a more viable system and a more stable society.” Despite the fact that this statement would have drew heavy criticism from the idealistic West should it be proceeded, what late Lee Kuan Yew said does hold some truths. Adults aged 35-60 indeed have been through a lot in life, holds great stake in every election as they just have too much to lose. They have to feed a family, pay for education, pay for the electricity, pay for June holiday trips little Jane wants, pay for the car, the house, the rent, the depts. It is a heavy burden. The vast majority of 18 year olds have never experienced these responsibilities before. Perhaps the most they have been through are ‘O’ and ‘A’ levels. Youths also do not have so much stake in the country; they are still young, who knows where they may migrate to? The need and urgency for a good and strong government to them may therefore be an “important…but not so much lah” issue.
18 years old is the typical enlistment age for National Service for males, and for females, university. They have just finished their ‘A’ levels or maybe are fresh from polytechnic graduation. Life is just hectic for them. These are huge milestones in their lives. Is it then wise to ask them to vote, in the midst of this flurry of activity? Since humans are social creatures, youths are social creatures on steroids. Thinking and decisions may be and can be influenced by peers. Can you imagine a society whose leaders are elected based on peer pressure and influence?
George Floyd’s death in United States is a tragic occurrence. The widespread horror and anger by Americans are influenced by their painful history- blacks were the white’s slaves. In Singapore, we do see racism, but vastly on a less severe scale. The situation is different. Similarly, our education system is different. Different not just from United States but from many other countries. Our culture places education in one of a youth’s top priority, and so our education system is longer. Our students spend longer time studying. It is hence unfair to compare other countries with Singapore as other countries’ youths might already be out working for a living while our youths are still studying. Hence, the decision to reduce voting age in Singapore cannot just be done to be “in line with international norms” – Singapore’s situation is vastly different from others. Just because free speech is the “norm” with many other countries does not mean Singapore should leave free speech unchecked.
Rome wasn’t built in a day, and Singapore certainly was not. It was built on the foundation of years of blood and sweat, among the roughest seas and strongest tides. While not built in a day, our admirable rise as a young country in a short span of only 55 years truly is a rare gem among other dried leaves. In a worldwide crisis, many countries are falling and getting sucked into a whirlpool of despair, turning and turning in a widening gyre. Good governance is the adhesive needed to hold the centre, guiding the sails gently to bring the vessel back to the port safety. The voters who choose the men and women who leads Singapore must be man and woman, with enough maturity, experience, and understand the great stake each election holds. Let us not experiment with lower the voting age, for it is an irreversible chemical reaction – once proceeded, it cannot be retracted. The stakes are too high today, especially with Covid-19 prancing past strict border controls and ridiculing government efforts in many countries. The fate of the tiny fort of Singapore rests on a needle, and is up to the people whom the people elected to ensure we do not collapse on this knife edge.
So dear reader: If you are 18 and live in Singapore, congratulations. Although you cannot vote yet, despair not. Your time will come.

Can ‘Domestic Tourism’ In Singapore Ever Be More Than Just Staycations?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-domestic-tourism-singapore-review-staycations/,27-Sep-20,"Everyone likes free money, even when it’s not actually money but credit linked to your Singpass. When the news that all Singaporeans above 18 were getting $100 in SingapoRediscovers vouchers broke, it seemed everyone I met that day was already planning their next staycation.
Contrast this to a month ago, when the S$45 million dollar campaign—a mix of hotel and attraction bundles, walking tours and curated neighbourhood itineraries—was first announced. At least on social media, the general response seemed to be one of disinterest or even confusion. As one Twitter user put it: “Genuine question: what does domestic tourism in Singapore mean?”
From the reactions of those around me, the answer seemed to be: staycation, or USS.
Even the TODAYonline telegram channel I get my news from captioned the story, “You can get SingapoRediscovers vouchers for that staycation you want.”
Pick one: staycation, zoo, or USS. (Source: CNA/AFP)
One can hardly fault STB for this; while one is unlikely to “rediscover” Singapore in a hotel room or when riding Battlestar Galactica, hotel staycations and—judging by the number of USS vlogs I’ve seen on Youtube recently—USS tickets pretty much sell themselves. In fact, I would wager that the reason places like Universal Studios are doing so well is because they’re distinctly not seen as tourism, but a date-spot, place to visit with friends, or a place to bring your kids because it’s the school holidays and they’re driving you nuts.
To be fair, the VisitSingapore website does feature a list of discounted tours such as Insta-walks, bike tours and even tours to Pulau Ubin, as well as guides to “SingapoRediscovers precincts”, promoting places of interest to explore on your own.
So maybe this boils down to the general Singaporean sentiment that “there’s nothing to do in Singapore”. But is there really nothing to do here? And can domestic tourism actually appeal to locals?
In the spirit of “rediscovery”, I dragged an unsuspecting friend with me to Chinatown one afternoon, a walking tour from the VisitSingapore website in hand, wondering if domestic tourism could actually work.
A shopfront in Chinatown.
The Politics of Heritage
Chinatown is a great many things. I’ve heard people describe it as a “tourist trap”, a place to eat mala, and a layover before the bars on Neil Rd.
Not unexpectedly though, the walking tour was focused on the area’s “heritage”, highlighted by the first two stops on the trail, the Chinatown Heritage Centre and iconic Sri Mariamman Temple.
Unfortunately, both were closed (thanks, Covid), so we headed to the next stop, the murals at Mohammed Ali Lane and Temple Street, where I was surprised to see some tourist-looking types still snapping shots in their masks.
Cantonese Opera Stage along Temple Street.
If you’ve ever seen a mural around Chinatown and Kampong Glam—think the famous letter writer mural—chances are they were painted by Yew Yip Chong. His cheery murals, found mostly around so-called “heritage” areas and in some HDB estates, typically depict deeply nostalgic, long-gone scenes.
Well, nostalgic for someone my parents’ age or older. After all, can you miss something you never got to experience?
While I snapped away at the painted faces of the mural, I realised with that twinge of guilt I always feel whenever confronted with my cultural alienation, that I had never seen a traditional Chinese opera show, let alone a makeshift one by a street more colourful than it is now.
To those who had experienced Chinatown before it was “sanitised”, I can imagine a tour of the current Chinatown may also entail a sense of loss, as I felt upon viewing the artist’s depiction—essentially all that remains of it.
Not all historical sights are preserved either. Missing from Yew’s murals is Sago Street where Yew grew up, only two streets away from the opera mural.
Infamously known as the Street of the Dead, it was a stretch of funeral parlours and home to loud wakes and the washing of nude corpses in open daylight. In a CNA interview, he stated that he has avoided the topic “due to the taboo behind death”, but I wondered, even if Yew had wanted to depict such a macabre subject—a huge departure from his usual cheery works—if it would be approved in a country where street art remains highly regulated.
All conservation is an active process of selecting the narratives that make up “place-identities”, the collection of ideas around a place and its identity, and prone to “tweaks” by those doing that active selection according to objectives and ideologies. The seedier aspects of Kreta Ayer, such as the brothels immortalised in Charmaine Leung’s autobiographical 17A Keong Saik Road, or taboo subjects like the lesbian relationships many Samsui women and ma jies long-associated with the area entered into, may have limited space in the curated image of Chinatown.
The way “heritage” is packaged in Singapore—in forms easy-to-digest, state-sanctioned, and infinitely instagrammable—may be optimised to draw tourists, but may put off locals. The transplantation of palm trees to the neighbourhood and influx of Middle Eastern restaurants in Kampong Glam have been criticised by the original residents for “Arabising” the landscape at the expense of the area’s original Malay-Muslim culture.
And additions like the shamelessly-touristy Chinatown Food Street do little to convince locals that the original charm of the area is being preserved. When we passed by it was nearly deserted, while the basement of People’s Park Centre where we had lunch was packed.
Does It Matter Whether or Not We Call It Tourism?
Next on our list was the famous Tong Heng Egg Tart, which turned out to be the most popular “attraction” that day.
Unfortunately, instead of the air-conditioned experience sipping tea and eating egg tarts the guide promised, we were relegated to the back of a long queue outside the store, which had limited its service to pick-up only.
And it wasn’t even lunch hour.
30 minutes later, we came away with piping hot egg tarts and a newfound respect for Singaporeans ability to queue for food on a hot Monday afternoon.
To beat the heat, we wandered off-course to Maxwell Food Center in search of a cold drink. As we ordered two glasses of sugar cane juice, I recalled Ghib Ojisan, the Japanese Youtuber popular for his vlogs of local neighbourhoods and food spots, mentioning in a video that he always ordered sugar cane juice whenever he visited hawker centres.
For all of Singaporeans’ complaints that Singapore is a cultural wasteland, the popularity of Youtube channels that explore local neighbourhoods and food—think channels like Georgia Casey, Our Grandfather Story, and even the Food King series by Night Owl Cinematics—shows that there is an appetite for content about local places, culture, and certainly, food.
Screengrabs of Youtube videos about local neighborhoods and food spots from (clockwise from top left) Our Grandfather Story, Georgia Casey, Eatbook and Ghib Ojisan (Source: Youtube)
Food is the most tangible and authentic—though some Malaysians may disagree—aspect of “Singaporean culture” locals can point to. If “heritage” tourism here lacks the authenticity to attract locals, “Ghib Ojisan”-style tourism—the hawker centres, the last vestige of street culture that existed before hawkers were shuttled into buildings; and coffeeshops— is ordinary, everyday, “heartland”.
Here may be where our difficulty in grasping what “domestic tourism” in Singapore is. Much of tourism fails to appeal to locals, while the “live like a local” tourism doesn’t feel like tourism when you’re already a local.
But even if “domestic tourism” is nothing but a marketing term, this is mainly an issue of semantics. If the issue is getting locals to fill the gap foreign tourist dollars left behind, rather than point us to the same tired-old spots built over with tourists in mind, perhaps focus on promoting less-known local businesses to spend at, where it might do more good than if it were spent on another multinational brand on Orchard Road.
Meanwhile, tourist-dependent businesses have to tweak their value propositions to appeal to locals. Browsing the list of tours on the Visit Singapore site, the tour “Creepy Tales of Singapore” immediately jumped out to me, with its premise to take one around areas like Haw Par Villa at night with “ghost-hunting” gear that can’t be beat by “but I can just go Haw Par Villa myself what”.
I was almost tempted to ask a friend to sign up to go ghost-hunting with me when the price made me baulk. Even after the discount, it takes up the entirety of the $100 voucher payout.
With an additional offer for students or bulk sign-ups—local tours are now allowed up to 10 participants—I could see them drawing some of the crowd already used to paying eighty dollar tickets for Haunted Horror Nights at Universal Studios, which was cancelled this year.
But this is not just a question of economics, but one about our identity. If our only conception of tourism here is hotel rooms and Universal Studios, what does that say about our own conception of Singapore?
That’s why I hope to see more from the campaign that is actually in the spirit of rediscovery. While domestic tourism remains an abstract idea now, it doesn’t always have to be. If local businesses and culture are given the support and space needed to flourish, they may not have to exist only in murals for future generations.

Is It Possible To Feed Our Nation with Just Caifan?",Abigail Ang,TRUE,TRUE
Covid-19: The Public Scapegoating Of Bats Needs To Stop,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-covid-19-public-scapegoating-bats-needs-stop/,27-Mar-20,"All photos by Sanjitpaal Singh / Jitspics.com
The world is now in the throes of a COVID-19 pandemic.
Although the origin and cause of the outbreak have still not been identified, right from the beginning the media was rife with the usual inflammatory statements speculating bats to be the main suspects.
There is still a lack of conclusive evidence tracing the disease back to bats – the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus has not even been detected in bats yet, and even if it is, this doesn’t prove a direct transmission route from bats to humans, as other factors (and possibly other animals) may have been involved in causing the outbreak.
Let’s not forget, bats were not recorded or reported to be at the Wuhan market when the outbreak started. Yet the supposed ‘bat origin’ of this so-called “bat-borne virus” was quickly propagated and accepted as fact amongst the general public.
This led to further irresponsible speculations quickly surfacing about the outbreak being caused by the consumption of “bat soup”—fake news that has now been debunked.
To this day, bats have not been proven to be the cause of the outbreak. Yet the psychological link between bats and COVID-19 has already been created and solidified in many people’s minds.
Virologists, disease ecologists, public health officials and science communicators need to realise the impact their words have on the public psyche, and also on the wellbeing and conservation of bats.
Public speculation about the link between bats and diseases is dangerous and unhelpful—particularly when the supporting evidence is still weak. When bats continue to be framed so negatively in disease research and its media coverage, this results in unnecessary scaremongering that does nothing to help address the actual outbreak, but does instead stoke fear and hatred of bats—an already maligned animal group that continues to suffer from an undeserved negative public image.
Project Pteropus mist netting bat pollinators in a durian orchard in Malaysia
This kind of storytelling is incredibly damaging and harmful. It threatens the safety of bat populations, and ultimately reduces support for bat conservation efforts. Indeed, the typical comments in response to such news is to call for the eradication of bats.
Once people have been led to develop unnecessary fear and paranoia around bats, it becomes very difficult to counter this, even with positive messaging about the beneficial aspects of bats.
If people are being forced to make a psychological choice between ecosystem services and their own health and safety, it’s not hard to see what choice they’re going to make.
In my own work alone, potential project partners have declined to support our bat outreach efforts because they worry that being associated with bats will hurt their businesses due to the COVID-19 hysteria.
A member of the public even complained to a wildlife officer about my team catching and handling bats for research—spurred by an unfounded concern about COVID-19.
Modern zoonotic outbreaks are clearly driven by the environmental destruction wrought by humans. As such, the best prevention method is in fact conservation action to preserve wildlife habitat, maintain wildlife populations in the wild, and reduce contact between wildlife and humans/livestock.
This fact has long been recognised and championed by the holistic One Health approach that recognises how environmental, animal, and human health are intertwined, equally important, and must all be prioritised concurrently.
This crucial message needs to be repeatedly highlighted; however, even in this effort there needs to be careful and sensitive messaging to the public.
The durian pollinating Cave Nectar Bat (Eonycteris spelaea)
We must not teach people to fear close proximity with bats. We need people to appreciate, value, and celebrate the nature that’s on their doorstep, in a safe and respectful way.
Conservationists, disease researchers, and communicators should avoid creating an assumption that human health can only be safeguarded by a total and complete separation between people and bats.
This is highly counter-productive and can have disastrous effects in places where local communities coexist with bats in the same space, which is common in both rural and urban areas.
In some places, this close-proximity coexistence has been the norm for generations despite the availability of pristine, high-quality bat habitat right next door; bats do often make a deliberate choice to roost amongst or near humans for no discernible reason.
In other cases, a loss of habitat and food resources can drive bats to suddenly move into human-dominated areas. Once bats establish themselves in this way it is exceedingly difficult—close to impossible—to remove them, even with lethal methods.
The last thing we need is for people to start panicking over this ‘forced’ coexistence, especially in places where bats and humans have had such a long history of cohabiting safely without disease spillover.
Certainly, we should teach people the right ways to live safely with bats in order to prevent zoonotic spillover.
Culling bats should never be attempted or promoted as a form of disease prevention and control. Yet people who have been led to specifically fear bats as disease vectors often do exactly that. Already we are hearing reports of bats being burned to death in Indonesia by the authorities, beaten to death by members of the public in Australia, and even thrown down a rubbish chute by urban residents in Singapore.
In Singapore, wildlife managers are fielding complaints and removal requests from the public who don’t want bats around urban housing areas. The backlash is very real, and it’s already begun.
With bats playing such critical roles in maintaining ecosystem health, their disappearance could cause multiple ecosystems to unravel and ultimately collapse.
Killing bats thus simply creates a ticking time bomb, leading to a new ecological crisis we’ll have to deal with later down the line.
The more immediate, short-term risk of such action is that it facilitates greater exposure to, and transmission of, disease.
So aside from jeopardising the welfare of bats, nature, and long-term human wellbeing, people who attempt to eradicate bats put themselves in direct contact with stressed and panicked animals that are far more likely to transmit pathogens—ironically, the very nightmare scenario that disease researchers and public health officials are trying to prevent.
Negative portrayals of bats thus undermine conservation and public health goals equally.
Instead, disease researchers, public health officials and science communicators should collaborate and coordinate closely with bat researchers and conservationists to devise more constructive communication on this topic.
There should be an integrated effort to ensure that public messaging and community engagement is sensitively crafted, and responsibly executed. If we can commit to this common goal, and execute this more holistic and interdisciplinary approach, we’ll finally be able to produce the right kind of information and messages to the benefit of both bats and humans.

8 Headlines You Missed Because Of Covid-19","Sheema Abdul Aziz, PhD",TRUE,TRUE
Migrant Workers’ Dorms Were Always Ticking Time-Bombs. Singapore’s Failure To Act Sooner Is Inexcusable.,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-covid-19-migrant-worker-dorms-delay-inexcusable/,6-Apr-20,"Unless otherwise stated, all images in this piece were supplied by residents of the Cochrane dormitory, who cannot be named to protect their identities.
Nearly two months have passed since early February, when the first cases affecting migrant workers were reported. (The critically-ill Bangladeshi worker from the Leo dorm remains in the ICU.) Since then, Covid-19 clusters have mushroomed in workers’ dormitories. The largest, at the S11 Dormitory @ Punggol, went from four cases to 62 in under a week. The Westlite Toh Guan dormitory now has 28.
There are now clusters in at least four other dorms and three worksites. As of Monday morning, over 100 migrant workers have tested positive for Covid-19 in the last week.
As local cases increased, so did fears about asymptomatic transmission. Slowing—and preparing—for community spread quickly became a priority.
And yet, as late as end March, when the entertainment venue closures were announced and many businesses were weeks into their continuity plans, it was still radio silence from the government about the ticking time-bomb that was workers’ dormitories. Now the situation has exploded, and everyone is scrambling.

We might all be in this together, but the brutal truth is that Covid-19 does not affect us all equally.
Social distancing, as a viral social media post put it, is a privilege. It does not apply to the slums of New Delhi or the refugee camps in Cox’s Bazar. In 1800s Singapore, poor Chinese coolies died from tuberculosis by the hundreds because the congested, airless shophouses they lived in made transmission inevitable.
Workers’ dorms are a far cry from decrepit shophouses, but they are still death-traps when it comes to outbreaks like Covid-19.
The very setup of dorms makes safe distancing impossible. A single dorm can house over 10,000 men, who are squeezed 15 to a room on bunk beds, use shared bathrooms, and cook shoulder-to-shoulder by the hundreds in mass kitchens. The minimum floor area per occupant is 4.5m², which means up to 20 workers can be housed in a space the size of a 4-room HDB flat.
Talking about distancing in ‘communal areas’ implies the existence of separate, private spaces. This distinction is useless in dorms, which are entirely made up of communal areas.
It is farcical to stick Xs on half the dining room tables while ignoring the glaring issue of the bedrooms. Many men find them so unbearably stuffy that they would rather sleep out in the open, which they do.
Despite this, as recently as April 2nd, MOM’s advice to dormitory operators was that workers should “stay in their rooms and minimise physical interactions”. No advice was given on how to achieve this—probably because it can’t be done.
Migrant worker NGOs have campaigned about overcrowding in dormitories for years. A 2014 medical sciences paper noted previous outbreaks of typhus and pneumonia, possibly due to dorms’ “high density” and “occasionally less than satisfactory sanitary living conditions”.
After the first cases in February, activists and NGOs sounded the alarm. Cai Yinzhou, the founder of Geylang Adventures, published a note with comprehensive recommendations, including decreasing the number of residents per room and earmarking dorms for suspected cases to be isolated.
On February 10th, MOM issued an advisory recommending the suspension of mass activities and staggering the use of common facilities ‘where possible’. The extent to which this was followed is unclear, and varied with dorms.
Weeks later, MOM’s approach was still focused on ‘education’ and ‘personal responsibility’:
“We ask for the cooperation of workers to take necessary precautions and exercise individual responsibility. MOM also urges … dormitory operators to educate their workers and residents on the advisory to remain at home or in dormitories on their rest days.”
(MOM Press Release, March 25th)
No mention of further distancing measures in dorms appears to have been made till April 1st, after the clusters at S11 and Westlite Toh Guan emerged, and more than a week after MOH announced large-scale distancing measures on March 24th.
Even so, gaps existed in the measures which had been implemented. According to one resident from the Cochrane I dormitory in Woodlands, who cannot be named to protect his identity, temperature-taking was not consistently done because queues were getting too long.
And for all the advice to ‘take precautions’, most dorm residents had not been given masks, hand sanitiser, or extra personal care products. The dorms themselves were still notoriously filthy, with garbage piling up, insect infestations, and broken amenities left unfixed for weeks. The situation had not changed from when I wrote about this in February.
In this context, the emphasis on ‘personal responsibility’ is really little more than ‘thoughts and prayers’. Translation: ‘good luck, you’re on your own’.
A lot can happen in two months. Since February, there have been two (soon to be three) Budgets, two mask distribution exercises, and progressively tighter movement controls. If we want to get things done, we can.
So why the lag? Given the potential for catastrophe, why did the government squander its precious lead time?
Misinformation and poor awareness is a legitimate concern, but a separate issue from dormitory overcrowding, which is beyond either residents’ or dormitory operators’ ability to solve. Only top-down instruction can achieve large-scale coordination of the kind necessary in ordinary times, let alone in a health crisis.
This was a strikingly obvious problem which needed time, attention, and resources to solve. The government could, and should, have acted much sooner. It did so with Singaporeans who needed help getting home from overseas exchanges and job postings. But right under our noses, migrant workers were once again left high and dry.
It would be laughable, and impossible, for the government to claim ignorance of how bad things could get. The more plausible assumption is that they simply did not care enough.
The bitter irony is that Singapore’s legendary preparedness has always been a point of pride. If making contingency plans was an Olympic sport, we would be World No.1. Time after time, our leaders have extolled that our vigilance, foresight, and talent for problem-spotting have saved our asses.
What if food imports dry up? Don’t worry, there’s a plan A, B, C, and D for that. Need to tap into the reserves? We can do that, we’ve been saving very prudently for years. What if Malaysia stops selling us water one day? No worries, we’ve been anticipating that since 1965!
The foot-dragging over workers’ dorms has exposed the hollowness of this self-praise. It is sickening hypocrisy to laud workers for their ‘contributions’ and lament how the UK and Switzerland ‘abandon[ed] any measure’ to contain the virus, when the dormitory issue was left unaddressed in plain sight. Our celebrated, ‘gold standard’ response had a citizenship blind spot.
On Sunday evening, MOM announced that it would finally be taking action to mitigate the spread at dorms. The most sweeping of these was the lockdown at S11 and Westlite Toh Guan, now gazetted as ‘isolation areas’.
Good, you might say: this prevents the spread of cases from these dorms to the wider community. But it also makes sitting ducks of nearly 20,000 men now trapped in a space where transmission is already ongoing. More ominously, it sounds little different from the UK government’s much-derided decision to let ‘herd immunity’ take care of things.
Measures were also announced at other dormitories, including moving ‘essential services’ workers into other spaces, reducing intermingling between floors, and housing sick residents (even if not positive) in isolated sick bays.
All of this is commendable, but comes regrettably late. Over the weekend, activists and NGOs received accounts that sick workers, or workers on LOA/SHN, were still being housed in the same rooms as their counterparts.
Moreover, no timeline has been given for when the new measures would be rolled out, nor any commitment made to giving all workers reusable masks and/or sanitisers.
If we want to prevent further spread in the dorms, decisive steps need to be taken right now. One, ramp up cleaning frequency. Ensure residents are kept well informed, in languages they can understand, and given adequate supplies free of charge.
Workers should also be reassured, in line with the government’s announcements, that they will not be penalised in any way for seeing a doctor and/or missing work. Operators who do not comply should be held accountable in the strictest possible terms.
Two, alternative housing arrangements should be looked into without delay. It is an ambitious task, but a necessary one, given how safe distancing is essentially futile. TWC2, the NGO, has come up with some suggestions; it is a total failure of imagination, not to mention a huge risk, to say there is simply ‘not enough space’. At the very least, all workers who are sick, on LOA, or SHN, should be promptly isolated in separate facilities.
Say all you want about ‘unity’ or ‘resilience’ or ‘solidarity’: a society is only as good as the protections we offer our most vulnerable. Now is not the time for empty words. We need to stop only caring about our migrant workers when they become corpses.
Migrant worker NGOs and community groups, like HOME, TWC2, itsrainingraincoats, Citizen Adventures, Project Chulia Street, and One Bag One Book, are all in need of assistance. If you are willing and able to, please send support their way.

Amidst Chaos and Confusion, Migrant Workers Describe Fears Over Safety and Salaries",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
Hawker Culture On UNESCO’s Heritage List Means Nothing If No One Takes Over,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-food-hawker-culture-unescos-heritage-list-nothing-no-one-takes-over/,5-Feb-21,"Photography by Marisse Caine and the author.
“We’re a new breed of hawkers armed with fresh ideas, but still rooted by the past.”
Caught between the old ways and new techniques, young hawkers face an uphill task of changing Singaporeans’ set notions of what defines hawker food and culture today. Two camps have surfaced: loyal traditionalists and innovators.
With hawker culture recently added to UNESCO’s list of intangible heritage—along with introductions of a new hawker course and scheme targeted at youths—what does it all mean for this aspect of Singaporean life?
Today, succession problems loom large, threatening the future of Singapore’s much-loved hawker fare. If youths aren’t willing, who will take up the mantle after veteran hawkers hang up their woks? To better understand the motivations of new generation hawkers, we hear personal accounts from three Singaporeans who chose to place family and culinary legacy above all else.
Mike Loh, 29
Third-generation Hawker, Blanco Court Beef Noodles
I had a sudden realisation one day while watching my Dad prepare Hainanese beef noodles. I thought to myself: “Big household brands have so much history, yet they are still good and well-liked by the public. If they can be so successful, why can’t we?”
From then on, I started thinking about ways to grow the family business. Plus, traditional beef noodles is a dish that is rarely seen in the local market; it would have been such a waste if we discontinued.
My aunt, who is the first generation of our family’s business, retired back when I was still in primary school. Thankfully, the business was passed down to my dad, and eventually handed to my brother and I. This makes us the third-generation hawkers of Blanco Court Beef Noodles today.
Mike and his Dad, Max Lo.
I took a Diploma in Sports Science but shifted gears because the continuation of our family’s legacy was of priority to me. My dad, being a traditional man, insisted that I start from the bottom. So I began scrubbing pans, manning the stalls, and learning to cook right after my National Service.
There will always be stress when running a hawker business. Long hours aside, I find that it’s also tough maintaining the quality of our food as we grow. Taste can become inconsistent if brands fail to honour authentic flavours. This is of utmost importance to us and we make it a point to never play a fool with our roots. You have to get this right and naturally, results will show.
With our Food Republic outlet at Parkway Parade, it was a point where we took a leap of faith. Our businesses were already affected due to Covid-19 and we had to do something about it.
There are a wide variety of delivery and contactless payment modes in partnership with Food Republic, so we were able to cater to a larger audience even during the pandemic. These modern approaches allowed us to bounce back from the bleak circuit breaker period.
It’s a partnership that we trust because they’ve also helped us to grow fast at lower costs. Since then, we have expanded to several other Food Republic outlets islandwide.
I’ve heard about new initiatives like the Hawkers Succession Scheme — those are great steps moving forward. Singapore is known for our food so we must do something to sustain it.
I’m certain more hipster hawkers will emerge in the future, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. New age hawkers will honour our heritage food with finesse, perhaps even adding new things like plating to the mix.
I believe that any trend can die out, but one thing won’t: tradition. Things may evolve but our roots will always be there. Let’s say my future kids take over and they pick a retro signboard for the business. If it suits that generation, then okay lor! Ultimately, our cherished recipes will still remain.
Rather than dollars and cents, the job is more about people and the relationships fostered. “Thank you for continuing this” are some precious words I’ve received from returning customers. Each time someone gives us a thumbs up, that makes my job satisfying.
If any young person wants to join the trade, I really wish them well. But first, they must really love what they do.
Mastura, 35
Second-generation Hawker, Hjh Maimunah
Hjh Maimunah? This is all that I’ve known. It’s my livelihood, my family, our heritage.
My siblings and I grew up with the familiar sights and smells of our family’s dishes. Our love for food was cultivated from a very young age. We helped out in little ways through simple tasks like cashiering, waitering and washing of dishes.
Back then, customers would say things like: “Aiyo, you guys know how to do it or not?” Those doubts have vanished.
My mother opened our very first restaurant back in 1992 with the support of my grandmother. Prior to that, she worked in small stalls selling traditional Malay kueh and pastries. I joined right after I graduated from university in 2008.
The reason was simple: If no one took over the business, the following generation would never get to taste certain foods that we grew up with. I refuse to let that become a reality.
I’ve heard some people express their worries as we expanded — things like our business being taken over by external parties. That’s untrue. We’re still us! We safeguard our family’s legacy by ensuring that recipes remain original. Each and every dish is tried and tested every step of the way. Even when using automated woks and combi ovens, we don’t simply innovate without conducting any tests.
These days, the biggest challenge is in getting young blood and Singaporeans to join the trade. Some people hesitate to join a small company like ours as they think it is less stable compared to large corporations. To address this manpower issue, we had to learn to be more adaptive.
Hjh Mainunah Mini at Food Republic @ City Square Mall
For us to really grow, we needed to collaborate with others. Our partnership with Food Republic has helped us to expand without having to spend too much on renovations. At the same time, our manpower issues have been reduced.
Since the food court provides their own staff who handles the clearing of dishes, we manage to save on hiring costs. There is also a dedicated team who manages the operations of the food court as a whole. This has been a great help and an effective solution to our problems.
We were unfamiliar with the process of setting up a stall in the food court, but thankfully, Food Republic provided us with ample resources like branding and operations assistance. From equipment to stall design and the type of licenses to acquire, they’ve guided us through all these different aspects.
Siput Sedut Lemak, one of Hjh Maimunah’s signature dishes
Compared to our other outlets, Hjh Maimunah Mini in Food Republic is strategically set up to serve the more popular dishes. We wanted it to be a convenient option for customers to get their all-time favourites.
Being in a heartland mall, some of them even come during office lunch times to satisfy cravings. Either choice is great; they simply offer a different dining experience.
The goal has always been constant: to build our brand and trust of the community. Whenever people see us, we want them to equate that to good food. We have reached that point after years of hard work. Now, it’s a matter of maintaining that and improving along the way.
In the future, I’d be more than willing to hand the business over than to ever see it come to an end. It doesn’t have to be a family member; the main thing is continuity. Otherwise, it would be a huge loss for both our community and heritage.
For those looking to join the trade, I’ll offer them three words: Never give up.
James Wang, 29
Third-generation Hawker, Haikee Soy Sauce Chicken
We’ve come a long way since the 1950s. Haikee (海记, Hai Ji) first began along Upper Cross Street where my grandad sold steamed chicken rice in push carts. He soon concocted his own soy sauce recipe and made it unique to our family.
Most of our customers remember us. They’d say: “Aren’t you guys from Upper Cross Street? My parents used to always buy from you.” It makes me smile knowing that we’re playing a crucial role in the lives of others and it’s not just an eat-and-go situation.
As much as possible, we want to honour past hardships and memories. My dad, who first took over from my grandfather, managed to secure a small stall. At first, he didn’t even have enough money to change our signboard, resorting to a plain red cloth for recognisability. It’s the reason why red is still prominent in our current one today.
Before I joined the trade, I was reflecting on our family’s slogan: “Taste of the past, sharing the future.” How can we move forward but preserve the old? It’s not as simple as it sounds and a challenge that many new hawkers face.
I first began by learning to cook, serve and chop the chicken. It’s tough work but when being on the ground, you slowly get to understand people and become a better problem-solver.
Unlike the older generation who entered the trade for economic survival, youths aspire to create a brand, start a franchise and expand to different locations. Things are simply not the same anymore and we can’t always expect them to be. To survive, we must stay relevant.
When my brother and I first took over, we started to incorporate new technologies into our business operations as well, such as the auto-lifting of noodles. Among the older generation, seeing is believing. If they personally witness how new methods help to save time yet produce similar results, they will come to accept it. Change is a hard thing for everyone.
Our new outlet at Food Republic @ 313 Somerset recently launched in February. This partnership was a bold step for us but one that we felt is necessary. Apart from being a well-established brand in Singapore, Food Republic shares the same vision as we do when it comes to heritage preservation. You see it in their food court designs and in the tenants they pick — they all deliver a nostalgic, familiar feel.
When I heard about hawker culture being listed in UNESCO’s list, it felt like the Grammy Awards. It’s the recognition that hawkers like my granddad deserves. With upcoming hawkerpreneurship programmes, we’re also on our way to destigmatising hawkers as failures.
It’s impossible to sustain the hawker culture alone. Moving forward, it’s clear that hawker business will become a dynamic ecosystem. Living in the digital age, it’s also important that we explore new means of communication. That way, we can then connect with a wider audience.
When working with brands like Food Republic, we’re opening doors to outreach opportunities. Chats like these, for instance, can be hard to come by. We’re grateful to be given a platform where we can share our humble story to a wider audience.
Above all, I am just glad to pursue the dream of continuing the family’s business. Food has always been where my heart lies. It’s an honour to preserve Singapore’s hawker culture – it’s becoming increasingly endangered and we mustn’t let that go on.
It’s clear that Mike, Mastura and James embody the spirit of new generation hawkers dedicated to preserving the old while moving forward with the times. Frustrating as this process can be, it is this shared belief that keeps them going: With time and effort, things will fall into place.
As a youth myself, I can see why fewer are looking to join the trade. Most of us were taught to strive for a cushy 9-5 job. Better still if you’re a doctor or lawyer earning big bucks; never mind if you have no social life or are constantly fatigued from inhumane working hours. And therein lies our problem, isn’t it? Life as a hawker may not be as glamorous from the get-go, but there is certainly more than meets the eye.
Hawker food is the Lion City’s cub to protect at all costs. It has become so central to our lives and identities at this point that I’m certain none of us would ever like to witness its death. Till then, preservation remains an uncertain but hopeful journey — and we’re happy to let these young hawkers lead the way.

1. First it Was Australia, Now it’s Chernobyl: Apocalyptic Wildfires Continue to Rage
As if a separatist struggle and a pandemic were not enough, locals in Ukraine set fire to grass (an offence that carries a fine). Since April 4 the blaze has spread, creeping frighteningly close to Chernobyl’s exclusion zone. Yes, that’s right. Chernobyl.
The site of the worst nuclear disaster in history. The government has since tracked down and arrested the arsonist and said that the fires are under control. But Greenpeace Russia has added a note of caution: this is the worst blaze they’ve seen in decades and has reached within a kilometre of Chernobyl’s defunct plant.

2. Second Source of Proof That The Apocalypse is Here: a Swarm of Locusts
By now you’ll have heard grim proclamations by citizens in the global south that starvation will get them before the pandemic does. This is proving to be the case in countries across east Africa.
Billions of locusts in swarms that are twice the size of Singapore have descended on countries like Ethiopia, Sudan, Uganda, Eritrea, and Tanzania. They’ve eaten their way through sorghum, wheat and corn crops and destroyed grazing land for cattle. The pandemic had already affected livelihoods and a fragile healthcare system in Africa. The locust swarm is only going to make that worse.
An aside about locusts: they are short-horned grasshoppers. They’re usually solitary but if a wet season follows a drought, these perfectly innocuous, usually harmless creatures get a shot of serotonin in the brain (that chemical which makes you feel happy and sexy) and, well, become insanely sociable. They also breed like crazy. And eat. Hence the swarms.
Wingless nymphs become winged adults and voila, what is basically a massive locust party spells disaster and death for humans. To give you a little perspective: a swarm can typically eat in one day, the same amount of food as 35,000 people. Gives you a whole new way of thinking about hedonism.

3. Further Proof That Nature Doesn’t Give A Crap About Your Future Plans or Your Historical Heritage
Lightning and thunderstorms have been decimating structures, killing people and wreaking havoc across provinces in Cambodia. Nothing has been spared, including the country’s iconic Angkor World Heritage Site in Siem Reap. Seven large trees were struck down in the Ta Phrom and Angkor temple complex areas. Local businesses have also suffered damage.
A significant drop in footfall due to the pandemic though, does mean that these ancient temples will suffer less damage caused by thousands of tourists haphazardly climbing and touching the structures, just to take dumb-ass selfies.
Also in happier news, the Indochinese silvered langurs, which are endangered according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), are thriving in eastern Cambodia. The latest count is 3,000. They are technically safe in wildlife sanctuaries. But illegal loggers and wildlife hunters don’t give a shit about biodiversity or about forests. So maybe the pandemic is keeping the jerks away, and the langurs are sleeping better at night.

4. Indigenous Nations in Brazil For The Win
By now I think we’ve established that much of the world is currently being governed by idiots. They tweet, they say stupid things on Facebook, they disavow, they denigrate and they destroy. Brazil’s President Jair Bolsonaro is no exception to this rule.
As if his attitudes to the pandemic weren’t maddening, his administration also represents the most recent, devastating threat to indigenous peoples and biodiversity in the Amazon.
But you don’t fuck with indigenous peoples and get away with it.
The Kinja indigenous people started community action and resistance, following a planned construction of a 720-kilometre power transmission line through the Waimiri-Atroari Indigenous Reserve in the Amazon rainforest. Government officials responded with racist rhetoric.
But here’s the twist: the Kinja people have been given the right to respond, and the government has been ordered by a federal judge in the country, to publish that letter on all government websites for 30 days. This terrific judge has also ruled that the government needs to develop an anti-discrimination indigenous program and actively work to discourage officials from engaging in racist rhetoric and inciting racial discrimination.
That would be like giving migrant workers in Singapore the chance to … oh wait, okay nevermind. Or a judge ordering a government official to apologise for that discriminatory statement about a virus clearing out a … okay, yeah. No that won’t happen.

5. The Next Time You Want to Insult Someone, Don’t Call Them a “Neanderthal”
Because to you, a piece of string or cord that you’re fiddling with might be proof that your clothes are fraying, or that you’ve been watching your cat play with it all day and you are slowly losing your mind in lockdown.
But to the team of archaeologists and paleoanthropologists who found a fragment of cord attached to a long stone tool in a cave in France, it’s exciting proof that Neanderthals twisted barks, fibre and other materials to make clothes, bags, nets and other implements. It means they were engaged in multiple, sequential tasks.
So they understood numeracy and had context-specific memory. That’s on top of the fact that they made art, strung beads, controlled fire and you know … hunted large fucking animals.
And you can’t even figure out how to toggle between presentation, grid and speaker views on Zoom. Shame on you, you Homo Sapien.

6. A New Era of Performance Art Emerges in Indonesia
To my editors: no, this has nothing to do with the dreaded C-19 pandemic. This is a performance art initiative started by youth in Kepuh village, Java, Indonesia to revive, interrogate and investigate the dreaded pocong figure from Indonesian folklore.
Said to be the soul of a dead person trapped in its shroud, young Indonesians have been exploring how the pocong speaks to the “dematerialization of the art object”, and successfully blends the pre-colonial folk stories of Javanese people with modern-day anxieties around survival and resistance to political corruption and ineptitude. “Our politicians are like pocongs, neither dead, nor alive,” one young artist remarked, on the sidelines of a performance piece.
The performance art initiative has involved several people dressing up as the undead / wandering souls and hanging out on benches, doing nothing (it’s difficult to move when you’re wrapped up like a corpse).
Sightings have caused widespread panic and villagers have begun staying indoors to avoid the pocong figures. Authorities, who have thus far failed miserably at imposing curfews and lockdowns during the pandemic, have thanked the artists for contributing to the national effort to beat the spread of Covid-19 in Indonesia.

7. Proof That Counselling And Therapy Should Always Be An Essential Service
The Adult Protective Service says that the number of seniors and people with disabilities who have been abused has doubled in the last few years. Last year, a total of 209 cases were reported. Most of the abused were hurt by their children and stepchildren. If this isn’t proof that there are plenty of people in dire need of counselling support, we don’t know what is.
Here’s a wild suggestion: keep the abusers in indefinite lockdown and let trained caretakers and therapists (and other decent folk) out to enjoy the great outdoors and their civil liberties, when the pandemic ends.

8. Because Those Government Payouts Are Not Enough, Two Idiots Start a Side Hustle
A 19 and 20-year old duo scammed more than 80 people out of $30,000 by pretending to sell Nintendo Switch consoles on Carousell, at a time when the prices of consoles have surged over three times to $650. They got paid and the consoles never materialised. Neither did the guys. They did get caught though and investigations are ongoing.
But look people, it takes two hands to clap. I get it. You’re going stir-crazy during the lockdown, but you haven’t turned into a blubbering idiot yet. So the next time you think you’ve struck gold and got a sweet deal on a much-prized material object to tide you through these tough times, think twice before you press the “Deal” button. Because someone’s hustling you.

This was during the early 2000s, a simpler time when emotional breakthroughs were achieved via Linkin Park songs. In an era when Fred Durst was an actual icon and people were unironically listening to Sisqo’s Thong Song, all I wanted was a beanie from 77th Street. As part of my teenage quest for status symbols, I wanted to be known as The Guy Who Always Wore a Beanie.
And so I wore a damn knitted cap for months, convinced I was a cool kid despite the streams of sweat cascading down my Gatsby-gelled noggin every time I stepped outside. My mother was impressed by my juvenile perseverance for this look—up till the night when we were all watching David Blaine encase himself in a block of ice on Channel 5.
As the family watched the brooding, overdramatic magician enduring the cold stunt for hours with a beanie on, my mother suddenly chimed in with genuine concern: “Are you trying to look like him? You know he’s a Jew right?”
To be fair, he did look pretty cool in a beanie. Photo: YouTube Screengrab.
Even today, way past the beanie-donning days and a cringe-worthy foray into fedoras, I don’t know if I can blame her, my father, or any other Malay-Muslims in their generation for their distrust of Jewish people. Unfortunate as it is, anti-semitism is common within Malay-Muslim households in Singapore—many other impressionable kids like me have been taught and told that “Jews were bad people”.
Unlike the Western notion that connects Jews with money, our families associated them with wanton cruelty. Jahat macam orang Yahudi (“as wicked as a Jew”) has been a common refrain. Perangai Yahudi (“Jewish behaviour”) is used as an insult, but the enduringly popular perangai babi (“pig-like behaviour”) just rolls off the tongue better.
This ingrained anti-semitism stems primarily from the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian hostilities, a century-long struggle taking place nearly 8,000 km away from Singapore. Like many other Muslims here or around the world, we’ve been horrified and disgusted to the point of jadedness at the horrors of eviction, homelessness, death, and destruction erupting in the region.
These days, the constant barrage of information online is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, we’re getting live, intimate updates of the dire situation in Gaza; an on-the-ground showcase of brutal bombing campaigns. On the other, it intensifies the anti-semitism (or anti-Palestinian sentiments, if you’re on the other side) with dozens of one-sided videos, clips, and posts. Facebook algorithms and WhatsApp chat groups aren’t exactly known for providing nuance.
The re-ignition of intense discord in recent weeks—erupting in the worst violence between Israelis and Palestinians in years—can’t be avoided on social media, or at least, across my personal feed. Posts made by social justice circles went viral before getting unceremoniously taken down. The Islamic Religious Council of Singapore (MUIS) condemned Israel’s violence against worshippers holding Ramadan prayers at Jerusalem’s Al-Aqsa mosque (but not everyone agreed with them reaffirming Singapore’s two-state solution stance).
Others reckoned with the guilt of visiting family members in their fresh Hari Raya outfits, stuffing themselves with ketupat and rendang while Palestinians marked Eid with bombs raining down on their homes.
As I watched my mother doing her market shopping with a #FreePalestine tote bag and heard my dad reminisce about their trip to Al-Aqsa—the very same holy site where Israeli forces fired tear gas and stun grenades last week—it begged the question: Why is solidarity with Palestine such an entrenched notion within Singapore’s Malay-Muslim community, bordering on the edges of anti-semitism?
The obvious answer is, of course, affinity with fellow Muslims—especially innocent Muslim civilians who have lost homes, family members, and lives in a bleak humanitarian crisis with no end in sight. If you ask the people behind @left.sg, Muslims in Singapore have been in solidarity with Palestine “since day one”, citing reports from 1947 of a massive protest in Kampong Glam denouncing the United Nations’ partitioning of Palestine into Jewish and Arab States.

Suffian Hakim, author of ethnically-tinged comedic novels like Harris bin Potter and the Stoned Philosopher, posted a more serious, nuanced note on Facebook when he was asked why the Malay community has been “so extra” of late about the plight of Palestinians. Aside from religious solidarity with Muslims worldwide, he puts forth that it is our recognition of privilege in Singapore (peace, prosperity, religious stability) that drives the community to be so public about the struggles on the other side of the world.
More importantly, Suffian attributes the unjustified violence against Palestinians to the Israeli government instead of blaming the Jewish people.
“Not Jews. Not Israelis as a people. It’s this current far-right, hardline Israeli government and its institutions that displace thousands of families, whose bullets and missiles have killed children.”

Like myself, he too, grew up with some anti-semitism at home. Like myself, he too eventually realised the difference between the Israeli people and the Israeli government. I asked Suffian why the older folks in our community still hold deep grudges against Jews, which they’ve passed down to their kids.
“I honestly think because most of them reached political maturity around the time of the first Intifada. Our parents and older relatives were in their 20s and 30s when the first Intifada happened and they split their media consumption mainly between local TV and Malaysian channels like RTM and TV3, right?”
This much was true. I’m carbon dating myself, but my childhood did involve jiggling around the old TV antenna as my dad messed around with the tuner to receive Malaysian broadcasts. Malaysian news channels, as Suffian points out, showed a lot of footage of suffering Palestinians, no doubt with an Islamic slant to the ongoings of the crisis.
This, on top of the Singaporean Malay community’s cultural similarities and familial connections with Malaysian Malays—a country that still has yet to recognise Israel’s sovereignty.

Closer to home, it didn’t help that the local Malay-Muslim community were not taken into account in the early days of National Service, modelled after the mandatory conscription of the Israeli Defense Forces, and even with Israeli military advisers brought in to help set the programme up. What’s not widely known is that Malay youths were excluded from conscription from 1967 to as late as 1984, which in turn, held dire consequences for the community’s socio-economic standing. When they were eventually let in, they were mostly deployed to serve in the police force or the fire brigade.
Those who managed to make it into the military were given menial jobs. Alon Peled, an associate professor and political scientist at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, noted in his paper (A Question of Loyalty: Ethnic Minorities, Military Service and Resistance) that discrimination against Malays in the military was simultaneously surreptitious and obvious:
“By the second half of the 1970s, Malay exasperation with military recruitment and discrimination policies reached an all-time high. Even without official data, Malay parents knew that their children alone were not called upon to serve. Malay officers and (non-commissioned officers) who had been transferred from field command positions to the logistics corps were also frustrated. Nearly every officer knew that military units had informal quotas on Malays.”
That distrust from the early days extended into an overarching wariness of Jewish people, compounded by how little they’ve been exposed to Jewish culture or even the small Jewish community in Singapore.

While I’m certainly not equipped to outline the contours of the Israeli-Palestine crisis, I’m sure that we can differentiate an entire Jewish race from the actions of the Israeli government and the far-right fringes of Israeli settlers forcing Palestinians out of their homes. Just as the other side can differentiate innocent Palestinians from the actions of Hamas.
You can protest unjustified violence without resorting to abject anti-semitism. Direct your criticism at the crimes of apartheid and persecution perpetrated by Israeli authorities. Blame the British imperial colonisers. Point fingers at extremists on both sides who intentionally fan the flames of hate.
It would also be right for the Singaporean Malay-Muslim community to realise that not all Jewish people are against them, many of whom have even publicly spoken out against violence against Palestinians by establishing advocacy groups or taken other more extreme measures.
It is, however, not a controversial stance to sympathise with those who’ve suffered heavier losses.

Taking a step back, there are other more immediate priorities to worry about, like the recent spike in COVID-19 cases here. But when one grapples with the idea of not being able to celebrate Hari Raya Aidilfitri properly this year against the fear of airstrikes raining on clinics, hospitals, homes, and children, one can’t help but reflect on the cyclical nature of perpetual strife and ingrained animosity. And hope for better days.

With Another Year Of Covid In Singapore Comes Another Wave Of Racism",Ilyas Sholihyn,TRUE,TRUE
Millennial Employee Reviews His Boss’s Spending Habits In His 20s,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-millennial-employer-personal-finance-cpf-retirement/,12-May-20,"I had ulterior motives when I approached my boss Jason to pitch an article about his spending habits.
After all, Jason turns thirty next year. An important milestone in life. Recently, he got married and took out a mortgage on an HDB flat, financing the down payment with a mix of cash and CPF contributions from his Ordinary Account (OA).
His story, I argued, could be very relatable to Singaporeans who are still in their 20s, trying to figure out their personal finances.
I had the trap laid out perfectly. First, I’d pretend to be a sympathetic ear by asking him about his spending habits. Next, I’d feed him my own personal morsel of financial heartbreak to get him to confide in me his deepest and darkest secrets. Then, I’d take his confessions and pick them apart, line by line, until he becomes a sobbing mess on the floor.
Toxic, bullying behavior? Or qi being redirected back at the capitalist oppressor?
By doing this, did I run the risk of losing my job? Sure. But that’s a risk I’m willing to take to give the huddled Singapore masses #content they deserve: pure schadenfreude at my boss’s expense.
The road to unemployment.
My Boss In His Own Words: A Personal Finance Journey in His 20s
My savings fluctuated quite a bit in my 20s. I started working in uni, where I held three jobs: barista, tuition teacher and freelance writer. At my peak, I was making around S$3,000-S$3,600 per month. During that time, I saved around 50% of my earnings every month, mainly because I was too busy between work and study to spend any of it.
After I started work full time, my spending went up. Growing up, I didn’t get much pocket money, so having disposable income suddenly was novel to me. During this time, I saved roughly 20-30% of my average paycheck.
I don’t buy a lot of things, but when I do, they tend to be big ticket items: Filson bags, nice restaurant meals with my girlfriend (now wife). I also started drinking more alcohol after graduating. Mainly craft beers, wine, or a gin and tonic after work.
Growing the company hasn’t always been easy, so I’ve spent some money trying to “take the edge off” as they say. Both my wife and I plan on cutting back on alcohol during this circuit breaker. When you’re stuck at home, the days seem to blur into one another.
In terms of wasteful spending, I’ve bought a lot of books I didn’t end up reading. I always think I’m going to do a deep dive into a topic, but usually find myself too exhausted from work to read, so the books just keep piling up and cost me about S$100-150 per month.
The most ridiculous thing I’ve spent money on was a Samsung S10e phone. This was back when my old iPhone 4S started dying and I switched to Android. I never got used to it, so I gave the phone to my dad. I’d spent S$1,000+ on the phone, and an extra S$100 on a case and screen protector before giving it away. Then I switched back to Apple and upgraded to an iPhone XS for another S$1,000+. It was a weird time in my life.
Still, I have managed to save up a ‘rainy day’ fund in my 20s to cover at least five months of expenses (six months if I stretch it). Last year, my wife and I took out a mortgage for a modest sized HDB flat, which was partially funded by our CPF Ordinary Account (OA). This has emptied out most of our cash savings.
Looking ahead at my long term goals, I probably plan to retire past 65. If I had to guess, I’ll need at least S$2,500 to $3,000 per month to retire comfortably. Have I ever topped up my CPF Special Account (SA) beyond what’s required from my salary and my employer? Nope. Right now, I keep my emergency fund and leftover savings in the bank, earning between 2.1% to 3% interest. I also give my parents money, in cash deposited directly into their bank account.
An Employee’s Reaction To His Employer’s Story
I was furious after our interview ended.
Instead of confirming every suspicion I had about his incompetence, I found myself relating to my employer on a human level. A classic case of Stockholm Syndrome.
And while I still had to use my finance major and three CFA exams worth of study hours to tear his financial life apart, hearing my boss’s story had ruined the mood. While I wasn’t exactly punching down, it didn’t feel like punching up either.
To be honest: Jason wasn’t in such bad financial shape.
He’s been lucky enough to earn enough income to accumulate a five month rainy day fund and saved 20-30% of his take home pay. This is especially important in his 20s. We should all be ‘paying ourselves first’ by setting aside a small portion of every paycheck in a separate savings account, one that we don’t touch except for emergencies.
Fortunately, this is where the positives end.
What’s So Special About the Special Account (SA)?
Perhaps the easiest win Jason could’ve taken would be to hop in a time machine, sign up for a library card, and redirect the S$100-150 per month he pretentiously spent on books (yuck) and use it to top up his CPF Special Account (SA), which is designed for his retirement. For just S$100 a month, at interest rates of up to 5% p.a., he could be growing his retirement nest egg by more than $24,000 in 15 years.
But look, I get it. Even the most financially responsible millennial might balk at stashing money away into CPF that can’t be withdrawn until age 55—except for certain expenses like housing and healthcare. After all, life is about more than just planning for the ‘next thing,’ especially when the next thing after retirement is typically death. What about living in the moment? Spending money on the simple pleasures in the here and now?
All of this is true, which is why moving forward, I wouldn’t recommend Jason top up his SA beyond what he can realistically set aside for the long term. Considering that he just got married, there might be a baby to save up for in the not-too-distant future. Or other short term goals like travel that he may have to prioritise before he and his wife give up their freedom.
At the same time, millennials can’t afford to miss out on the 4% interest rate offered by the SA. Regular top-ups to our SA balance also provide higher monthly payouts when we retire. Even small increments set aside in our 20s could have an outsized impact on our financial future.
Using the handy ‘rule of 72’ with a 4% compounded growth rate, Jason’s SA balance would roughly double every 18 years (72 divided by 4). This means that every S$1,000 sitting in his SA by age 30 would be worth roughly S$4,000 by age 65.
To summarise: millennials in their 20s need to ensure that they make sufficient income to cover their short-term needs first, while also creating a sustainable, long-term plan to top-up their SAs for retirement.
Covid-19 Can Be a Threat or Opportunity For Singaporeans to Right Their Financial Ship
Recent events around Covid-19 and the circuit breaker also presents Jason with an opportunity to kick his household savings rate into overdrive. For example, he’s already planning on cutting back his alcohol consumption.
And since he won’t be going out except for the essentials, he can probably set aside a lot more than he would in a normal month. The government’s Solidarity payout of S$600 (along with other indirect measures), will also help tide him over to pay for essentials during the slow economy and tough financial times brought on by Covid-19.
Covid-19 also highlights the importance of CPF in a crisis. Much like how Singapore’s past reserves have been saved up by previous generations to protect Singaporeans in this downturn, retirees today can also lean on their monthly CPF payouts for their essential needs—without putting too much strain on their children, who are also struggling to adjust to this new reality.
For millennials, Covid-19 won’t be the last crisis we will have to deal with in our lives. Sometimes, the hardships we experience today may give us more perspective of what’s important—giving us more time to right our financial ship early.
A Sad Epilogue To This Personal Finance Hit Piece
For this employee on the other hand, the story doesn’t have a happy ending.
Hmph.
When I finally approached my boss to point out this huge missed opportunity regarding his SA contributions in his 20s, all he did was nod and agree with me. Then he gave me a pat on the back for writing such a terrific piece promoting financial literacy and the importance of doing early and regular CPF top-ups for retirement.
He also had the nerve to suggest I start doing the same. Like this was his idea all along: to educate his employees on the importance of retirement savings, then cash in on their hard work by publishing a branded article about it.
Sometimes when you throw a rock at the system, the rock comes back to hit you.

Don’t let short term events like Covid-19 become a distraction for your long term goals in retirement. Stay the course with small, regular top-ups to your CPF Special Account (SA) to take advantage of the attractive rates. Visit this page for more information.

One Man's Quest To Find Peace In Baking During The CB",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
"From Cancer Scare to One Family Illness After Another, This Is The Life Story Of PSP’s Anthony Lee",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-psp-anthony-lee/,18-Oct-20,"Photography by RICE/Zachary Tang, Images provided by Anthony Lee
“Hi, my name is Anthony. My wife is expecting this year, and I have cancer.”
This was how Anthony Lee introduced himself to me back in 2013. Articulate, well-mannered, and built like a tank, he stood out in the crowd of strength athletes at the table. We were at a Hari Raya party hosted by a mutual strongman friend. Although I was the one speaking directly to him, his casual remarks stunned everyone at the table. The silence was deafening.
What do you say to a stranger who declares he’s marooned between dying and the birth of his first child?
Much later, I asked him how he could have been so nonchalant. He explained that he had wanted to confront his cancer directly and not hide his illness. It helped to reinforce his resolve to stay alive; maybe then, he would live to watch his daughter grow up.
It turns out there was no cancer. But that stroke of luck is a false sign of what’s to come next. Today, his father is vegetative, his wife has a rare visual illness, and his daughter survived a rare childhood inflammatory disease, and is currently undergoing treatment for another rare infection that happened in the middle of 2019.
While all of this was happening, he became involved in politics, going from volunteering for Dr Tan Cheng Bock’s Presidential run in 2011 to co-founding the Progress Singapore Party in March 2019.
Just days before our interview this June, this Cockney-speaking giant was discharged from the hospital for severe acute pancreatitis. He may have escaped cancer himself, but one health crisis after next seems to strike either him or his family like an obsessive Grim Reaper.
For better or worse, this series of unfortunate events has been pivotal to his drive to join politics. The turbulence of providing care for his loved ones reinforced his beliefs that something is deeply wrong and inadequate with our country’s system, where there is not enough compassion for the downtrodden.
The Beginnings
To understand Anthony’s psychology and political values, one cannot ignore his childhood.
Anthony was the first of two sons, born into a family that ran a business selling coffee powder and doing wholesale coffee bean roasting. The business was set up by his father Lee Kim Tow in 1979.
Anthony began having health problems from a young age. Aside from asthma, he recalls his first traumatic health episode at 10-years-old, which involved him waking up one morning and urinating fresh blood. There was no firm diagnosis on the cause of his condition, but doctors suspected IGA nephropathy, a disease related to the kidneys.
This continued for 7 years, occurring a couple times a year. It eventually disappeared after the doctors removed his inflamed tonsils, deducing that the antibodies were attacking his kidneys.
All this took a significant toll on him as a young primary school student. The weekly hospital visits hurt his grades and disconnected him from his friends.
He reminiscences somberly, “Since I was hospitalized a fair bit, it sort of becomes out of sight-out of mind. There was little support from teachers & classmates. The culture back then was to focus on grades and teachers had limited bandwidth to care.”
Despite all this, he developed a complex to help people at all costs. This was largely due to his upbringing, and he would follow his father, who was a fervent grassroots leader for Dr Tan since the 1980s until Dr Tan’s retirement. Mr Lee assisted in relaying concerns from the ground to Dr Tan, the town council, and HDB, and helped settle disputes between market stallholders and hawkers.
Anthony's Dad on his walkabouts.
In reflecting on his younger days, it is evident his life has changed drastically from being cheery to despair. He speaks indulgently about his days of participating in shotput, discus throwing, and basketball and giving private tuition on computers in secondary school during his weekends.
But one mishap after another began piling up. In 1997, he was the unfortunate victim in a street fight—even though he was merely a bystander training at a public basketball court. He was slashed on the right side of his head, and was left with a scar. That was the end of playing basketball. He then moved on to strength training, eventually competing in strongman sports and arm wrestling. Due to an old injury, he eventually shattered his humerus bone (a long bone in the arm that runs from the shoulder to the elbow) and suffered nerve damage.
His doctor said,“It looked like someone took a hammer and smashed a piece of glass or windscreen.”

Cancer Comes Knocking
His brush with death would come in early 2013. He had been hospitalised for heart palpitations due to immense stress from starting his pet care business. A cardiologist referred him to an arrhythmia specialist who presumed he had Wolff Parkinson White syndrome (a rare condition when there is an extra electrical pathway in the heart).
While there, he felt an unusual lump on the right side of his face. After doing some research of his own, he became concerned that it could be cancer, and consulted a variety of doctors and an ENT specialist. Eventually, he was informed around late April that it was a case of Mucoepidermoid Carcinoma in the saliva gland.
Although the doctors insisted on operating on him immediately, he resisted chemotherapy and other invasive treatments. His parents were in denial, and he tried not to dwell on it lest it break their spirits. Instead, he continued training at the gym, and started researching his cancer. Determined to beat it, he took on a number of supplements and a great deal of fruits.
Anthony buying lots of carrots that would hopefully treat his cancer.
Things took a decisive turn later in June 2013 when his wife informed him of her pregnancy.
He explains, “I never saw my grandfather because he died when my dad was 3. And I can’t bear the thought of not seeing my daughter grow up or history repeating itself where a child is unable to see her parent. We only had her after 10 years of marriage.”
He decided to operate by September so that he would recover in time to take care of his wife in her final trimester.
When I ask him how he felt during these intervening months, he replies, amused, “Actually, I felt normal. And that created doubt in me whether the cancer was in the early stages or maybe whatever I was doing was helping.”
Nevertheless, he went for his parotidectomy (surgical excision of the parotid gland, the largest of the salivary glands) only to receive an extremely dumbfounding outcome. There was no cancer.
Post-surgery scar.
This experience was already more than anyone can be expected to bear. Yet in 2018, he underwent cardiac ablation, a procedure to destroy tissue in the heart that’s allowing incorrect electrical signals to cause an abnormal heart rhythm. He had held back on seeking treatment since 2013 as he was too occupied. At the time, his doctor had told him bluntly that the annual consultations were simply to check if he was still alive, and urged him to get the procedure done, citing a case study of a young patient dying just before his procedure.
He was told that at his age, the odds of dying from this condition were higher than that of getting into a car crash. He could just drop dead at any time.
Anthony knew he had to stay alive for his family. But during the procedure—in which Anthony was totally conscious—the doctor found an abnormality that led him to abort. Later, the doctor explained that he’s only seen 2 cases like this: a benign condition which gives the same reading as the presumed condition.
For a man who has been close to death twice, Anthony has come to terms with the volatility of life. He was initially indignant with the cancer episode, but eventually he made his peace with it.
In what is to become useful in managing oncoming crises, he expounds on the importance of maintaining a stoic mindset: “It’s a natural process. At some point, you won’t be upset when things don’t work out the way you wanted. I worked past the anger and disappointment, it’s a life cycle. I tell myself and others this, don’t ever be consumed by your anger and disappointment or you will never have clarity.”
Misfortune Falls On Others
Other members of his family would meet with their own misfortunes. On October 2014, eight months after the arrival of his daughter, his mother noticed his father was struggling to breathe and move in bed, so they rushed him down to A&E.
The CT scan showed his brain was bleeding. He’d had a massive brain haemorrhage.
At the hospital, Anthony saw his father turning non-responsive and slipping into a coma. The doctor explained that there was a 20% chance of surviving surgery, which involved draining over 100cc of blood in his brain. His father would go on to stay for more than 200 days in the hospital.
Anthony recounts the agony of the experience: “He stayed in the ICU for the first 4 months. I would leave home at 5 AM from Clementi to go Changi General Hospital because I want to get the doctors during their morning rounds as he had up to 7 teams overseeing him … and I get to see how he is. His eyes eventually opened after almost 4 months but they were hollow and glassy, as if there was no soul. Many days I stayed till late, accumulating a lot of expenses from the transport costs including parking.”
There were also the midnight emergency calls telling him that his dad was not going to make it.
During this period, a friend and I met up with Anthony on one occasion. Our friend asked if he would consider taking his father off life support, but Anthony was adamant about hanging on.
I recall his words, “Just one more day makes all the difference.”
Eventually, he was transferred to the general ward. Though stable, there was very little progress. One of the most difficult experiences for the family was deciding whether to resuscitate him in the event that he became moribund. After a family discussion, they decided to sign the Do Not Resuscitate form.
However, when it came to that critical moment, his mother was unable to sign the form, and Anthony could see she wanted to keep him alive. Explaining that they met in their teens, Anthony weeps tearfully, “It felt like I was signing his death sentence. Why I chose to sign it is because I didn’t want my mother to carry the guilt. I didn’t want her to blame herself, so I took it upon myself to do that. It would kill her to carry that blame and guilt.”
Anthony's father taking a walk with Goh Chok Tong.
To compound matters, his mother-in-law was found to have an aggressive form of Stage 4B cancer (Mixed Mullerian Malignant Tumour) during this time. Thus, Anthony found himself overloaded with new responsibilities. He took her for weekly chemotherapy sessions for almost a year, and used bodybuilding protein supplements to nourish her. In fact, he took care of her so well that she put on weight compared to other cancer patients.
His father-in-law, however, was in denial, and began showing signs of depression. To assuage his stress, Anthony took him out for frequent walks to chat. He points out that most people overlook the state of family members who also become depressed when watching loved ones battle cancer. She has since recovered and is doing well.
Throughout all this, the impact on everyone in the family has been immeasurably profound. One poignant regret of Anthony’s was not being able to spend time with his daughter (who was 8 months old at that time), and missing important developmental milestones.
His father still lives to this day, defying expectations of an early demise. It has been 6 years of him being in a vegetative state. Aside from the emotional burden, it has not been an easy transition given new difficulties with intensive home care.
For one, there’s the difficulty of getting sustainable adequate care for his father. He looked into various hospices and homes but found very few institutions that could take him. There is a waiting list for public ones, and the private homes are expensive ($8000 a month excluding items like diapers and medications). Eventually, he settled on training and hiring 2 domestic helpers who oversee every aspect of his father’s health—bathing, feeding and cleaning him.
His mother continues to look for signs of cognition. By now, Anthony says his father’s eyes aren’t as hollow, and can track movement. But he can’t respond to commands like being asked to blink. Contemplating the possibility that there is brain damage in the hippocampus (memory area), Anthony discloses telling his father in the ICU, “It’s ok if you forget me and brother, just remember mother.”
Trying to moderate his mother’s hopes is tricky too.
“I try not to dash her hopes. I don’t know, perhaps it’s possible deep down she knows that recovery chances for my dad was low. That’s the thing about being a caregiver, you can be in extreme denial or hope. When there is no progress, you try to convince yourself that there may be. So you have to find a sweet spot to deal with that reality.”
He worries if his father is cognitively aware but can’t communicate, imagining the terror of suffering in the silence, the world not knowing you are awake. According to Anthony, his father was a man who loved to chat, and is now nothing like his former self.
Transmuting Adversity Into Political Awakening
Between caring for a heartbroken mother, a cancer-stricken mother-in-law, and a vegetative father, it’s unfathomable that anyone would still think of getting into politics. And I haven’t even gotten to his daughter’s and wife’s medical issues.
But perhaps the outcome has also been that in dealing with such adversities, he has cultivated certain altruistic sensitivities that steer his political compass. The personal is political, as they say.
Anthony with Dr Tan Cheng Bock.
Anthony initially turned his father down when asked to help with Dr Tan’s presidential bid. A direct invitation from Dr Tan for a chat changed his mind.
He describes his outlook back then: “I just didn’t see a general problem with society and I had no interest in politics. It was when I looked up the history of the presidential elections that something struck me. This is the highest level of office and yet there is no competition. How can there not be other qualified people around? With the exception of Ong Teng Cheong, it doesn’t make sense that they all be walkovers.”
The 6 months spent campaigning for Dr Tan would turn out to be an eye-opening experience. There’s also a reason why Anthony attaches significance to ex-President Ong Teng Chong’s legacy: his father received a Public Service Medal award from him in 1993.
How Anthony wishes to remember his father: receiving the Public Service Award from then-President Ong Teng Cheong.
Anthony was at his sister-in-law’s wedding in Australia when the election results were released. He cried upon seeing how close the numbers were, but it woke him up from his political slumber.
For all his criticism of the current system, Anthony prefers a less confrontational position to the ruling government. Instead, he opines repeatedly on the importance of a political culture, insisting that “the nature of the beast has to change. Singapore, to me, is like a blank canvas. What do you want to paint on the canvas? We must never say things can’t change. If we get the right people and leaders, we can explore & offer different possibilities to people. For example can we create a retirement system that matches dollar for dollar in retirement funds? We may be a small country but we also can play a big role globally.”
Anticipating questions of his view of the PAP, he clarifies that what he feels is not hate but disappointment. He acknowledges the positive aspects of PAP governance, but wants to address several things which can be improved. Among them: the design of the economy, the political system, education system, unemployment, and cost of living. These have been some of the fundamental interests for his father and him.
He concedes the government isn’t wrong in defending that Singapore faces the same uncertainties as other countries. But he is discontented with how they don’t facilitate an open democratic environment, and are just as confrontational and divisive as they make out their critics to be.
Stressing on the exigency of cultural change, he suggests that there should be a collaborative spirit from the ruling party, “If I am the ruling party, I will reach out to the other parties, including NGOs, VWOs and ask how can we do this together? Every party is entitled to their own ideology, but the ends are the same, we want things to be better, just that the means are different. We shouldn’t be discordant and work together.”
As someone who has interacted with the health system so frequently and painfully, his criticism of the system is surprisingly tepid and moderate. He praises the system for responding to human needs first, and setting aside billing later.
His contention lies instead with the lack of mental health care, which he feels should be provided every step of the way for both patient and caregiver. A recent instance of this was his daughter’s case of Kawasaki Disease, a rare illness which causes inflammation in blood vessels throughout the body.
Because she exhibited atypical symptoms, it was hard to diagnose. He came away disappointed with the lack of support from the hospital in helping them understand her condition and how life threatening it can be. They were only told that the cost of treatment would be high as she required transfusions of IVIG (an antibody extracted from plasma) and that each bottle was worth about $1000.
She needed 11 bottles.
Anthony's daughter Ada.
He understands the economic rationale for the high cost, but was frustrated at the lack of support. He joined a local Kawasaki Disease Support Group and found out that a few parents had either lost children or placed them on lifelong medication. Nevertheless, all of them run the risk of dying.
He tells me, “Nobody supported us so we felt quite helpless and had to step up for ourselves.” As is to be expected from Anthony’s charitable nature, he became a volunteer and gave talks at some pre-schools to increase awareness.
He doesn’t deny that more can be done for the costs of medical treatment. Due to the lengthy nature of severe illnesses, post-hospitalization measures can be stepped up & costs better supported. He even experimented with a business venture to sell cheaper medical equipment and supplies, which unfortunately didn’t pan out.
Like a utilitarian philosopher, he acknowledged that while the rich can deal with the costs better, “during the actual process, the pain is no different. We shouldn’t judge from the outside and instead find how to improve things.”
We debate on his political ideas. I am not sold on the idea that the rich suffer on the same level as the poor. As someone concerned for the plight of the average person, I cannot fathom that the level of pain and hardship will be the same for them. If you can afford tonnes of carrots as a means to heal your cancer, you are better than the family subsisting on $3 cai fan meals while trying to pay for chemotherapy as well.
We also discussed his notion that all political parties aim for “the same ends even if the means are different”. It is platitudinous to think that everybody pursues the same goals in society. Some are perfectly fine with the poor suffering on their own with minimal support from the state, while others campaign for enhanced welfare benefits even if it comes at the expense of higher taxes. There will be no politics of conflict if his adage was true.
He opines that “I’m not into the politics of plain hindsight in terms of criticisms. It generates too much hatred and vitriol online especially. It’s easy to say anything can and should be better indefinitely. It is more important to learn instead from it. We need to know what went on behind the scenes that led to decisions being made. It is sometimes hard to do that without the data or information. That is where transparency and accountability matters.”
Hearing his rationalisations, it seems to me that Anthony can perhaps be too affable for his own good. To learn important lessons from the past requires criticism that can sometimes be harsh. Harshness does not equate to hate; we can criticise a politician for not heeding the advice of NGOs or considering other policy solutions without being hateful.
Even in issues of transparency and accountability, it is precisely when a gross oversight has been exposed, that demands for more transparency gets stepped up, which the Covid-19 outbreak at the foreign dormitories or the Parti Liyani case have demonstrated. Particularly for the latter, the PSP has called for an independent review to scrutinise the lapses as indicative of “underlying systemic faults”.
Current Realities
That being said, perhaps this never-look-back attitude is what keeps the man going. Currently, he is on insulin and some other medications. Though his daughter is still undergoing treatment for her current infection and requires life-long monitoring for Kawasaki disease, she tries to participate in all activities like a regular kid.
Meanwhile, his wife suffers from visual snow syndrome—a condition which causes a person to see numerous flickering tiny dots in their visual field. Describing it as similar to the black and white TV static seen on old CRTVs, there is no established cure, and all they can count on is medicine to reduce symptoms.
He has been able to manage the medical expenses thanks to his wife and daughter having insurance for hospital care. However, it’s still financially stressful as their claims are inadequate for managing their life-long conditions. Given his own medical history, he is currently uninsured. As we speak, he is expecting a bill from his pancreatitis hospitalisation, which he estimates to be over $10,000. He may need to secure a private loan if he is unable to claim through Medisave or MediShield Life.
His relationship with the PSP has also transformed. As the youngest member in the CEC, he had conceptualised the PSP, creating the party name, slogan, and its constitution’s ideals, among other things. Due to his daughter’s condition, he stepped down in January 2020, and is now the Head of Conduct and Discipline.
Anthony as the first member of Progress Singapore Party.
Though he suffered the spurious accusation from a former member of being funded and acting as foreign proxy, he is fiercely determined to protect his legacy. Showing off his membership card like a kid with a gold medal, he proclaims, “There is a good reason why is my membership number 001.”
He jokingly suggests that he deserves a Guinness World record for having the worst luck in the world. A friend adds plaintively, “Will your luck run out one of these days?”.
Anthony is not religious. But like others who have undergone near-death encounters, there is a profound transformative effect on their views of life. Anthony has converted these hardships into teachable moments about grit, “There are many times that I felt things could have gotten worse. What I can say is there’s no rock bottom. Life can come along with a shovel and dig even deeper and push you harder. But you get up and grit, and go on.”
Anthony with Ada.
Indeed, he considers himself a lucky man as he managed to survive all these adversities.
Everything that has happened has taught him the importance of being there for people.
“To what end and eventuality doesn’t matter. By helping others, I found purpose but lost myself in the process. Once you forget yourself, philosophically speaking, it helps to get through things easier because you will always put others before yourself and that you can always still help others even if you are in a difficult situation yourself.”
In some psychology and spiritual circles, it is said that the key to a good life is to lose yourself in a social cause. But paradoxically, the more you lose yourself in it, the better you may feel about yourself due to the goodwill generated in helping others.
And it is through all this that perhaps you show the world who you really are.

"The Secret Beauty of Ubi, Uncovered In 24 Hours",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-the-secret-beauty-of-ubi-uncovered-in-24-hours/,21-Mar-21,"Photography by Ilyas Sholihyn and Eve Lock.
Industrial parks are commonly misunderstood for being utilitarian urban jungles, a stark contrast to the glamorous glass towers and accompanying nightlife of downtown Singapore.
Word on the street is that things have changed—quaint cafes and hip stores have popped up in every corner. Business owners and real estate companies operating in these zones are excited about this trajectory, and are bracing themselves for an influx of sightseers and daytrippers.
Unconvinced, we found ourselves in the industrial quarter of Ubi and its vicinity at 8 A.M. on a weekday morning. The assignment? Spend 24 full hours in the vicinity to find out if things are really all that they’re hyped up to be, and on a motorbike no less.
DAWN
Written from the perspective of Eve, a night owl attempting to be a morning person.
9AM: Hock Siong & Co
Pre-loved furniture and goods
From the moment we stepped into the dusky depot, antique furniture and ornaments greeted us at every turn. Aisles were packed with second-hand goods, from oriental shelves to used typewriters, heavy wooden tables and framed artwork.
Lurking in the corner was a massive Sir Stamford Raffles statue, which we learned later was collected from a now-shuttered hotel in Ann Siang.
Like a tour of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, each nook and cranny offered unexpected yet fascinating finds. One man’s trash is another man’s treasure indeed.
Brillyn Toh, Managing Partner of Hock Siong & Co, tells us that the store pulls in a myriad of people from all walks of life — fashion bloggers, young homeowners, vintage enthusiasts, antique collectors and more. Considering the range of items found here, it shouldn’t be surprising. She adds, passionately: “I’ve worked here for 11 years. There’s so much to see and do around this area now!”
10AM: Tamiya
Miniature model hobby store to relive your childhood
After making our way out of Kampong Ampat, we rediscovered childhood just a short ride away.
Admittedly, my knowledge of Tamiya cars is limited to casual races against my older brother and other scrappy kids in the neighbourhood. Still, it felt surreal to walk into a shop filled with a multitude of Tamiya models. The place is a colourful playground that’s both sentimental and nostalgic; a throwback to the early 2000s.
The result: a shiny Manta Ray model now sits in our office. We learned from the cashier that they used to have Tamiya racing tracks out for customers to play with, but that’s not feasible now due to Covid-19. Still, it’s a self-contained world that brought back years of precious memories.
11AM: Red Point Record Warehouse
A towering collection of vinyl records
For longtime Ubi occupant Ong Chai Koon, the industrial digs of the district provide a secluded haven for the over 70,000 vinyl records in his collection—all housed in towering fashion in a massive space on the sixth floor of Kapo Factory.
The proprietor of Red Point Record Warehouse was more than happy to open his doors to the first customers (us).
“I play you something Hokkien!” he cheerily offered, vanishing into his labyrinthe—rows upon rows of his diverse stock of records, from Japanese city-pop to Malay funk; from Cantonese oldies to Swedish death metal.
Soon enough, the hiss and crackle of a turntable needle dropping on a record filled the air before giving way to some groovy guitar laced with boisterous Hokkien chants. For a moment, I seriously considered purchasing the record.
12PM: Musa Muslim Food (Formerly known as Niu Zhou La Mian)
Halal handmade beef noodles
The afternoon sun was relentless at this point, prompting us to hit the road again and grab lunch. Being a first-time passenger on the backseat of a motorcycle, it was the perfect chance for me to take in the unobstructed sights of the surrounding area.
We parked near a hawker centre in Ubi, where we discovered a modest beef noodle stall tucked away in a corner. A man was tugging tirelessly on dough. We watched, intrigued, as he kneaded and hand-pulled the noodles with skill and vigour. Just what we needed.
The giant bowl came with generous spoonfuls of spring onions along with slices of marbled beef. I’m still reminiscing about the rich beefy flavour of the broth while writing this. It took us work to discover places like these. How many others are we still clueless about?
Bellies filled with spicy soup, meat and noodles, we agreed on the need to burn the calories with a brisk walk. A quick ride to the Kampong Ampat area and we found ourselves coming across a few perfect spots to furnish our personal Instagram feeds.
As it turned out, industrial-chic environments make for great photo opportunities. Ilyas was more than happy to pose for pictures, suggesting where I should position myself to capture his best angles. I was more than happy to comply, as long as I didn’t need to appear on camera.
2PM: Nasty Cookie Factory
Thicc and deliciously gooey cookies
It was midday. Our eyes were growing weary and food coma was sinking in. But there’s always room for dessert, which was why we landed at Techview’s Nasty Cookie Factory. Unlike their other outlets, this is a flagship concept store that houses their central kitchen, office, and retail cafe space.
It was a really quiet afternoon at the batter-scented dessert cafe. A few patrons on laptops minded their own business. Outside, people ambled in and out of the Kaki Bukit MRT station exit.
We ordered a Choco Bueno and Lychee Rose Cookie along with Earl Grey Tea to cleanse our palate. The cookies were huge, chunky and chewy all together. Looks sweet enough “to kill a small child,” commented our editor when we sent over pictures on Slack.
3PM: Compound Coffee and Co
Singapore’s first and only co-roasting space
Techlink’s indoor parking lot held the unmistakable whiff of freshly-roasted coffee—and we weren’t even close to the CapitaLand building’s front lobby. By the time we entered Compound Coffee and Co, the aroma had already engulfed us: all parts floral, smokey and nutty.
To trace its source, we looked to a fearsome black contraption in the corner. As the man behind the counter revealed, it’s an industrial-sized Giesen coffee roaster that Compound rents out to anyone with sacks of raw beans to roast.
Dozens of local cafe proprietors come by to process their coffee beans, mentioned Wan, the professional roaster on duty. The 10-year industry veteran explained that the idea is to build a community of coffee roasters in Singapore, thus the co-roasting space in Kaki Bukit for learning, research and experimenting. Otherwise, it’s a snazzy spot to get some real fresh coffee brews if you don’t mind the mechanical whirring and clanking.
4PM: Green Chapter
Stunning Plant and Aqua Biodiversity
Sounds of chirping birds soon took over as we neared this charming aquarium. These little creatures aren’t up for sale, but they certainly add to the allure of the place. Inside Green Chapter, the cool temperature contrasted sharply against the sweltering heat outdoors.
Patrons drifted in and out, most looking like regulars with the way they confidently navigated the space. We wandered by ourselves too, peering through eye-catching plants and aquascapes.
“Look! It’s Totoro, so cute,” I recall saying at one point. Ghibli fans, rejoice.
The plant biodiversity was extensive, with each arranged neatly in sections. A wide range of species were observed: Cacti, succulents, ferns, jungle and aquatic plants, just to name a few. We gave in to our impulses; little figurines purchased as decorations for our plants back home. We left in a haste, fearful of damaging our wallets further.
5PM: Jie Traditional Bread
Old-school bakery, old-school spirit
We hopped back on the bike and soon arrived at a bakery 10 minutes away. Even under the waning 5 PM sun, a long line had already formed: a sign that it would be well worth the wait.
Here, loaves of bread are baked the old-fashioned way. Traditional baked goods were laid out at the storefront—from golden brown, pandan, rainbow-swirl loaves to red bean and hot dog buns. Yums.
In an orderly fashion, one man trims and slices bread crusts while another takes in orders from customers. Feeling peckish, we ordered some to go. The man tells me that these loaves are best enjoyed with kaya or butter. More yums.
DUSK
Written from the perspective of Ilyas, who wrongly believed that this would be something like The Motorcycle Diaries.
6PM: Kravist Singapore
Self-defense à la Israeli combat skills
The sun set on Ubi at 7:20 PM that day, but I wouldn’t have known—I was busy trying to fend off a man from wrestling me to the ground. The best way to do so, according to Krav Maga Global Singapore director Edwin Peng, is to harden your forearm against the attacker’s collarbone to create distance and kick them away before delivering a cross-hook combo.
Kravist is where the man—the highest ranked Krav Maga Global practitioner in Southeast Asia—teaches the deadly Israeli martial art, an aggressive fighting system grounded in realistic scenarios. What I underwent (Eve was supposed to as well but backed out last minute “to take photos”) that evening was learning how to defend against grabs like headlocks and tackles.
Which made it a bit awkward when class started: I was the only dude in the entire session. Still, pretty heartening to know that the place draws steely women looking to come out on top when forced into street brawls.
The good news was that another male student dropped in late after the initial warm-up sesh. The bad news was that the student, Albert, had thighs and arms as thick as pythons. But bless his heart, he took it easy on me as I fumbled my way through knee strikes and hammer fists while Edwin barked helpful corrections by the side. My shoes and spectacles slipped off while pushing back against Albert’s thunderous tackles, so I was really glad that groin guards were a strict requirement.
“Hope you’ll come by again!” he cheerily offered as I spritzed some antibacterial Febreze on my sweaty communal jockstrap at the end of class.
8PM: Knots Cafe & Living
A harmony of furniture, greenery and cafe fare
We rode to our next destination, stopping briefly along the way to note down several boutique artisan shops and local cafes for future visits.
A particular cafe stood bright against the darkened skies. Murmurs of diners and sounds of clinking silverware filled the air as we entered Knots Cafe & Living, a bistro that’s also a furniture store. The interior boasts lush greenery, furniture, and trinkets; all of which are up for grabs.
Parched from Krav Maga, I inhaled a bottled beverage; a fancy flowery drink tagged at $7. A little pricey, but the ambiance of the place more than made up for it.
9PM: Kushi Japanese Dining
Premium Japanese Ala Carte Buffet Under $50
The buffet veterans among us know the one cardinal rule: don’t go for carbs because they fill you up too quickly.
Eve brought that same energy to the table at Kushi Japanese Dining, an all-you-can-eat ala carte Japanese experience. “Let’s just get all sashimi,” she joked. With more than a glimmer of serious intent.
Considering that this was an all-you-can-eat buffet with an endless flow of sashimi, $45.80 per head was a pretty good deal. Within the span of an hour, we ordered enough entrees to surpass that amount in any other restaurant. We’re talking about various sushi rolls, temaki, tempura vegetables, chawanmushi, deep-fried seafood, and more than a few hot-off-the-grill meats.
Turns out, it’s completely possible to indulge in fancy places within industrial districts too.
12AM: Julaiha Muslim Restaurant
Popular supper spot for night owls
“Go to Julaiha for prata next,” DMed a musician friend of mine after seeing my hourly updates on Instagram. It’s where his band usually goes after jamming sessions, he said, and it’s where a man they dubbed “Professor Prata” works.
In search of supper by this learned flatbread academic, we rode to Julaiha Muslim Restaurant, a 24-hour joint along Macpherson Road. Brightly lit and teeming with people even past midnight, we approached the lectern of ghee, dough and eggs, where the supposed professor was giving a wordless masterclass in flipping pratas.
Attentive staff walked past carting plates of mutton biryani and other Indian-Muslim fares to patrons, which could be described as ‘vaguely international’, judging from the surprising number of Caucasians and foreign accents.
I sent a picture of the prata maker to my musician friend. “Alamak that’s not the professor hahaha,” he replied.
2AM: Night Ride
Cruising for poetic photos
Fresh air was a much-needed respite after all that food and thus began our night cruising.
We rode around aimlessly, taking in the night scenes and relishing the cool night breeze. Rows upon rows of trees and buildings remained luminescent in the streetlights. Occasionally, we passed by several groups of people stepping out of eateries—co-workers perhaps? They’re all smiles and deep in conversation.
Further down the stretch, we came across the construction site of UBIX, an upcoming business space by CapitaLand primed for companies in fintech, gaming, biopharma, and other fashionable industries.
Set to launch sometime later this year, the space is slated to be the next big thing in Ubi, a modern workspace of sorts for people to network, collaborate, and do other things high-flying professionals do when they get together. A CapitaLand spokesperson explained that UBIX is being envisioned as a one-stop-shop for both business and leisure, which is good to know for anyone looking to establish their offices there.
While UBIX is still very much in the akan datang stage, we caught ourselves imagining how everything will look upon completion: A full glass facade, a stylish lobby, spiffy offices fit for any burgeoning enterprise, and buzz worthy F&B joints for gatherings. Not to mention that commuting to and fro work would be a cinch with Ubi MRT Station located at its doorstep.
7AM: Circuit Road Market & Food Centre
The unmistakable kampung spirit
In our sleep-deprived daze, we somehow made our way deeper into Macpherson, arriving at Circuit Road Market & Food Centre.
The place exudes a unique character, and immediately we noticed the lively atmosphere. On the ground level, elderly folks haggled good-naturedly with hawkers as they purchased their groceries. A friendly lady selling dried goods was surprised to know that it was our first time there. “We love it here. Everyone knows one another. You should join us too!” she exclaims.
Above, others were engaged in vibrant banter while consuming breakfast. Me, I couldn’t resist ordering a plate of Nasi Lemak, having forgotten that it tastes best at the crack of dawn, while still piping hot. The charming elderly couple running the stall were so happy to see young folks like us among their first customers that they tossed in two chicken nuggets. Nice.
8AM: Riding Back To The Office
A realisation on the roads
Being situated so close to a major junction meant that the vicinity was a much-loved stop for workers in the area ready to start their day, while ours was coming to a much-needed end.
We went for one last ride—this time to the central business district, back to our Ann Siang office. But while riding on the flyover with the towering cityscape in sight, I couldn’t help myself from thinking that Ubi—a sequestered district we found plenty to do within 24 hours—is just as compelling a place to work and play in.
The first step to experiencing our escapades could be from working at one of these CapitaLand buildings.

Food Review: Man Walks Into a Thai Disco and Chinese KTV,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-food-life-review-man-walks-thai-disco-chinese-ktv/,16-Dec-20,"All images by Zachary Tang for RICE Media.
For some men, women are props. Ornaments used to signify status and desirability in society. Beautiful women, in this specific sense, are like expensive cars, watches, or fine bottles of wine.
For the right price, you get to take it home with you.
Before Covid hit, nothing laid bare (pun intended) the transactional nature of this relationship between men and women more than at Thai discos and Chinese KTVs.
At siam dius in Singapore, for example, men ‘hang flowers’ or diao hua. Thai women in low cut dresses stand on stage, wearing flower sashes with price tags emblazoned across their (typically) ample chests. Like at an auction house, the tables of men offstage make their bids. The goods (i.e. the women) always go to the highest bidder.
At Chinese KTVs, on the other hand, you have the girl butterflies, with a going rate of anywhere between S$50-100. For this fixed sum, you get to pick your own girl from a line-up at the front of the room and she will sing and drink with you for 15-20 minute increments, before she flits off to another room to do the same with another paying customer (hence, the term ‘girl butterflies’).
After the night is over, dabao is always extra. What takes place after these venues close is between two mutually consenting parties, and dependent on your chemistry with your girl.
By ‘chemistry,’ what we actually mean is a suitable exchange of money for goods and services.
To an outsider like me looking in on this part of Singapore’s nightlife, this entire process seems like an extremely inefficient and convoluted way for Singaporean men to get laid.
If the end goal is to buy sex, why not cut out the middleman and visit a brothel instead? Or pay a private escort? After all, the money spent on beer towers and Hennessy bottles alone is more than enough to pay for a staycation at a nice hotel (#SingapoRediscovers).
What exactly is it about these places that keep men coming back? And now that some Thai discos and Chinese KTVs have pivoted to the F&B model to avoid a Phase 2 shutdown, what exactly is the appeal?
In short: what’s a Thai disco without the flower hanging? What’s a Chinese KTV without the KTV?
That’s what I wanted to find out through this food review.
Food Review #1: Club Illusion (Thai Disco)
It’s Thursday. My photographer Zach and I have made 5:30 PM reservations to dine at Illusions Exclusive Bistro, formerly known as Club Illusions, located inside a third storey walk-up in the Clarke Quay club district.
Honestly, it feels like an illusion to be sitting inside a Thai disco while the sun is still shining through the windows. But we’re running on a tight schedule. We have many more discos and KTVs to hit for the night, and according to regulations, all such venues must close by 10:30 PM.
We order the spam fries, the fried prawn bean curd rolls, and a truffle mushroom pizza.
At the table behind us sit two middle-aged men. Each man is accompanied by one scantily clad and young-looking female companion. The men are red-faced, sweaty, and breathing heavily. The man with heavy male-pattern baldness is groping his girl and trying to tongue kiss her on the mouth. The woman laughs and pushes him away.
The food arrives. The spam fries are ordinary, but the fried prawn bean curd rolls are excellent. The bean curd skin is crisp and flaky and the prawn filling is fresh-tasting with a pleasant crunch of radish.
The truffle mushroom pizza, on the other hand, is a different story. Despite the forty-five minute wait, the pizza still comes out undercooked and soggy in the middle. Instead of actual truffles, we are treated to a drizzle of truffle oil that tastes like sadness.
They cracked an egg on my pizza.
In the middle of our meal, a young woman in a white low-cut dress walks over to our table. Even before she sits down and pours herself a glass of water, I recognise her familiar Mandarin accent. Her name is Summer. She’s half-Taiwanese. We fall into conversation easily.
Ten minutes later, Summer is telling us about her struggles this year, moving from one Thai disco to the next in search of customers. I learn that she lives in a cramped HDB flat with her parents, and that this year has been especially tough. If I want to buy her a drink, that would be okay with her. Prices start at $75.
She really was a sweet girl. So I had to come clean. I confess that Zach and I are journalists from RICE here to do a food review.
Her eyes widen. “So your employer pays for all your food and drinks for the whole night?”
“That’s right,” I say.
“Wow,” she says. “This is why I like talking to customers. It’s so interesting to learn about how other people live.”
Later that night, I would feel a sense of shame thinking back to this conversation. When I took this assignment, I’d envisioned this article to be light-hearted and humorous. The headline even wrote itself: Married Man With No Game Visits a Thai Disco. Hijinks ensues.
I would laugh at the absurdity of the situation while also laughing at myself, thereby projecting the image that I was a writer who was comfortable in my own skin.
But in Summer’s case, this was her livelihood, and I’d been treating it all like a joke. To add insult to injury, this was a business expense for me, one that I’d likely harvest for clicks, to seek validation on the internet for my own insecurities as a writer.
Food Review #2: Club Mao at Barcode (Thai Disco)
We’re seated at Mao Thai Kitchen, formerly known as Club Mao, inside the Resident Evil-looking building otherwise known as Oriental Plaza.
It’s 8:30 PM. Aside from the three staff on duty and a forlorn-looking Thai girl playing with her phone in a red booth, we are the only customers in the place. It’s dark, the stage is empty, and the air-conditioning is on full blast.
On my way to the bathroom, I caught a glimpse of the state of the kitchen. It was so dark and dingy, I half-expected Gordon Ramsay to storm in at any moment to cuss out the owners.
What are you??? An idiot sandwich.
To be honest, I’m also growing increasingly frustrated with how the night is unfolding.
It’s now two hours before closing time, and nothing is happening. When we entered, the only Thai girl in the disco barely looked up from her phone to acknowledge our existence.
How am I supposed to write this article? Who wants to read about two losers sitting in an empty Thai disco eating a bowl of Thai Basil Pork Rice and pork skewers? (Although side note: the pork skewers at Mao turned out to be excellent—the perfect combination of smokiness from the char-grill, with perfectly marbled cuts of meat. You can’t judge a kitchen by appearances alone).
I stew in my own impotence, recalling all the times my guy friends and I would rave about the crazy night we had at the bars or clubs the night before. Personally, I’d always found these retellings to be greatly exaggerated. Yet somehow, we all bought into the illusion.
For the sake of the story, we would accept the lie that in our alcohol-induced haze, good times were had by all, and that we, the boys, the bros, had more than lived up to the night’s promise of conquest and glory.
Food Review #3: Supreme KTV (Chinese KTV)
“Follow me, boys! I know the shortcut to this place,” says Magic Mike as he strolls confidently down the ramp towards the B1 parking garage.
Look at that swagger.
Magic Mike is a friend of Zach’s, who we pick up at Chijmes in our Grab on our way to Orchard Towers.
Zach and I had decided that we needed to call up reinforcements for our third and final venue, because our night so far had been the blind leading the blind. Magic Mike, Zach hyped, was an experienced player. He knew the ins-and-outs of the Chinese KTV scene like the back of his hand.
But strong men also stumble. Because after following Magic Mike down a series of winding parking garages, towards what I assumed would be Supreme KTV and Bistro, we hit a locked door. A dead end.
As it turns out, we aren’t even in the right building. Supreme KTV is proving to be as elusive as the female clitoris. The real venue is not at Orchard Towers, but across the road at Far East Shopping Centre.
It’s 9:45 PM by the time we make it to the correct Supreme Bistro, and I have to plead with the KTV staff to let us order food before the kitchen closes at 10:15 PM. The staff at Supreme escort us into an empty blue KTV room, turn on some music, then close the door behind them. Of course, the microphones are all unplugged. There’s no singing allowed at this KTV.
Since Phase 2, Supreme Bistro started serving Korean food and dim sum. But I can’t tell you whether the food is any good, because by the time we’d arrived, all the kitchen had left were 5 cans of Kirin beer and their recommended sausage platter.
The sausages arrive—too quickly. They taste store-bought from the cheapest rack at NTUC. The fries are stale and dries out our already parched throats. Only the canned Kirin beers are acceptable.
Even the wallpaper was getting more action.
As we munch on this disappointment, the three of us get into a discussion about the appeal of these places.
“I personally don’t get why some men still want to come here with all of these restrictions,” says Magic Mike. “But I know some friends who still do.”
“But why?” I ask. “What do they get out of a KTV with no KTV?”
“Well, some of these KTV places are still operating illegally. So the butterfly girls are still there. Depending on your chemistry with the girl, you can still dabao her home afterwards.”
“I get the rationale behind sex work,” I say. “But why not just cut out the middleman? Just visit a brothel or hire an escort instead.”
“I think it’s about more than the sex. Some ah bengs just need a place to show off to their friends. To prove that even in this recession there’s still money coming in. That they can still afford to let loose and enjoy themselves.”
“And the Thai discos?”
Magic Mike shrugs. “For some it’s just another place to unwind with the bros. For others, it’s about making an appearance and being seen at these places. To be seen as the kind of person who can spend on women and booze without caring so much about money.”
“So it’s about ego,” I conclude. “When men visit these places, the ones they’re actually trying to impress are other men.”
Later in the Grab ride home, I realise that my assessment of these men may have been too simplistic and one-dimensional.
Online, there are entire communities dedicated to helping gong taos, the term used for Singaporean men who fall head over heels for a Thai disco girl, deal with their heartbreak (see: Gong Tao Help Desk). To these men, the Thai disco isn’t just another transaction or a way of showing off. The gong tao believe—or at least want to believe—that they are worthy of genuine love and attention from these exotic Thai women, beyond the exchange of money.
Maybe this goes back to the basic human need: we all want to feel wanted. We all want to feel seen.
To get this feeling, we use each other, sometimes carelessly and thoughtlessly. In our loneliness and desire, we become incapable of recognising that same yearning in others.
The Bill Arrives
The total damage for the night, including the Grab rides home, is $243. But in the days following, I struggle to figure out what our night of eating and drinking had amounted to.
They say that life doesn’t end in death. It ends when we get addicted to comfort. I wonder if Singaporeans are starting to realise this.
Because despite the superficial novelty of these venues (i.e. struggling Thai discos and KTVs), the night felt painfully familiar to me. Moving from place to place eating and drinking is the one thing we’ve all been doing since the lifting of the circuit breaker.
So if there’s one interesting takeaway from this night, it’s what this pandemic has laid bare: the sometimes transactional nature of our pre-Covid relationships in the face of the five-person per table dine-in limit. Or the ways we’ve been deriving our sense of identity and self-worth—whether that’s tying our self esteem to our jobs or the venues that we frequent as regulars.
Perhaps we can all use the remainder of this year to figure out what actually matters and let the rest fall away.
Because when Covid strips away all the pageantry, the props and fantasies we use to massage our fragile egos, what are we really left with?
Just three men sitting in a dark KTV room, talking cock, and munching on sausages.

Why Future-Proofing Workers Is Critical as Singapore’s Factories Automate",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
There Is No “Best” Time To Lift The Circuit Breaker,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-no-best-time-lift-circuit-breaker/,11-May-20,"Top image by Zachary Tang / RICE File Photo.
May 11, 2020. Today, there is a buzz of anticipation surging through Singapore’s veins because several circuit breaker measures will be eased tomorrow. Dessert cafés, pet supply shops, and hair salons—thank goodness—will resume operations.
When announced last week, the relaxed measures were a (pleasant) surprise because they arrived three weeks in advance of the circuit breaker’s official end date on 1 June 2020.
Some worry that it comes prematurely. Granted, the average number of local cases has been dipping steadily, from 11 per day two weeks ago, to nine last week. But we are still hovering at the cusp of low double digits. Unlike Taiwan or Hong Kong—among a few other Asia-Pacific countries—there has yet to be a day when Singapore has had zero new cases.
Besides, it seems that we have yet to get a handle on the enormous clusters of infection among our migrant workers, which, ironically, emerged at a time when Singapore was praised globally as the “gold standard” for handling the pandemic.
This fiasco shows us that despite the encouraging drop in local transmission, all it takes for another coronavirus conflagration to erupt is a carelessly flung cigarette butt. Which is exactly the case in South Korea now.
With these arguments in mind, some might think that we are loosening the CB too quickly.
I personally don’t think so.
Life before the coronavirus. Image by Cheryl Tang / Rice File Photo.
While one month of living under the circuit breaker has put a halt in the tracks of the coronavirus (at least in our local population—it’s kind of sad to have to keep adding this qualification), and another will make this effect even more pronounced, there are undeniable costs to keeping most of Singapore at home.
At the top of everyone’s minds are the financial and economic repercussions of the circuit breaker. Two months of shutting huge industries will cause Singapore’s economy to shrink 5.7%, retrenchments to rise to 45,600, and unemployment, after being seasonally adjusted, to reach 4.2%, DBS Bank forecasted. Some numbers, released just today, confirm that pessimism: over 8500 businesses have closed in April, more than twice the number in March, The Business Times reported.
But the harm to the economy is not the gravest effect of the circuit breaker. For one, we need to stop thinking of the economy as an embodied person who soars or suffers because of our actions. We are the economy. If we are dead, there is no economy to speak of. And lessons from history teach us that nations that “intervened earlier and more aggressively do not perform worse and, if anything, grow faster after the pandemic is over”.
So there is no real argument to be made for lifting the circuit breaker solely for economic reasons.
Crises, such as pandemics or economic recessions, have historically corresponded with a surge in domestic violence cases.
(Shailey Hingorani to The New Paper)
More pressing are the social costs of the circuit breaker.
One-quarter of Singaporeans rated their mental health as “fair” or “poor”, an Ipsos survey conducted from late April to early May found. Moreover, the survey respondents’ work situation had little influence on these respondents’ mental health, suggesting that it is the isolating effects of the circuit breaker, rather than a loss of job or income, that is contributing to their poor mental health.
If ordinarily healthy and functioning Singaporeans are buckling under the psychological and physical strain of the circuit breaker, imagine, then, what vulnerable and lower-income groups of people are experiencing now.
This publication has previously written about how the circuit breaker is disproportionately affecting persons with disabilities, migrant workers, and families without laptops.
To that list we can add victims of domestic violence. Cases of domestic abuse in Singapore are surging because victims are now forced to inhabit the same space as their abusers literally 24/7. Speaking to The New Paper, AWARE disclosed that it received 619 inquiries on family violence and domestic abuse in April, 35% more compared to March.
Similarly, the elderly who live alone struggle with social isolation that, in turn, leads to higher risks of health complications such as dementia and cardiovascular problems.
I am by no means suggesting mental health or social costs take precedence over saving lives. That sentence, in fact, makes no sense. But in evaluating when we should lift the circuit breaker, we have to keep in mind that it is effective only insofar as it fulfils its purpose.
Image by Dennis Khung / RICE File Photo.
Simply put, the circuit breaker was never meant to eradicate the coronavirus from Singapore.
In Minister Lawrence Wong’s words, “the Government decided to [implement and extend the circuit breaker] so as to break the transmission chain, and slow down the spread of the coronavirus” (my emphasis).
That is to say, the aim of Singapore’s circuit breaker seems to be a reduction of the number of unlinked cases and to shrink clusters to more manageable numbers. Not to achieve zero transmission rates (though it is ideal) and a population free from the coronavirus.
Globally, no government is pinning their hopes on a circuit breaker/lockdown to flush out the virus from their nation’s borders either. The point of a lockdown is, instead, “to slow the spread—to flatten the curve—so that the first wave of the pandemic would not overwhelm the health-care system”.
The Director-General of the World Health Organization (WHO), Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, presents six conditions a country must meet before it can lift a lockdown:
1. Disease transmission is under control.
2. Health systems are able to “detect, test, isolate and treat every case and trace every contact”.
3. Hot spot risks are minimized in vulnerable places, such as nursing homes.
4. Schools, workplaces and other essential places have established preventive measures.
5. The risk of importing new cases “can be managed.
6. Communities are fully educated, engaged and empowered to live under a new normal.
Note how these conditions don’t mention eradicating the coronavirus.
I’m neither an epidemiologist nor do I have oversight of Singapore’s healthcare and contact-tracing capabilities. But, in light of these advisories, I think the argument that we should keep the circuit breaker going until we have zero new cases for an extended period of time is excessive. Furthermore, an extension would make the circuit breaker’s social costs, as delineated above, too expensive to bear for the diminishing returns it will give.
The point is that new structures have been put in place, during the time bought by the circuit breaker, so that we are more prepared to deal with the second-, or third-, or fourth-wave of infection.
Spaces have been transformed into isolation facilities to house Covid-19 patients. TraceTogether’s son, the more effective SafeEntry, is now implemented in malls and will soon be extended to taxi rides and offices. Masks will be mandatory even in workplaces. Haircuts will be limited to an hour. And so on.
That is, unfortunately, the reality we now have to live with.
Image by Dennis Khung / RICE File Photo.
Indeed, without the development of a vaccine, which WHO warns might take “a number of years”, or herd immunity, which, as Sweden is demonstrating, is a dangerous path to take, it is a mere pipe dream to think that we can be rid of the coronavirus so quickly and easily.
After railing against The Economy, I know it’s ironic for me to invoke the language of economists, but it’s only sensible to run a cost-benefit analysis in deciding whether to prolong or ease the circuit breaker.
The benefits are straightforward: lower transmission rates of Covid-19.
The costs? Unless we want to replace the pandemic with an epidemic of anxiety, depression, domestic abuse, and so on (sigh), it seems that the better choice—now that the circuit breaker has done most of its job of stalling, not solving, the coronavirus pandemic—is to gradually and very cautiously reopen segments of society and industry so that we can acclimatise to this new normal.
Do you think Singapore is relaxing the circuit breaker measures too soon? Let us know at community@ricemedia.co.

What My Pre-Covid-19 Self Can Learn From My Anxieties,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-what-pre-covid-19-self-learn-anxieties-circuit-breaker/,6-Jun-20,"Top Image: elgassier / Shutterstock
Dear Pre-Covid-19 Me,
I am writing this to you, my 23-year old self, prior to the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic. Have I changed? Do I have any regrets, being cooped up at home for the past two months?
Maybe I’m just upset that you’re getting more fresh air and sunlight more than I am, or I’m seeing things differently now that I have to put on a mask every time I leave the house. Now that I’m several CB-weeks wiser (I think!), I hope you learn a thing or two from this letter.
Right now the world’s in a bit of a limbo. You might have heard of this respiratory virus, Covid-19, that’s starting to spread worldwide. Spoiler alert: it gets worse.
Everything skyrockets in the blink of an eye. After months of keeping up with the World-o-meter Covid-19 update page three times a day, I’m already numb to the statistics. But you might be alarmed or even terrified when case numbers for countries enter the thousands.
At first, you will be worried about the worsening situation. But you don’t really start to grieve until it affects you directly.
Moving out of your home of four years, trying to find a job, AND there’s a pandemic? F.
All this time, we have put our faith in the narrative: As long as we follow the path laid out for us, we would be fine. Work hard, finish school, get a degree. We would have a roof over our heads and enough money to, at the very least, go out every once in a while.
Graduation signals the beginning of our adult life, and we would be somewhat prepared and assured of a livelihood.
But, this year, Singapore is projected to see the worst economic recession in recent memory. The world economy is about to experience a recession even more dire than the Great Depression.
The situation is bad enough that, at the time I am writing to you, the government has announced relief measures that amount to S$92.9 billion, or almost 20% of our GDP.
And I consider myself one of the lucky ones. I still live with our family—though it can get overwhelming, you know how small our house is—and I don’t have to worry about not being able to eat. Others have it much, much worse. Your friends, too, are struggling to find jobs. Your mum’s company has gone into a hiring freeze and retracted employment offers. People are getting their internships cancelled.
At East Coast Park, before things got worse.
I know you’re probably rolling your eyes. You’re thinking that I should just take it easy and trust that things will work out.
But that’s easier said than done. Many people are having a much tougher time than I am, but that doesn’t erase the very real anxiety that I’m trying to grapple with.
I don’t know if I can get a job. Even if I do get a job, will it be one that adds value? Or do I have to settle for whatever random position that comes up on the SG United portal? Would I just end up wasting one year in an industry that I have no intention of pursuing? Or do I take a risk and wait it out, living without an income for a full year, at the end of which I have to compete with even more fresh grads?
I’m starting to realise how fragile our livelihoods really are. In the blink of an eye, I’m likely to be unemployed for up to a year. Others have trouble paying rent, or even just getting three meals a day.
Honestly, it’s terrifying.
I hope this letter helps you understand how easy it is for our lives to be upended by something that is biologically so much simpler than ourselves. Something that barely has any agency at all.
You are there right now, living before a pandemic happens, happy and content with your safety net of a Singapore education and a university degree. But, sometimes, life throws a nasty curveball, and it’s impossible to dodge it.
I can go on and on about what you should do to prepare yourself for this: take up more part-time gigs, do some online courses, start career networking so that you can get a headstart in your job search. However, to be completely frank with you, I don’t know how much help that will be. An economic downturn will be incredibly difficult to offset. Still, it doesn’t hurt to take whatever opportunities come our way and remain prepared.
Our anxieties right now are very different. You’re worried about submitting your assignments on time. I’m worried about getting hired. I’m worried about mum getting fired and dad’s business going bust.
But that’s all right. Enjoy the moments of peace while they last. Make sure to spend time with your friends and family, learn new skills, do the things you never had the time to do before, and go outdoors a little more often while you still can. We can support each other and head towards the ‘new normal’ with more confidence by staying strong together.
We went on a final commemorative walk around campus right before CB kicked in.
I don’t want to sound too pessimistic, but I just want you to keep in mind that whatever I’m experiencing now is what you will eventually experience too. The realisation that our livelihood might not be so certain after all. That we are never in complete control of our fate. That everything we’ve worked for can be so easily taken away.
On a more positive note, your friend’s father, who’s been unemployed for three months, just found a job. So maybe things aren’t completely apocalyptic.
Yes, our livelihoods are fragile. But if we make it through this storm and understand the fleeting nature yet tremendous value of whatever we have, maybe we’ll come out on the other side a little wiser.

Childhood Games Are Making A Comeback. I Played Maplestory Again To Find Out Why",Yin Lin Tan,TRUE,TRUE
Customers Love Their Furniture Shop. So Why Are These Sisters Fighting To Save It?,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-sisters-dream-furniture-shop-sme/,18-Aug-20,"All images by Marisse Caine.
Sisters’ Dream is a furniture shop in Bedok set up by Agnes and Mary Fong, a pair of sisters. For over two decades, they have sold eclectic teak furniture that they design themselves, but this dream might be coming to an end soon.
Agnes and Mary speak to RICE on the struggles they face running an SME in Singapore at which no Singaporean wants to work, why it’s difficult for a business like theirs to embrace digitalisation, and the impact of Covid-19 on their shop.
Ultimately, they fear that Sisters’ Dream, like the antiques they sell, will be a thing of the past in this environment.
Agnes and Mary Fong in Sisters' Dream.
We just signed a one-year lease with our landlord. That was in April, when Covid was widespread. We appealed to him: please, can you reduce the rental by 10%?
He said no. He even wanted to increase the rent by 10%.
It’s madness. It’s just not logical. There’s Covid, the business is suffering, we are all suffering. And you still want to increase our rent. How can you be so heartless?
And we have been here 18 years. With the same landlord.
If Heng Swee Keat hadn’t come up with the different budgets to help us, with the rental waivers, the shop would be dead. We wouldn’t be sitting here talking to you.
Sisters’ Dream would be gone.
Sisters’ Dream started with a garage sale in 1998.
We had taken a holiday in Australia, where we went to all the little coastal towns. They had small shops selling handcrafted furniture, antiques, knick-knacks … it’s like a treasure trove. We spent hours in these shops and bought things to bring back to Singapore.
Mary’s husband suggested: “Why don’t we display the collection in our house, but people can just buy what they like?”
So we advertised in The Straits Times. In the Classified Ads. And people would come! They would buy all the things. We had to replenish stock. Eventually we decided to lease a proper shop instead of selling items out of our house.
That’s how the Sisters’ Dream business began.
At first, we employed a local designer. But he left after a few months because his wife wasn’t happy he had to work weekends! So we picked up drawing furniture ourselves.
We just started sketching from physical furniture that we can see and measure … we just draw continually. Surprisingly, customers wanted to buy our designs—we were so happy.
From there on, there was no turning back. We started to design cabinets, beds … anything that the customers want, we draw for them. At that time, there was no Google. If a customer wanted a Straits Chinese cabinet, we had to refer to magazines, go to the library to borrow books, to make sure our designs were accurate.
Recently, we drew a dinosaur bed and a football bed for a customer’s two young sons.
Our furniture is all solid teak, one-of-a-kind, and made in small factories in Java: places like Solo, Jepara. They’re not like those fabricated, plywood pieces produced in the hundreds and thousands.
So the two of us, we don’t only serve customers, we design the furniture, and Mary even drives the lorry to deliver furniture to customers.
In a small business like ours, we do everything ourselves.
It’s tiring, but the good thing about this is that our customers become good friends.
During Christmas, they will send a wreath, made from real pines. Mary’s birthday was yesterday—that’s why this customer brought flowers and kueh kueh today. When they come over, we will sit down and chat. Some even confide in us, telling us about their family problems.
And we see them grow up. There was a young couple, they just got married and bought furniture from us when they got their first house. Then the children grew up and got married. They even invited us to their wedding.
This closeness … it’s our favourite part of running the business. You don’t get it from selling things online or running a big company with many employees.
We’re not sure how long this can last. For the first 15 years, we could manage everything on our own. But Mary is now 57, and I’m 62. So we are starting to need some help.
It’s very hard. We advertise for part-timers but nobody wants to work in this kind of business.
When our driver left, we had to find a new local driver. Hiring one was no joke. We have had workers who come and work for one week, try carrying one sofa or coffee table, and they say, “We try already, furniture delivery is too tough.” Then they will resign.
Samuel Ambrose works as a carpenter at Sisters' Dream.
Right now, we have a Singaporean carpenter, Samuel Ambrose. We also wanted to find someone to be his apprentice. But nobody is interested in these skills anymore.
In Singapore it’s very hard to sustain such trades. Employment is one problem that the government can help us with.
Singaporeans really don’t want this kind of job.
Technology is another obstacle. More and more people shop online nowadays.
But the way we run our shop is a bit different. We bring lamps, paintings, cabinets to our customer’s house. We put it up for them. If they like it, they buy it on the spot. We do not know how this kind of business is going to go online.
To tell you the truth, I [Agnes] am a bit of a technophobe. I was a teacher for 22 years, but I had to leave the profession because of the introduction of technology. I had to use the computer to teach, and, as a HOD, give PowerPoint presentations to teachers from other schools. These were terrifying to me, and I went into very serious depression. I was in the hospital for 39 days. I couldn’t eat. Couldn’t move, couldn’t walk. I was really sick.
So digitisating the business … it’s a bit hard for us. That’s why we still use paper invoices, why our fax machine is still in regular use! Agnes uses it to send designs to our cushion maker, our glass maker …
But the young ones in our family teach us things like Instagram. Facebook is still a bit stressful … but Instagram is very simple and doesn’t intimidate us. There are no restrictions. So we started taking photos of our shop and advertising through Instagram.
Especially during Covid. We couldn’t open the shop but we came in to take photos, and posted a lot on Instagram. Customers would see the post, call us to ask about our pieces, and even buy them. That motivates us.
We know sooner or later we have to go digital.
But the biggest obstacle is Agnes. [laughter]
We hope that SMEs like us can survive in Singapore. Other countries have very small local businesses that thrive on their uniqueness and community.
I do not know in Singapore if our government is supporting these kinds of businesses. It’s very sad. The government is always looking at companies with turnovers of millions.
But we don’t have enough revenue to do a proper advertisement. Even if there is a boom in sales because of advertisements, we can’t manage it. Our one carpenter will work until he throws in the towel because we can’t find another local carpenter to hire. And I [Mary] can’t do all the deliveries myself.
Bigger companies can get a loan from the bank at certain rates to tide them over for cash flow. An SME like ours, we don’t have that. Everything must be from our pocket or sales.
There’s no help for shops like ours. For 20 years we have not had any help, and we daren’t ask for any help from the government.
Frankly, we are not rich to run a business like that. We just can sustain ourselves, and make us feel that we are still doing something for the community. We become friends with our customers, we provide a place for people to come in and chat, we employ local people.
When we started, we didn’t think of a five-year plan, ten-year plan. We never think, wah, we must plan, expand, meet sales targets … we don’t even have a marketing strategy, that’s how sad we are.
No, we started just to try, to follow our passion. We lease one year. Then every two years. When the contract finishes, we continue.
These are our small dreams.

12 Things I Learnt From Checking Myself Into A Psychiatric Ward,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-12-things-learnt-checking-myself-into-psychiatric-ward/,9-Oct-20,"Top image by Genevieve Yip. All other images by Marisse Caine.
Just over 3 months ago, my sister took me to the A&E after I broke down at work. I hid in the staff toilet the whole time because I couldn’t stop crying. My supervisor had to come and physically remove me from the toilet, and even then I was inconsolable. I hated the fact that crying didn’t make me feel better. In fact, the more I cried the more hopeless I felt.
Suicide became a very tempting option. A quick escape. An immediate solution to everything. With each passing minute, I was putting together a more detailed suicide plan. No one felt safe to let me go home. I didn’t feel like I could keep myself safe. So when the doctor offered me inpatient admission at NUH, I said yes.
I said yes, because when you’re at that stage where you feel so defeated, miserable, and desperate, you can either find the courage to kill yourself, or find the courage to admit yourself. The latter is always an option. I said yes because I saw how harmful and toxic my behaviour was to the people I loved. They needed as much space and time away from me as much as I needed time and space for myself.
I was wheeled into the ward even though I told them I could walk. Security door access – I was told that even staff from other wards couldn’t enter. Windows that resembled prison bars. I heard the magnetic door shut behind me, signifying the last of my autonomy being surrendered. I felt everyone’s eyes on me. Wheeled in, plain clothes? “The new girl”. I saw patients in green and brown seated in the common area, and all stopped their conversations to stare at me. I was scared shitless because of all the things I’d heard and seen in movies about psychiatric wards. I was expecting to see people banging their heads against the wall, wandering around with blank looks in their eyes, screaming while being tied down, or being aggressive towards me.
While I did experience some of that, you only fear because you don’t understand. I learnt that there is a reason for everything you see. If you are being tied down or injected with sedatives, it is likely because you pose a substantial threat to yourself, or to other patients and staff. People can be aggressive because of the symptoms they are experiencing. People can look zoned out because of side-effects from their medication— I experienced that myself.
At the same time, the people I got to know in this ward were also easily some of the most sensitive, mature, and empathetic people you could ever meet.
In any case, these are some of the lessons I’ve learnt after being admitted to a psychiatric ward:
1. People can seem like they have everything in the world, and still choose to die. Respect that.
My father figure, whom I will refer to as “Uncle”, was so hurt to find out that I wanted to discharge myself, then kill myself. He said, “But you have so many people who care for you and love you. Like me.” I told Uncle that I knew that. And even if I had plans for the future that I can be excited about. Even if I could tell him about my plans to apply for BTO, to get married, and start a family, I could still decide to kill myself.
2. But when people tell you they want to kill themselves, it’s a cry for help. So help them.
When people feel suicidal, it is likely that they are at their wits’ end. They feel like they have tried everything but nothing has worked. They still feel as terribly as they did before they tried, which makes them even more helpless and hopeless. So firstly, acknowledge that it is okay to feel depressed/angry/anxious, etc. But be frank and let them know that it is not okay to behave in the way they are behaving, whether it’s cutting themselves or wanting to kill themselves. Constantly remind them that while you may never understand how they’re feeling and what they’re experiencing, you’re there for them. Show some empathy.
Which brings me to …
3. We REALLY need to learn how to listen and show empathy.
Communication and active listening skills may come naturally to some, but for many, they require conscious effort to learn and practise.
Step 1: Show that you’re listening. Make eye contact. Nod. Reflect and summarise what the person’s saying.
Step 2: Show empathy. Name and acknowledge their feelings. Say, “I can see that you’re feeling ____. It must have been very difficult for you to (insert reason and show that you have been paying attention).
It may seem awkward at first, but it really helps. And when it comes naturally to you it’ll be even more effective. And then you can teach others.
4. Staying in the ward can be a well-needed respite.
I felt like I had been living on edge since the start of this year. So being warded gave me ample time and space to rest and reflect on what has happened. There is a reflection corner in the ward, complete with artificial grass, parquet flooring and the only mirrors you will find. Three large full-length mirrors (made of polished metal of course—they didn’t want people to break it and cut themselves). It was there I spent a lot of time thinking and reading. Being away from social media, work, people, and from my usual routine allowed me to give my mind and body a good rest, all while getting the appropriate support. I was given a safe space to gain insight of the thoughts and behaviours I displayed with the help of a multidisciplinary team.
5. Getting the support of a multidisciplinary team was CRUCIAL to my recovery.
Prior to my inpatient stay, I was already seeing a psychiatrist as an outpatient, where I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression. While the medications helped to control some of the anxiety symptoms I was experiencing, medication itself was not enough for me to manage my overwhelming emotions and suicidal thoughts. Inpatient admission gave the medical team more time to explore the causes of my symptoms and behaviours. It was only then my diagnosis was revised to ‘adjustment disorder’.
It was very helpful when the psychologist in the ward provided me with new perspectives on the issues I was struggling with, and challenged some of the unhealthy thought patterns I had. The mental health occupational therapist helped me to brainstorm different strategies to calm myself down when I’m feeling distressed, such as using a weighted blanket or essential oils, and encouraged me to return to my leisure activities, like writing and playing the piano. I felt more like myself again when I found myself returning to a healthier routine and enjoying my usual hobbies again.
6. Just remember that sometimes, even healthcare professionals working in a psychiatric ward may not be able to provide the help that you want them to.
Not all the doctors you speak to are specialised in psychiatry/psychology. Only the consultant a.k.a. my psychiatrist is. So, not everyone will have answers when you ask them about your treatment plan, because I was often met with, “That was what the consultant suggested.”
Additionally, not all nurses and allied health professionals working in a psychiatric ward are knowledgeable about trauma-informed care. In my experience I felt that the medical team did not know how to effectively manage me when I was feeling the most suicidal. When I told the doctor that I was feeling suicidal but I wasn’t going to tell him my suicide plan, all he could ask me was if I was going to do it in the hospital.
I guess it’s just like what my psychiatrist shared, “Medications form only 30% of the equation. The majority of the remaining 70% would be just you.”
Therefore, it is important to …
7. Have clear boundaries. Know what you can and cannot control. Evaluate the expectations you have of yourself and others.
I was warded was because I was feeling suicidal to the point where it was no longer safe for me to be left alone. But the real reason as to why I was feeling so immensely miserable was a result of countless uncontrollable external circumstances and the unrealistic expectations I had had of myself and others.
So, figure out the unexpected or uncontrollable external factors that are causing you distress. It could be Covid-19, a new job, new environment, new culture, new rules, medication side-effects, etc. Figure out the unrealistic expectations you had, eg. “I cannot make mistakes”, or “He must be there for me all the time.” Write them down, and then let them go.
Remind yourself of things you can control: your reactions and expectations. Feeling prepared. Setting healthy boundaries and writing down healthier expectations you can have of yourself and others. Identifying your triggers and brainstorming/exploring strategies (a psychologist or an occupational therapist can help you with that). This would likely inform your recovery plan.
8. There’s a limit to how long you should stay. Remember that you’re ultimately still a patient.
There was never a point in time during my stay when I forgot I was a patient. While I was taught in school to humanise people with mental health issues (that’s why you’d always refer to them as “A person/people with mental health illness” and to never categorise them as “The mentally ill”), I saw the value in being treated as a patient. Having to be in patient pyjamas, having to follow the strict ward rules—no phones, no leaving the ward, leaving your toiletries with the nurses to safe-keep … etc.
When I was on suicide watch, I couldn’t even lock the toilet door when I wanted to pee. The nurse had to be stationed outside, with the door slightly ajar. But by voluntarily having my autonomy taken away from me, it kept me awfully and consciously aware of my purpose here: to seek professional help and get better.
9. Know your rights as a patient in an adult psychiatric ward.
As long as it is voluntary admission, you have the right to decide whether or not you want to take certain medications, and you have the right to know what the medication is, and what the possible side effects are.
You also have the right to decide when you want to be discharged. I decided that two weeks was enough because while it was a good respite at the start—I definitely had way better sleep there; away from all the external stressors that were triggering my anxiety—being warded started to give me anxiety. I developed some sort of cabin fever; the rules started to feel stifling, and the fact that I couldn’t even go out for a meal or for a walk felt extremely suffocating.
Plus, I decided that I couldn’t take the overwhelming negativity that came with conversing with some patients. It dawned on me as to why the medical team discouraged us from building friendships here. “They could give you bad ideas,” they said. True enough, a new group of patients asked me, “Did you pick your scenery when you wanted to jump down?”
10. Recovery is rarely a one-way street. It’s a journey which takes a LOT of discipline. So be kind, patient, and understanding towards yourself.
Trust me, you will often feel as though you’re getting better, only to break down and feel like you’re back at square one. But it’s still progress. “It’s like taking two steps forward, one step back,” my counsellor said.
That image made a lot of sense to me. I was so disappointed whenever I experienced breakdowns; when I realised I was still feeling extremely frustrated, crying, and hitting myself over and over again. But I also noticed that I was feeling less anxious, feeling less breathless, and having fewer panic attacks. So pat yourself on the back when that happens and celebrate the small wins! Don’t be so hard on yourself. Think about how you would respond to a close friend if they came to you for help, and if they were having difficulties. Say and write down things like, “You’re making progress”, “You’re trying your best”, “You deserve to be treated with kindness”. Find a way to be healthy and happy first, then you’ll have the capacity to do that for others.
11. You will become resilient.
When I spoke to my friend after being discharged, she asked me, “So, how was it like being warded?” I laughed. I told her, “I felt like I was being pushed to my limits over and over again. But because I couldn’t kill myself, I could only learn how to be resilient.” And I did! Sometimes we just need to find a safe space, and if you need it, inpatient admission is always an option you can consider.
12. You will realise who will stick by you through your toughest times.
Duh. You’re very likely facing one of the biggest/worst obstacles in life so far. So if the person is able to handle you at your worst, cherish and appreciate them. Be grateful for them.
On the first day of my admission, I was terrified. I kept crying and shivering and holding onto my sister really tightly—my little sister by the way. In the midst wiping all my tears and snot I said to her, “Thank you so much, I really appreciate you being here for me.” And she said, “Jie jie, don’t thank me. I know you’d do the same for me if I was in your situation too”. (SHOUT OUT TO MY SISTER I LOVE YA)
Also a huge shout out to my partner, who chose to stay with me even though he could have left for the sake of his own health and wellbeing. He never gave up throughout my journey of seeking help. Both him and my sister were the ones who did the research on which hospital I should go to; which doctor I should see. Also shout out to my family and friends, who made the effort to visit and accompany me while I was warded, with the help of my sister who was my personal assistant and organised everything. And of course, my workplace supervisor, welfare officer, mentor and colleagues who have been so kind and understanding.
This brings us to the end of my story. Almost. I am merely sharing my personal experience as a mental health patient in an inpatient psychiatric ward. I am not intending to generalise the experience of others who chose or didn’t choose to be admitted. Some may have had better experiences, some worse. And I respect all of them. I just wanted people to feel more comfortable speaking up and seeking help, knowing that inpatient admission is always an option.
To the people who are reading this—who may be facing some hardships in life—regardless big or small; who may be afraid of speaking up; who may be afraid of seeking help; who may be contemplating about seeking help; who may already be seeking help, it doesn’t matter.
But do tell yourself this: it must have been really, really difficult for you. But whether or not you have already spoken to someone about it, by acknowledging that it is a problem, you’re already on track to becoming better. It’s going to be a difficult, long, and arduous journey, but have faith. You’re a lot stronger than you think.
One thing you can be certain about is that there are many people who are struggling too. All you need is the social support and the courage to find out about many others who may have similar experiences. Don’t be afraid to reach out to people for help.
Here are some of the 24/7 hotlines you can call if you ever find yourself overwhelmed/distressed and unable to cope with suicidal thoughts.
Samaritans of Singapore: 1800 221 4444
IMH mental health helpline (crisis): 6389 2222
To the people who know/ love/care about someone who is suffering from hardships: Thank you. Thank you for being there. Your person is lucky to have you. It’s not going to be easy for you too. But please don’t give up on the person. Remind them that as someone who cares for them, you’re genuinely concerned for their wellbeing, and you really want the best for them.
If they can’t figure a way out, and you can’t, then maybe it is best for them to try something different. Talk to someone different, talk to someone who is trained. Tell them you’ll arrange it for them; accompany them. Be patient and give them time to consider. Try again and again. Some people find it easier to speak to a counsellor first, so you could approach/contact a Family Service Centre nearby and receive counselling services as appropriate. I personally found it helpful to start from there.
I’m still embarking on my recovery journey. But remember, in a way, we are all in this together.

International Students Fact Check Reddit’s Op-Ed on International Students,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-international-students-fact-check-reddit/,15-Oct-20,"Not too long ago, TODAY published an article on the plight of international students who are stuck in limbo in Singapore.
Essentially, Permanent Residents (PR) and international students who undertake a Tuition Grant Scheme (TGS)—which subsidises their university fees by up to $20,000 a year—have to serve a three-year bond of employment in Singapore upon graduating.
In previous years, the scheme had worked as intended. International students attracted to local universities contribute to, and diversify, our economy as they enter the workforce. But with Singapore’s economy depressed by Covid-19, these students are finding it hard to fulfill their bond. Worse, some have secured a job, only to have their Employment Pass (EP) rejected by MOM—despite having to serve a three-year bond under MOE.
A Reddit thread on the article attracted over 300 comments, most of them from Singaporeans unfamiliar with the Tuition Grant Scheme. In response, RICE invited three international students, all of whom are TGS holders, to respond to selected comments from the Reddit thread in the hopes of clearing up misconceptions, finding out if these comments are justified.
The three students are:
1. Aaron, a 2019 Yale-NUS graduate from Oceania, who came to Singapore on a dependent pass when he was 15;
2. Ben, a 2020 NUS graduate from Vietnam, who came to Singapore on a student pass when he was 15;
3. Charles, a 2020 NUS graduate from Thailand, who came to Singapore on a student pass when he was 14 .
Note: As all three of them are in the process of applying for PR status, they have requested anonymity and are referred to by pseudonyms, lest their chances of getting PR are jeopardised.
Aaron: While it is true that I chose to come to Singapore, it’s hard to explain how heavily marketed this life was. We were scouted to come over, we were put through a local education system and told we were the same as any Singaporean from secondary to JC. Then when we graduate, suddenly, bam, we hit a wall. We are told that we are foreigners.
Charles: I’ve been here for 10 years; I came here at the start of 2010 with my brother. We were 14. My mum made a decision that changed our whole lives in a whole month. In November 2009, we were told to come to Singapore, in January 2010, we were here.
It was decided for us that we were going through this path. The path is carved out for us. All we could do was try our best and go to university in Singapore. That’s what my brother and I did. We didn’t really have a choice at such a young age.
We have integrated well into the local social fabric, but still, in the end we are sort of blocked on both sides. This guy’s comment is pretty unfair, comparing us to people who come to Singapore just for the job.
Ben: After finishing secondary school in Singapore, I started to think about whether I want to go overseas for university, or if I want to stay in Singapore.
I made the decision to stay here. For the past 6 years, at that point of time, Singapore was all I had. My friends, my social circle. A big part of my decision of why I chose to go to university in Singapore with the tuition grant is because this is the country where I live.
A lot of people will ask, ‘Why have you not applied for PR or citizenship then?’ Applying for PR is not as easy as some may think. It’s very hard … the employment policy lumps all of us together, whether we’ve been in Singapore since a young age or are here just to look for a job. But as I’m saying this I also appreciate that the foreigners who are only here to work, sometimes it’s not their choice also.
The point about depressed wages: it’s not because of us that you have depressed wages. It’s because of the company and policies that allow them to depress the wage.
Companies are able to pay us a bit higher because they don’t have to pay us CPF, that’s the idea. But the discrepancy between foreign and local PMETs is not that big.
The depression of wages is because businesses want to cut costs. It’s not because we are here.
Aaron: I personally know people who are running for specific reasons. The first person got cancer and is seeking treatment in the UK. Another has Korean national service, so he had to go back. The last one, their father attempted suicide, so they went back to America to be with their mother.
And I also know people who graduated and got high-paying jobs overseas. But they bought out the bond. So I don’t know anyone who upped and ran without paying the money back.
About the second comment: people think you can get released. No one can be released. Even the person who got cancer, MOE said, ‘You come back after you’ve beaten cancer.’ No one I know has been released from their bond.
Ben: Yes, speaking as someone on the tuition grant, it’s unclear if they’ll take away our bond if we can’t find a job for 12 months.
Charles: Even if we give them evidence that we have been looking for a job for a year, and are unable to find one, MOE will probably extend the bond. I don’t remember anyone who got released from the bond, ever.
Aaron: Ever. Ever. I know people who have been searching for 11 to 12 months. And they are still searching.
Charles: Similar to Aaron, I only know people who got really good job offers overseas, and are able to pay back the bond at one shot. Or the company wants the talent and pays off the bond for the candidate. Personally, I do not know anyone who just ran away.
Ben: The comment is correct. Fresh graduates can take up S Pass jobs as well. I think the problem is that this is not communicated well by MOE to students. For example, I only knew about this after asking an MOE officer, who was not sure about it to start with.
Aaron: I will happily work on an S Pass but I couldn’t get it because most companies reserve it for certain people.
Ben: Each company has a quota of 13% for S Pass. They save this quota for so-called less-skilled positions. If the company is small, this means only one or two S Pass positions are available.
So that leaves us with EPs. In March, when I saw that they raised the minimum from 3.6k to 3.9k, I panicked so much I emailed the school and MOE. I wrote, ‘We’re in a pandemic, how are you expecting us to find a job that pays 3.9k right away after graduating?’ The school said that they will provide career guidance and resources. But most of the time, we cannot count on the universities to help us.
Ben: For every country, there must be a differentiation between a citizen and foreigner. It boils down to the question of what it takes to receive benefits from Singapore … I respect that. But the same Singaporean who complains about NS, who said it’s a waste of time, wants us to do NS and waste our time. We are also repaying our own debt through our bond. It’s not like we are getting employment for free.
Aaron: I’m willing to serve NS at any moment’s notice. I actually tried to serve NS 3 times. I tried once at 18, but MINDEF told me ‘no’ because my parents just had their PR application denied. Half-way through university, I wrote in to ask again, but they said no. At the end of university, there was a foreign student PR scheme that came up, so I applied, fully knowing that I would have NS obligations. But I got denied again.
I really wish I had done NS.
I would have happily become some sort of OCS dude if I could. I know I differ from a lot of other kids here … perhaps it would even have been better for me if I had done NS so I could integrate better to Singapore.
Ben: I didn’t know the government rejects people from wanting to do NS. That’s very surprising to me.
Aaron: If I get PR, I’ll stay. If I don’t get PR, I’m out. My application has been pending for 12 months. I don’t think it’s going to happen.
Charles: Personally, I don’t know that many people to know the trend. But it’s the same for me, if I get PR I’ll stay. I’m actively trying to get PR.
Ben: I am planning to apply for PR at the end of next year. In any case, most of the international students I know want to get PR.
Aaron: I don’t know anyone who’s returned home. I know people 3 years above me, who finished their TGS bond, but decided to stay here.
And no one in the TGS sticks only to their own circle. That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard. All of us live and work with Singaporeans. I’m talking about 40 to 50 people who have taken the TGS. None of them have exhibited these qualities. The percentage marrying or dating a Singaporean is super high. (laughing) They’re even helping to bump Singapore’s birth rate.
I don’t buy it for a second. Unless they’re getting recruited in some India- or China-based company, but that’s just Shopee.
Laughter.
Charles: I think it’s a stereotype.
Ben: There is one big reason why we don’t stay with Singaporeans. Why? All Singaporeans have their own housing. They live in HDBs with their parents. So how do they expect us to stay with them and their parents? So I do agree to an extent. Some social circle bubbles exist because of housing.
Aaron: I am in a job that I don’t “prefer” because I couldn’t get other jobs. I took it because I needed the EP.
Ben: Most of the people I know are unable to find a job because no one offered. Like my friend—he sent to every single job he could but none offered.
And I don’t see why a person who is a foreigner and has received tuition grant should be any less selective about their own career, just because their education was partly funded by taxpayers.
Charles: I have to agree with Ben on this one. All of us know we’re strong in certain aspects, weak in others. It’s not that we’re only aiming for the top, the best paying jobs. That’s unrealistic.
But after working so hard during university to build your resume, it’s absolutely reasonable to have some level of preference in applying for jobs, because we know we are more suitable for certain jobs.
Still, all of us practise some common sense to make sure we are not too selective because we do want a job. The pressure is there.
Ben: In fact, there’s a practical reason for anyone to choose a preferred job. Because it’s a job where we can contribute the most, regardless of wage. Everyone is going to be exploited in a job anyway, whether it’s low wage or high wage, EP or S Pass.
Laughter.
Ben: In that sense, a preferred job is actually better because in that way we might have a chance to enjoy what we do, put our effort into it, contribute more, to GDP, or any other metric. So I don’t see why, from Singaporeans’ point of view, it’s bad that we are choosing our preferred job. Especially when they have been using taxpayers’ money to subsidise our tuition. Might as well let us do something we’re good at.
Aaron: I think I would fight with this fellow. I’m a political science major—
Laughter.
Aaron: A common misconception is that we came on scholarship but I’m not.
Ben: Same.
Charles: I have a huge student loan.
Aaron: Me too. If they were so smart they could get a non-bonded scholarship to UK. I couldn’t. That’s why I’m here.
But the people who are making these comments don’t understand what is needed in Singapore’s PMET scene. It needs a variety of cultures, languages, geographical scenes. MOE carefully calculates who they are bringing in. They know what they are doing. Why did they want Ben and Charles here? Because they speak Thai and Vietnamese. It’s great for businesses. I have a shitty grade, but why did they want me? I bring in all this money to my company through my connection with my home country. MOM needs to recognise this.
At the student level, the people MOE brings in are purposefully diverse to bring in business, social, and political links. How many Indonesian kids you know—their father is some rich Indonesian tycoon? That’s why you see so many rich Indonesian kids in public universities.
Singaporeans do not have the same sort of connections. MOE specifically recognises the value of bringing in people from these backgrounds.
By virtue of being different I have more value than a Singaporean. That’s the uncomfortable truth.
For Singapore to succeed, some locals have to lose out. Some foreigners have to succeed. But when one foreigner succeeds, it can also mean more locals succeed overall.
Ben: I understand their concerns and predicaments and stand by them. They are struggling: not being able to find jobs, having to cope with their expenses at this time … What they are saying is correct. The government should be looking after its citizens.
Where I don’t stand with them is that, the same problems they have, we have too. To the eyes of their families, they are the HERO of the family. But to mine, this life is about ‘doing what’s needed to put rice on the table’. For us, we also need to put rice on the table! We are not on scholarship. A lot of us have debt. And we are the same as them. We have to pay tuition fees—we have to pay higher tuition fees, compared to local students, even with the tuition grant.
It’s not entitlement. We read the contract. We sign the contract. The contract obliges us to find employment to pay off our bond. It’s not like we say that we deserve a job. We have to look for opportunities ourselves to pay off the debt.
They’re going after the wrong people. We don’t fault Singaporeans for our current circumstances. The reality is that there is a lot of confusion from both the authorities and employers that makes it difficult for us to fulfill our bond.
We simply ask Singaporeans to consider that we also share the same pain as you.
We know Singaporeans are struggling. But we are struggling too.

To Tackle Inequality, Stop Expecting The Same Rules To Make A Difference",RICE STAFF,TRUE,TRUE
"I, A Millennial Singaporean, Became a Fish Farmer For a Week",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-millennial-singaporean-fish-farmer-for-a-week/,24-Mar-21,"Photography by Liang Jin Tey unless otherwise stated
I’m sitting on a 12-seater speedboat, seawater splashing lightly onto my facemask as the Yamaha outboard motor hurtles us in the direction of Changi Ferry Point Terminal.
About a kilometre before reaching the pier, our boatman slows down and puts the engine on idle. I don’t even shift, budge or ask what’s wrong. After spending five days out at sea, I know that our small watercraft can’t just plough through the series of strong waves that the boatman spotted swelling towards us—we’d all tumble out, or at the very least, get thoroughly soaked. We waited for the waves to pass underneath before making our way to the mainland.
Our boatman, Leow Soo Khoy — but everyone just calls him Uncle SK
Admittedly, there had been a slight sense of romanticism and a considerable chunk of cheekiness when I pitched this assignment. What a fish out of water tale it’d be, I laughed (no-one else did). Joke’s on me, though — I was booted out of the office to spend a week at a modern floating fish farm. Return with a first-hand account of the farm-to-table process, they said.
I now know that it takes about eight months for Asian sea bass to grow from tiny fry to an adult that’s ready for harvesting. I now know that even if you grip an adult Asian sea bass tightly, it could still wriggle out of and/or pierce through your gloves with its sharp gill plates and spiny top fins. I now know that there’s a particular artery nestled within its gills that you need to sever and bleed out—this kills the fish quickly and produces tastier blood-free fillets. I now know the optimal storage temperature of frozen fish (about -19°C).
I also know that the smell of fish on your hands doesn’t go away for at least three days.
These lessons were gleaned from a stint on a floating fish farm located two kilometres off Changi Point Ferry Terminal. More specifically: I voluntarily worked as a farmhand on board the Eco-Ark, a rectangular floating platform that arrived in Singapore waters in October 2019. Location-wise, it’s taking up 1,400 sqm of sea-space near Pulau Ubin’s coast – about a quarter of the size of a football field.
The Eco-Ark
Accessible only by direct ferry, this was where I spent my 9-to-6 job placement for five days. Think of the facility as a high-tech farm that produces hybrid groupers, Asian sea bass and red snappers. The high-tech parts are primarily located at the front of the Eco-Ark, where industrial-sized pumps draw in seawater and filter and remove solid waste. The facility also generates its own ozone — a gas that smells like thunderstorms — to sterilise the seawater.
The resulting filtered sterilised seawater only then enters the culture tanks for Eco-Ark’s fish to live in, explained Lai Yongyi, the farm operations manager (and my temporary boss). The usually soft-spoken man, lean but sinewy from over 15 years of fish farming experience, had to speak much louder over the motorised din of the massive spinning pumps. Considering the sensitive moving parts and the crucial role in the entire operation, I’m not allowed to linger around here. Nobody is, unless they’re maintaining the pumps.

I soon got used to tuning the noise out after a couple of days on board the Eco-Ark. Worries of acquiring a harsh suntan and shaky sea legs dissipated just as quickly. The platform is entirely covered, shielded from the elements that would have rapidly baked and soaked all of us.
Solar panels line the roof, producing self-sustainable electricity to run the whole shebang. The floating platform’s foundation is spudded into the sea bed, so we’re not wobbling around. Even for a landlubber like me, the rocking sensation is just about slight.
The farm found its footing during a turbulent time. February 2020 saw the company, Aquaculture Centre of Excellence (ACE), make its first-ever harvest of fish on the Eco-Ark right before the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Much later on in November, the facility added a nursery and a post-harvesting unit, establishing a complete fish farming ecosystem. Essentially, a fish will undergo its entire life cycle from larvae to adult on the Eco-Ark before it gets harvested, killed, gutted, cleaned and packed for sale.
ACE CEO Leow Ban Tat is a firm believer in having tight control over the whole farm-to-table process. He’s happy to tout that ACE is the only company in Singapore to process its own fish—other farms outsource the processing services to a third party. More control over the whole process would mean that ACE could ensure the quality of fish stays tip-top, from the moment the fish wriggles out of its egg sac to the moment it gets sealed in vacuum packaging.
My journey from bungling writer to fumbling farmer began in Eco-Ark’s hatchery, a small, sealed-off section on the upper deck. It’s terribly humid, snug and sticky inside, but that’s by design, said Mr Lai. The environment must be kept at a constant warm temperature to ensure optimal survival conditions for the wee fish babies swimming about in the hatchery’s eight huge tubs. It gets cold out at sea at night.
Spawned from eggs purchased from the Singapore Food Agency (and neighbouring farming partners), the newly hatched young fish are minuscule, barely the size of a fingernail. Tossing tiny granules of feed over the surface of the water, Mr Lai tells me that there are up to 40,000 fish in each tub. He chuckled at my astonishment, explaining that not all of them will survive. But the survival rate here is a heck of a lot better odds than fish out in the wild.
I had the task of grading the baby fishes. This involved separating them according to sizes, splitting the big ones from the small ones to prevent the former from gobbling up the latter. Cannibalism is rampant, even among fish as young as these. But considering the tens of thousands of fish in one tank alone, how does one even begin to set the sizes apart? We used a highly advanced fish grading tool that people in the culinary circle would refer to as… a colander.
“Gentle, gentle,” cautioned Mr Lai as I swished the metal sieve around in the water to get the smaller fries to swim out of the 1.2-inch holes. Clockwise, anti-clockwise, up, down. Slowly, the tiny, fragile critters that were small enough to squeeze out of the perforations wriggled free into the waters. We released the remaining big lads into a different tub, where they can’t commit fratricide on the weaker siblings.
Meanwhile, Aung Kyaw Min — an ever-smiling farm assistant with abs for days — was occupied with scrubbing an empty nursery tub. Hygiene is crucial at this stage of the fish’s lives, said Mr Lai. The tubs and filters need to be cleaned of all the gunk once every three days, and with 40,000 fishes excreting waste in each one, you can imagine the accumulated filth.
I now know as well that when fish make it past the fry stage by developing scales and fins, they’re called juveniles. Nothing to do with delinquency though, that’s just the correct term. Once they’re about the length of a finger, the fishes graduate to the larger tanks in the nursery in the open air, no longer in musty conditions. Here was where they’d stay for months before getting transferred to the four gigantic main tanks sitting in the main deck below the nursery to grow to adulthood.
“You wouldn’t want to swim in there, man,” Ben Pang pointed at the massive, swirling tanks below.
Ben, a strapping bespectacled fellow farmhand, was just as new to the Eco-Ark as I was—the 24-year-old student had started his ACE internship a week before. It was part of his search for work experience related to his Bachelor of Science degree at James Cook University, where he’s the only student in his batch majoring in aquaculture technology. I had thought that he was a fish farming veteran the first day I came on board—he was completely covered in fish blood and scales when we first shook hands.
“Why not?”
“See all that foam and black clots?” Ben pointed at the dark, bubbly sludge spinning in the middle of the tank. “That’s from all their poop and pee.”
Ben Pang, Eco-Ark's resident intern
Though the youngest personnel on the Eco-Ark, Ben turned out to be pretty damn knowledgeable about the fish farm’s inner workings and processes and the fish that populate it.
“I guess fish saved my life,” he pondered out loud during one of our lunch breaks on an empty bumboat facing Pulau Ubin.
Having suffered from depression since he was 12-years-old, what helped keep him alive were his pet fishes: feeding them and maintaining his aquarium centred him to the path towards recovery.
It was his interest in fishing and marine life that eventually drove him to study aquaculture.
“After reflecting on it, I thought that I might as well make something out of my interest,” Ben offered. He found some additional merits to the first-hand experience working at the farm: he lost about 4kg after his first week at Eco-Ark.
Which reminds me. Despite the facility being a relatively high-tech one — with monitors to measure oxygen, ammonia and temperature in the tanks, as well as automatic feed distributors — modern fish farming still requires a decent chunk of manual labour.

Case in point: fish harvesting. ACE had just acquired a dazzling piece of industrial engineering called a fish pump, capable of sucking up live fish from one tank and transferring them into another. Essentially, the Asian sea bass gets sucked into the fish pump and gets catapulted out from the exit trough, confused but unharmed.
“It’s beautiful,” Mr Lai said out loud to no one in particular, as he watched the fishes shoot out of the tube.
The four main tanks holding the farm’s adult Asian sea bass and grouper fish go deep. Way deep. One would have to go down below decks to get a glimpse of the fishes through a glass window. Watching the fish popping in and out of view, Ben described how each of the tanks has been specially designed to maintain a continuous vortex to mimic sea currents instead of letting the water stay stagnant. Asian sea bass tends to swim against currents, and the constant exercise would mean that the fish would grow leaner and longer, which makes for nutritious meat.
Nick Goh, the senior aquaculturist on hand at Eco-Ark, added that the clean filtered seawater would mean that they could keep everything organic. No antibiotics needed to be fed for the fish to fight off infections. No vaccinations required during the juvenile stage. And certainly no growth hormones involved.
It’s difficult to pin down the 27-year-old aquaculture major to any one spot. His daily workflow sees him zipping to and fro different sections across the entire facility, checking on fish health and production rates.

On the fourth day, however, he needed Ben and I to enter one of the tanks and drive the hundreds of fish into a net for easier harvesting. But first, we had to pump out the water and climb down the ladder.
I didn’t even have to time be afraid of heights. Or perhaps it helped that I didn’t look down during the descent, with only a rope to hold on to. While I managed to drop to the bottom just fine (after minutes of awkward clambering), I realised that I really shouldn’t get any of the remaining waste-filled water anywhere near my eyes and mouth. I was waist-deep in the water, struggling to move among the swarm of sea bass darting around and in between my legs.
Together with three more farmhands, we managed to secure all the fish into a single net. Pro tip: wear some sturdy gloves if you ever find yourself hauling up a net filled with lots of fish one day. You don’t want to get cuts and bruises from the wet nylon and the struggling fishes.
Speaking of gloves, you’ll need them if you, like me, need to kill and bleed out 50 wriggling sea bass at one go.
There was a day when we hauled up over 327 kilograms of fish for harvesting, and all of them needed to be bled out quickly. It was here that I learned promptly that there is no escape from getting fish pee on my clothes during a slaughtering session.
The experience is best described like this: Attempt to pick up fish. Fish wriggles out of my hand and flops back into the tub, sending up muck and blood onto my face. Pick up fish again. Fish shoots a stream of urine at me. Grip the fish harder. Drive shears into its gills. Snip. Check if blood is flowing out. Toss bleeding fish into another tub of ozonated ice water. Repeat.
“If you’re sensitive, it helps if you don’t look at their eyes,” suggested Ben. The other farmhands didn’t even blink—they were snipping and bleeding out the fish (with bare hands) at the rate of 8 fish a minute.
Time is crucial when it comes to freshness. As soon as the fishes are killed, they are immediately sent to the post-harvesting facility — a refrigerated room where rubber boots are essential. The fish processing is handled by two young Vietnamese dudes, both of whom only speak a smattering of English.
One person descales and guts the fish, while the other power-washes the fish down and tosses it in iced water. Typically they’d do the vacuum packing as well, but since Ben and I were on hand, we would handle it.
We would stuff the fishes in special plastic bags and use the industrial vacuum sealing machines to pack each of them nice and tight. Vacuum packing the fish prevents them from spoiling easily too, with none of that fishy smell. All of them would be separated by weight class before going straight into cold storage or delivered chilled to ACE’s customers.
Prepping the fishes for vacuum packing.
It’s mainly business-to-business sales for the company right now, says Joie Lee, the General Manager for ACE’s business development side of things. The bulk of customers are made up of wholesalers, resellers and restaurants. Interestingly enough, local Thai restaurants really love getting supplies from Eco-Ark—the locally farmed sea bass make for great Thai-style steamed fish with chilli, lime and garlic. According to her, the luxe kitchens of W Hotel and Tung Lok Restaurant are supplied with fresh Eco-Ark fish as well.
Joie Lee, the General Manager (Business Development) at ACE.
Of course, the company would love to have regular folks buying their fish direct from ACE. Joie shared that on top of their own online fish market, the freshly-farmed fish is also available for purchase from Redmart.
This, on top of upcoming plans to sell their produce at NTUC FairPrice. Making their locally-farmed fish available for purchase is one thing, but getting locals to buy them is another. Joie admitted that the fish from Eco-Ark are priced a tad bit higher than imported ones.
“We need to put ourselves in the customer’s shoes and figure out why they would want to pay a little bit more,” she explained. “In the end, it’s all about just how fresh and safe our produce can be.”
Joie points out that the distance and time taken from Eco-Ark to mainland Singapore is much shorter than the stretch between overseas farms and markets here. With all the transportation, clearance at customs, and finally reaching distributors, it would take much longer for imported fish to make it from farm to table.
She rightfully points out that I should already know after working on the Eco-Ark for a week that sheer freshness is the key differentiation point.
And it truly is. I have killed a batch of 30 fishes at one go. I have seen them degutted and cleaned within an hour. I have personally vacuum-packed each of them. I have stored them in a styrofoam box filled with shaved ice-flakes. I have carried that same box on a ferry and transferred it onto a waiting freezer truck. I have seen the truck head off to a hotel, where its kitchen awaits the fresh catch. I have cooked a locally-farmed sea bass direct from the farm. And I know now that it tastes exceptional.
But would I consider leaving it all behind and become a full-fledged farmer? Perhaps. Millennial burnout is absolutely real. I can’t really remember the last time my brain wasn’t hyper-alert about to-do lists, deadlines, emails and other errands. For those five days on the fish farm, though? Things did get physically taxing at times, but at least chronic stress wasn’t around. Getting away from the city’s hustle and bustle does wonders for the soul, too, as Ben would attest. It’s a legitimately viable career option for millennials, is all I’m saying.

Idyllic views of the Pulau Ubin coastline helped, of course. As we watched the sun set on the horizon at the end of a solid day’s work, Nick expressed his hope that more people his age would want to join the aquaculture industry.
“We need more young blood,” he says. “We need people to continue ensuring our oceans stay sustainable and our people stay fed.”

Doomscrolling Is The New Banana Bread in Phase 2 (HA),https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-doomscrolling-new-banana-bread-phase-2-ha/,22-May-21,"Illustration by Ansh Sirohi
In last year’s circuit breaker, I tested all of the lockdown ‘life hacks’ from Instagram: baking banana bread, running 5km, painting with watercolours, gardening, and so on. These activities were billed as a meaningful break from the panic which pulsed through the digital world of COVID numbers, border closures, and political strife.
However, I fear that baking, running, painting, and gardening won’t cut it this time around. In hindsight, did these lockdown substitutes replicate the old normal in the new normal? No matter which ‘life hack’ I tried, the reality of the situation always settled in. At times, these activities felt extra isolating. I’d argue this is partly due to the toxic positivity that circulated on social media during the first wave of the pandemic.
I found the pressure to ‘optimize’ my time spent at home even more dystopian than the pastimes we were told to reject. Put down that evil screen with scary notifications and paint a picture of a clear, blue sky. This sentiment proliferated on social media in a barrage of infographics, which told us to practice mindfulness, stay offline, and just breathe while using the devices we needed to ‘escape’.
In truth, living through a pandemic is lonely and strange. As we enter another phase of heightened restrictions, it might do us some good to accept this and lean into the world we strove to reject during the circuit breaker.
Isolation is here to stay, for now. In the spirit of accepting reality and running headfirst into Phase 2 (HA) I have a proposition for you: embrace the doomscroll.
Renegotiating the Doomscroll
Doomscrolling is the act of spending “an excessive amount of time devoted to absorbing dystopian news.” There’s been some fear mongering by various media outlets on pandemic related doomscrolling, which casts it as an experience to be avoided at all costs. Some experts have cited anxiety, insomnia, and depression as potential side effects.
Despite a bad reputation, doomscrolling actually has an upside. Dean McKay, a Fordham University professor who specializes in anxiety disorders noted that trawling through negative content can have a soothing effect. “When you know things are pretty horrible, but you’re comfortable, you feel good about your station in life.”
I concur with McKay’s assessment. During the circuit breaker, doomscrolling felt like a suitable activity for the global moment. Yes, the world is terrible. Yes, I would like to watch an hour long compilation of Karens refusing to put on their masks.
However, when I got sucked into COVID statistics I didn’t feel the same comfort. Watching slideshows of dead bodies in refrigerated trucks on the streets of New York did not improve my mental health. What I’m getting at here is there’s an equilibrium to strike in the throes of a doomscroll. What if we microdose the doomscroll? Can we moderate our consumption of negativity the way that we moderate our intake of junk food and alcohol? I think we can, and here’s how.

To doomscroll in moderation, a good internet rabbit hole is required. There’s a condition to finding the rabbit hole, though. One must identify a subject which is sufficiently irritating, but not totally maddening. Perhaps it’s an unsolved mystery, or a niche historical event. But the most intriguing rabbit holes come from the subconscious. For example: I’m a very kaypoh person. Unfortunately, being a busybody is not a well-loved trait. So, during the circuit breaker last year I indulged my kaypohness in a doomscroll.
Firstly, I found @singapore_observed on Instagram. It’s a crowd-sourced Instagram account of public oddities in Singapore. The content varies: from car crashes, to wild boar attacks, and dramatic outbursts from eccentric characters.
@singapore_observed is like a guerilla version of STOMP. The videos are blurry or chopped at inopportune moments, and there’s no editorializing of the content beyond the odd hashtag which says something like #ahbenggonewild or #anotherkaren. The account’s small following (7,464 at press time) and the lack of effort made by its owner adds a neighborhood feeling to the posts. It’s almost like eavesdropping on public skirmishes in real time.
My second find was COMPLAINT SINGAPORE on Facebook. According to the group description, COMPLAINT SINGAPORE is “providing an Arena for Everyone to Vent their Anger & Unhappiness, Share Bad Experiences in Singapore and Most Importantly, COMPLAINT~!!”
With over 120,000 members it’s not as niche as @singapore_observed, but the content for doomscrolling is plentiful. Here, the submitters make themselves known by posting through their own Facebook accounts, describing various scenarios which have elicited ire. Most of the complaints are banal and mundane, mirroring thoughts which run through one’s mind during an inconvenience in the non-socially distant world.
Image credit: COMPLAINT SINGAPORE

When I reached out to the moderators of COMPLAINT SINGAPORE for comment on the group’s mission they shared that there was no place for sarcasm or rudeness, and they moderate comments to stop the complaints from escalating to hostility. The moderators also noted that there was an increase in engagement following the circuit breaker.
As a result of this moderation, the group has a surprisingly mellow tone. The comments under each complaint are thoughtful, usually concurring with the original poster’s frustration or simply saying I hear you, what you’ve experienced is frustrating. Witnessing these snatches of life through a screen is like viewing the world through their eyes. It’s a relaxing detour from one’s own complaints and frustrations.
Finally, doomscrolling in COMPLAINT SINGAPORE led me to another private Facebook page called “a group we all pretend to be KIASU boomers” where users inhabit alter egos and write fictional comments on the daily news in the voice of, well, a kiasu boomer. The posts are eerily realistic, and so authentic that the group as a whole becomes digital performance art. Participating in the make-believe is a welcome reprieve from face palming at the tone deaf takes on social media in response to benign mothership articles.

Tragic Optimism Instead of Toxic Positivity
As we prepare to hunker down and wait for the case numbers to drop, I’m hoping that while we’re feeling damn sian about this pandemic, we can ditch the toxic positivity and move towards an internet that is hopeful but realistic. Less judging of how others spend their time under restrictions, more acceptance of the fact that life is different now, and we all cope differently.
Do whatever it takes to get through. Whether it’s indulging in a ‘non-productive’ activity, or embracing the call to optimize your time in an ever-evolving crisis. Tragic optimism is a potential antidote to toxic positivity—it posits that “there is hope and meaning to be found in life while also acknowledging the existence of loss, pain and suffering”

Why Transgender Singaporeans Turn To Buying Hormones Off The Online Black Market",Zachary Hourihane,TRUE,TRUE
As If Covid Never Happened: Witnessing The Loneliness Pandemic In A Nightclub,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-as-if-covid-never-happened-loneliness-pandemic-nightclub/,15-Mar-21,"All images by Feline Lim unless otherwise stated.
Loneliness is the new pandemic. Like the virus itself, social distancing has a plethora of disruptive symptoms. People that rely more heavily on robust social networks—namely the young and the elderly—are experiencing isolation more intensely. The global supply chain was ill-prepared for this crisis, but socially we were even more inept.
How long can we be vigilant and resilient? It’s a question many of us asked ourselves in the undertow of the circuit-breaker. I returned to this question last weekend in Singapore’s last nightclub. It’s not billed as a nightclub per se, but for all intents and purposes, it functions like one. We didn’t expect what we saw—a flagrant breach of social distancing.
But it wasn’t a surprise, either.
Image credit: Rice Media
I was curious to visit this establishment because it had pivoted from operating as a nightclub to a restaurant in line with the Phase 3 social distancing rules. With the 10:30 PM alcohol curfew in place, the nightlife industry has faced a challenging year. So, I brought some colleagues to have dinner and support the resilience. In my teen years, I had come here to throw back shots and dance with my friends.
That’s an important part of growing up, right? Indulging the hedonistic principles when they are first available. The joy of a night out is two-pronged: there’s the adventure of sin and an escape from reality. Early adulthood is emancipation that spawns reckless, sometimes bad decisions that are remembered fondly in hindsight. It’s an imperative step towards becoming a whole, integrated person.
What happens when the avenues to indulge are indefinitely removed? Exactly what I saw last weekend: rule-breaking. I quickly realized that ‘dinner’ was a coverup for partying with minimal intervention. The menu had mouth-watering descriptions of hearty junk food that did not match the microwave dishes which landed on our table.
It wasn’t bad at first. The only warning sign of the chaos to come was a young waitress walking around with a mask tucked under her chin like an afterthought. I wasn’t concerned. Sure, the tables on the repurposed dance floor didn’t have one metre of distance between them, but I figured some would be kept empty for distancing.
Image credit: Rice Media
Security guards in red shirts patrolled the repurposed dance floor with flashlights and surly faces. I assumed they were safe distancing ambassadors, employed to keep matters civil and obedient. The stream of young adults that poured into the room with wide eyes and nothing to lose happened fast. The security guards melted into the crowd, halfheartedly breaking up the party. Some tables were packed with more than eight.
Image Credit: Rice Media
The space devolved into a smattering of intermingling groups, maskless dancers, and even a birthday celebration with a roaring twenties theme behind the DJ booth. I don’t need to harp on the irony of a prohibition-themed party in 2021.
The allure of this space was clear. First, the adrenaline from a secret rendezvous. Young adults are natural antagonists. The prefrontal cortex doesn’t fully develop until the mid-twenties, and it’s responsible for complex behavioral performance. In this instance, there is the tug of war for vigilance and resilience, shoved aside in favor of an escape from the sterile world of safe entry, mask-wearing, and contact tracing.
Young people have lost social rites of passage to the pandemic. Graduations, parties, the first year of university—all taken at a moment’s notice, and not supplanted with viable avenues to indulge or rebel. Admonishing young adults for behaving badly is a swipe at low-hanging fruit. Of course, they are irresponsible and careless. Haven’t we all been there and done that? When has reprimanding a rebellious teen ever worked?
But placing the blame squarely on the establishment is a cheap shot too. Nightlife workers are in a tight spot. Pivoting to the foodservice or otherwise trying to conform to the measures of Phase 3 is costly and sometimes unfeasible. It’s a bureaucratic maze of licensing, rental, and operational woes. The fluid nature of the restrictions throws another spanner in the works—seen in the swift reversal of a pilot programme to reopen nightclubs and karaoke bars.
The prevailing sentiment is that nightlife workers must restructure their operations or call it a day. It’s a disheartening ultimatum, which doesn’t fully account for the value and demand of escapist hedonism. Two symptoms converged to create chaos in this former nightclub: loneliness and desperation. Young adults will find a way to act out, regardless of what’s going on in the world. As the partying spun out of control, we quickly asked for the check. While waiting, the DJ hopped on the mic and made this plea to the crowd:
“If you guys want to come here every weekend you have got to help us. Help us, help you. There can’t be more than 8 people per table. Okay? One more thing, please do not take any Instagram videos. Again, help me, help you.”
It was a shameless appeal from an embattled industry to a lonely group. The motives of both parties are valid and understandable. But creating a public health risk by exploiting the naivety of young adults, then encouraging bad behavior, will not solve this problem.
Image credit: Rice Media
My sympathy for the operators of this establishment—presumably acting from despondence—waned for a moment when I spoke to the waitress who brought our check. She described her working conditions as ‘fun’ but ‘unfair.’ The servers are young, mixed, slim, and attractive girls who are encouraged to source other young adults from their large followings on social media to spend money at this club. She divulged that the security guards were not social distancing ambassadors, but bouncers hired by the club to stop people from taking videos.
The fun part of her job: free drinks throughout her shift. The unfair part of her job? Lacking compensation. On a table with a minimum spend of $400, which servers are pressured to source patrons for, she earns $5 on top of her $8 an hour. My first response was again, compassion for the young adults who frequent this club. But Singapore’s success in regaining a semblance of normalcy is due to our collective action. These are not children, and they are not exempt from the rules.
We all want to have fun, let loose, and feel a sense of normalcy and belonging. But one person’s want is no greater than the other. Sacrifice has brought us far. We are able to visit our friends and family and gather with caution. These are small blessings, but miracles nonetheless. Loneliness aside—partying is not essential. In this instance, the behavior of the nightclub workers and the revelers are equal in poor taste.
As I mentioned earlier, this situation was a shock but not a surprise. The reason both parties flouted the rules is clear. The way forward, to prevent something like this from happening again, is a trickier path to chart. Loneliness and desperation are at the heart of this encounter, and these phenomena have had dire consequences during the pandemic in other parts of the world.
In the UK and Japan, suicide rates in young adults have skyrocketed during the pandemic. Institutionally, this problem is addressed by the appointment of a ‘loneliness minister.’ The Japanese minister for loneliness has a dual function—he is also in charge of addressing declining birth rates and an aging population.
We’ve heard some discussion in Singapore, post GE2020, about the plight of caregivers due to our own aging population and declining birth rates. Social issues are entwined—addressing the symptoms without interrogating the root cause is palliative instead of preventive care.
I wonder—are the declining birth rates and aging population in Singapore, symptoms of a larger disease? And is that disease the pandemic of loneliness? A cure for the current loneliness is on the horizon with the vaccine. We’re in the home stretch of the race to normality, but treating the symptoms will not vanquish the disease.
Breaking the rules is unacceptable. But perhaps the first step we can take towards solving pandemic-spawned loneliness and desperation is to meet it first with compassion.

Tired of Covid-19? Here Are 3 Life Lessons From People Living Alone During Lockdown,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-covid-19-life-lessons-people-living-alone-lockdown/,23-Apr-20,"We are now entering the third week of lockdown—or the Circuit Breaker (CB), as we’re calling it in Singapore—and we’re just starting to make sense of all the changes happening in our lives. For people living alone, it’s an unprecedented time.
In Singapore, most young people live with their families or flatmates. For those who live alone, most have probably never gone for extended periods of time without seeing anyone.
While the lockdown poses challenges for everyone, we can’t deny that living with people makes it a lot easier right now (assuming, of course, that you’re on good terms with who you live with). I like to think of myself as one of the lucky ones because I might miss my friends, but I have my family to eat with, watch movies with, workout with, and a dog to walk which gets me out of the house.
What happens when you don’t have that?
“I feel like I’m trapped. Like I’m in jail,” says Kelvin Kuan, a Malaysian citizen who has been working in Singapore for over 5 years. “There’s only so much I can cook and bake for myself.” Daniel Olagunju, a 30-year-old UK expat, said that he relies on calls from friends and family, including happy hours on apps like Houseparty, to stay entertained.
Kelvin describes to me what sounds like cabin fever. And throw into the mix a little bit of loneliness too, which has been shown to have similar effects on your body as cigarette smoking—and that’s during ‘regular’ times, when society functions as per normal.
Among other activities, Kelvin entertains himself by working out and baking.
So now, when people living alone are forced into isolation for weeks on end, what goes through their heads? We spoke to them to hear about what they’ve learned in these times, and the lessons that might continue to be relevant when all this is over.
Address Your Mental Health
Particularly on weekends, Kelvin’s cabin fever grows strong. He wakes up, works out, and cooks himself something for breakfast.
“But by the time I have done that, it’s only 11 am,” he tells me. What is there to do for the rest of the day? He admits, “Eventually, I do some panic shopping. I buy new plants and other things just to feel better.”
Whether shopping is the best way to deal with our uncomfortable emotions remains debatable, but one thing’s for sure: lockdown or not, we need to address our mental health.
Hanli Hoefer, a 27-year-old actress and host, has also been experiencing a rollercoaster of emotions in the past few weeks. She has been living alone since she was 21, and loving it. But now she’s experiencing a different side to it.
When I called Hanli, she said, “Today, I am good. But it’s been one of the longest weeks of my life so far.”
Dinner time is one of the hardest for her. When she sees people posting photos of themselves eating with their family or flatmates, she feels extremely lonely.
“Eating on this huge round table alone is a really sad scene actually. And I don’t really know anyone else that lives alone, so I don’t mind butting in and calling my friends.”
“I just call them and make them eat with me.”
Hanli said she is really grateful to have her dog with her during this time.
There are also other things we can do to keep our mental health in check. For example, we can try out meditation, breathwork, and other activities in the realm of wellbeing.
Vanessa Ainsley, a 31-year-old mindset coach, tells me that the extra time on her hands has allowed her to look introspectively in new ways, and breathwork helped her do that.
Normally, she is the kind of person that signs up for a lot of challenges and courses—but rarely has the time to follow through. Now, she has managed to commit to an 8-day breathwork workshop until the very end.
“I’m not sure if you’re familiar with breathwork but it can bring up your old traumas and suppressed emotions,” Vanessa explained to me. “So for me to have the time to process those emotions and go through the whole thing was really nice.”
In general, Vanessa said that this extra time has allowed her to live a healthier lifestyle. This is partly due to the fact that she is working on feeling better on the inside, which allows her to be more motivated to do more for herself in other daily activities as well.
“I regularly work out and I cook all of my meals now,” she said. “I haven’t ordered any takeout and I have signed up to get organic produce boxes delivered to me every week, so I’m finding it fun to make new healthy dishes all the time.”
Vanessa cooks all her meals and works out daily.
Making time for ourselves, and prioritising our well being should be done year round—not just when we are forced to. And while not all of us have access to organic produce boxes, anyone can access a variety of free resources online for meditation, breathwork, or even journaling.
The lockdown may have given us the time and tools to experiment with self-help, but we should bring this knowledge forward. Everyone works differently, but ensuring we leave enough ‘alone’ time here and there can drastically change our mood for the better.
Limit Your News Consumption
While dinner is the time Hanli feels the loneliest, anxiety creeps in from time to time as well, “especially when I get sucked into the news,” she said.
The news has always been somewhat dark. Climate disasters, shootings, terrorist attacks, or other dramatic events of some other variety are constantly happening elsewhere in the world.
Under normal circumstances, we might have work, friends, and family to distract us from all this. But now that we are locked up at home all day, there seems to be no escape from the news.
Especially during this time, we all face the pressure of staying up to date with the latest health and safety updates—especially the daily virus count. But while being in the loop is considered responsible, we also need to know when to draw a line. The news can take a toll on our physical health in various ways, by startling our limbic system (the part of our brain that deals with emotions), and by releasing cortisol (one of the stress hormones), among others.
So maybe, we should limit our consumption … always?
“If I go too deep, that’s when I start to get anxious, and that’s when the severity of the situation dawns on me. So I call a friend, and I tell them that i’ve been feeling really down because of something I read.”
When she gets lonely at dinner time, Hanli finds that reaching out to people is a great way of releasing some of the emotions of helplessness or anxiety that come from reading the news. Implicit in this is recognising that there’s nothing wrong with reaching out. You should not be ashamed that you might be feeling needier than usual.
Vanessa reading.
In The Guardian, Rolf Dobelli writes that he has gone 4 years without the news, and that he feels “less disruption, less anxiety, deeper thinking, more time, more insights”.
“It’s not easy,” he says, but it’s worth it.”
That said, we shouldn’t give up reading altogether. Dobelli stresses that “society needs journalism—but in a different way”. Instead, he focuses on reading investigative journalism pieces, long journal articles, and in-depth books.
Staying up to date with the times is still important, but the format we consume that in is what makes a difference.
Explore Our Relationship With Intimacy
Kelvin confessed that during these times, “not being able to have sex is one of the most difficult things.” But the silver lining is that “people are more likely to be down for phone sex nowadays.”
“I do phone sex with or without the circuit breaker anyways. The only difference is that people who don’t normally do it have considered it now. It’s changed the landscape a bit.”
As a single man, Daniel expressed similar feelings.
“It’s quite funny, on dating apps there’s an option now to virtually date. You can go on an immediate video call,” he said.
“I have nothing to lose, I mean I’m in the comfort of my own home.”
Daniel and his work from home set up.
Daniel actually tried it, with a woman named Denise who was meant to move to Singapore before the circuit breaker was implemented.
“Having the video time allowed me to focus on our conversation,” Daniel said. “Kind of like a mix between Love is Blind and Too Hot to Handle—removing the physical gives you a chance to understand each other on a different level.”
Maybe, with this added feature on dating apps, the status quo for online dating will change as well. We will start by virtually ‘going out’ for our first dates, and if all goes well, the second one will be in person.
Another area of intimate exploration is sex toys.
In a recent article I wrote, I interviewed Janice, a Singaporean woman who went from being in corporate HR to selling sex toys. She told me that “since this virus outbreak, I have been so busy.”
She has acquired a bunch of new clients who want to use the spare time to explore using sex toys alone or with partners.
“We need to get to know our own bodies before letting another person in,” Janice told me. “And with partners, it’s important to spice things up and try new things every once in a while.”
These points are both extremely important and relevant not just now, but in general as well. Whether it’s trying out a virtual date, or incorporating different tools in the bedroom, we should constantly explore our boundaries.
These elements contribute to living a fulfilled and happy life.

Is Food Delivery in Singapore Too Cheap?",Edoardo Liotta,FALSE,TRUE
What Westworld Teaches Us About Singapore’s Blind Spots,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-westworld-singapore-blind-spots/,29-Apr-20,"If you’ve heard anything about Westworld Season 3 at all, it’s probably that Westworld is shot in Singapore.
Judging by the number of scenes, it must be the biggest local production since Crazy Rich Asians.
Nearly every episode features some recognisable local landmark. Aaron Paul takes the MRT to go for an interview at LASALLE. Afterwards, he takes a stroll and makes it as far as Ion Orchard before the rejection call comes in. Dolores books a hotel at Parkroyal Pickering to liaise with her lover. Maeve meets her new expat employer at—where else—Atlas Bar.
Unlike Crazy Rich Asians, however, Westworld Season 3 is not an extended Singapore Tourism Board ad. Crazy Rich Asians was shot in Singapore, but our country has never been more than just pretty wallpaper for a fantasy of Asian-American empowerment.
Westworld, on the other hand, does not identify Singapore as its setting. We are only standing in for Futuristic City Par Excellence. However, the show does raise some uncomfortable questions–perhaps quite inadvertently.
In interviews, Jonathan Nolan said he chose to film here because the future had already arrived ‘in places like Singapore’. “You just need to know where to look,” he says. However, I’m not sure if this is the compliment everyone seems to think it is. Especially when the future is a tech dystopia riven by massive inequality.
The Air-Conditioned Westworld
Westworld, as regular viewers would know, is a theme park populated by hosts (robots), where murder is permitted and rape highly encouraged. Last season, Dolores—one of the hosts—escaped from Westworld to take revenge on the humans who abused her.
This season, she discovers that humans have done a pretty good job at fucking themselves over.
We may not be robot serfs, but we are certainly not as ‘free’ as one would imagine. In the park, the hosts are slaves to human whim. Outside, the humans are slaves to big tech companies like Facebook or Amazon.
Okay, they are not called Facebook and Amazon, but they might as well be. Incite Inc—the movie’s main antagonist—is an amalgamation of all your favourite tech companies, from Grab to Tinder. Like these companies, it gathers data on its users. So much data, in fact, that it can predict the future, manipulate elections, and even destroy your love life—just as tech companies are already doing, but on a much larger scale.
So far, so Black Mirror, I hear ye say. You are not wrong, but Westworld differs in one crucial aspect. While Black Mirror invariably depicts such data technology as evil and insidious, Westworld is more … ambivalent about the subject.
It’s true that Incite’s data and AI basically control the world, but they are a benevolent master. Before Incite, the world was torn apart by chaos. Nuclear disasters, civil unrest, Hock Lee Bus riots—you name it. After the Incite took control, there has been nothing but relative peace and prosperity.
In fact, we even witness its ‘wisdom’ in action. When Incite discovers how the Brazilian President’s corruption has worsened separatist conflicts, it immediately issues an ultimatum. Clean up your act or eat a bullet. Suitably chastened, he complies. Hence, through the miracle of data technology and surveillance, it has created a world that’s undeniably safer and better, albeit at the expense of free will.
In short, Incite offers what Cherian George describes in his famous essay The Air-conditioned Nation. A trade-off between civil liberties and material comfort. In exchange for surrendering your personal data—your political agency—you get to live in a universe of order and stability. You get to live … in Singapore.
Is this a good thing or a bad thing? The show wisely defers judgment. On one hand, the idea of being controlled by an AI causes us to rebel almost instinctively. However, the streets do look clean, green, and terribly efficient. Incite’s driverless ride-hailing service puts Grab to shame. Its control—much like our own authoritarian system—has resulted in a “desirable standard-of-living”. No doubt many kill for the privilege.
The catch? It has also produced massive inequalities in wealth and power. On one end are tech billionaires who are virtually gods. The other end is occupied by people like Caleb, a ex-soldier with no money, no prospects, and serious mental illness.
Caleb is a good person. In another time—as Dolores judges—he might actually ‘make it’ through pure grit. In the data-driven dystopia of Westworld where every facet of his past is known, he doesn’t stand a chance. He is denied better employment because companies buy data from Incite and thus know everything about his past. To make ends meet, he is driven into petty crime, which worsens his social credit score and thus further reduces his employment prospects.
Like the robots in Season 1, he is trapped in a loop which he cannot escape.
To what extent is this ‘Meritocracy’ a lie? Caleb’s predicament recalls our Education streaming system, where students are sorted according to their ability (or is it potential?).
Officially, the system is justified because students of different abilities learn at different paces. Unofficially, however, there is nothing to stop your stream from becoming a self-fulfilling prophecy. Caleb’s downward spiral is not unlike the loop which Jack Neo once portrayed in I Not Stupid. Students sorted into the Normal stream are demoralised. Many of them see their position not as a temporary setback, but a definitive verdict. Like Caleb, they struggle against the baggage of their past performance while Special students are given opportunities to excel and pull ahead.
In one of the most progressive and widely-applauded moves in recent years, Minister Ong Ye Kung has since dismantled the streaming system. However, his purview is limited. Even a Minister cannot dismantle the larger inequalities in our nation.
Control or Freedom? Chaos or Comfort? This is the binary choice which Westworld Season 3 presents.
It is also a political Rorschach test. Whether you choose to side with Incite or Dolores might be a good indicator of how you would vote in the next general election. The show asks the most fundamental question in politics: What would you sacrifice for a comfortable, stable life?
These are rather unpopular questions to ask during a pandemic. Unfortunately, they are absolutely necessary. Right now, the temptation is to give up everything to defeat covid-19. Anything goes if we can flatten the curve. Take my data. Take it all and count the cost later.
But what happens when the contagion ends? The virus will eventually run its course, but the problem posed by AI/Data will remain for the foreseeable future. How nation-states choose to deal with the immense power of data technology will determine the shape of things to come. Israel’s Mossad is using its extrajudicial powers to contact-trace. China has already built a social credit system with little opposition or fanfare.
The robot hookers and cowboys are gone, but the show has only grown more disturbing as it leaves Westworld for our world. Or as Chernobyl often reminds us: “Reality is the most horrifying genre of all”.
Westworld Season 3 is available on HBO and HBO Go. If you’re dying of boredom, freeze all motor functions to catch up with reality. New episodes air every Monday.

"They Launched Their Businesses Smack In the Middle of Covid-19. Crazy or Unlucky, You Decide",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-business-covid-19-crazy-unlucky/,19-Jun-20,"Even when the first case of Covid-19 hit in January, the business climate in Singapore still looked promising. MNCs were shifting operations from the politically-entangled Hong Kong to Singapore, and growth opportunities seemed to be concentrated in Southeast Asia.
Buoyed with optimism, new business owners came into entrepreneurship—this was an opportunity large enough for them to commit to a change in careers. But as increasingly stricter rules were imposed, these aspiring business owners were soon badly hit.

Against the backdrop of a frail disposable tablecloth-turned-curtain, Shen connected over video call on the second day of her cafe’s reopening. Just two weeks before this reopening, stricter measures imposed during the CB had closed her cafe.
Shen’s aunt was a second-generation owner of a 34-year-old bakery, and was looking to retire. Last year, Shen’s aunt asked her if she wanted to take over, but Shen wasn’t sure if her aunt and uncle had made up their minds about handing over the family’s legacy.
At that time, Shen was traveling frequently to Germany for personal reasons. She was also starting up a business in sustainable fabrics with two like-minded friends she had made during her travels. Upon her return from Berlin, Shen confirmed the transfer with her aunt, and started to prepare the paperwork while on her next trip to Vietnam.
“I thought hard about what I could do with the place because I can’t bake,” Shen laughed.
Instead of continuing with the bakery, Shen decided to start a cafe, envisioning a community for people to interact in a space surrounded by environmentally-conscious materials. But from building a community space to using environmentally-friendly materials, the pandemic changed Shen’s plans almost entirely.
Over our Facetime call, Shen ascended an unfinished staircase and showed me the second floor of a modern shophouse. Walls separating the bedrooms had been knocked down to create an open space for a 2.7 metre-long table.
For Shen to change the shop from a bakery to a cafe, approval took months. And it took her yet another month to receive the approval to knock down the walls of the old bakery. Shen had pushed her timeline again and again.
“I thought I would be ready (to open) by end Feb. And then later I thought, okay March. And then the situation got worse.”
More delays came her way when Malaysia announced its Movement Control Order in March. To continue renovations, Shen needed to find a new plumber when her original plumber returned to Malaysia before the MCO. Though those who remained in Singapore stayed to help, Shen still faced a shortage of workers. As we spoke, the staircase was yet to be cemented, and stacks of chairs sat in the corners.
She considered offering the second floor of her cafe to her Malaysian workers to stay in Singapore, but was quickly told it wasn’t allowed.

Months of renovation also meant months of rent payment without income for Shen. With a lease transferred from her aunt, she was not eligible for a rent-free period during renovations, typically made available for new owners. So when the first floor of the cafe looked ready for business in early April, Shen contacted Singapore Food Agency (SFA) for an inspection right away, and the news of CB soon followed.
Things took an unexpected but positive turn when the SFA responded to her request in mid-April. On April 21, when dine-in was no longer allowed, Shen’s cafe opened for the first time, taking only takeaway orders. With makeshift front and back doors and a barren second level, Shen’s then-newly opened cafe had been under renovations longer than expected.
But before residents in the area could ask about the months-long halt and its connections with the older bakery, Shen’s cafe was banned from operating, together with other shops selling only beverages and desserts.
On the same day, a 24-hour window to close had sent F&B outlets scrambling to add a hot food menu to keep business open.
“It was not the clearest instructions,” Zal, another coffee brand owner working with Shen, commented. After an hour of deliberation, Shen told Zal that she wanted to “keep to the spirit of the circuit breaker”. And the temporary closure of the cafe began after two days of operations.
With CB came restricted supplies of the most common sort: glasses and paper bags. To make sure she could last through it, Shen bought more supplies than needed when the surprise license to open came. Her paper bag supplier told her she was lucky to get them, especially when suppliers were saving quantities for their existing customers. In the following week, Shen was hurrying around the island to find new glass bottle suppliers for cold brew. To maintain the flow of operations, she now needed three different suppliers.
The little takeaway window designed for customers with pets, baby prams, or a quick to-go order replaced physical interactions inside the cafe. With the sliding glass pushed aside, customers in the neighbourhood could exchange a few lines of conversation with cafe staff when they were handed their coffee.
Shen’s plans to build a community based on physical interaction will still be on hold before her contractors finish up with the works at her cafe.
Ilya’s eSports arena was amongst the first entertainment venues to close. For Ilya, the arena was both a childhood passion and physical evidence of his relocation to Singapore. On the fifth week of his new venture in Singapore, he had to shutter the business.
In 2019, upon his arrival in Singapore from Dubai for a telecom consulting project, Ilya fell in love with the country, and requested to relocate here. Just half a year later, in June 2019, Ilya quit the job for which he was spending a third of the year travelling. Together with a friend, he pooled his savings and raised funds to start his gaming arena and a professional gaming team based in Malaysia.
When attending an eSport tournament in Germany in late January, Ilya heard news about the spread of Covid-19, but dismissed it as an “overhyped” problem. Upon his return, he oversaw the final touches to his 3,450 square feet gaming arena, and waited for the end of CNY holidays to start his business. Unlike the eSports team that now participates in online tournaments, the eSport arena is dependent on revenue from physical operations—something far from sight even in Phase 2.

Just a week before Ilya’s arena was set to open on February 7, MOH confirmed an unlinked Covid-19 case, and Singapore went into DORSCON Orange. Amidst a gradual build-up of anxiety, Ilya’s eSports arena opened for business in Bugis.
In those five weeks, business looked as promising as he had predicted for Singapore, which he called “a developed market with extremely underdeveloped gaming arenas”.
But when entertainment venues were told to close on March 24, Ilya’s eSports venue was among the first to close. In Bugis, restaurants and bars were still packed with crowds. While some businesses have taken the chance to move their operations online, Ilya’s e-sports arena depends entirely on their physical capacity for revenue. In what Ilya called “a good old LAN shop”, it now weighs heavily on Ilya’s finances.
Ilya was expecting a closure at some point in time. Other countries were doing the same, and the overall strategy made sense to Ilya.
“You need to make sure that there’s less contact between people. At that moment of time, I didn’t quite understand.”
While the subsequent budget announcements made available financial support for Ilya to retain his permanent staff, Ilya was left with no income for himself, a foreigner in Singapore. On top of this, he has no family in Singapore.
“You’re allowed to visit your Singaporean relatives but I don’t have Singaporean relatives. So nothing changes for me.”
Ilya has maintained his faith in his business model and the market for gaming in Singapore, using the closure to sort out more detailed staff instructions and check off the other 31 tasks on his to-do list for the day.
“If the new reality is not normal for our business, then we need to see what to do with that. We don’t have unlimited funds.”
As Singapore moves into Phase 2 of reopening, Ilya’s E-sports arena remains shuttered but he remains hopeful for a reopening before Phase 3.
“Hopefully more Singaporeans can know us and give us support.”
Less than 10 minutes away from Ilya’s store, a newly opened dessert shop sits among the fiercest supper competitors on North Bridge Road. Allowed to reopen on May 12, the Chinese dessert shop is now packed with colourful desserts stacked on wooden tables that had been intended for dine-in.
Before opening the dessert place with his partner in early January this year, Andy was a loan consultant who loved to cook. At the end of February, when it was certain that Covid-19 had truly hit Singapore, things became more uncertain.
Andy had wanted to make his move into F&B for a long time: “I love desserts a lot. I love to cook. I hope I can bring some of my specialties to share with more Singaporeans.”
It all started to change when the 1m social distancing rule was introduced. In the two-storey shophouse that can fit 50 people, maintaining the 1m social distance within a small food establishment meant the shop could only fit less than half of its original capacity. On April 7, just two weeks later, dining in was no longer allowed.
“We hung on for about two, three weeks and then the second announcement by the government, all bubble tea and dessert shops have to close within 24 hours. Remember that one?” Andy laughed in resignation. “That was really a disaster for us.”
Other than to close, Andy had no idea of what he could or should do within the 24 hours. “At that point, we did not have any directions … There’s nothing much we can do, in fact.”
Until the reopening of confectioneries and beverage stores were allowed on May 12, Andy was left with no alternative.
Just like many other small F&B outlet owners, the closure directed Andy to expand their delivery services. They brought their business to more delivery apps, and started their own online ordering platform.
After coming across news about doctors and nurses on the frontline, Andy initiated an effort to provide support to medical workers and spread the shop’s name through charity. One of Andy’s relatives had the same thought, and shouldered half the cost. With the finances secured, Andy quickly put his initiative into action. He emailed #SGUnited to request an exemption to operate and deliver desserts to medical workers. Hospitals like SGH, KK, and Alexandra gave Andy the green light to swing by with his 100 bowls of desserts.

For the past two months, Andy and his crew have been getting up earlier than usual to prepare for bulk deliveries on three days of the week.
After an MTI announcement in May, the dessert shop resumed business on May 12. When asked about the plans on future hospital deliveries, Andy hesitated. After a 50% drop in his projected revenue, Andy and his small team have to focus on getting the business back on track.
At the time of our call in May, Andy believed that dine-in would not be possible in the next two months. He turned his attention to registering for SafeEntry and enhanced the shop’s online ordering platform.
But a month after reopening, messages from hospital staff saying “they love and say your glutinous rice is super nice” kept Andy going as he prepared to reopen for dine-in.
“Hopefully more Singaporeans can know us and give us support.”
In our communities, various home-based shops are closing for good. For these three business owners, determination propelled their switch. And now, they have to adapt to new conditions when opportunity turns into uncertainty and unforeseen losses.
Shen runs Kizuna Cafe, Ilya, Reality Rift Arena, and Andy, Chow Zan Dessert.

Schools Reopening During Covid-19: 2 Parents at RICE Debate MOE’s Decision,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-schools-reopening-covid-19-parents-at-rice-debate-moe-decision/,24-Mar-20,"Top Image: Cheryl Tang / RICE File Photos.
This is a debate between Terry Ng and Vinita Ramani, two of our colleagues here at RICE who also happen to be parents. While they disagree over whether schools should have resumed as per normal, they also share a lot of dissatisfaction with how some things have been handled.
The number of people now infected with the coronavirus has surged to over 300,000. Globally, over 13,000 people have succumbed to the virus. Across the world, borders have closed and countries have instituted massive lockdowns to contain the spread. The existing data seems to suggest that children, while susceptible to the virus, appear to recover more quickly than their parents and grandparents. Nonetheless, over 100 countries have closed schools. In many cities or counties, parents are exercising their own discretion, and opting to keep their children out of school, regardless of whether the local government mandates a closure.
Singapore is an exception to this new and growing norm. This week, a petition was started at Change.org by parents who believe schools in Singapore should close, in keeping with the global trend to fight the coronavirus. Signed by close to 7,000 people, it exposes the increasing divide in Singapore between parents who want the schools to stay open, and those who want it shuttered for at least two weeks. Education Minister Ong Ke Yung explained in a Facebook post why schools will reopen this week, following the March school holidays.
There is no “right” answer in this debate. Every parent has a different perspective. We at RICE asked two staff writers, who are also parents, to tell us why they disagree with both each other and with MOE’s decision.
Vinita: I have a three-year old daughter who goes to preschool everyday. We changed schools in January, so she’s taken time to adjust, adapt, and settle into a new environment. I have a helper at home, and my in-laws (who don’t live with us) are very involved in my daughter’s life: they play with her, read to her, take her on walks with their dog, teach her Tamil and so on.
As a writer and editor with Rice, you could argue I’m in the ideal position to choose for schools to close. But I hope they will stay open.
As a parent of a toddler, we can engage in lots of fun activities at home (painting, reading, craft, dancing, singing, etc), but we don’t have the sort of sit-down school work/assignments that older kids have to keep our little ones occupied for an entire day.
We did a trial-run of staying at home when Covid-19 first spiked, and Singapore was among the top three countries with cases. For nearly three weeks I kept my daughter at home. I wasn’t working at Rice at the time, so I was able to manage this. But I did feel over time, that she wasn’t able to access the benefit of being with kids her age, and of building those subtle, but vital social skills that are valuable at this stage of life.
Keeping a toddler at home presents some challenges. They tend to need lots of attention, particularly if you have an only child. If playgrounds are not safe (i.e. they’re not sanitised regularly, unlike schools), then we run out of options, beyond outdoor walks with our kids. Working from home, and having your toddler/preschooler at home, is also difficult.
So I’m glad preschools are still open.
Terry: I have a five-year-old daughter who’s turning six in April. She’s attending K2 Mondays to Fridays. Since Singapore started reporting Covid-19 suspected and confirmed cases, my wife and I have restricted her outdoor activities at our neighbourhood playground.
She used to go there and play with her neighbours every weekday from 5 to 7 PM, but doesn’t do so anymore. Instead, she stays home and does drawing, colouring, and activities (with her parents). On weekends, she watches YouTube and cartoon channels. Occasionally, we take her out for a swim in a nearby pool.
Two of the reported Covid-19 cases came from the same street where we live. I remember when the first case near our block was reported and folks in our neighbourhood started sharing on Facebook. People started putting on masks when they stepped out.
There was an aura of anxiety. But this dissipated after a week or so. Then, other countries started reporting cases and deaths, and Singapore went into DORSCON Orange. We started taking more precautions, making sure our daughter put on her mask when she goes to school or goes out.
In recent days, Singapore’s infected cases have been on an upward trajectory. I’m seeing staggered steps being made on a near-daily basis to stem the inflow of imported cases. Many of these cases are from Singaporean and PR residents returning from overseas. The intensity of spikes and new measures coincided with the one-week March school holiday (14-22 March).
This means that parents who took their children abroad and returned (from non-high-risk countries or before the 20 March SHN mandate) but failed to declare them may potentially be introducing infected but asymptomatic children into classrooms when school reopened on 23 March.
I feel the school break should have been extended for another week.
Vinita: Yeah, from that perspective I understand. Related to that: the issue that bothers me is that we didn’t close our borders sooner. We let residents in Singapore travel. We let parents with kids travel. Why did we do that?
To me, that’s the heart of the matter. If you’d instituted travel bans sooner, we’d not have to worry about closing schools now. We’ve done it now and I hope we’ll see a flattening of the curve, and a more disciplined approach to containing this virus within Singapore.
This entire dilemma is being exacerbated by the fact that parents who are less anxious about Covid-19, would have travelled right until the restrictions were imposed. For those of us who placed restrictions upon ourselves, who self-regulated (i.e. we have not travelled since January), now have to deal with the people who chose to travel and exposed themselves to the virus.
The travel declarations help, and I hope that keeps the parents and kids who travelled, at home, so that the rest of us (who did practice social distancing, or who have refused to travel, for fear of exposure to the virus) don’t have to have our routines disrupted.
But for me, as a parent, this is also where I’m putting my trust in the system: those travel declarations will be answered truthfully. There are penalties if you don’t. Sadly, I think introducing penalties that are real (i.e. you can be prosecuted) is the only way to ensure we have a clear picture of what’s going on.
Measures to keep these people at home ensures there is no need for a blanket closure, thereby penalising parents who want to send their kids to school, like me.
That said, I wanted to ask you a question Terry: is keeping your kid at home for two weeks (or more) something that works, from a day-to-day perspective? Who stays home? How do you figure out the routine at home?
Terry: It more than works, at least in my situation. The Manpower Ministry has encouraged companies to stagger employees’ work, allowing for work-from-home and BCP strategies. So my wife and I are now spending more time at home (far more than usual on a work week).
So even if our daughter stays at home for an additional week, I think she’s more than covered with adult supervision! She can even e-learn and life-learn through us from home. I’ve recently bought us a Google Home device so she can ask encyclopaedic questions and get intelligent responses.
I feel that there are two schools of thought now and the messaging differs between the Education Ministry and the Manpower Ministry. Work-wise, employees are advised to work from home; school-wise, children are advised to go to school now.
I think this disparity needs a serious review because it seems to tell me that workers can stay home and continue to be productive, but school children need to go to school to be productive.
Vinita: That’s not how I interpret it. I don’t think they’re concerned about productivity, so much as they are about herd immunity. Kids are not (yet) as vulnerable. So they want to keep the routine going by keeping schools open, at least until we have good reason to impose drastic measures.
The second point is this: you and I can make these choices. We can sit here and have this conversation, even if they close schools. We’ll figure it out. We can go into a room and shut the door, have our morning editorial meeting, and work on this story. What about frontline healthcare workers? People in transport, logistics, security etc? Basically every sector where you cannot work from home? What about low-income families who don’t have computers and i-pads for e-learning at home? Not everyone has access to learning online. And what about people who have elderly parents who can’t help with supervising kids?
In my case, my father has stage III Parkinson’s Disease. I cannot lean on my parents for regular help because it’s simply not possible. My father is also more vulnerable and that means I have to minimise his interactions with my daughter. Not everyone has a helper at home either.
If you just can’t manage, schools are often the safest, most hygienic environments for your child to be in. They’re also not living in an environment of heightened anxiety. Sometimes I’m glad to send my daughter to school, just so that she isn’t feeding off my anxious energy about this global pandemic.
Where I am worried is that every company, or school, might interpret these measures differently. There are grey areas that cannot be adequately monitored, or are not yet being regulated.
A friend of mine has one child in primary school. A stall in the canteen is run by a man, whose wife travelled and has been given the SHN. But he was back in school, working at the stall. He’s since been served the SHN as well (after parents complained).
I also have a friend who travelled briefly with her husband, and is now serving SHN. But her husband is the team on shift (i.e. alternating team arrangements/staggered work), so he’s right back to work this week. So this is bizarre.
Technically, all adults who’ve travelled should stay at home no matter what, for 14 days. So in that regard, we’re back to this one essential point: people have to be responsible. People have to take initiative to say, “I need to stay home. I’m not coming in to work.”
I’m surprised the government is providing this “space” for people to exercise that discretion and to be responsible. It feels like a calculated risk. And that’s where I think we need to give critical feedback to our ministries, to our institutions. Do the checks on the ground. Don’t leave this entirely up to the individual’s discretion.
Terry: Personally, I think parents should be given a choice, instead of putting a blanket requirement where all schools remain open and all children must attend (especially primary and upwards). If parents are unable to arrange a caretaker, stay home with their kids, or make alternative arrangements, and school seems to be the only viable venue for their child to be at, then that’s a parental responsibility. Right now, however, it’s an MOE mandate.
One reason given by Minister Ong for wanting schools to reopen is science. Young children aren’t as susceptible to being infected by Covid-19 compared to adults. We’re still at an early stage of even understanding the nature and mutations behind this virus. It hasn’t even been three months since it surfaced. According to UNESCO, as of 20 March, Singapore and Brunei are the only two ASEAN countries where school remains open country-wide. This is even though this pandemic is far from over.
In case you’re wondering, Singapore is white (meaning, no school closure, localised or country-wide). Image credit: UNESCO
Terry (cont’d): While studies like this and this show that children are less likely than adults to be infected and have severe illness, they are still vulnerable. According to this Pediatrics study, the proportion of severe and critical cases is 7.3% for children aged 1 to 5, 4.2% for those 6 to 10 and 4.1% for those 11 to 15 and 3.0% for those 16 to 18. It’s not exactly 0% across the board.
What’s worse, they are less likely to look or fall sick even when infected. My concern as a parent is schools and day care centres can be breeding grounds for respiratory illnesses and other infections. Children like touching, and are curious by nature. They touch each other’s faces without a second’s thought. They don’t always wash their hands.
Who’s to say these milder illnesses (flu for example), especially in air-conditioned environments, would not be transmitted to day carers and teachers, and then get transmitted to other adults or older folk elsewhere?
Vinita: I don’t disagree with the data. You’re right that the world is still learning about the infection, and we don’t know if it’s mutating etc. But I think the challenges that come if we close schools are more acute than we realise. And as is the case across the board, the fundamental point is this: if you or your child is sick, of course exercise extra precautions and keep them home for longer than you ordinarily would.
Again, here’s the part that makes no sense to me: we’re all clinging onto this “14-day period” as if a person will wake up on the 15th day and be miraculously well, if indeed they had been incubating the virus. For every parent that says “let’s close for 2 weeks”, my response is: “what happens after that?”
You still want to send your kid to school after that, so how is that vastly different from parents like myself, who are fine with the schools staying open?
So an argument for school closures really becomes a question of time. How long are you prepared to have your kids at home? What if that closure is prolonged? What if 14 days isn’t enough? If it isn’t, then you’re asking families to prepare to be at home with their children for the long haul. Who will be impacted by this? From a gender perspective, will women/mothers be expected to be the ones to do home schooling, more than their male counterparts?
I think the critical question we need to ask of the Ministry (if we could) is this: okay great, you feel you’ve got this situation under control, or you’re taking a calibrated approach and you are reviewing things as the situation evolves. But it’s undeniable that we’re living a “new normal”.
If you’ve cancelled CCAs, then some kids who thrive in sports or those activities, will now be denied the ability to excel in those areas. Not everyone does well sitting in classrooms, engaged in book learning (or e-learning). And is this really the year to carry on with exams? With the PSLE and O- and A-levels? Those are the modifications we should seriously be making. This is not the year to measure aptitude in this way because life isn’t normal.
As some have pointed out, getting back up on our feet after the lockdown will be incredibly hard as well. And let’s not delude ourselves: we will get our class packs. We’ll find all those endless array of suggestions on YouTube and elsewhere to keep our kids entertained and engaged. We will get going on these grand endeavours. But at some point, sheer attrition and exhaustion will prompt us to turn to that insidious babysitter we all have at home: social media and screen time.
A Nielsen report predicts a 60% increase in media consumption in the U.S. during the pandemic. Let’s look at us: 84% of Singaporeans are online and the majority are social media users. What are the long-term consequences of increasing screen time? How will that affect our kids? I also rely on YouTube and shows for toddlers to keep my daughter engaged. I constantly feel unnerved by what that can do to her.
So my choice would be to reduce that, not increase it.
Terry: I personally feel that we’re taking a really big chance on reopening schools so soon on 23rd March, 2020. We just had consecutive double-digit confirmed cases daily since 17 March till 22nd March, so it’s still too soon to say we’re flattening our curve. We can swing either way as students mingle with one another, take public transport, school buses, and interact with strangers outside the safety of their homes, on their way to and back from schools.
There are many other reasons why schools may have needed to reopen. It could be that our e-learning system across all school levels isn’t ready yet (but work-from-home systems for offices are). Not all school systems have trial-ed or tested e-learning for BCP contingencies, so the outbreak may have caught many educators unprepared. We also had this cheating issue to contend with.
But as a parent, my main concern is my daughter’s well being and health.
During these trying times, I just want to keep my eye on her as often as I can. I want to hear her voice, her singing, her cheery laughter. If she’s ‘away’ at school, she’s out of my sight and beyond the parental safety net I’m providing for her. I need to then take a deep breath and entrust the school, educators and the Ministry to practice the same level of protection and care as a parent would. They need to be responsible for whatever happens.
Under the current circumstances, I hope they don’t just see themselves as educators, but as critical caretakers of children’s lives.
Vinita: So maybe this is when we can all rise to the occasion? Let the schools stay open for now. And let the teachers take care of our kids’ health as well as their intellectual and emotional well-being. I hear you—I’ve entrusted my child’s welfare in the hands of her teachers at the preschool. When I wave bye to her every morning and she’s walking away with her teacher with a smile on her face, it is an act of faith.
I trust that beyond the closed gates, the adults in that institution are adopting impeccable standards. They’re going to follow those protocols. They won’t let things slip.
I have to believe this to carry on with my day and I do. So the lessons we are all learning here will stay with us for a long time.

Bringing Life Into A Changed World: Giving Birth in Singapore During Covid-19,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-giving-birth-during-covid-19/,5-Apr-20,"Top image wdongxv/Unsplash
By the time you read this, Gabriela Ho will be a mother.
Gabby, my ex-colleague, is due to give birth to her first child six days after our phone interview (hello, socially distant journalism). Like any mother-to-be, she’s a little nervous about the delivery.
“It’s gonna be a natural birth, but my baby is a bit bigger than average, so it might take a while to push him out,” she says, sounding both matter-of-fact and slightly apprehensive.
Meanwhile, Elizabeth ‘Liz’ Morse, also an ex-colleague and first-time mum, has just managed to get her newborn daughter to take a nap before getting on the phone with me.
“Perfect timing,” she laughs.
“It’s been a huge learning curve for my husband and I,” she says of the last few weeks. “One moment we’re like, ‘this is hard work but it’s got beautiful moments and so far we’re okay’. In the next we feel like we’re in over our heads and have no idea how we’re gonna get through this. All these things wrapped up into one.”
Liz gave birth on March 5th, almost a month after MOH raised the DORSCON level to Orange. On March 11th, six days later, the WHO declared Covid-19 a pandemic. Since then, the outbreak has been pronounced the ‘greatest crisis’ facing the world since World War II.
In the time that Liz and Gabby have had their lives forever transformed, the world, too, has been navigating a new normal, waking up to all the ways in which things will never be the same.

When the coronavirus first landed in Singapore in late January, just before Chinese New Year, Liz and Gabby were in the final trimesters of their pregnancies. Like most people, they were a little wary but not worried.
“I was like okay, it’s good to be cautious, but I wasn’t overly anxious. It wasn’t like I was staying home because I was afraid of catching the virus,” says Liz.
Similarly, while Gabby had been hearing about trouble afield from her sister in Hong Kong, she didn’t feel like things had changed in Singapore.
The virus had yet to make an impact here, both practically and psychologically. To Liz and Gabby, Covid-19 was a distant abstraction against the here-and-now of pregnancy: feeling their babies kick, being in discomfort virtually all the time, learning how to live in bodies they no longer recognised. Preparing to bring a new human into the world left very little bandwidth for anything else.
Then February happened.
Things continued relatively unchanged for Gabby, who went on maternity leave early in the month. Liz and her husband Anthony, however, found themselves right in the eye of the gathering storm.
Anthony works as a freelance actor and host, doing mainly travel programmes (you might have caught him hosting Channel NewsAsia’s The New Silk Road). In early February, when China’s caseload was nearing its peak, he was due to film a new series in Tibet.
Everything had been good to go when he boarded his flight from Changi. While he was still up in the air, somewhere between Singapore and Beijing, the project was called off. He walked off the plane to the news that he was out of work.
To make things worse, when he caught a flight back to Singapore the next day, he got caught up in the restrictions being imposed on travellers coming from China. He would have to go into isolation for two weeks, just as Liz was entering her final weeks of pregnancy.
“I was like, what? You mean I’m not going to be able to see my husband!?” recalls Liz.
“So that all became very real. And we were in our 9th month by then, getting close to our due date. If he had been quarantined right up till then it would have been hard.”

So far, Singapore has remained relatively insulated from the chaos affecting thousands of mothers-to-be around the world. With cities in lockdown and hospitals overwhelmed, women from Barcelona to Boston are bracing themselves to lose access to their doctors, give birth at home, or go weeks without seeing their families—not to mention terrified of getting sick. (We still don’t know much about transmission in utero, but there’s a possibility that pregnant mothers can pass the virus to their unborn children.)
Still, the outbreak has taken its toll here in other, subtler ways. The day after I speak with Liz and Gabby, two doctor friends tell me that elective Caesareans, like many other non-urgent surgeries, are being cancelled or rescheduled to free up bed space and manpower. (I reached out to several hospitals for comment on this, but did not receive a response.)
In addition, hospitals have been tightening their visitor policies to protect patients. Gabby tells me that at her delivery, only her husband will be allowed in, and only one visitor will be able to see her at a time after the birth. For families welcoming children in the coming months, a normally jubilant occasion—think of maternity wards strewn with flowers, stuffed animals, and adoring visitors—will have to be something much quieter.
Even delivery plans have been disrupted. Gabby and Liz mention that around late February, as the situation picked up, hospitals began asking gynaecologists to pick a single hospital to work from, rather than operating out of several hospitals as they normally would. (I also reached out to hospitals to verify this, but did not receive a response.)
As such, many mothers-to-be have had to make a choice: follow their gynaecologist, or stay with their hospital.
Gabby hasn’t been affected; her gynaecologist will be staying at the hospital she has chosen to give birth at. Liz and Anthony, however, weren’t as lucky. They’d planned to have the delivery at Mount Alvernia, but their gynaecologist was no longer based at that hospital. The policy had kicked in just days before she was due.

Since Eleanor’s birth, Liz has been spending time at home, recovering from the delivery and slowly adjusting to motherhood. With social distancing having kicked in, both she and Gabby are secretly glad to have an excuse not to constantly entertain visitors.
“Honestly, when you’re a new parent, your house is a riot,” says Liz.
“Everything smells like spit-up. You don’t feel beautiful. You’re on baby timetable, and you don’t really know when to tell people to come visit … it sounds a bit brutal, but to be honest, we’re not that ready to have people come over.”
“Everyone’s been super understanding and responsible about keeping their distance, but in that sense, social distancing is kind of nice.”
Gabby, counting down the days, is also looking forward to the space. She doesn’t expect to have many visitors after the delivery, though they might still hold a small man yue (the traditional Chinese celebration of a baby’s first month of life) if the situation allows for it.
“All things considered,” she admits, “I’ve been in a pretty privileged position throughout my pregnancy, even with Covid.”
For now, her family remains financially sound, although her husband is currently the sole breadwinner, and is supporting his retired parents on his income as well. At this advanced stage of her pregnancy, her in-laws have been taking care of most of the chores and grocery shopping, leaving her free to focus on preparing for motherhood.
“I’m just trying to be more intentional about my interactions and not feed into the paranoia. I don’t actively seek out the news about, like, how many people have died in China,” she says, when I ask if she’s actively tried to avoid getting stressed out.
“I just try to surround myself with things that are more positive, and take it a day at a time.”

Liz, who has also never been big on social media, admits that this has probably helped keep her sane.
“I’m generally not glued to my phone watching updates,” she admits. “Although there have been a couple of times where my mum and Anthony were talking about the virus and I’m like, can we please have a break from talking about the virus?” (I tell her we would all like one, too.)
Covid-19 hasn’t entirely faded into the background, though. For her and Anthony, the much more pressing issue has been its impact on their finances.
Liz will be on maternity leave for several months, but more significantly, both she and Anthony are freelance actors. With shows being cancelled and work drying up—in particular, Anthony’s travel gigs, which provide the bulk of their income—neither of them have any jobs confirmed for the next few months.
“I have one paycheque coming in the next 45 days for a job I did some time ago, so that might meet us at a good point. But there aren’t any other outstanding cheques after that.”
Paying for Eleanor’s birth swallowed a chunk of their finances, although they had saved up to prepare for this. The rest of their savings will tide them over for a while, given that they’re mostly staying in with Eleanor, and Liz’s parents have chipped in to help for the time being. Still, diapers, formula, and paediatrician’s visits all add up.
“Is this something we talk about every day? No, because that would exacerbate the anxiety, and we don’t want to go down the slippery slope of feeding off each other’s anxieties,” she admits.
“But it’s definitely in the back of our minds. When is our next paycheque coming in? How are we gonna hustle during this time, now [that] it’s not just two adults we’re taking care of and we have a little one? All I can say is that this is where our faith comes in.”

And yet, in many ways, even the extraordinary times we are living in can’t compare to the perpetual strangeness of motherhood.
Both Liz and Gabby assert that they feel lucky to be here in Singapore, where the outbreak has been relatively contained and the healthcare system appears to be coping with the strain. For now, kids can still catch a break at the playgrounds. Their husbands can still go to the supermarket.
On the outside, life is clinging to what normalcy it can. Internally, normal has been a foreign concept for the last nine months.
“My doctor told me I had the option of medically inducing yesterday, because the baby’s getting hard to push out,” says Gabby. “I was a bit stunned. Like, what?! In three days’ time I have to hold a baby?!”
“Even at this late stage in pregnancy, I was still pushing back against the idea of having to care for another person. My brain hasn’t caught up. I wake up in the morning and go, oh, you’re not out yet? Okay. But with each day that passes, I feel like it’s getting more and more real.”
Even for Liz, just coming to terms with her role as a parent—a journey marked by more ambivalence than many feel comfortable admitting—has taken far more energy than dealing with the madness of the last two months.
“It’s so surreal, Soph,” she muses. “Sometimes I say out loud to her, You are my daughter, and I am your mother, and it’s just the wildest thing.”
“I mean, when you meet your future husband it’s not like it happens overnight. You date them and then the wedding happens and you’re married and it’s that gradual progression.”
“But you give birth and this tiny, beautiful, miraculous human being is in your lap all of a sudden. You’re a mother overnight. I’m a mother for life now.”
No mother, given a choice, would want to welcome her child into a world battling a pandemic. Half the planet is in lockdown; our economies are imploding. Every day seems to bring some new devastation. We seem to be teetering on the brink of something we can’t define, bracing ourselves for even deeper loss.
And yet, the upheaval of the last two months—cancelled Caesareans, massive job losses, endless disruption—is, fundamentally, no different from the uncertainty which defines parenthood itself.
No mother, after all, can prepare to give birth in a pandemic any more than she can direct how her child’s life will turn out. Parenthood is the ultimate masterclass in how much of life is beyond our control. Whatever our hopes, Mother Nature will do as she pleases with us all.
“It’s a bit unfortunate that Covid-19 has hit at this late stage of pregnancy, but I think the only thing I can do is take it a day at a time,” says Gabby.
“In terms of the relative uncertainty of Covid versus the real uncertainty of parenthood, the real uncertainty trumps it every time. How my child will turn out, if he’ll be healthy, whether he’ll have any hereditary or neurological disorder … all that far outweighs Covid.”

How I Am Surviving One Month of Not Paktor-ing With My Partner",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
Love is Essential: Stories from Couples Still Separated by Covid-19,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-love-essential-stories-couples-separated-covid-19/,30-Sep-20,"Top Image: Amien / Pexels
In an alternate, pandemic-free universe, Esther, 29, would have been married by now.
A Malaysian citizen with a Singaporean fiance, the last time she was in Singapore was back in early March. “I think I’m forever scarred,” she recalls. “Before leaving the house, I said, ‘Bye auntie! See you in two weeks!”
That was when they were supposed to solemnise their marriage.
“And that night, or a few nights later, my Prime Minister came out and said we’re going into lockdown. International borders are shut.”
Since then, Esther hasn’t seen her fiance in person. The relationship is now sustained through text messages, video calls, and flowers and chocolates delivered to her doorstep.

Many other couples have also been separated due to travel restrictions during Covid-19. While we might not think of it as a particularly terrible circumstance—you’re not even married, can’t you just wait it out like every other LDR couple?—their experiences help shed light on just how ambiguous and frustrating travel restrictions can be.
Esther has already gotten approval from Singapore’s ICA to enter Singapore and be with her fiance. But Malaysia still requires her to apply for permission to exit, on top of securing approval to enter her destination country.
“For cases like mine where I don’t hold any long-term visas or PR in another country, I need to apply via email with the Immigration Department,” she tells me.
“And it’s frustrating. I don’t know if my email application has been received or read. I understand they are flooded with applications, but a simple acknowledgement would be nice.”
As of September 2020, the Malaysian Immigrant Department has ruled that citizens are not allowed to leave the country for “holidays and social visits, including visiting family members abroad”. Only those who are heading abroad to start a new job, attend business meetings, or settle emergency matters are allowed to do so; even then, they still need approval from the department.
Through groups like Love is Not Tourism, Esther and others in her situation get hold of information like this, helping one another figure out how to navigate the ever-changing travel restrictions.
Snacks delivered by Esther’s fiance. Photo courtesy of Esther.
Love is Not Tourism is an international movement that advocates for governments to amend travel restrictions and allow lovers and partners to reunite, all while abiding by safety regulations like compulsory testing and 14-day quarantines. It’s gotten traction in Europe, where some countries took note and implemented ‘sweetheart visas’, which exempt unmarried couples from travel bans.
But the plight of unmarried couples has gone largely unnoticed in places like Singapore and Malaysia.
Much of Esther’s frustration stems from the fact that she was already looking to settle down in Singapore, instead of returning home: “I think the restriction exists because it seems like some countries are afraid [of you coming back and bringing the virus]. But I’m not coming back.”
Her resignation is palpable, from the way she emphasises her pessimism to the sombreness in her voice.
“Oh, we’re not having that,” she replies, when asked when she intends to hold the wedding ceremony.
“Thank god. I just want to sign the paper and get it over with.”
Daniel, 27, has been living the expat life for a while. He’s originally from New York, but has worked in Kenya for the past 3.5 years, which was also where he met his girlfriend, Nicola, who’s 26.
He moved to Singapore in early March, just when the Covid-19 situation was starting to worsen all around the world.
“The flights were already starting to look post-apocalyptic,” he recalls.
The thing is, Daniel could technically fly to Kenya to visit Nicola, or even meet up with her in another destination, like the UAE. Both admit that they would be willing to do the two-week quarantine and to pay for the hotel and tests out of their own pocket.
But even though the process seems simple, the consequences are not. Since he’s an EP holder, once he flies out of Singapore, he won’t be allowed back in.
“And your employer has to apply for [approval] for you. So my company won’t be doing that,” he says, resigned. “I cannot—I can’t re-enter.”
On groups like Love is Not Tourism, Daniel has been keeping up with updates on travel restrictions, looking for possible ways to meet up with Nicola. The group provides a safe space not just for couples in this situation to exchange information, but also to share their stories.
“The movement is called Love is Not Tourism because it tries to get people to understand that this travel is not for fun,” Nicola emphasises, “It should be appreciated as more or less essential travel. The understanding of the term ‘family’ can be broadened.”
“I think I echo a lot of couples who say that they’re willing to do whatever is possible, just so that they can be reunited.”
She then hastily adds, “But I feel like I need to clarify that as a non-Singaporean, I have no authority to tell the government what to do.”

For Singaporeans, the situation is more straightforward. Either you tough it out, or you take the risk by forking out thousands of dollars for that one rare flight, and then serve a mandatory quarantine notice if your destination country requires one.
But for non-Singaporeans, these restrictions have merely highlighted their status as outsiders, and the rise of xenophobic sentiments during the pandemic haven’t helped.
When asked about the issue of xenophobia in Singapore, Daniel notes, “I don’t pretend to know Singaporean society very well, but I definitely see there being … let’s say ST posts something about cases and migrant worker dorms on Facebook, I can definitely read the comments. People are definitely ‘Singaporean first’—which, I mean, it’s your country.”
For someone like Daniel, who’s only been here for six months and feels like he doesn’t have a stake in what policies we end up implementing, he’s caught in a position of helplessness where he can neither do nor say much about the situation.
“[People might say], why should we do something which potentially endangers the safety of Singaporeans for your sake?” he says. “And I respect that. You don’t want to make too much noise.”
Daniel adds, “I know that in general, Singaporeans are probably not very sympathetic to my case. Why would they, right?”
Klaudia, 29, has travelled back and forth between Singapore and Europe for the past five years and met her now-fiance (who is based in Singapore) during one of these trips.
When lockdown restrictions kicked in, she thought they would last only a month. But as the pandemic dragged on, she grew increasingly anxious, to the point where it affected her performance at work.
“One day you are full of energy, and you’re like, we will keep fighting. Another day, you are completely down and you can’t do anything. You just cry all day,” she describes.
Other than regular Zoom calls with her fiance, what has helped her get through this period of time is pouring her energy into the Love is Not Tourism movement. As a Slovakian based in the Czech Republic, she first got involved with the Europe chapter.
“I think it’s a little bit easier with Europe, because you can easily reach the ministers,” she notes. “I feel like, every week, I’m speaking with the government, like the Ministry of Interior and Ministry of Foreign Affairs.”
And then she found the Singapore chapter of the movement. But the local petition hasn’t gotten much traction at all, despite having been up for two months.
Calls to politicians like Minister Lawrence Wong and MP Raeesah Khan haven’t moved things forward, even though MP Jamus Lim has allegedly even requested to join the group, according to Klaudia.

“We are always getting the same answers,” she says. “Like, ‘we are working on it, ‘Singapore will open up soon’. But it’s not going to be like that.”
Technically, her fiance can fly into Europe, which is what they are trying to arrange right now. He just has to prove why he is visiting Czech Republic and take a Covid-19 test within five days of entering.
“He is asking for some kind of home office at work, so we’re trying to figure this out, because now I have a lot of work here.” Klaudia also intends to apply for entry into Singapore in November, when her workload eases. “But, actually, legally, I have nothing to apply for in Singapore.”
What underlies all of this anxiety is the sheer uncertainty of the situation. Klaudia understands the Covid-19 will be a long-term thing—reassuring people like her that borders will open up soon is as good as telling a kid that you will buy them that Snickers bar after they finish their vegetables. Anyone with a vague grasp of the situation knows that such promises are half-hearted at best.

No one is saying that we should be doing away with travel restrictions altogether. But what Klaudia, and others from the Love is Not Tourism movement, is asking for is to make the criteria for entering and leaving countries more transparent, instead of telling distressed partners to hope for the best, or some other lofty equivalent. They want governments to actually address these issues, instead of dismissing them with standard customer service responses.
If a businessman can travel from Singapore to Shanghai for a conference, then why can’t someone cross the Causeway to have their marriage solemnised?
“I guess the closest model to follow would be the European one,” Esther suggests, “where you need to show tangible proof of your relationship. That it’s … long-lasting, serious.”
The stress and frustration of not having your relationship legitimised, along with the terrifying prospect of simply not knowing when or if you can see your loved one again—this takes a toll on anyone, especially during a time that is already emotionally and mentally draining.
Reviewing travel restrictions for unmarried couples is, at its core, about adding that bit of humanity and compassion into a conventionally bureaucratic process, and showing that we can demonstrate kindness even in the face of uncertainty.

How Much Progress Has The Progressive Wage Model Led To? We Asked Security Guards What They Think",Yin Lin Tan,TRUE,TRUE
Can Friendship Be The Future of Migrant-Local Community?,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-friendship-future-of-migrant-workers-local-community/,4-Jun-20,"All images: Covid-19 Migrant Support Coalition (CMSC)
I was having yong tau foo with Zakir one Sunday in December 2018. We were talking about our families, our attitudes towards love, mental health in the migrant community, and the migrant poetry scene. He paused, mid-chew, sighing, “You know Yong, I really regret coming to Singapore.”
Surprised at the sudden turn in the conversation, I asked him why.
“Once I come here, people don’t see me as human. They only see me as a migrant worker.”
He shared a story of an encounter with a Singaporean girl who made him feel visible for the first time. She was the first Singaporean friend he made, he said, and he spoke of her with warmth and fondness.
The story touched me so much I remember it till today, but time has made the details fuzzy. I asked if Zakir could tell me the story again, this time in writing (translated with the help of Arjit Shaw), so you can read it in his own voice:
“When I first came to Singapore, I used to work at a club as a gardener. Most of the time, people would walk past me, treating me as though I were invisible. One day, I came across someone named Chu Ange. Every afternoon, she would wait in front of the club for her father to pick her up. If he was late, she would visit the garden to take a close look, and if I’m around, she would question me about how long the plants take to come out of the seeds and so on.
In one such meeting, Chu Ange told me her boyfriend has to serve national service for two years. In another session, she said both her boyfriend and her are of the same age—eighteen years old. I answered, there is a poem in Bengali, that has the title—The Age of Eighteen (Athero Bochor Boyos). The poet is Sukanta Bhattacharya, one of my most favourite poets. She told me she wanted to read an English translation of the poem.
In subsequent meetings, she came to know that I am a poet too. Again, she insisted on reading the translation of the poem, “the age of eighteen.” So I asked a friend of mine back in Bangladesh, for a reading and the poem came via postal mail two weeks later.
The next day, I handed over the envelope to Chu Ange. She read it, and exclaimed—what a beautiful poem! A week later, she accompanied her boyfriend and introduced me to him—Zakir is a poet and a farmer! They both praised the poem and invited me to her home on her birthday, insisting that I have to read the poem on that day, along with some poetry of mine. Initially, I was shy about this invitation, but after their insistence, I eventually agreed.
I took leave from work on a Saturday. In the afternoon, her father took me to their home—an HDB block in Bishan. It was my first time being invited to Singaporean house. I was uncomfortable. The whole family warmly welcomed me, and that heightened my discomfort. Chu Ange cut her birthday cake, we sang a birthday song, and it was my turn to recite the poem. She introduced me and the poem, and I recited The Age of Eighteen. After I was done, everyone praised the poem. Chu Ange’s boyfriend said, the poem has touched the heart of Chu Ange, and has moved her a lot. She just nodded, and kept on saying “It is beautiful.””
I found the story of Zakir’s unexpected friendship with Chu Ange beautiful yet thought-provoking. However, I also asked myself why I found these friendships seemingly unique. I wondered, what does Zakir’s story suggest about the current social fabric in Singapore, and what are some structural issues at work that lead to such segregated social spheres?
Why could such diverse friendships be important, and what kinds of spaces might help build the kinds of organic interaction necessary to facilitate genuine local-migrant interactions?
Participants at Majulah Belanja 2015, an event organized by Geylang Adventures, where locals and migrant workers participated in a cook-off together at a dormitory.
Today, migrant workers largely work and live in geographically isolated areas, interacting mostly with other migrants. Migrants and locals hardly exist in overlapping social spheres, and even when migrants share public spaces with locals (say, in public parks), their presence tends to be regarded with annoyance.
More tellingly, after the government announced plans to build new quick-build dormitories near residential areas, many Facebook users left xenophobic, racist, and Not-In-My-Backyard (NIMBY) comments. Some saw migrant workers as a source of danger or vice, calling for more security measures to be taken to “protect” the neighbourhood. Others fretted about whether these dormitories would affect property prices, or else saw migrant workers as potential disease carriers, and even blamed Covid-19 on their “poor cultural practices”.
These comments suggest that a large segment of the population continue to hold harmful stereotypes of the migrant community; stereotypes that are rooted in bigotry and ignorance. There are many potential reasons for this, and it would take an entire article just to unpack the varying threads of xenophobia made apparent by these comments. Nonetheless, one obvious reason—apart from residential and employment segregation—is that there are few spaces for migrants and locals to interact directly with each other. Consequently, migrant workers are seen as alien bodies, an ‘Other’ to be feared and despised.
Some NGOs, community initiatives, and social enterprises have tried to address this by curating events designed to promote migrant-local interaction. They hope that through such genuine interactions, more Singaporeans can see migrant workers as real people, not as abstract Others. For example, some local groups have tried to organise dinners where Singaporeans can meet migrants to hear more about their lives. Yet, such initiatives, however well-meaning, can sometimes amount to nothing more than “human petting zoos”, a criticism Debbie Fordyce, President of TWC2, raised in an interview with academia.sg.
The realities, however, are that we live in a highly unequal world, with segregated lives. What then, are some thoughtful ways to build community amongst migrants and locals without perpetuating existing power hierarchies or stereotypes? After all, it’s not that dinners between migrants and locals are a bad idea per se (in fact, I think they could be a wonderful idea), but that we should be thoughtful about the ways they are designed and framed.
One possibility would be for locals to participate in spaces where we can interact with migrant workers as equals, on their own terms. Migrant Writers of Singapore has been organising Human Libraries, most recently at the Migrant Literature Festival held in December last year at the National Library.
A human library in action at the inaugural Migrant Literature Festival, organized by Migrant Writers of Singapore.
The Singaporeans who attended asked the migrant writers present plenty of questions: What were their daily lives like? How long have they been in Singapore? How come they loved writing poetry? Beyond talking about their lives as migrant workers, participants shared stories about their dreams, passions, and hobbies. Jean Ragual, a migrant from the Philippines, had shared about her passion for photography, while Belal Hassan, a migrant from Bangladesh, had talked about his love for poetry.
The Human Library is perhaps not too different from the dinners that some social enterprises have been organising, except the migrant writers do not charge a fee, and have complete autonomy in deciding how they want to be seen, and what they want to talk about. The emphasis is on giving migrant voices dignity and agency, not in exoticising them as pitiable subjects.
Migrant Writers of Singapore also organises Open Borders: Stories Have No Boundaries, a series of events where migrants and locals share personal stories, as well as Carnival of Poetry, a monthly poetry reading session that features both migrant and local poets. Said Bhing, a migrant poet, volunteer with HOME, and domestic helper from the Philippines, “I’ve been to these poetry events for five years, but I always see the same faces. I feel good when I see locals joining. I like it when they listen, and when they ask questions.”
WePals, an initiative under CMSC.
Not all migrants write poetry, however, and even amongst Singaporeans, poetry activities tend to draw a self-selecting crowd. The interactions they create are also once-off, and not conducive for deep understanding. Other platforms have since emerged to help facilitate more sustained interactions between migrants and locals.
WePals, an initiative under CMSC, is a recent befriending and penpal initiative that hopes to build bridges between the migrant and non-migrant community. Ronald Wong, a lawyer who has been volunteering with migrant NGOs for more than ten years, started it when many of his migrant friends stuck in dormitories reported experiencing much anxiety and boredom.
“What they do appreciate is somebody listening,” said Ronald. The initiative has amassed a total of 440 sign-ups so far, comprising both migrants and locals. All Singaporean befrienders are trained in adapted psychological first aid by volunteer trainers from the PSS community. Befrienders are guided to detect escalating signs of distress that might mean they have to refer their migrant friends for professional tele-counselling or further case work management.
WePals emphasises long-term commitment, and values active listening. It hopes that genuine friendships can blossom through it, even if the platform itself creates a level of artifice.
Said Ronald, “It is essentially a platform that helps people make friends and to connect them to a supportive community. The challenge today is that most of us live in our insulated social bubbles—our realities are usually far removed from people of very different demographics. It doesn’t matter whether it’s migrant workers, or the elderly, or someone who lives in a rental flat or Sentosa Cove.We have to ask ourselves, given these boundaries, what helps to transcend them? And work from there.”
Ronald also hopes that WePals can help build the “empathy bridge”. From an advocacy standpoint, he says that “it is precisely from that friendship that we begin to understand, to feel enough to want to speak up about the problems they are facing.”
A common criticism of befriending programs is that it makes befrienders wash their hands off more systemic issues, thinking that empathy or “kind thoughts” alone are sufficient.
“They are not mutually exclusive,” Ronald adds, “We have to look at it from a bigger picture: If we want structural change, we need members of the general public to think and feel about certain things. One of the best ways to do that is precisely to help members of the Singapore public have friendships with migrant workers in the hope that we are building empathy, and not just sympathy, or abstract theorizing. Through that, people will start to realize the real situation of their migrant friends, and make the necessary calls for change.”
Ronald shared an anecdote about one befriender who learned that his migrant friend had not been paid a salary. The befriender escalated it to CMSC, who then reached out to provide assistance.
“I don’t know how much he (the befriender) was involved in migrant worker related issues before this, but it gives him a glimpse into common issues that many migrant workers face,” Ronald said.
Personal reflections are the best way to change mindsets.
Friendship, of course, is not a panacea. We might ask if conflating “friendship” and “advocacy” undermines the sincerity of the connection itself, or if we risk mapping our own ideas of what friendship means onto such relationships. The inherent tensions embedded within the concept of friendship between two presently socially distant groups suggests that friendship is not without its limits. Friendship in a highly unequal setting can ring hollow, merely a curious interest masquerading as a desire for intimacy.
The best friendships are often accidental, unmediated through formal initiatives or events. This was how Mamun, Bangaleshi and founder of Singapore Migrant Friends, and Cai Yinzhou, Singaporean and Director of Citizen Adventures, first met. Said Mamun, “Around seven years ago, I moved to Geylang, behind Yinzhou’s house. We were playing badminton in the back alley. Sometimes, he would come and talk to us. Normally we don’t have any opportunity to talk to Singaporeans nor have the chance to have deep conversations.”
Mamun shared that Yinzhou had approached one of his roommates, Bashar, during one of those badminton sessions, asking if he could join them. They exchanged contact numbers, and sometimes had coffee together after work. Slowly, they built their friendship and developed mutual trust.

Yinzhou explained that his friendship with Mamun and some other migrant workers blossomed organically, largely out of proximity, not by design.
“It wasn’t a big deal for me. I was just hanging out with my friends, but it seemed like a surprise for most people. There were comments from my family and friends—it was a spectrum of reactions, from curiosity to ignorance. ‘Why are you hanging out with ‘dangerous’ people?’ They had a perception that this was a ‘special event’ when it should be no big deal.”
Mamun says many Singaporeans however continue to think that migrant workers are dangerous, not daring to approach them out of fear or shyness. He added that Singapore Migrant Friends, an informal collective consisting of 30 – 40 migrants from four countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Philippines, and Myanmar) that gathers every Sunday to play volleyball, has partnered with some local organisations to help bridge that gap.
He stressed that there is a mutual desire to learn about each other’s lifestyles and cultures—“The important thing is we need more conversations between migrants and locals, more integration.” Sports, he says, is a particularly good way to build community because it is both free, and translates well across languages.

Yinzhou, however, pointed out how good intentions can still be misguided when organisations approach such interactions with a transactional mindset—companies looking to do CSR, student groups wanting to fulfil assignments or extra curricular activity requirement—or else centering interactions around their own project requirements, not the migrant workers’ interests.
He said, “We have seen student groups who approach SMF looking to ‘promote migrant-local interaction’, but come with a whole slew of requests: they ask migrant workers to share about their culture, teach them their local languages. For three hours students will come, interact and distribute goodies, take lots of photos, say ‘Welcome to our event! This is super awesome!’ Then they leave, and we never see them again.”
Mamun added, “I know some organisations go down to dormitories to give food. They only come one time, just say hi, hello, distribute something, and leave. This kind of short-term visiting is not really changing anything—they cannot hear our struggles, hopes, and dreams. We need to have long-term relationships, like my friendship with Yinzhou and others.”

These critiques highlight the importance of long-term community building programmes and partnerships, and the need to move beyond one-off, ad-hoc, feel-good interactions that are seemingly for show. Migrant workers have limited time off, and every moment is precious. Pandering to requests from strangers with no interest in long-term participation or reciprocal friendship is, unfortunately, an indulgence on a regular day. Migrant workers are not here to satisfy our curiosities, or meet our project requirements and KPIs.
Mamun also shared about some constraints in accessing spaces that could facilitate migrant-local interaction: migrant workers often cannot afford to participate in common entertainment activities like watching movies with locals, due to cost issues. They also cannot easily access common spaces like public community centers or sports halls because users need an NRIC or SingPass to reserve these sorts of venues.
Yinzhou says that the segregation of social spaces is where public policy and public perceptions intersect to perpetuate social divides. He expressed a desire to see community spaces designed for real migrant and Singaporean integration, celebrating ground-up initiatives such as Project Chulia Street.
Ultimately, if we care about building inclusive societies, we need community spaces that can help facilitate the kinds of friendship that mean we see each other as peers, not as inferiors and superiors.

In the end, true friendship means that we become part of each other’s lives—we celebrate one another’s birthdays, mourn collective losses, comfort one another in the aftermath of bad break-ups. We share stories, and exchange photographs of our days; we laugh, we cry, and sometimes we work for a common cause—but at heart we care about each other as friends. My own hopes are that in future, migrant-local friendships will become so commonplace we will not even see articles about them.
The recent NIMBY attitudes that have resurfaced in full force make me question if the migrant-local community I dream of—of genuine friendship with one another—is too idealistic. Some of these views seem so entrenched that changing hearts and minds seem like an impossible task, or at least one that would require great passion and patience.
But to give up simply because it is frustrating to engage would be akin to legitimising the status quo. For those of us who care, we have to remember that racism and xenophobia are not simply intellectual issues that our migrant friends can simply decide to wash their hands off. These are real, lived experiences, and the public comments by strangers are no less hurtful just because they are mediated by the virtual sphere.
After dinner with Zakir one night at Hans Cafe (a favourite haunt of his) in the National Library, we sat in silence as we contemplated the many challenges that continued to affect migrant workers in Singapore: high agency fees, low wages, inhumane employers and continued discrimination by locals. “Will anything change?” I had asked, trying my best not to wring my hands in despair. Zakir took a sip of his teh, and laughed. “Slowly lah, Yong, slowly. We have to be patient.”

We've All Seen The Black Squares. Where Does Singapore Go After #BlackOutTuesday?",Poh Yong Han,TRUE,TRUE
Shining a Spotlight on Portraits of Purpose: The Covid-19 Diaries,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-shining-spotlight-portraits-purpose-covid-19-diaries-dbs/,24-Aug-20,"All images from RICE File Photos unless otherwise stated.
It’s been more than two months since circuit breaker ended and Phase 2 has been in full swing. RICE takes to the streets to get a sense of the sentiment and capture what is driving the man on the street to look to a better future.
In our efforts, we’ve met a diverse group of individuals, in age, background and personality. Each one has a perspective of how Covid-19 has impacted them, and why they’re staying the course. While each of their purpose and drive is different, collectively, it’s apparent we’re overcoming and surviving this together.
Pann Lim (47) is the creative director of Kinetic Singapore. While his family is extremely close-knit, he admits working late in the office prior to Covid-19, which meant less time with his loved ones. But things changed when the pandemic hit, and he found hope in more quality time with his kids.
“I began to see more of my family. In fact, I think, during the two months of working from home, I’ve spent more time with my wife and kids than all of our time in the previous year combined. I treasured the lunches I had with them every day. If I did not have any Zoom meetings, I saw my children coming home from school and we had a father-child chit-chat before I went back to work. So there it was—that silver lining.”
Boo Han Wei (20) is an Experience and Communications Design student at Singapore Polytechnic. Much as he hates being in school, he would rather be in an environment where he could “look left and right and see people doing work.”, yet recognised how the circuit breaker changed things for the better.
“Two things happened to me when Covid-19 started. First, my relationship with my mom and dad improved. My dad dislikes my tattoos and stuff. So, over the past few months, because of Covid-19 and circuit breaker, we’ve had proper conversations. He understood me a little bit more and it’s getting better.
“The second thing is my band. My mates and I were recording a bunch of songs and we were supposed to play our first show in Germany. Because of Covid-19, we couldn’t play and we were stuck. So yeah, I felt terrible.” Despite the initial disappointment with his plans, where his passion was disrupted, Han Wei found a way to make the best use of the downtime. “Our guitarist and I redoubled our efforts to write new tunes and we talked about technical things like handling our merchandise, money and stuff. We started to focus on managing our band instead of just making music.”
Rachel Loh (26) is a photographer by profession and runs a community space ‘thestarvingartists’. At first, she was excited by the prospect of working alone and having more free time at home. Then it began to spiral out of control.
“There’s a lot of anxiety because people started asking me, aren’t you worried about your future? Are you going to continue being an artist? How are you going to eat? What I then did was to produce art that is not necessarily photography-based.”
Rachel saw how being forced out of her comfort zone was an unexpected gift. “Without the isolation, I would never have thought about doing things outside of photography.
Her advice to others struggling? “I think it takes time. You need to know how to discern what is toxic when in isolation and try new things that make you feel different even if it’s just like 10%. That’s very important.”
Juhardi Muhamed (32) works as the Education Programs Manager at DECK gallery. He tells us that prior to Covid-19, his team was looking forward to renovating the gallery. Covid-19 struck and the construction company didn’t have workers so everything had to be put on hold.
“Classes and workshops were also affected because you can’t have more than five. Usually, our classes run with more than 5 people, sometimes up to 20 people.”
But Juhardi quickly pivoted for the sake of the business and his colleagues. “The team at DECK is small, so converting everything online may seem challenging at first. Everyone has to adapt and move into the digital space in a very short amount of time. Good thing though, is that now we have gained a bit of experience, we’re improving day after day.”
His words of encouragement to those with a passion, “Keep learning and upgrading. Having a strong support from the community will keep the arts moving as this scene is considered niche. Keep the passion strong. Without it, you will tire easily.”
Mohamed (61) has run the Makbru Mart for 25 years. When RICE asked him how Covid-19 has impacted him, he asked “Where do I even start?”
“This is no longer your normal, everyday business! Covid-19 has affected everyone, a lot of businesses, including mine. Most of my usual customers are working from home. There was also that period when schools weren’t allowed to open. My shop was closed for four to five months.
“Around my area, I think the rental issue will affect more of the hotels, because they mainly rely on tourists. During the circuit breaker, I feared I had to close too. Thankfully, I didn’t have to. The money changer near my shop? It has remained closed for six months now, because no tourists. Thankfully, the government was supportive of us with the jobs support scheme. We could maintain, maybe for six months.
Despite the challenges, Mohamed is thinking of Plan B and looking for a better future, “maybe we’ll find a different location to set up or something, start again.”
Ai Li (55) runs her stall outside Fu Lu Shou Complex since 1997. She laments that since Covid-19, she’s only been earning S$10-plus dollars every day. She hopes the government can do more to help tenants with regards to rental.
“Whatever we sell, most of what we earn is good enough to cover maybe part of the rental, not manpower and other costs. So a lot of people like us have no choice but to close shop. Even as I speak with you, I am considering closing.
“If we cannot earn, we have to move, get employed somewhere and earn a salary. I’ve never thought about retiring yet, so my work continues. Once you stop work and stay at home all day, you will get depressed and become a burden to your kids. I don’t want to burden my kids, so I must work hard on my own.”
While Ai Li is determined to persevere, she’s also driven by the gratitude she feels amid this global pandemic, “Everyone should just learn to let go. Take things one day at a time. There are people out there who have to worry about their next meal. We should save when we can. Savings are so important, especially for young people.”
Sulthanul Arriff (62) works as Basheer Books’ manager at Bras Basah Complex. He’s been a permanent resident for over 15 years now.
“We had to close Basheer Books for 72 days. Income was affected, yes. Our online sales are simple, but they were better than nothing. These days, I’m at home with my family. We do our housework together — cooking and cleaning our home. It’s a good thing really. We are eating together more. I enjoy the time spent with my wife. As she cooks, I help cut and clean the ingredients. We’re doing more together as a family. Even our children, who are all grown up and already married, would come help us sometimes.
Sulthanul also believes that if he’s able to adapt and upskill, then nobody else has an excuse. “As Basheer’s manager, I am putting more attention into online sales, using social media channels like Instagram. Before Covid-19, there was hardly any time, as I had to do the housekeeping and paperwork. But now, it’s critical. I am already old, but if I can find the time to learn, I think everyone else also can.”
In the spirit of recognising purpose in our lives, DBS is inviting everyone to share their stories of passion, and even the everyday kindness and courage they see around them in Portraits of Purpose. Every individual, no matter how old, how inexperienced, how different from you, has faced some challenges in one way or another due to Covid-19. And we’re all finding a way to pull through.
Two ways to share:
1) Submit your photo and it could be featured on DBS’ iBanking pre-login page with credits, which receives more than 5 million views a month. The top five entries will receive SGD 1000 each to further their passion. T&Cs available on the submissions page.

"In This Zombie Apocalypse, Your Homework is Due At 5 PM",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-zombie-apocalypse-homework-due-5-pm-covid-19-hbl/,10-Apr-20,"All images: Zachary Tang, Marisse Caine / RICE File Photos
This week marks the beginning of the shutdown of schools and childcare centres in Singapore. All over the island, in households with children, adults are no doubt struggling to maintain some semblance of normalcy in abnormal times.
Fixed timetables; the sounds of buses arriving and leaving; the rituals and totems of canvas shoes and ironed uniforms, flags and pledges, recess queues and school bells; the teacherly voices of authority figures straining above the din of students; the presence of other little bodies doing exactly the same things at exactly the same time, peppered with regular micro attempts at flouting rules—these and more are the pillars of school-going children’s lives. Year in and year out, when school’s in, children know that they are to be at certain places at certain times, doing particular tasks in particular ways. And now, weeks loom ahead where they are faced with many of the same tasks, absent of all the pomp and circumstance. This is the ultimate zombie apocalypse nightmare—a pandemic has hit the world with a mighty force, schools and tuition centres are shut, and homework is still due. Children are adaptable creatures, but it will be challenging for many, if not most, to do all that they are expected to do under these altered conditions.
Children’s and adults’ lives and wellbeing are intertwined. With social structures receding and the private sphere literally holding everyone in, the inequalities that we know exist will become more palpable and consequential than ever. This is the feminist sociologist’s nightmare—the work of social reproduction now resting entirely in the household and weighing on certain members within them. The many hands holding the fort together—teachers, bus drivers, canteen operators, tutors, grandparent caregivers, day or afterschool care staff—now stand parted, fingers pried open, a delicate and precious circuit broken.
The unfolding story of Covid-19 is a story of inequalities, long experienced by those who bear its brunt, coming to the surface of our collective consciousness. In the weeks to come, who will care for children? What inequalities will be especially consequential when ‘work from home’ and ‘home-based learning’ kick in? Without institutions and services providing supporting roles and to some extent mitigating gender and class inequalities, parents and children will find their gendered roles and class positions mattering more than ever in shaping their wellbeing, both now and, for some, also in the longer term.
Over the past year, and up until I had to suspend fieldwork due to the Covid-19 crisis, I have been interviewing people about their experiences with balancing wage work and raising children. I have spoken with both women and men, with people across the class spectrum and from various ethnic groups and across some range in age, with both married and single parents. I aim to do at least 100 interviews and have conducted about 70.[1]
Some patterns are already obvious and relevant here. First, among married couples, women bear heavier responsibilities for housework and caregiving than do men. Even if individual exceptions exist, the pattern is strong—across class and ethnic lines, as well as among both younger and older respondents.
Second, the labour of ‘care’ for parents in Singapore today is deeply tied up with meeting children’s schooling and educational needs. While the specific contours of those needs vary across class lines—insofar as people articulate expectations and aspirations differently—what is widely shared is a deep sense of responsibility, and intense feelings of anxiety and stress. That this is a key component of parenting today translates into deep inequalities in what children receive by way of cultivation outside of school.
Third, many people are in employment situations that are unaccommodating to household and caregiving responsibilities. Workers are expected to prioritise work over home, to sacrifice familial wellbeing for the good of the company, and there is limited collective bargaining power. People therefore regularly stretch or bend themselves to be both workers and parents—mothers making more adjustments and doing more on the two fronts than fathers, and people with lower income having far fewer options for flexible work and the “outsourcing”[2] of care labour than those with more.
That these patterns exist, in clear form and with well-defined contours, suggests that we can speak of the practices of individuals not merely as individual actions and choices, but as social phenomena. Work-life conflict (not ‘balance’) is a social phenomenon in contemporary Singapore. Gendered and classed variations within this work-life conflict are also social phenomena. The things people do in a society, regularly, day after day, form the society’s shared habits and norms, its culture. Work-life conflict, whether we like to admit it or not, is Singaporean culture.
This week, we embark on a great involuntary experiment—work and life will now be in conflict not only in a temporal way, but also within constrained physical spaces. The challenges will moreover be amplified because important socially-organised, extra-familial parts of the care circuit have been broken. What are we likely to see?
Housework and caregiving have long been gendered, designated as the role and responsibility of women. Now women who have always been in charge of cooking will have to cook more; women who have always been in charge of cleaning will need to clean more; women who have always overseen children’s education will need to supervise more. To say that this work is gendered is not only to say that it is mothers and wives who are presumed to be responsible, but also to point out that in the Singapore context, where a significant number of households employ live-in domestic workers, this labour has been deeply marked as women’s work and indeed work that, if one can afford it, is better displaced to lower-status women.[3] One hopes a circuit breaker can break habits too, and it probably will in some households, but gender egalitarianism cannot be built overnight. Housework and caregiving require knowledge, expertise, and experience; children will gravitate toward the person who knows how they like their milk, the parent they know is in contact with their classmates’ mothers.
Many of our employers, and indeed our government, seems to expect continued productivity from individuals who are also cooking, cleaning, and ensuring the kids are off their devices and on their homework. Ironically, prior to the crisis, many of my respondents expressed the desire to work from home. They felt that this would save them time spent commuting or in pointless meetings, and accord them the flexibility to pick up or drop children off at childcare, school, or other activities. They thought working from home would allow them to be more efficient while also being more present with their children.
For most people, notably people without full-time domestic workers and/or people with children who are younger or have disabilities, the next weeks will almost certainly not be this work-from-home dream. As every parent who has tried to work while children are present already knows, children are great interrupters. They are not interested in the emails we receive all day long from colleagues and bosses asking us for things, nor the deadlines and task lists we worry about getting through. Some of us are lucky enough to be in jobs that can be done at home;[4] the luckiest amongst us even have rooms of our own. Still, even the luckiest will find out that children do not knock before entering, and they will not be as committed as we are to the invisible boundaries we try to build around a corner of a bedroom or around a dining table. The work culture respondents described to me is one where workers are expected to put work ahead of everything else, to not let down colleagues and bosses, to prioritize ‘the economy’—that thing held up like life itself.[5] Now, in times where people will be more worried about losing jobs, where multiple people have to share the same flat 24-7, these pressures will be felt more intensely. In the weeks to come, homes will have to house work-life conflict,[6] with very little respite.
How will children fare in all this? Prior to the crisis, class already mattered greatly. The income, wealth, and educational background of parents strongly shape the resources they can put into tuition and enrichment classes, the time and capacity they can spare to help with homework and coach toward exams, and therefore ultimately how a child fares in exams. But still we had schools—where there were spaces for sitting, individual desks to write on, time-chunks to mark activities, rooms shared by others doing the same thing at the same time, teachers to ask when one did not understand something. A few weeks ago, when tuition centres were told to shut down, I had a fleeting moment of fantastical naiveté—this will level the playing field! Of course, within days, tutors moved online, the branded tuition centres one step ahead of the rest of us in discovering Zoom. The Ministry of Education has displayed a high level of consciousness about inequalities the shutting of schools will create. Various individuals and community groups have stepped up to try to provide necessary hardware to support the transition. But in spite of this, we are likely to see the gaps that have always existed now pushed further open—laptops and wifi are one barrier, but beyond this, students will not have equal access to quiet rooms and desks, adult supervision and help, and alternative means of seeking peer group support. Tuition centres may be shut, but I suspect those tutoring sessions now conducted online will be more important than ever in coaching kids toward the exams that remain on the horizon.
Numerous commentators have pointed to the current crisis as illuminating the pitfalls of our existing systems.[7] The deep inequalities that exist within societies and across the globe have been made even more obvious than before—the picture is bleak and the depth and length of the fallout of this major global humanitarian challenge as yet unknown.
The patterns I have described will not be easy to overcome during the crisis, but we must begin now. We have to start assigning value to housework and care—what feminist scholars have long referred to as social reproduction—recognising it as crucial labour for society. It is, moreover and rather uniquely, labour that when lopsided is deeply burdensome, but when shared enhances everyone’s lives. We have to stop insisting that productivity is our national value and economic growth our highest priority, particularly at a time when existential questions[8] have come to the surface as never before (at least for most people alive today). And in the realm of education—there is no better time than now to begin realigning what we want kids to learn when we teach, what we want to achieve for an entire country’s children when they school, and what we really should shed because it damages our collective wellbeing.
After the zombie invasion, if we are lucky enough to go back into our city—a city I already miss—our job must not be to put things back where they are, but to take things where they could be.
Notes
[1] I have also done earlier empirical work on this issue, focusing on low-income households. See Teo You Yenn, This is What Inequality Looks Like (Ethos Books, 2018).
[2] “Outsourcing” was a word my respondents used to describe part-time cleaners and tuition teachers, signaling the ways in which the space of family and household are viewed through the lenses and vocabularies of the workplace. See Arlie Hochschild’s book on this topic: Arlie Russell Hochschild, The Outsourced Self: Intimate Life in Market Times (Metropolitan Books, 2012).
[3] Elsewhere, I have elaborated on this: Teo Youyenn, “Support for Deserving Families: Inventing the Anti-welfare Familialist State in Singapore”, Social Politics: International Studies in Gender, State & Society, 20(3):387-406 (2013); Teo Youyenn, “Not everyone has ‘maids’: class differentials in the elusive quest for work-life balance”, Gender, Place & Culture, 23(8):1164-1178 (2016); Teo Youyenn and Nicola Piper, “Foreigners in our homes: linking migration and family policies in Singapore”, Population, Space and Place, 15(2):147-159 (2009).
[4] There is a divide here between white- and blue-collar work, between higher and lower-wage work, that others have pointed out. See, for example, Charles M. Blow, ‘Social Distancing is a Privilege’ in the New York Times, 5 April 2020.
[5] I wrote about the valorisation of ‘the economy’ in earlier work. See Teo Youyenn, Neoliberal Morality in Singapore: How family policies make state and society (Routledge, 2011).
[6] In the worst cases, as has already been reported elsewhere, this conflict will escalate existing violence and abuse. See, for example, Amanda Taub, ‘A New COVID-19 Crisis: Domestic Abuse Rises Worldwide’ in the New York Times, 6 April 2020.
[7] See, for example, Arundhati Roy, ‘The Pandemic is a Portal’ in Financial Times, April 4, 2020.
[8] Environmental activists in particular have highlighted the current crisis as part of a larger pattern of climate crises we are witnessing, and what is at stake if we try to go back to business as usual. See for example SG Climate Rally’s recent commentary.

We’ve Accepted #StayHome and Remote Working, But Let’s Not Take It for Granted",Teo You Yenn,TRUE,TRUE
DORSCON Orange is the New Panic: COVID-19 Makes Singaporeans Show Their True Colours,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-covid-19-orange-new-panic-singaporeans-show-true-colours/,18-Feb-20,"Image credit: Pexels.com
On the evening of 7 February 2020 (Friday), I remember telling my wife—when the videos and photos started circulating—“Don’t buy into the hysteria. You join the supermarket crowds in the narrow aisles, the probability of you getting infected (by the COVID-19 virus) increases.”
Image credit: Ministry of Health and Gov.sg
That day, Singapore’s Ministry of Health had confirmed three additional cases of the novel coronavirus, but was unable to establish any links to previous cases or travel history to China. The Disease Outbreak Response System Condition (DORSCON) was heightened to Level Orange. I immediately alerted my wife, who was boarding a plane flying back to Singapore that afternoon.
The reactions among some Singaporeans to these two pieces of news were unprecedented. What happened next reminded me of US Black Friday Sales with people lugging big-screen TVs and PlayStations.
A few hours after the alert, I received WhatsApp messages filled with images and videos of uncles, aunties, and husbands-whose-wives-made-them-rush-out-with-no-questions-asked, thronging supermarket aisles, carting heaps of instant noodles, bags of rice, condoms, and toilet paper. The psychology behind why a majority chose these items is best left to the experts in primate anthropology, but by the time images of emptied shelves flashed on my phone, I knew something didn’t feel right.
While there were shoppers who wore masks, there were also many who didn’t. Either they didn’t have any or couldn’t be bothered. It struck me then that this wasn’t panic caused by concern about the rising number of cases without links to previous cases (or China). It was kiasuism caused by the notion that everyone was buying stuff up, so I better buy too.
Panic, when mixed with kiasuism, has surfaced a few times over the past year. Alibaba’s Singles’ Day campaign last November was one such example. I can’t for the life of me remember any other part of the year when I was spending on stuff I didn’t need—all in one day. If we return and ask the aunties and uncles about their excessive purchases on 7 February, they might say they don’t have regrets, but you and I both know, they’re going to be eating MSG-laden instant noodles for the rest of their lives.

Beyond the videos and photos, there were also messages that fueled the anxiety (if it didn’t already exist). I wondered if someone compiled these materials and sent them to a few ‘super spreaders’ to drive everyone’s kiasuism up a notch. Perhaps to test water? Or clear old Chinese New Year stock?
On my phone, I received screenshots of Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong’s Facebook message, advising Singaporeans to stay strong, followed by notes telling me to boost my immune system, NOT by taking antibiotics, but by ingesting Vitamin C, Zinc, Vitamin D3, Probiotics, Manuka Honey, and Essential Oils. More photos surfaced, showing empty supermarket shelves and long queues of aunties and uncles with trolleys filled with sundries. While I viewed them with amusement, my wife, who had just gotten home from the airport, didn’t.
This was because we do our weekly grocery runs every Saturday morning, when we buy our week’s worth of supplies from our nearby Sheng Shiong, wet market, and RedMart. I don’t blame her for being anxious. She had a tiring three-hour flight, navigated intense scrutiny and security at the airport, only to come home to these developments. Worse: we couldn’t do our usual ordering on RedMart—the error message said there were no delivery slots for the week. We found out, much later, that some goondu had made a purchase order amounting to 800kg!
Hello, that’s equivalent to a full-sized giraffe! Buying to feed the whole of Mandai Zoo is it? Can you imagine a RedMart van stocking a giraffe-sized carton for just one dude?
Image source: RedMart’s Facebook page
Spurred by up-to-the-minute updates from close relatives, she jumped into our family car that same evening, drove to the nearest Sheng Shiong, and stumbled into what is now known as the infamous panic-buying queues of that 7 February night. We saw the ugly side of Singaporeans—many abandoned baskets of their goods, perishables inclusive, on the aisle floors because they could no longer wait. That moment coincided with the TOTO S$12m Hongbao Draw results, which unfortunately for everyone else, one lucky Bukit Batokian won.
To calm everyone’s nerves, photos and videos of Singapore’s abundant national stockpile emerged in the press. Then on 9 February, NTUC Fairprice imposed a purchase limit on paper products (4x packs), rice (2x bags) and instant noodles (4x bundles) per customer. There was also a S$50 limit on vegetables. Apparently, kiasuism does have a limit.

Today, we still see queues for hand sanitisers at ulu places like Tuas, but the panic-buying queues have more or less subsided.
Panic- or should I say kiasu-buying isn’t just a Singaporean thing. We’re also seeing this in Hong Kong and Taiwan, especially for face masks and hand sanitisers. It’s human nature to think the worst when everyone else is doing it, and you don’t have all the necessary information. It worsens when your close friends and relatives start giving you up-to-the-minute stock-take information when they’re not even physically there. At least, over here in Singapore, we’re getting up-to-the-minute details on the number of confirmed cases, where they’ve been, and how many have been discharged.
While I wouldn’t call myself a panic-buyer or a hoarder, I am a little forward-looking, to the point of taking precautions when things are still at DORSCON NO COLOUR YET. When I read about China locking down the city of Wuhan and parts of Hubei province on 23 January, I was in Malaysia celebrating Chinese New Year with my family. I immediately went to the local pharmacy and bought two boxes of surgical face masks and one that’s child-friendly. I then bought a fourth box as a CNY gift for my parents.

When I found out Singapore’s immigration custom officials were taking temperature readings of checkpoint commuters on 24 January, I suggested we drive back to Singapore earlier than planned because we didn’t want to get caught in subsequent gridlocks.
Now, I make it a point to wash my hands and sanitise as often as I can, reminding my daughter and family to do the same. When hand sanitisers were sold out at pharmacies, we googled ways to make our own, and my wife ordered rubbing alcohol, essential oils, and distilled water for the ingredients. I was also one of the early folks to wear a mask when I was out and about.

Once, at the hawker stall, the uncle looked at me funny because I ordered Bak Chor Lou Shee Fan With Soup through a face mask. I looked around and no one else was wearing one. Due to my muffled voice, the uncle gave me Bak Chor Lou Shee Fan Without Soup instead. At the time of writing, because we’re in Code Orange and the third highest country on the list of confirmed cases for the virus (after China and the Japan/Diamond Princess cruise ship), every individual out of maybe thirty wears a mask. I bet the hawker uncle’s had enough practice to hear everyone’s orders right.
While the official advisory from the Ministry of Health and the Prime Minister is to only wear a mask when one is sick (so as not to infect others), the general sentiment from the community is to wear one if entering congested places, like a wet market, crowded bus, supermarket, or cinema. Some parents complained on social media because some schools disallowed their children from wearing masks (if they’re not sick).
Others are worried because the incubation period of the COVID-19 virus is 14 days (some say 24). If you do not wear one, what’s stopping an incubator from infecting you? As more 14-day incubators are created, it creates a chain reaction of many more 14-day incubators, and it becomes a wait-and-treat approach. Making it worse are people who are genuinely sick and not wearing masks. I was having lunch at a hawker centre just two days ago while a sickly man was continuously coughing without covering his exposed mouth as he walked by. I felt a moment of panic, because I wasn’t wearing my mask at the time.
This contentious issue was further put in the spotlight when four doctors signed and circulated a letter advising that everyone should be wearing a mask, prompting former NMP Calvin Cheng to argue his view on the side of people who need it most (ie. healthcare workers, public transport workers, etc.) in his Facebook post.

I wear a mask (even though I am not sick) because I believe in protecting myself from the unfortunate situation of being exposed to a ‘spreader’. No matter how hard I try to avoid staying too long in crowded places, I’m usually in them—hawker centres, buses, wet markets—for work and day-to-day routines. Subconsciously, I’m also doing it to set an example for my five-year-old daughter.
“If daddy can wear a mask and keep it there without constantly touching or adjusting it, so can you.”
This was my rhetoric to her. Discipline comes first.
“If you need to wear a mask, you keep it on, not fiddle with it because you’re restless or touching your face all the time.”
I cannot imagine a situation where she does not wear a mask, or fidgets with it without understanding the need to keep it on, then gets exposed to a spreader and ends up being quarantined. I could only have myself to blame.
Image credit: Pexels.com
Which brings me to my final question. What happens if we ever get to DORSCON RED? My guess, based on what I’ve seen, is that there will be hysterical kiasi-ism. Front and back doors, and windows, will remain forever closed. Wipe-downs of every nook and cranny at home, right down to the last shred of toilet paper.
Knock on their door and ask if they’ve got toilet paper to spare, the answer will be, “Go and die lah” in Hokkien or their own native language—delivered from behind a closed door. Don’t even bother trying to reach them on the phone.
The phrase ‘social distancing’ takes on a very different meaning. If they’re carrying umbrellas, they’ll spin it around like Mary Poppins to make sure everyone stays at least ten feet away. They’re afraid of what’s going to happen to them—not others. That’s hysterical kiasi-ism. We’re already seeing some signs with people entering trains completely covered in transparent head-to-toe ponchos.
My hope, like SARS, is for the chain of person-to-person transmission to be broken and the COVID-19 virus contained. The last thing I need is my neighbour displaying symptoms far worse than a coronavirus infection. Or worse, I get infected and become hysterically kiasi too.

DORSCON Orange Is The New Bleh: When You Can't Be Bothered About COVID-19",Terry Ng,TRUE,TRUE
Book Review: China’s Most Controversial Writer (And Its Lessons For Singapore),https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-book-review-chinas-most-controversial-writer-and-its-lessons-for-singapore/,28-May-20,"When the Chinese novelist Fang Fang began writing about her life under lockdown, she could not have imagined that Wuhan Diary (武汉日记) would become China’s biggest controversy this year.
After all, there was nothing particularly scandalous about her chronicle. Yes, there are mentions of overcrowded hospitals. Yes, she demands accountability from her local officials, but Fang Fang was hardly an investigative journalist breaking new ground. Much of what she covered could be found by stumbling blindly around Wechat, where there was a brief blossoming of dissent in the immediate days after the lockdown was announced.
No fingers were pointed at Beijing, nor was it suggested that such a crisis had emerged out of China’s political system. President Xi Jinping appears a grand total of once–in the translator’s endnotes.
And yet, many did take offence as the blog grew more and more popular (attracting around 100 million readers at its peak). First, the critics claimed that she had fabricated many of her ‘doctor’ friends. Then, the CCP IB attacked in force. They accused her of being a ‘running dog for the Americans’ （一条美狗), of feeding off the misery of Wuhan’s residents, and for ‘selling out’ in general. An anonymous high school student (with 100,000 Weibo followers) wrote a letter attacking her on social media, prompting responses from other high-schoolers, as well as right-leaning academics, government-linked trolls and much more. The end result can only be described as a shitstorm—the largest in China this year.
I read a few of her diary entries back in February, but I was too distracted by Singapore’s own crisis to follow the back-and-forth in much detail. However, as our own lockdown draws to a close, I found myself rereading the newly-published Wuhan Diary: Dispatches From A Quarantined City with some interest. Wuhan, free of the virus, has not been news for some time, but its contested legacy holds lessons for us all.
My first response upon finishing the book is a profound sense of anticlimax. Huh, is this it? After all the controversy and accusations of treason, the actual text is extremely underwhelming. If this is what working for the CIA entails, nobody would sign up.
Every entry begins with a very British discussion of Wuhan’s weather （先下大雨，中午大晴）, followed by a short passage on her mood （只想待在家里） . From there, her thoughts move onto more ‘relevant’ subjects, like the hospital’s poor ventilation, or the Hubei natives who were just then being ostracized as lepers in other provinces.
There are many conversations with friends and doctors serving on frontlines, but the diary itself, like most true diaries, is rather short on high drama. This is no Decameron. There are no accounts of dead bodies piling up on the streets or wealthy women turning to prostitution in order to secure medical care.
Instead, it’s almost aggressively banal. A neighbour brings Fang Fang the ingredients for fish soup, dropping it off at her door. She thanks him, then laments that she has so much food in her fridge she could not possibly finish it alone. She shares some of her food with another neighbour and drinks the soup while thinking about some article she read in the Yangtze Daily. Afterwards, she feeds her dog and worries about the dwindling dog food supply.
Suffice to say, Netflix will not be adapting it anytime soon.
Published by HarperCollins, Translated by Michael Berry
Crucially, however, she has not become a lotus-eater like so many of us who, tired of reading Covid-19 numbers and disgusted by the internet shouting matches, have decided to retreat into that happy place between baking and F.r.i.e.n.d.s. Amidst the dog food anxiety and literary meditations, she does perhaps the most important thing a writer can do under the circumstances: she tells it like it is.
Local government officials are relentlessly questioned for their role in downplaying the epidemic during its early stages. Why, she asks, was a 40,000-person community banquet allowed to go on mere days before the lockdown ensued? She rightly calls this lapse a ‘form of criminal action’ on the part of its organizers.
Likewise, the medical team who were sent to investigate the plague gets a beatdown for telling everyone that Covid-19 was ‘Not Contagious Between People, It’s Controllable and Preventable’. （人不传人， 可防可控） When evidence to the contrary grew insurmountable, they did not even bother to ‘express one ounce of regret’ over their mistake or to offer the slightest ‘hint of an apology’. Instead, one doctor, Dr Wang, even had the audacity to turn himself into a martyr by saying: “If I hadn’t gone into some of the patients’ rooms and the sick ward, I wouldn’t have been infected myself!”
In response, Fang Fang rightly cursed him to hell. She also demanded the same accountability for Dr Li Wenliang, the persecuted whistleblower, from the administrators of the Central Hospital in Wuhan where Covid-19 had spread quickly amongst the medical staff, as well as for all the cancer patients who died because overcrowded hospitals made chemotherapy impossible. In short, she counts the cost in a manner which attracted the ire of China’s ultra-nationalist trolls, who saw her critical stance as an attack not against the Wuhan local government, or certain leaders, or even certain policies, but as an attack on China itself. She was not just a critic, but a traitor who fed off the blood on Wuhan’s people and gave ammunition to the west.
Scenes of overcrowding and chaos which Fang Fang describes in the diary's early entries. It was widely reported, but nonetheless drew the ire of Big V ultra-lefitsts.
This is where Wuhan Diary becomes truly eerie. Reading Fang Fang’s diary, especially the latter parts where she debates with nationalist trolls, gave me a warm fuzzy feeling of familiarity. China’s nationalists are called ultra-leftists, but even the most sympathetic marxist would struggle to distinguish them from our own Facebook IB. Although they are defending the CCP instead of the PAP, the arguments employed are not just similar in tone, but copied more or less word for word.
I can list the greatest hits, but I think you already know them by heart. First, there is an imaginary ‘west’ that is not just ‘biased’ and ‘racist’, but well-organized in their maliciousness far beyond the dreams of any State Department official. Secondly, there are accusations of being an ‘armchair critic’ and using the tragedy for ‘personal gain’. Thirdly, a lack of gratitude to the government is quickly upgraded into a charge of treason.
Some of the bolder outlets will even outright accuse you of working for a foreign government because why not? If you frame it in such a way that your accusation sounds like a genuine question rather than a statement of fact, no one can really prosecute you anyway.
The overall effect is neither right nor left, but plays on that ever-useful sentiment: pride. A siege mentality. Us versus them. The irony of your opponents using the exact same arguments seem to discomfit no one, probably because nationalism and patriotism are not about rational arguments, but play on hurt egos and an instinctive gut-level hatred of foreigners.
Fang Fang’s Wuhan Diary is thus remarkable, not because it sheds new light about China’s early handling of the crises (it really doesn’t), or because of its grossly-exaggerated literary significance (it has little, if any). It’s important because it illustrates the struggle of speaking out in a time of heightened jingoism, where dissent is equated to treachery and everyone is suspected of disloyalty; when seeking accountability is forbidden—unless it’s directed outwards towards other countries and foreign bodies.
The irony is, her realistic portrayal of Wuhan during the lockdown, lambasted as ‘unpatriotic’, has since been proven right and true and universal. Who doesn’t feel ‘a sense of fear, helplessness and anxiety?’ (恐慌、无助、焦虑、紧张) Who doesn’t want a ‘good cry’ when it’s all over? Much of what she described in Wuhan Diary, far from being bleak, is extremely relatable as the lockdown commenced around the world. Much like Singapore during the early days of covid-19, the journalists of Wuhan had a brief moment of panic when the daily case count was delayed by accident. Pregnant women, whether they are in Wuhan or Woodlands are all under a great deal of stress as they bring new life into a changed world.
Unfortunately, it is not just criticism which has been outlawed. Negativity has also become a taboo subject as the central government tries to promote positive energy (”正能量“). The question is, when does positivity cross the line from cheerleading into censorship?
One of the letters attacking Fang Fang, accusing her of eating 'steamed buns filled with human blood'.
A vaccine has not yet been found, but we already know how the Pandemic will end. At some point, China, Singapore and the USA will all declare victory against the covid-19. Everyone will lean out of their window to clap, and leaders will take the podium.It will be a great triumph, and it will be attributed to Chinese unity, our Government’s quick response, America’s unyielding spirit, resilience, collectivity, individuality, solidarity and feel-good phrases which mean everything and yet nothing.
As for the mistakes, everyone will blame everyone else until it emerges that neither the PAP, nor the CCP, nor the Trump administration, nor Boris Johnson, nor Bolsanaro had made any mistakes in their handling of the outbreak. Singapore is great. China is great. America is great. The world is great. Everything is great. It was a great pandemic where everything was beautiful and nobody died.
It is against such triumphalism and false positivity which Fang Fang makes her stand. “Remember, there is no such thing as Victory here,” she writes, “there is only the end.” (记住，没有胜利，而是结果）Perhaps this is the real point of Wuhan Diary and other ordinary accounts of life during the Pandemic. Without them, we would be swept away by the relentless firehose of bullshit which turns every tragedy into an opportunity for triumph.

Where The Wild Ones Are: Protecting the Great Primates of Singapore",Pan Jie,TRUE,TRUE
Security & Independence Are Basic Needs: Sg’s First Minimum Income Standard Research Project,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-security-independence-basic-needs-minimum-income-standard-mis/,3-Jul-20,"Teo You Yenn, Ng Kok Hoe, Neo Yu Wei, Ad Maulod and Stephanie Chok of the Minimum Income Standard research team suggest that security and independence need to be centred in the ongoing public conversation—boosted by the General Election—about basic needs.
Political parties contesting in the 2020 General Election have pledged to address inequality and poverty. During campaigning as well as after the new government forms, the policy question on the table will not be whether, but how, we should address this. For a start, how should we define the basic standard of living that political candidates say Singaporeans deserve?
“A basic standard of living in Singapore is about, but more than just housing, food, and clothing. It is about having opportunities to education, employment and work-life balance, as well as access to healthcare. It enables a sense of belonging, respect, security, and independence. It also includes choices to participate in social activities, and the freedom to engage in one’s cultural and religious practices.”
– What older people need in Singapore: A households budgets study (May 2019)
This definition was crafted through data generated from focus group discussions, and then used in multiple rounds of discussions with ordinary Singaporeans over the past two years. It includes things that are concrete—housing, food, clothing—as well as things that are abstract—belonging, respect, security, independence. It is a definition that reflects people’s shared sense of basic needs in its multiple facets.
We expect this definition to be robust and stand the test of time, but COVID-19 is a crisis on an unprecedented scale. So we have to wonder: have certain needs become more urgent, and others less so? Are people shifting their expectations of what ‘basic’ means? Are they meeting basic needs in new ways? We convened two special focus group discussions over Zoom to investigate these questions.
We saw in our participants’ lives many things we have experienced in our own: the challenge of ensuring every member of a family has a device for work or study; the struggle for private and quiet space at home; changes in grocery shopping and food consumption patterns; the drastic reduction in social encounters—whether with friends and family, or teachers, classmates, and co-workers.
The challenges of managing the needs of all family members at home have been acute for many. Illustration by Jolene Tan.
Mostly our participants seem to have adjusted well—they did not express resentment, impatience, or skepticism at the necessity of these shifts. In several instances, they talked about positive aspects of the past months at home—the opportunity to spend more time with family, or healthier eating habits, for example. One very perceptive young person pointed out that suspending some of one’s own needs for things like social participation is important at a time like this, because the health and wellbeing of the whole community is at stake. Human needs, as we have often emphasized, are not generated and experienced individually, but collectively in society.
Of all the needs captured in the definition of a basic standard of living, two stand out as particularly relevant: security and independence. Security refers to financial stability and freedom from worry, so that life goes beyond basic subsistence and people can access things and experiences that bring pride, pleasure, and joy. Independence is about being able to take care of oneself and not rely on others, and having autonomy to make choices.
Pre-crisis, the needs for security and independence were somewhat met by reasonable expectations of employment opportunity and continuity during one’s working age. But even then, older people expressed a lot of anxiety about falling sick and losing mobility. They were concerned about the cost of healthcare and becoming a source of financial burden for their children. Many worried that the younger generation may find it hard to cope or ever achieve their aspirations. In a poll conducted by the Straits Times after our study was released, working-age people reported worry that they may not be able to provide for their own families and support their retired parents at the same time. The participants in our study rarely mentioned any sort of collective ‘safety net’ provided by society–it did not seem to be something people could count on.
Illustration by Jolene Tan.
Although our participants seemed to have adapted reasonably well since COVID-19 struck, there was a stronger and more palpable anxiety in recent conversations. It appears that needs for security and independence may be increasingly difficult to meet. There was much talk about how things will look in the next few years, and what the pandemic’s effects will be for livelihoods in the longer-term. Older participants, in their 40s and with children, worried openly about losing jobs and income; they do not have security because they know their savings will not last long. Still in their prime working age, with children to support, these people count on continuing employment to meet their and their young families’ needs.
Younger respondents, in their 20s, still studying or just beginning careers, are finding it hard to hold on to the independence they were beginning to carve out. With the crisis, many lost part-time jobs they had depended on to support themselves. Indeed, contrary to stereotypes of ‘soft’ or irresponsible young people, many were cognizant of their parents’ financial circumstances and contributed financially to their households. For them, the need for independence, once on the cusp of realisation, now looks more elusive.
Security and independence have both tangible and intangible dimensions. Respondents are very clear that this is not merely an abstract feeling—it requires money to buy all the things that one needs to live. But they are also feelings. A sense of security and a sense of independence are things people need. They are important for people to attain wellbeing. Younger participants were especially articulate about this—pointing out that mental health is deeply and negatively affected when people lose their senses of security and independence. One shared that when she thought she would be fired, she could not eat or sleep for weeks.

How people feel about their futures has important consequences for their current actions. This in turn has deep and significant implications for society. For example, when young people experience insecurity and a lack of independence, they put longer-term plans—buying a flat, getting married, having children—on hold. When people tighten their expenditures in anticipation of harder times, as our respondents have, it affects overall consumption in the economy and therefore businesses and jobs.
The sense of insecurity we witnessed in our focus group discussions may be a direct reflection of these extraordinary times. But it is also a reminder that the role of social policies is to provide assurance that people will not, as one participant put it, “fall through the bottom” precisely when times are hard.
How people view the future depends on how they weigh their capacities and potential against the demands and risks in the environment. Individual capacities depend not just on personal and family resources, but also on collective commitments to ensure basic living standards in society. Policy arrangements express these collective commitments. Indeed, security has always been one of the main purposes of social policies globally. Modern social welfare is geared towards providing protection during non-income-generating stages in the life cycle (such as care, education, and pensions for children and elderly people), as well as buffer against contingencies (such as income protection during sickness, disability and unemployment).
From our research over the years, we have learnt that unequivocal, scientifically-derived standards are critical for rational, transparent policymaking that will give people a sense of assurance and confidence about their futures. If policies are not based on principles and benchmarks that people understand and accept, they will always feel like they can be suddenly taken away. We know too that having a policy in place is only the first step. How it is designed and operated will determine people’s actual experiences. When social assistance is difficult to qualify for, onerous to access, insufficiently generous to meet basic needs, and come attached with social judgement, they add to people’s sense that they have to manage on their own, regardless of their difficulties.
Whether people understand and accept the basis for policies is relevant to their sense of security. Illustration by Jolene Tan.
The fallout of the pandemic will be long and protracted. Struggles to meet basic needs, both tangible and intangible, material and abstract, will likely intensify. Ordinary people are now more conscious than ever of how all our fates are shared. We have seen in the past few months that people mobilise and find affirmative meaning in community and sharing, numerous donation and volunteer drives demonstrating solidarity. They cast doubt on arguments that Singaporeans will not support measures to redistribute income more fairly, or that older and younger generations are in competition for resources they would each rather keep for themselves.
The pandemic has revealed, in Singapore and elsewhere, the deep costs of inequality. Solutions have to be bolder. There is no sidestepping the need for redistribution to adequately protect those not adequately rewarded by market mechanisms. Security and independence are basic needs—necessary to everyone’s well-being, and consequential to the collective wellbeing of society—and social policy must address these in the recovery.
Political leaders and policy makers now have the extraordinary opportunity to create the conditions for greater solidarity. We urge them to forge a social policy regime that is transparent and consistent in its rationales, systematic and fair in its consideration of diverse interests, and oriented toward ensuring that everyone in society is able to meet basic needs.

Reviewing 'Singapore Dreaming' in 2020: How Much Has Really Changed?",Academia.sg,TRUE,TRUE
Where Migrant Support Efforts Are Headed After the Circuit Breaker,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-migrant-support-efforts-after-circuit-breaker/,22-May-20,"All images RICE file photos unless otherwise stated.
The circuit breaker may be easing, but migrant workers’ worries are far from over.
Since the outbreak began sweeping through the dormitories in early April, the situation on the ground has evolved, and migrant workers’ needs with them. The ‘first wave’ of relief efforts focusing on immediate needs, like food and medical supplies, has shifted towards more medium-to-long-term concerns over mental health, salary payment, and job security.
Domestic workers have also emerged as a second, invisible crisis, with a surge in reports of overwork and mental distress since the start of the circuit breaker.
With so many initiatives in this space, different groups have different focus areas and concerns. We caught up with several migrant support groups on what they’ve been doing, and what their key concerns are moving forward.
HOME: Casework and long-term advocacy for both migrant workers and migrant domestic workers
What they’ve been doing: HOME has been focusing on casework and advocacy, direct outreach and coordinating donations (particularly to migrants living in private accommodation), and providing financial and social support.
Their helplines are still operating, although their shelters have not been able to take in new residents, and their walk-in helpdesks have been closed since the start of the circuit breaker. They expect demand for their casework and financial assistance services to surge after the measures are eased.
Domestic workers’ challenges are another major area of concern. A joint survey they conducted with AWARE in April found that respondents were struggling with issues like overwork. under-payment, remittances, and access to information.
Looking ahead: Going forward, they see a need to balance short-term aid with structural change.
“There has been a generous outpouring of donations and increased willingness of people to be engaged in issues related to migrant workers … Hearteningly, there have been attempts to bring migrant workers together through talks and panel discussions,” said Jaya Anil Kumar, HOME’s Casework Manager.
“However, while there has been a generous outpouring of humanitarian aid, we also need to examine the structural gaps that have led to the need for this massive effort, and a recognition that we need to implement lasting change for the living and working conditions for migrant workers, and give them a voice to speak to their own issues themselves.”
How you can help: Direct cash donations, donations in kind (meals, groceries and housekeeping supplies, sanitisers, and top-up cards), and volunteering support (translation, communications, design, and casework) are all welcome. Contact ruchita.chheda@home.org.sg.
Healthserve: Medical support, including mental health and chronic care, case work, and social assistance
What they’ve been doing: Healthserve provides medical care, counseling, case work, social assistance, and other support to migrant workers.
Since the start of the circuit breaker, their team has been working largely on the ground, providing medical assistance and other support at dormitories and community care facilities. Their casework team has also been supporting workers on Special Passes, and working with HOME and TWC2 to reach out to workers living in private accommodation, many of whom have faced problems with eviction or are struggling to pay for rent and food.
Looking ahead: Mental health is a major concern going forward. “We’ve received a lot more enquiries about mental distress,” Suwen, Healthserve’s Head of Communications and Engagement, tells me. “Our counselling clinics have received close to 300 enquiries since they started on April 20th, ranging from mild to severe.”
Another emerging concern is the need for medical care for chronic diseases. Suwen explains that as migrant workers have undergone other health screenings along with testing for Covid-19, many have been diagnosed with chronic conditions like high blood pressure or cholesterol, but employers are often unwilling to help pay for their medication.
Like HOME, they expect demand for their casework and drop-in centre to rise even further after the circuit breaker is eased.
How you can help: Donations to their Migrant Health Relief Fund (earmarked specifically for Covid-19) are now closed. However, they are accepting donations to Healthserve’s general assistance fund.
Still from I Dream of Singapore (2019).
TWC2: Casework, particularly for migrant workers on Special Passes, and advocacy
What they’ve been doing: Although their office closed at the start of the circuit breaker, TWC2 has been keeping up their casework and advocacy services, including assisting workers on Special Passes (ie. men who have lost their jobs and are in the midst of salary claims), and workers whose claims have concluded but have not yet been paid or paid less than expected. They have also been providing workers with direct support, and run a campaign to buy prepaid phone cards.
Looking ahead: Although they expect any evolution of their services to be gradual, in line with the lifting of the circuit breaker, they will generally be re-focusing their attention on workers who have lost their jobs and remain highly vulnerable.
“These are the ones with salary and injury claims and abandoned by their employers,” said Alex Au, TWC2’s Vice-President.
“The hope is that workers still with jobs will be able to resume working and not have to depend on charity. Our fear though is that substantial numbers of workers will lose their jobs in the months to come, and our case load will increase dramatically.”
How you can help: “We have received tremendous support from the public in the form of donations, for which we are very grateful. But going forward, what we also need is support for the policy changes we are advocating, because unless we fix the policy defects that created the Covid-related and non-Covid problems, these will recur,” said Alex.
Migrant Workers’ Centre (MWC): On-ground support and employment grievance assistance
What they’ve been doing: Since the start of the circuit breaker, MWC has been providing extensive on-ground support at dormitories (both purpose-built and factory-converted).
They will assess the need to keep providing essential supplies as the situation evolves, although they anticipate that FCDs, in particular, may continue to need support for some time. They are also looking to acquire personal protective equipment (PPE) and oximeters for FCD operators and residents respectively, covering around 1,000 facilities.
They also provide employment grievance assistance services, and partner with MOM and the Tripartite Alliance for Dispute Management to provide interim support and ex gratia assistance to workers who are either in the midst of pursuing claims, or who have been unable to receive compensation despite successfully concluding claims (typically where the employer is unable to pay).
Looking ahead: While they plan to keep up their emergency response work in the dormitories, their post-circuit breaker concerns centre on financial and employment stresses.
“[T[he enforced downtime for many companies has led to quite severe financial strain on some companies, and some of our key concerns are the availability of adequate, real relief to workers that are marginalised as a result of the economic pressures on their employers brought on by the virus and the circuit breaker,” said Bernard Menon, MWC’s Executive Director.
He noted that as businesses begin to take stock of their employment situation, many may implement cost-cutting measures. “We fully expect many migrant workers to be displaced in this new norm and worse still, not have been paid salaries from April onwards.”
How you can help: While public support in terms of both monetary donations and donations in-kind has been “overwhelming” and “heartening”, they would appreciate donations to be made in cash going forward, as this would give them the flexibility needed to provide relief and gate-keep the claims process. Donations to their Migrant Workers’ Assistance Fund can be made here.

CMSC (Covid-19 Migrant Support Coalition)
What they’ve been doing: CMSC is a collective of ground-up initiatives, which banded together to address the immediate-to-medium term needs of migrant workers affected by the circuit breaker.
The collective has been providing meals and basic needs to migrant workers during this period, particularly those living in FCDs or other accommodation with limited access to resources, working with government agencies as well as other migrant community organisations and private sector logistics personnel. They also send out teams of interpreters, caseworkers and medical personnel to provide PPE to FCDs through their Reassurance Project initiative.
CMSC also runs programmes to support migrant workers’ mental and emotional well-being, such as relaxation classes (in collaboration with The Art of Living) and WePals (a befriending initiative which connects locals to migrant workers).
Looking ahead: Like many other organisations, they expect salary payment and housing issues to rise after the circuit breaker eases, and are ramping up their casework team and legal capabilities to meet these needs.
“We also anticipate the mental health effects on migrant workers to worsen in the coming months, due to the buildup of anxiety from (1) uncertainty of jobs, and (2) their family situations back at home, ” said a representative from the collective. They plan to increase communication touchpoints with migrant workers, in addition to their current mental wellness and occupational engagement initiatives.
They will also be keeping up the Reassurance Project, meal provision, and support for dormitory operators depending on need.
How you can help: You can donate, join their WePals befriender programme, send a note to a migrant friend, grant a wish, or provide knowledge support at their SG Migrant portal.
ItsRainingRaincoats: English classes, direct worker support, and meal provision
What they’ve been doing: ItsRainingRaincoats has been providing a range of targeted support and outreach programmes over the last few months.
Some of their initiatives include Project Belanja (providing hot cooked meals), a data card drive, providing care packs and miscellaneous needs like snacks, fans, phones, and board games, helpline support, and assistance to workers who contact them directly. Prior to the circuit breaker, they also began their MAD WISH initiative, which connects migrant workers with locals for 1-on-1 English classes.
The group has also been in touch with the families of migrant workers who passed away during this period.
Looking ahead: The group will be keeping up its various initiatives post-circuit breaker, and will be monitoring the situation to address shifting areas of need.
How you can help: Visit their Facebook page for more information, or this site for a full breakdown of their various Covid-19 response initiatives.

WIMBY (Welcome In My Backyard): Community integration initiatives
What they’ve been doing: WIMBY is a ground-up campaign which was set up in April, following the announcement that migrant workers in essential services would be temporarily rehoused in HDB flats in Redhill and Jurong West. They aim to counter NIMBYism by amplifying the message that migrant workers are ‘welcome in [my] backyard]’, and normalising relations between migrant workers and Singaporeans.
The campaign’s first initiative, Welcome Notes, collects notes of support for migrant workers. They have also begun an online panel discussion series, Backyard Conversations.
“Personally, while I believe that monetary donations are an important and viable way of supporting migrant workers during this time, perhaps something that will stick with people longer is the experience of having proper conversations and actual interactions with a migrant worker,” said Ethel Pang, one of WMBY’s committee members.
“Many Singaporeans have actually never had the opportunity to come face to face with a migrant brother; I think that conversations will go a long way in shattering stereotypes and helping people feel more personally invested in this cause in the long run.”
Looking ahead: The team will be keeping up Welcome Notes, and hope to extend the campaign to Ulu Pandan, Bukit Timah, and Upper Bukit Timah, which have also been designated as temporary rehousing sites.
They’ve also launched Backyard Hangouts, their virtual community, which aims to bring migrant workers and Singaporeans together through online activities like karaoke and board game nights. The team is also looking to expand their Local Integration efforts, which disseminate information and develop outreach sessions with residents in the rehousing estates.
How you can help: Write a Welcome Note, join their Virtual Community, or tune in to their Backyard Conversation panels. More information is available at www.wimby.sg or on their various social media channels (under the handle WelcomeInMyBackyard). They are also recruiting volunteers (contact welcomeinmybackyard@gmail.com).
This is by no means an exhaustive list of the many support efforts in this space. There are many others, including Project Chulia Street, One Bag, One Book/Migrant Writers of Singapore, Sama Sama, and the SDI Academy, all of which provide services ranging from casework and advocacy and community integration efforts to English classes.

"Migrant Workers Need Masks and Hand Sanitiser, But These Won’t Fix A Culture of Chronic Neglect",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-migrant-workers-masks-hand-sanitiser-wont-fix-chronic-neglect/,27-Feb-20,"Photos by the author save where otherwise stated.
Over the last few weeks, even the most cynical amongst us, scarred by the Great Panic Buyout of 7th February and the ensuing fallout, will have seen #SGTogether efforts making the rounds on social media. I’m not referring to top-down calls for calm, but earnest, ground-level initiatives encouraging Singaporeans to look out for each other while the Covid-19 outbreak drags on.
Amongst these are posts calling for donations of masks, hand sanitiser, and vitamin C to be collected and distributed to migrant workers. You might have seen the one put out by itsrainingraincoats, an NGO, or a more recent one by TEDx Singapore.
Unfortunately, the need for such initiatives is as severe as it is obvious. As one of society’s least protected groups, migrant workers are amongst its most vulnerable when the proverbial shit hits the fan (or when coronaviruses savage our respiratory systems).
Despite literally building this country, they aren’t considered part of it. The measures that so many of us take for granted either don’t apply to them, or leave them out altogether.
They didn’t receive free masks from the government. They don’t have the resources to scour pharmacies for hand sanitiser or disinfectant wipes, which many employers haven’t and won’t trouble themselves to provide, given how hard they are to come by.
Construction workers live in massive dormitories that make instructions to ‘avoid crowded places’ completely moot. And between language barriers, financial need, and the fundamental power imbalance associated with their transient status, none of them are in a position to speak up and ask for more help.
As such, migrant worker NGOs and handfuls of civil society volunteers have been working overtime, under incredible constraints, to ensure they aren’t left high and dry in the scramble.
Last Sunday, 23rd February, I joined a group of volunteers helping to pack and distribute masks and advisory leaflets to migrant workers in Little India. The effort was the initiative of a domestic worker, Neng, who had mobilised volunteers to raise funds, before enlisting family members in Indonesia to source masks from a supplier, and then arranging for them to be brought to Singapore.
While handing out the mask packs, I took the chance to quickly ask workers—Indian and Bangladeshi men working in the construction sector—how they’d been coping with the outbreak. What measures had they seen rolled out in their dorms and worksites? Had the virus had other effects on their work?
The responses I got were as inconsistent as the government’s messaging on citizen engagement or the value of the arts.
Temperature scanning: yes at worksites, mostly-but-with-more-gaps at their dorms. (At this stage, it’s worth mentioning that not all construction workers live in dorms, where operations are managed by private companies. Many live in temporary accommodation, sometimes in the very buildings they happen to be working on.)
Masks: one worker said his company had given them N95s, and a few got surgical masks, but most claimed they hadn’t received any. (I mostly got eye-rolls for asking this and emphatic claims of, “Nothing.”)
Hand sanitiser: please.
Were they given instructions on how to use said masks, or what to do if they fell sick? Posters (in English and in their native languages) had been put up in dorms, and some employers and dorm operators had held talks outlining what to do, but it wasn’t clear if these had been effective. Apart from the language barrier, some men claimed to have missed the sessions because they returned too late from work.
Had they been reminded to wash their hands more? Yes, but when you share a bathroom with so many other men, soap tends to be in short supply, and the bathrooms themselves would make even the most hardened Survivor cast member cringe.
Had dormitory events been cancelled? Yes, but they still share bedrooms with 10-15 other men, and kitchens with hundreds of others, so.
And on top of this, their Chinese colleagues have been caught up in the travel restrictions imposed earlier this month, so many have had their work schedules reorganised to get all hands on deck.
Against all this, two surgical masks and a leaflet felt like small comfort. It didn’t help that all 250 packs we were giving out were gone in minutes.
On Monday morning, it was reported that the family of a critically ill Bangladeshi worker would be receiving a $10,000 donation to help defray their expenses.
This is a helpful gesture, but it shouldn’t distract from the fact that long after the outbreak subsides, migrant workers will face the same challenges as they did before it started. Where their welfare is concerned, Covid-19 didn’t just create a new set of problems; it also exposed how existing cracks can widen into yawning craters under pressure.
The first is communication. One simple example to illustrate this: the use of masks.
While handing out the packs, it became obvious that many migrant workers didn’t know how or when masks ought to be used. Many began opening the packs and taking out the masks to wear on the spot. Cue frantic volunteers waving our hands and stressing, “NO, PLEASE DON’T, ONLY IF YOU’RE SICK.”
This goes beyond the difficulty of translating information into Tamil, Bengali, Mandarin, and several other native languages, and then getting dorm managers and construction companies to relay it with no broken telephone-style gap (a challenge which would apply regardless of DORSCON level). But migrant workers’ access to information, already limited in normal circumstances, falls far short of the speed and scope required for crisis communications.
Unlike you and I, who enjoy a constant, reliable stream of Covid-19 updates flowing in via government websites and the news, many migrant workers have to wait for information to trickle down to them, usually via their employers (to whom advisories are sent) or the efforts of NGOs. (It’s worth pointing out that many domestic workers, in particular, also have their mobile phone use circumscribed by their employers.)
Forget urgent clarifications about how Covid-19 spreads, or the details of the latest travel restrictions; just ensuring migrant workers are aware of standard information like their employment rights is hard enough. This not only contributes to a general climate of disempowerment, but creates room for confusion, anxiety, and disinformation to abound in a crisis.
Similarly, when you consider construction workers’ general welfare and living conditions, most of the health advice that’s been rolled out starts to look overambitious at best, and pointless at worst.
Anyone who’s had to share space with other human beings knows how hard it is to keep communal areas clean (case in point: the Rice office pantry). Multiply this several times over for your run-of-the-mill dormitory—bedrooms and bathrooms are shared by 10-15 men, and kitchens by hundreds—and just keeping the place sanitary starts to look like an accomplishment.
Concerns about workers’ accommodation existed long before Patient 0 brought Covid-19 to Singapore. As one paper notes, “outbreaks of infctious diseases such as typhus, dengue and pneumonia have been documented [amongst male migrant workers], possibly due to the high-density living conditions and occasionally less than satisfactory sanitary living conditions”.
Moreover, facilities are not always up to scratch, making hand sanitiser and disinfectant wipes a luxury.
Two men I spoke to, one of whom lives in a dormitory in Punggol and the other in Sembawang, told me about how broken sinks or showers often take weeks to be replaced. They showed me photos of their communal kitchens after a round of cooking, with a floor so grimy it deserved its own trigger warning.
According to them, dormitory operators sometimes reprimand them for ‘causing trouble’ if they bring issues to light, or question why repairs are taking so long.
To cap all this off, migrant workers do not enjoy access to government-subsidised medical care. They aren’t eligible for the reduced fees currently being charged by Public Health Preparedness Clinics (PHPCs) and polyclinics for diagnoses of respiratory illness, and HealthServe, the main NGO providing healthcare services to migrant workers, has had to temporarily close 2 of its 3 clinics due to resource constraints.
This said, on any given day, many workers would hesitate to see a doctor in the first place. They can’t afford the cost of both missing a day’s work and having to pay for treatment.
Ultimately, these are all acute manifestations of chronic issues, which NGOs and activists have been campaigning on for years.
Vulnerable communities don’t suddenly become vulnerable because of a crisis; they are already vulnerable because of existing gaps in the system. Long after Covid-19 becomes old news and the last pack of masks is given out, migrant workers will remain one of our most poorly protected communities, unless or until things improve.
When we look back on the lessons learned from this period, we should remember that #SGTogether, after all, is not a hashtag that should only apply in bad times. It applies in the good, too—and the Singapore we’re rallying exists for all of us.
Migrant worker NGOs still need all the help they can get at this time, so please send support their way: HOME, TWC2, Healthserve, and itsrainingraincoats are but a few. In the meantime, send us your thoughts on this piece at community@ricemedia.co.

"After 2 Weeks of HBL, Is the Work Being Divided Equally At Home?",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-hbl-work-divided-equally/,20-Apr-20,"Top image: Dennis Khung / RICE File Photo
Welcome To The New Normal
Singapore is just over two weeks into a lockdown. Yes, a lockdown.
To date, Singapore has 6588 cases of infections and 11 deaths. The New Normal here is littered with acronyms: SHN, CB, HBL, LOA, WFH. These tidy terms, devised by our government, and enforced, especially in the past two weeks, with prosecutorial zeal, only tell half the story.
They tell you how your society is going to be regulated during the pandemic. But they don’t tell you how life will be organised behind closed doors. For that, you’ll have to speak to families in lockdown. And in particular, to women.
I single out women raising children because this lockdown has increased the demands made upon them to keep the family chugging along through a crisis.
All of the worlds we occupied that gave us some structure and reprieve, have recently collapsed and folded into each other with a spike in Covid-19 cases. Nuclear families are in lockdown as self-contained units. Some live with grandparents who help babysit children; others care for aging parents, at a time when the elderly are considered to be most vulnerable to contracting and succumbing to the virus.
And everyone is at home. Almost all the time.
Institutions and individuals have disappeared into blocks of time and multiple video-conferencing applications from Zoom to Google Hangouts. Our communities and our lives have been compressed into a 13.5-inch laptop screen, an i-Pad, or the mobile phone.
Life in miniature: Zoom call for preschool kids. Photo by author.
Along the way, women have unwittingly become part-time teachers, part-time caretakers, part-time parents, part-time workers and fully fragmented. This is also the New Normal.
Women have always tended to carry the mental load. Used and popularised by French comic artist Emma, the term has come to encapsulate all of the work women do, which is unseen and might seem insignificant, but which makes them the home’s multitasking project manager par excellence.
Much of that juggle depends on both individuals and institutions carrying some of the weight. The “village” consists of spouses or partners, grandparents, schools, tutors, sports instructors, extended family members, helpers and more.
In theory, that load should be significantly reduced now because you can’t engage in most activities outside your house. But it hasn’t. Working from home means many are working far more hours than they ought to, while trying to master MOE’s home-based learning initiative (HBL), designed to keep children “in schools” despite school closures.
Junice works, while the boys play.
The ones who are managing, still have some aspect of the “village” to lean on, or have kids in preschool, which means HBL is not a pressure.
Junice, 39, who works in the sustainable business sector, has two sons aged 3 and 5. The family stays with her parents, and they take turns to manage the boys.
“It has naturally evolved into each adult taking on tasks,” she says, adding, “Although grandparents have taken on a bulk of the cooking and cleaning. Childminding involves a lot of free play and a greater reliance on TV and Youtube Kids. Both are in preschool so there’s much less homework pressure.”
This has happened to my husband and I as well. I’ve tried to get our toddler to do some of the “activities” that her preschool teacher has given us. She dislikes the word “activities”, and has decided structured time belongs in preschool. I’ve given up and I let her free play, while I frantically edit or work on a story draft. If I manage to carve out four hours of work from my day, it feels like a small miracle.
We’re not alone.
Out of 200,000 preschool going children in Singapore, currently only 5 percent are still going to preschool because their parents are in essential services, or are unable to provide alternative care arrangements. The rest are at home.
Chaos is the order of the day. Photo by author.
While some of us are managing, it is contingent on key aspects of life returning to normal, which we’ve been told may not happen soon. Some of us will muddle through. But for many, an indefinite extension of the lockdown may increase their anxiety.
This Is Your Life In Lockdown
Days after schools closed across the country, I reached out to mums to find out how they were doing. There was a flurry of responses that read like haikus of condensed anxiety because every single one was in the midst of acclimating to the multiple interfaces and apps required for HBL, whilst working or managing the home with no help.
“I’m barely surviving, I cannot meet the deadlines …”
“I can only handle one child at a time …”
“I’m not really coping …”
“They can implement a circuit breaker but the poor kids cannot manage the stress of not exercising or exerting themselves …”
“It’s mad … I’m constantly shooing away the kids when I’m in the middle of a meeting and they have questions … this is so much more stressful.”
“I’ve been pulling 15-hour days to pull off homeschooling and a full-time job. #exhausted”
Cheryl Tang / RICE File Photo
What I found striking was that almost all of them were taking on HBL without help from their partners.
Where have all the men gone? They are at home as well, and many will be running errands, shouldering some of the home-based learning (HBL) classes for their kids, or getting them outdoors for fresh air (with masks on). But for a significant number of women I spoke to, the men have disappeared into their newly outfitted home-offices: a cubby-hole in the corner of a room. A desk installed in the bedroom. A laptop and office supplies on the dining table.
This divergence in approaches to life during a lockdown isn’t a criticism of men. It’s simply further proof that while we’re all being told to adjust our expectations during a time of crisis, we’re also being told to keep up appearances “at work” and to meet our KPIs or work outputs for the quarter, and beyond. For a lot of men, that means doubling down on the task at hand and leaving the myriad duties that have flooded the household to their partners.

Nithya, 38, an adjunct lecturer at NUS, and mother of two boys, explains.
“My husband shuts himself in his room and has full working days, with calls and meetings and late night conference calls. It’s like he feels helpless. He needs to do his work. He wants to help me, but he feels unable to. I, on the other hand, am unable to continue as if the pandemic hasn’t disrupted anything.”
And so she marks papers, tries to stay on top of articles she needs to write, and does HBL with her son, who is in primary one, while leaving her 3-year old to play with minimal supervision.
In some instances, the presumption is that the men will simply not be as meticulous.
“I need to give my husband instructions on how to manage HBL,” quips Mrs. Leong, 43, who works in the oil industry.
Without a comprehensive survey of just how families are dividing responsibilities at home and who is leading the HBL programme with their children, it’s hard to conclude that women are most likely to be at the helm. But if they are, that could be driven—for better or for worse—by an almost unconscious presumption on all our parts that women make better teachers.

This isn’t just in the New Normal. It’s evidenced by statistical facts. In 2017, women consisted of over 80% of the primary school teaching staff and over 60% in secondary schools. Preschools are virtually women-run communes for kids: men account for less than 1% of early childhood educators.
Does this make it okay that working mothers are having to now play the role of primary school teachers?
For many, it has had a negative impact on their mental well-being.
Nisa, 38, a part-time lecturer with two boys aged 6 and 4, and her husband co-share duties. But it’s still proving to be a challenge.
“Finding the time to do these different things is causing me stress and sometimes even anxiety. I have slowly come to terms with the routine though sometimes when I don’t feel good mentally or physically, it does affect my temperament when I’m guiding my son during HBL.”

For others, I sensed stoic acceptance, undergirded by guilt. We have it good, they seemed to say, and so we should not complain. The ability to work from home, and have access to resources (laptops, for one) is already a privilege during a crisis.
But this doesn’t diminish the fact that we’re in unprecedented territory, and that the loss of a sense of control over one’s time and space is genuinely felt.
Hanqing, 37, who runs her own editorial business, and has three children between the ages of 4 and 9, tells me that between scanning and submitting work, troubleshooting IT issues, or accessing the MOE Parents Gateway to make sure the tasks for the day are done, there is no time left to attend to her own work.
“No ‘me-time’ is an understatement but I try to cope by getting a HIIT workout in the afternoon as well as catching up on some reading at night.”
If any more variables are added into the mix, the current challenges become too much to bear.
Shaiful, who works in the arts industry, tells me that some of his peers have pre-existing struggles, which has made HBL all the more difficult.
“One is going through a divorce, works in essential services and has two kids in preschool. Another is already divorced and has to split one laptop between herself and two kids who are at different levels in school,” he tells me.
He’s trying to figure out how to offer support, or draw attention to the fact that parents are struggling to adapt.
Rosemary, 41, a preschool teacher, with two sons (and who is separated from her husband), has continued working throughout the lockdown, to teach children whose families cannot afford home-care or who work in essential services.
In a voice recorded message, she tells me it has been incredibly difficult.
“We’re going through very tough times. The day the schools closed, they kept the teachers back. I teach at the kindergarten level, so I fill in for people who cannot teach. I’m struggling to cope. I have two sons who cannot be controlled and who don’t have a father figure at home. I asked for limited care for one of the boys to continue primary school. But I was refused. They gave me an i-Pad instead. So now they’re just on devices, or watch TV.”
The Quest for Productivity At All Costs
Scattered art supplies, multiple screens, dining tables turned into work hubs, the chaotic pantomime of half-dressed kids running around throwing their toys across the room, while a harried mum furrows her brow and tries to answer an email; the dad is in another room, trying to remain professional during a work call on Zoom.
This is emblematic of life in lockdown.
Everyone is adjusting. As the second week of HBL and WFH ends, and another begins again, people have begun finding a workable rhythm, however faltering, and they’re doing what they can. Many recognise that all of a sudden, they have more time—however chaotic and jam packed that time is—with their children.
For Mrs. Wong, 40, who works in the corporate sector has three children aged 5 to 11, that’s been the singular silver lining.
“It’s been a tough, rough start … and unfortunately my workload is the same, and at times heavier depending on the situation. But we’re getting the hang of things and we’re becoming more organised with their schedules. It has given us more time to bond with the kids, and to teach them things beyond what they learn in school. Though tough, we’re loving every minute of it. Until they turn into monsters!”
Mrs. Leong echoes the sentiment. “I do treasure this one month where we have no outside commitments and all the time to huddle and bond as a family.”
Nonetheless, themes have emerged.
First, HBL and its impact: both parents (largely mums) and children have had very little time to adapt to HBL. It was trial-run briefly for a day before being rolled out overnight. From Google Meet, Zoom, to the Student Learning System, MOE Parents Gateway and more, the assumption seems to be that it’s easy to toggle between multiple portals and applications.
Berna, 40, a stay-at-home mum who has been going back and forth between facilitating activities for her two daughters, tells me she has tried to make it all as fun as possible, but worries that MOE isn’t aware of how difficult it is for the children and mums.

“They’re at different levels, which means we’re on different timetables, using different modes of learning. I have a primary school kid and a preschooler (K2). There are also a lot of distractions from one to the other. There are different educational videos, Zoom times, and all of these activities take place in the same space (living room/dining area) that is now considered a class area.”

There has also been a woeful lack of preparedness to equip families with the tools (laptops, smartphones, i-Pads) to manage multiple children at different levels of learning.
If the pandemic has revealed one thing in this regard, it’s that we’ve got some way to go to achieve digital literacy and close the digital divide across all segments of society.
Second, I didn’t get any responses from working mothers telling me that their workload had been reduced. If they’re freelancers, they’ve simply cut back taking on work. If they run their own business, they’ve put things on hold (with all of the risks that entails).
And pointedly, their husbands or partners are working as hard, if not harder than before the lockdown. The juggle has become overwhelming for families.

Every mum I spoke to said that with all of the chores, the management of the learning platforms, free play, and time with family, they now get time to themselves only at night. If I read between the lines, I can see a hint of the maddening anxiety to keep going.
Nithya shares this with me during one conversation. “I’m not even going to get into what it’s doing to my mental health—without or with kids. That’s been my response to the pandemic. I’m anxious, and that anxiety has more to do with crumbling social institutions than the health scare. In the midst of this, why is Singapore still insisting on such high levels of productivity?”
And finally, there are the children themselves. They too, have had to transition into a whole new pedagogical reality, but their workload hasn’t necessarily been reduced while they get used to life during a pandemic.
“My daughter’s teacher called on Monday and I talked about the workload. She feels for her students but said MOE wants these standards to be met regardless. Teachers are trying to explain how challenging it is for lower primary children to engage in online learning, as well as meeting the timelines of assignments, but MOE wouldn’t budge,” Berna adds.
So, here’s what I wonder: are institutions (workplaces and schools) really expecting parents to perform at optimal levels? Are we still in a state of denial about the fact that our idea of what constitutes “productivity” needs to be radically altered during this lockdown (and possibly thereafter)? Because we cannot possibly be expected to continue carrying the mental load, in a new form.

So the time for metaphors is over. If we have to keep calling it a “circuit breaker”, then mothers everywhere will extend the metaphor and retort: “Our fuses have blown, and we’re breaking your circuit next.”
I jest. But for many women and their families, humour has become acerbic of-late, even as they find ways to remain optimistic and rise to the occasion during this crisis.
What families need right now are institutions which demonstrate empathy and patience, as they adjust to this new reality; not metaphors that remind them of their children’s school assignments.

How We Can Help Flatten The Curve Amongst The Migrant Worker Community",Vinita Ramani,TRUE,TRUE
Finding Joy In Bars And Nightclubs A Year On Since The Pandemic,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-finding-joy-bars-and-nightclubs-since-the-pandemic/,28-Apr-21,"Photography by Zachary Tang and Ilyas Sholihyn.
“As much as we’ve loved drinking in our undies while watching exotic Americans feud over exotic animals, there’s only so much a person can take before wanting to return to actual bars,” my editor recalled about boozy nights at home during the circuit breaker.
“You can try, but you can’t replicate freshly-poured pints, bar food—quality doesn’t matter, you just want something to munch on—and some communal merrymaking at home.”
I, on the other hand, identify as an 80-year-old homebody. To put things into perspective: I’ve never been to a club. I don’t drink either. Still, I was determined to discover the appeal of nightlife get-togethers. What’s the big fuss? Is a boozy night out really that enjoyable? Even in these times?
Zouk 2.0
Out with the club lounge, in with the pop-up restaurant. This is clubbing in 2021.
Long gone are the crowded dance floors of Zouk, though a sliver of normalcy remains in the form of bright, psychedelic lights and EDM bangers. The club is still alive and kickin’, albeit as a different place.
In a drastic turn of events, Zouk is now synonymous with three things: spin classes, film screenings, and restaurant fare. Like many other nightlife hotspots, it was forced to reinvent and adapt.
When night falls, Zouk is now more dinner spot than rave central. Tablecloths and silver cutlery in lieu of drunk, twerking youth.
At one table, diners polished off buckets of beer and bottles of liquor. At another, others inhaled fries and burgers. It felt like a typical gathering of hungry friends, except that people don’t usually dine under such flashy conditions.
I could’ve never imagined myself in a club, and yet there I was, amidst the spirited atmosphere. Patrons looked cheery; their mood jolly as they let loose on a Friday night.
Wayne Lee, General Manager of Zouk Singapore
“During the Circuit Breaker, all I felt was worry. Worry for the business, and for the staff. Ultimately, I’ve learned that no idea is a bad idea,” shared Wayne Lee, General Manager of Zouk Singapore.
People need to unwind, after all. Based on what I was hearing from him, drinks like Martell, for instance, have been their top-selling brandy especially among female party goers and younger folks.
“The impact has really been great. People were feeling sian. Once, we even thought of turning the space into a supermarket.”
These changes were tough for a manager like Wayne, but it certainly wasn’t a walk in the park for staff under him either.
Exe, a Zouk employee of 10 years, recalled having to attend classes with co-workers to learn the basics of running a restaurant; from table set-ups to food handling.
“There was no choice. We had to pivot and learn new skills.”
Team Zouk Singapore
The club now operates on an earlier schedule, forcing a major body clock reset for staff members, most of whom are seasoned night owls. With alcohol strictly prohibited from 10.30PM, tables are cleared of drinks even before then, regardless if they’re emptied.
Before the pandemic, the club easily drew in close to 2,500 people on a good weekend night. The place might still be buzzing with close to 150 people now, but that’s a huge drop from before.
The question of when to reopen is a complex one for clubs like Zouk. Their main draw, at the end of the day, lies on the dance floor, where people interact in close proximity.
In the meantime, the club strives to preserve the celebratory, feel-good vibes that define Zouk. Tough as that may be, they’re doing so by partnering with long-standing brands like Martell.
To 开 (kāi) means to open—it’s also a word commonly heard (or yelled) in drinking holes around Singapore. And 开 (kāi) Martell is a fun roulette. Each purchase of the Martell VSOP bottle now comes with sure-win rewards. We’re talking prizes like iPhones, AirPods and hotel staycations easily redeemable by peeling a sticker and scanning a QR code. Either way, you still get to imbibe a whole bottle of cognac.
“Serious ah, staycations!? Not bad leh!” a colleague yelled; enthusiastically, as I was explaining the campaign mechanics. She then proceeded to inspect the bottle like its newfound treasure.
When you 开 (kāi) Martell, that essentially means opening rewards. That’s certainly one way to inject joy back into the nightlife scene.
“Obviously, we’re not out of the woods yet,” Wayne cautions. “But a campaign like this helps in getting people together to form memories. At least until nightlife reverts to normal.”
In the midst of the club’s radiant lights and catchy tunes, we met Chris. Face flushed, the gregarious man introduced himself as one of Zouk’s regulars.
“It’s my brother’s birthday today, so we’re here to celebrate. We’ve got cognac, sake, beer!”
I wonder how much of his friendliness was influenced by alcohol. We may have just met, but it felt like I’ve already known Chris for ages.
“WHAT!?” I was struggling to hear him.
He repeated himself, gesturing wildly as we went along.
“Alamak, I tell you! Last year, I really felt like a prisoner of Covid-19. I was one of the first to come when Zouk reopened. The vibe here is unlike many places lah. I love how we can have fun but still feel safe.”
As the night progressed, we met another of Zouk’s patrons, Remy. Like Chris, he was there for a birthday celebration. “It’s really nice to get together with friends again,” he says, with a note of relief.
“This human contact is what keeps us going. People are yearning for their community, even if it’s in limited capacity.”
At one point, a birthday song erupted from a far corner. Fuelled by good spirits (in more ways than one), everyone joined in hushed tones. I couldn’t help but hum along.
Kaypoh-ing KPO
Covid-19 has similarly clobbered KPO — a rustic bar nestled at the heart of Orchard Road. It’s right next to Orchard Central, one that somehow always has supercars parked out front.
Zulkifli (or Zul), KPO’s Outlet Manager, recalled shutting their doors during Circuit Breaker last year.
“We’ve grown to be a comfort spot for many who come to catch up with loved ones. When we closed, people started to experience cabin fever.”
To stay afloat, KPO turned to online deliveries during the lockdown. But even that came with its own set of challenges. Alcoholic drinks have always been their main source of revenue and they were struggling to compete against retail prices.
The bar experience is impossible to replicate online, even through Zoom.
“That’s because we don’t just sell food and alcohol. We’re also selling positivity and good vibes!”
Team KPO
Being the Outlet Manager, Zul took it upon himself to reassure the team, making sure to check in on their state of mind occasionally. Having worked at the establishment for 7 years, he views colleagues and pub regulars as family.
“I try to always ask them: Are you okay? Do you need help? It was a tough time for everyone at that point.”
It was relatively tranquil at KPO during our chat in the day. After sunset, it was a different beast, what with its pop remixes and warm lighting.
By 7PM, it was already at full capacity. Plenty of cars were parked outside, with valets on standby. Two security staff stood alert at the entrance, ready to record temperatures and sort out unruly patrons.
Temperature checks, masked waiters, shorter operating hours and fewer tables—these make the new normal.
On an average Wednesday or Friday night in the days before Covid, KPO would be jam-packed on the inside, with everyone brushing shoulders just to move from one spot to the other.
“It could take some time and effort just to weave through the crowd. Those were the best nights—no special themes or activities. Just drinks, people and music,” shared Sam, the bar owner.
These hallmarks of a night out feel like relics of the past; before social distancing was even a thing. Thankfully, things are picking up.
#TGIF
Trails of laughter, the clinking of bottles and waft of food permeated the place. You’d easily spot groups of friends, couples and colleagues chilling and having a great time.
At this juncture, Zul is more than thankful for the outpouring of support from regulars who have returned to soak in the familiar atmosphere.
“We may not be back to normal yet, but many still come to eat or pop a drink or two. It’s as close as they can get to feeling good; something we all need in these times.”
The nightlife industry still has little idea on what the future entails—and whether patrons would ever feel comfortable dancing shoulder-to-shoulder again.
I do see why parties matter. It’s in these shared moments of emotional highs that people get to bond and feel belonged. Having some cognac and the chance to win some prizes certainly helps too.
Looking ahead, the managers of Zouk and KPO expressed anxiety and pain over seeing industry counterparts calling it quits. But underneath their worries, hope persists.
Even after an arduous year, the mission remains: spread good vibes to anyone who steps through.
The 开 (kāi) Martell campaign aims to reward Martell customers for every single purchase. It seeks to inject some much-needed feel-good around Singapore.
During the run of the campaign, each bottle of Martell VSOP Luminous Limited Edition Cognac purchased from 50 participating outlets across Singapore will come with a 开 (kāi) Martell sticker, which can be peeled off to reveal a unique code.
Every purchase also automatically enters you into the Standout Swift Grand Lucky Draw, where you stand to walk away with the Standout Swift package worth $10,000, inclusive of a Martell-tailored 3D2N stay at W Singapore.
Now, when you 开 (kāi) Martell, you open instant, sure-win rewards, celebrations, and all-round good times.
The campaign ends on the 30th of June, 2021.
*Sure-win rewards include iPhones, iPads, AirPods, Spa vouchers, Martell goodies (Martell-themed skateboard, Martell x Tobyato denim jacket), dining vouchers and even a W Hotel Staycation.

Locked In A Transparent Cage: The Lives Of The Autistic In Singapore’s Lockdown,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-ricexdialogic-transparent-cage-lives-autistic-singapores-lockdown/,21-Jul-20,"This is a Shortlisted entry in the Rice Media x DLS Op-Ed competition.

Decked out in a red t-shirt, blue shorts, and crocs, my brother sits squarely at the porch waiting for his school bus. For most people, the process of getting ready in the morning is usually never a pleasure. For my brother, it is a crusade against every imperfection in the world. Sure, some of us may cringe when others improperly squeeze toothpaste, but this simple action will aggravate my brother as if it is a violation of his very being. He would need to restart his entire morning bathroom routine with the slightest deviation or interruption.
Reading this, you may think that my brother is a kindergartener. He’s actually thirty-years-old.
My family child psychologist diagnosed my brother with mid-spectrum autism when he was three-years-old. My parents only began to suspect his condition after his delayed language development and lacking social skills became evident. Since young, I have known that it would be challenging to develop an emotional bond with my brother; for the autistic, most social and environmental cues are utterly incomprehensible. But despite such great emotional barriers, his behavioural changes during lockdown were hard not to notice.
The circuit breaker had strained my brother, Christopher’s, already fragile sense of stability in his daily routine. His behavioural therapy and walks in the neighbourhood park were cancelled. The pandemic resulted in the temporary closure of special education schools and services such as psychotherapy. Anxious, my brother had clapped his hands repetitively and became increasingly uncommunicative during quarantine.
Though I could see his distress, I could not comprehend his exact needs. Growing up, I took up an interest in learning about developmental psychology in an attempt to understand his behaviour. But with the maturity of living with Christopher for seventeen years, I realise that that knowledge would not translate into a clear understanding of his subjective experience.
The cacophony of his shouting and fits prompted me to wonder about autistic people’s experiences and issues during lockdown. For those who rely heavily on certain prescribed medications and professional support for autism, the lack of access to healthcare services posed a problem. According to Joshua Gordon’s article Coping for Coronavirus: Support for the Autism Community, parents of autistic children and adults recommended for quarantined autistic individuals to attend online therapy sessions; this would act as an outlet for effective communication, helping them keep their emotions in check.
And the pandemic has not only affected autistic people – their caregivers find themselves struggling to juggle daily responsibilities and caring for their autistic relatives around the clock. It doesn’t help that some autistic people may not want to carry out new actions required of them, such as wearing a mask.
A fierce duality arises when it comes to caregivers’ autistic kin – while most parents show extreme love, care, and devotion to their child, being a 24/7 primary caregiver is an insurmountable burden. Being paired with emotional toddlers their whole lives is undoubtedly draining as they have their own affairs to manage. Caregivers would normally focus on themselves when their autistic kin attend school or work – however, the pandemic has deprived them of this personal time.
Unfortunately, the shift towards a greater reliance on digital communication during quarantine more often than not fails to benefit autistic people. The underlying inequality presents a huge gap when addressing coping strategies for the autistic community. With autistic people being excluded from virtual benefits, this means that educational resources distributed to uplift the autistic community, such as technological devices, are sorely lacking.
There is also insufficient teaching of autistic people on how to make use of technological devices to compensate for their unfulfilled social interactions. My brother, like his schoolmates, had simply experienced a school closure with no amends to this heavily disrupted routine. Occasional phone calls from teachers and words of assurance such as ‘school will be opening soon’ were not enough. In Singapore, policies like SkillsFuture and schemes like the Workfare Training Support Scheme operate on the neoliberal assumption that Singaporeans must reskill to remain competitive. The move towards digitisation not only exacerbates inequality, but inequitable policies obfuscate the issue with a veneer of assurance that governments have been remedying the issue.
The digital revolution is undeniably relevant to the autistic community; yet, it is often overlooked. It may seem that home-based learning (HBL) would be a welcomed change to autistic people as it provides an escape from the exhaustion of face to face interaction, but the human touch is still indispensable. Although it is a stereotype that autistic people prefer to avoid communicating with others completely, they, like the rest of us, still need a level of intimacy at the very least. Teaching greater ICT skills to autistic children and adults would give them the chance to resume their daily routines virtually. While autistic individuals often need face to face interaction, external stimuli, such as the sounds and commotion of a structured environment like a classroom, can often lead to sensory overload. HBL therefore offers an innovative opportunity to toggle classroom and online engagement based on the individual’s changing social needs. They will have greater chances of attending classes and earning a living through working from home. Medical appointments can continue and apps that promote fitness can act as partial substitutes for outdoor activities. Studies have shown that autistic individuals are especially well-versed at repetitive tasks like coding and in fields such as software engineering or computer programming, which require little social interaction.
Capitalising on technology would allow caregivers to focus their attention elsewhere. Working from home will also be less of a distraction as their autistic relative will be more preoccupied with their own devices. Virtual caregiver circles can be set up with host volunteers – who are well versed in communicating with autistic children and adults – giving advice and resources to get through the pandemic. They can also be 24/7 sources of outreach when autistic people wish to communicate and their caregiver is busy.
Unfortunately, the lack of opportunities for autistic people to upgrade their ICT skills only accompanies the problems of current measures aimed to help the community during these uncertain times. Current schools and schemes tend to only benefit high-functioning autistic individuals and caregivers; for example, schemes intended to uplift mainly target caregivers and their autistic kin, such as the Enabling Guide by SG Enable and educational resource packages sponsored by movements such as Superhero Me. Several schools, including Pathlight, rejected my brother for “not having a high enough IQ”. Not to mention, the already small pool of employment accessible to autistic adults has further shrunk during the COVID-19 pandemic.
Therefore, the government should roll out relief funding in order to specifically uplift these disadvantaged Singaporeans. Initiatives could include monthly pay outs with low eligibility criteria for autistic adults. Such pay outs should be available beyond the circuit breaker period in order to allow a safety net of financial support. Now reopened schools and workplaces should also provide ICT training to autistic people. Complementing this measure would be the creation of care packages to specifically target autistic adults and include mobile devices, in addition, to merely necessities such as food.
Even in a society that invests in socially integrating the marginalised, we still overlook certain groups within the marginalised. Autistic adults are one such example. The issue lies in the fact that Singaporeans are still, on the whole, unaware of the extensive impact of autism. Autistic individuals often also look indistinguishable from neurotypicals. Overlooking the real impact of autism has led to measures that tend to cater to more familiar demographics and not so much the population of autistic adults.
Additionally, due to public ignorance, we neglect distress derived by autistic people from the confinement of quarantine. The transparent cage that autistic people find themselves in is one people tend not to recognise, making autistic voices go unheard and unacted upon. Everyone expects others to abide by strict codes of social responsibility, but what most of us fail to grasp is that people who do not follow these codes are not necessarily dismissing the importance of the greater good. Even with unimaginable amounts of empathy directed towards them, we treat autistic people more as objects than as humans – objects we need to manage, things to be kept in control. Rarely do people offer the warmth of understanding that lends effort into treating the autistic as legitimate individuals. With the COVID-19 crisis, people deny the autistic community this fundamental reprieve by chastising autistic people for socially inconsiderate behaviours, such as refusing to wear a mask.
I can’t help but worry about what the world has to offer my brother. As a Singaporean, I was born and bred in line with Singapore’s mantra of economic growth and innovation. Stuck in lockdown with my brother, I’ve come to realise how easy it is to gloss over the vast inequities that continue to persist. I may not be a psychologist, but I can still try to understand my brother’s needs.

Looking To Donate Your Solidarity Payout? Consider These Lesser Known Initiatives,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-donate-solidarity-payout-consider-these-lesser-known-initiatives/,16-Apr-20,"Top image: Zachary Tang / RICE File Photo
Over the past few days, Singaporeans above 21 have been receiving S$600 from the government as part of the solidarity fund—and many will continue to do so in the coming weeks.
For many, this is a great relief. People who have lost their jobs or are facing pay cuts (and have families to support) will need this more than ever. Others, however, might be lucky enough not to need this money; they may still have their jobs, with little changed in their lives except that they now work from home.
If that is the case for you, you could consider donating your solidarity fund—or a portion of it—to someone who needs it more.
In the past few days, there have been hundreds of individuals doing so to various initiatives in the country. This comes after multiple charities and ministers called for Singaporeans who are financially stable to donate their payouts to help vulnerable groups suffering during the current economic downturn.
If you are considering donating your solidarity fund, here is a round-up of initiatives you could look into:
Beyond’s COVID-19 Family Assistance Fund
Beyond Social Services is a charity that supports young people and children from less privileged backgrounds. By guiding them with care, resources, and education, the group helps them break out of the poverty cycle. Living in rental housing areas, the individuals they help have been hardly hit by the coronavirus outbreak. Many have lost their jobs or had their income drastically reduced.
To ensure they continue to have access to basic goods, food and basic financial assistance, donate to Beyond’s Beyond’s COVID-19 Family Assistance Fund here.
We’ve also previously written about Beyond Social Services here and here.
Hagar SG COVID19 Global Emergency Response
Hagar is an international organisation that helps vulnerable individuals and migrant workers who faced slavery, abuse or human trafficking. In Singapore, Hagar helps migrant workers access safe accommodation, healthcare, legal support and education, to help them reintegrate into society.
With the Covid-19 outbreak, individuals who have been subject to slavery and abuse are struggling to cope psychologically, and financially—as many have lost their jobs, or have been infected themselves.
Donate to Hagar to help migrant workers and abused individuals here.
Boys Town
Boys Town was founded in 1948 as a home for war-torn orphans, helping to educate them and integrate them in society. Today, they provide a wide array of services for children and young people, including providing residential shelter, fostering, therapy and clinical intervention. Currently, they work with almost 1,500 children and young people every year.
Many of the individuals they support have faced abuse, come from financially disadvantaged families, or don’t have families at all. Boys Town will continue to support them during the coronavirus outbreak and ensure their needs are met.
Donate to Boys Town here.
Laptops and broadband for underprivileged children by Children Wishing Well
Children’ Wishing Well is a non-profit organisation and charity that was founded in 2002 to help children and youth from low-income families.
Now that home-based learning has become compulsory, young people across the country need access to computers and broadband to learn. However, many who are underprivileged struggle to get these essentials.
To help all children get access to laptops, broadband access and safe learning environments, donate to Children’s Wishing Well here.
Our Babies Need Milk & Diapers by SSVP
SSVP Ltf is affiliated to the Society of St Vincent de Paul (SSVP) Singapore, a Catholic organisation that helps vulnerable families and people in need. They currently support 200 underprivileged families with babies, providing them with milk and diapers.
To fund the program, SSVP runs charity events—which have now all been cancelled. Their current reserves will only bring them to June or July, and if the babies they support are not adequately nourished after that, it could be potentially dangerous to their lives.
To help the babies SSVP supports have access to milk and diapers, donate here.
Singapore Association of Motion Picture Professionals Relief Fund (SAMPP)
The film and theatre industry heavily relies on live productions, events and performances for an income. With all of that being cancelled due to the Covid-19 outbreak, many artists and creative professionals have no source of income. To help, SAMPP is creating a relief fund that will help their members who lost their jobs or are struggling to get by.
Specifically, SAMPP will help those who are struggling to pay for their daily needs—like food and housing. They will also focus on those facing the burden of medical costs, or who have family members who lost their jobs.
Donate to SAMPP’s Covid-19 relief fund here.
SISTIC Roundup of initiatives to help local art groups
To support other local arts groups that are struggling to survive, SISTIC has compiled a list of initiatives you can donate to.
Shelters For Abused Women
Now that all families are forced to stay at home, women and children in abusive households are especially vulnerable. In fact, AWARE”s Women’s Helpline and Sexual Assault Care Centre has reported a 35% increase in calls.
Donate to AWARE here. Or to support other organisations that provide shelters for women and children facing abuse, donate to SCWO and Casa Raudha.
Alternatively, you can buy a photographic print from Giving Prints Sg, who will be donating all proceeds to the Humanitarian Organisation for Migration Economics (HOME), who supports migrant workers.
You can also donate to this Give Asia fund, that makes it easier to split up your donation amount between 5 organisations including AWARE and HOME—or lets you donate the full amount to a charity of your choice.
It’s also important to note that while the groups listed above are particularly vulnerable during this outbreak, there are still organisations that run off of donations all year round. For example, the WWF and ACRES work hard to preserve and protect our wildlife and animals, and without constant support, would struggle to keep their activities running. Others include Willing Hearts— who continue to provide food daily to those who need it, and the Samaritans of Singapore—who provide support to those who are suicidal.
Please continue to donate to your favourite charities.

No More Coffee Shops, How? Elderly Singaporeans Tell Us",Edoardo Liotta,TRUE,TRUE
"Singaporean Youths and the New Normal: Pre-, During- and Post-Circuit Breaker",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-singaporean-youths-new-normal-post-circuit-breaker/,29-May-20,"Image credit: Aki Tolentino on Unsplash
With Singapore’s Circuit Breaker (CB) set to end on June 1, Singaporean youths are taking things in stride, staying strong and safe at home, while gradually adapting to the ‘new normal’.
Contrary to what we’ve seen in the news, the majority of youth have been supportive of the CB measures, sharing their activities on social media and finding ways to keep busy (Zoom calls, HouseParty app and what not). A recent poll conducted by the National Youth Council revealed that 89% of youths are concerned about COVID-19 and most of them are willing to be responsible and play their part to stay home for Singapore.
A few have stepped up to start their own projects, such as The Happiness Initiative, which posts “happiness” articles every week (similar to what John Krasinki did for SGN). It also organises Netflix parties with post-show chit-chat sessions on Google Meet, all in the name of helping everyone cope and engage.

Another initiative, Advisory, a youth-led non-profit, is an online mentorship programme which match-makes anxious and graduating students, with industry mentors on career prospects and interests. There’s also the series of resource videos from My Working Title, co-founded by Jael Chng which is a company and movement that inspires and empowers people to actively design their own careers.
It’s clear that there’s no shortfall in youth-led engagement opportunities for youths staying safe at home. So we ask a few Singaporean youths how they are gradually adjusting to the ‘new normal’. With CB about to end, how will they take these experiences and prepare to return to school or work?
For Jorden, the CB itself marked sort of a milestone in his life. He’d recently celebrated his 30th birthday at home; probably a once-in-a-lifetime affair.
“This was a whole new experience for me. I think quite a few people can relate to it, especially when you’re turning 30, but not many will have the badge of ‘I celebrated my 30th birthday during CB’.”
For many youths celebrating their milestone birthdays during CB, it means sacrificing get-togethers, dinners and presents. For Jorden, it meant re-evaluating the past thirty years of his life and the next phase of his adulthood, knowing friends and family are far more critical to help him get through this period more than ever.
“I got a case of beer and cake for it though,” he said, noting that celebrating his birthday online was a unique experience. Perhaps this could be a positive trend moving forward, especially with care packages and Zoom parties changing the traditional notion of physical celebration and making it easier for more people to join in.
Jorden (top right) and his friends have gone from meeting at a bar to toasting drinks online virtually. “The only downside to this is we can’t slap each other when one of us says something stupid.” Image credit: Jorden
Jorden works in corporate video production and laments the loss of inspiration as one of the drawbacks of staying home during the CB.
“I long to see outdoor traffic, feel the vibes of a place or smell the area. I find it hard to think of videos to create or stories to tell, because these days, I wake up, go on Zoom meetings and then, I am stuck on my chair for the whole day. So, to cope with the routine, I inject some home exercises in-between meetings, read a book or do some cooking.”
Jorden spends time working on his own personal YouTube channel at home. Since he’s also doing corporate videos for work, it’s a great way to stay fresh and up-to-date when he returns to the workplace after CB. Image credit: Jorden
Jorden also found the works behind Creative Nation’s Cr8studiosg interesting. It hires youth freelancers by giving them a platform to create content, which they can then share with others—a prospect he’s already doing in his free time and is open to exploring.
Another Singaporean youth, Jane Tan, 28, fancies herself as more of a stay-at-home person, so the impact of the CB hasn’t been as devastating as what many would paint it out to be. Working as a customer retention marketer at an insurance company, she had to commute for two hours daily between her home in Jurong and her office in the CBD prior to CB.
“I don’t need to commute to the office now. That’s an extra two hours of time saved right there. I’m using the time and energy for mealtime conversations with my parents, and we’re bonding better as a family. With everyone working from home, including my dad, we are able to finally have lunches and dinners together—no appointments needed.
“Also, my partner has recently gotten me hooked on a mobile game app called Gartic. It’s an online game where you guess words with your friend’s drawings. We spent hours playing over the phone after our work hours. It’s a great bonding game.”
Jane spends much of her time at home playing a Pictionary-like game on Gartic with her friends. Image credit: Jane Tan
Another youth who’s determined to innovate is Glenn Wong, 33, a full-time realtor and part-time client lead in an ad agency. He understands the need to stay home. “Complying with safe distancing rules during CB is good for everyone. We do not endanger others and our own lives. I appreciate the government’s efforts and framework put in place to make it possible for everyone to appreciate the importance of doing so.”
During CB, he guides his potential property clients to attend virtual seminars remotely with him. This is in preparation for upcoming house viewings, dos and don’ts, and things prospects need to know. For Glenn, this additional step helps him mentally prepare himself prior to meeting his customers face-to-face once CB ends. It is also a way for him to continuously engage them, especially if they are interested in a particular sale.

Sherlyn (not her real name), 29, an accountant, relishes the day when she can resume her dinner dates with friends after work or over weekends. With CB now, she’s mostly stuck at home while her husband, who works for the Air Force and is posted to Australia, video calls her every day.
“Besides my husband’s video calls, my cats entertain me quite a bit at home. When my sister and mum, who work in essential services, return from work and I “knock-off” from e-work, my family will have dinner together, so it’s quite fulfilling.”
When she’s not video-calling her husband who’s overseas, spending time with her family or e-working, Sherlyn finds entertainment from her pet cats. Image credit: Sherlyn
Sherlyn and her family just put their home through a massive spring cleaning. Having gone through what they’d always thought was just mess and clutter, they discovered things from their childhood, bringing back many fond memories.
She was amazed by the mementos her parents and older siblings had held on to—real throwbacks to the past.
As her father was recently hospitalised due to a minor stroke and currently undergoes rehabilitation therapy, the spring-clean is also a way to make space for him and his wheelchair when he returns.
“The upside to all this is that my aged parents are learning to video call one another more frequently and we spend more time cooking, eating together, which rarely happens before CB.”
The thing about CB is that there are opportunities to extend one’s passion for something with others as well through digital means. Youth Corps Singapore for example, has recently launched Virtual Red Box. It’s an online platform for youths to share skills and hobbies with their peers and encourage them to contribute positively to the community. These skills can be carried forward into the ‘new normal’ even after the end of CB.
One Youth Corps Leader, Owen Tan, even raised funds via social media to buy food like chicken briyani to be distributed to seniors of Thong Teck Home (as they weren’t able to step out). He’s set aside S$600 of his Solidarity Payment and pooled donations to support residents and healthcare workers staying in these homes by buying and arranging for delivery of hawker food to keep their spirits up.
Considering we’re almost at the tail-end of CB, what are youths looking forward to next? Would staying home for the past months make them appreciate this freedom even more and not take it for granted?
Sherlyn remains pensive and optimistic. “I hope family members who were not close before, or didn’t have many opportunities before to communicate, find the chance to mend bridges and rebuild the family bond during this period,” Sherlyn says.
After CB, I’m sure I will have to make adjustments and down time to get back to my old routine. But I believe I will be able to adapt quickly since this is what we’ve all been doing for years.
Jorden too foresees himself honing a closer connection with his family even after the CB period.
“While I’ve always had a deep connection with my parents, CB has made us spend more time indoors. This in turn helped us see our flaws a lot more. There’s a lot of nagging for sure. I sometimes nag at my parents to eat their lunch after I’m done cooking, or they nag at me and my sibling to wash the dishes. Even if it’s nagging, we’re communicating far more than usual!”
“As a realtor, I am really looking forward to taking my clients to the showrooms,” Glenn tells me.
“There is a lot of pent-up demand and great deals waiting. But I think I will need to adjust my sleeping patterns when CB ends. Might be a little tough but I’ll take it slowly. Commuting to work may need some adjusting for sure.”
Jane is more introspective. She quoted a repost by a Facebook friend: “This is a pandemic. Not a productivity contest.”
“While social media has given people a huge push into thinking that we should be more productive and focused than ever, such as slotting in a yoga session every morning, or learn how to make a new cake every week, it can be overwhelming,” she said.
Jane acknowledged that it is encouraging to see others trying their best to make meaningful use of their time. “Take things in your own way and time. We are all trying our best to get through it.”

To help adjust herself to the future situation, Jane has found some resources useful, especially the ones on personal finance. “I’m actually interested to hear from Seedly.sg on how to manage my finances, especially when the economy is going through a recession and layoffs are happening as we speak.”
Similarly, Jorden recommends mehgowhere.sg. “The compilation of different useful information there keeps my mind busy. Staying home is important, but a healthy mental well-being is also important. I’m not the kind of person that can sit still for long periods of time, so I’m always pacing around my house or just doing something fruitful.
“A Stronger You(th), for example, focuses on issues that might affect youths like mental health. The site comes with information for all of us to stay connected, tap on career resources and so on. I think it’s very important to prepare for the ‘new normal,’ especially if you’ve graduated, ORD-ed or left your previous jobs.”
Jorden finds the impending return to office after CB bittersweet though. “Heading back to the office means I get to interact with my colleagues, go out for shoots again and use the studio. It’s going to be hard to get back on the routine for sure. Worst case scenario—wake up earlier, go for a morning jog and then, head off for work.”
For youths like Jorden, Jane, Glenn and Sherlyn, the circuit breaker is just the beginning of a new normal, or at least a new way of looking at things (pre-, during and post-CB). Some adjustments will be necessary once it’s over, but they’re more than willing to push themselves, learn new skills, and lean back on the great relationships they’ve built with their parents and siblings. For instance, authentic stories of youths staying strong together are being documented on Dear Covid-19 where youths can share and learn from their collective experiences, empowering them to be the change in the ‘new normal’.
Their positivity and optimism are well-placed, judging from my conversations with them during the CB period. They understand the need to adjust to the future, so that everyone can emerge stronger and more resolute as a society.
Is this a reset for them? For some, probably. The commuting and daily grind may need some adjustments. While the circuit breaker period has made them more inward looking rather than outward, the intrinsic value of the emotional bonds they’ve built with family and friends (at home or through video calls), whether it’s cooking together, getting nagged, or spring-cleaning, have only gotten stronger and made them feel safer.
So together, we can stay strong and safe. It’s one take away Singaporean youths will never forget.
This story is sponsored by the National Youth Council (NYC).
As we’re moving into a ‘new normal’, NYC has dedicated an array of resources to support youths who want to level up further to prepare themselves better.
Head over to MehGoWhere for resources on jobs & the economy, mental well-being, financial literacy as well as ideas to keep you engaged at home
Aspiring content creators can also check out Cr8StudioSG, NYC’s partnership with Creative Nation for job opportunities and mental well-being for freelancers to create content from home.
Other resources include My Working Title’s Career Resilience, Lit.sg’s Virtual Mentorship (FREE!), Seedly.SG’s money management, Bold At Work/Home’s IG Live Classes and Chope and Save gift cards.
NYC in partnership with DSTNCT has also embarked on a nationwide youth memory project, called Dear Covid-19, to share their experiences through user submissions in different formats such as photos, poems, songs and letters to preserve this historic moment in time that the world is going through.
Let’s all do our part to stay strong together and head towards the new normal with confidence.

Why Stardew Valley Is The Perfect Game For A Recession",Terry Ng,TRUE,TRUE
"What Have You Learnt This Year About Dealing With Trauma, Conflict, And Unexpected Loss?",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-sgiff-2020-calm-the-pig-inside-rocketship/,3-Dec-20,"These days, I rarely read the newspaper. Thumbing through the pages inevitably leads to encounters with some sort of brokenness, from forest fires to ongoing wars, overwhelmed medical workers to unthinkable acts of sexual misconduct. If it is not nauseating, it is heartbreaking, or both. Yet, while devastation and loss may seem synonymous merely with 2020, the grim reality is that this tragic undercurrent has existed for a long time. Brokenness has been a familiar experience for all of humanity.
In this year’s Singapore International Film Festival’s lineup, two Southeast Asian short films explore the landscape of tragedy, intimately depicting the psyches of those for whom tragedy has hit close to home, wrecking havoc upon their shores and upending their lives forever. These tales acknowledge the effects of tragedy, wrought by unforeseen circumstances but exacerbated by human incompetency, painting a universal portrait of the resultant wrestling with anguish and pain.
To Calm the Pig Inside is filmmaker Joanna Vasquez Arong’s way of coping with grief in the aftermath of Typhoon Yolanda. Utilitizing a blend of survivor recounts and personal familial narratives, Arong attempts to offset a helplessness in preventing tragedy. How do our memories metamorphosize after tragedy strikes, inevitably dented and wrought with grief? In a bid to answer these questions, this monochromatic lament of loss provides space for the wrestling, for the not yet and the in-between.
Memory is seen to be a comforting solace as we reminisce about our loved ones, yet also appears to be fickle and unreliable as our longings for the departed turn into hallucinations. More tellingly, the breakdown of memory is explored in those who lost their minds after the disaster. For these, memory now exists as a faulty apparatus, a doomed consciousness stuck in time. Arong herself frequently drifts off into nostalgic rumination of her own deceased grandmother, making for the most affecting sequences of the film. Indeed, the cradling of our memories is our way of dealing with loss, a yearning that the outline of those we love would somehow always exist in our faint recollection.
Given as Arong herself volunteered in the wake of the destruction, the narrative recount feels all the more poignant, coated with deep heartache over the senseless suffering of the community. Yet, Arong manages to infuse optimism into the situation, magnifying the spirited backbone of the everyday people as a recourse to eventual recovery. It is ultimately this bitter anguish laced with profuse hope that will stir something in the hearts of viewers.
SGIFF X RICE conducted an interview with filmmaker Joanna Vasquez Arong.
What influenced the weaving of your personal family narrative inside the film?
There were many different ways I could have told this story. Once I finally decided I was going to tell the story from my perspective, it felt natural to draw from my own experience and interweave it with the different stories I had come across during my time in this devastated port city. In order to even come close to trying to comprehend the magnitude of this tragedy, I had to reflect on my own experience on grief and trauma. And how we cope.
And it made me consider how trauma when unresolved, stays on and comes back to haunt us, until we finally come to terms with it. I often think of intergenerational trauma. There are times where I’ve felt I’ve been carrying something bigger than my own personal experience. It makes me think that a person could be carrying the suffering of his or her forefathers, and the same applies to communities, regions, and countries even.
For example, from a larger perspective—although I don´t really explain it in the film—I feel the way the relief efforts were handled by the government was politicized partly because of both a personal and national tragedy that has up to now, never been resolved. The father of our president at the time of the storm, was assassinated in 1983, and this had been blamed on the Marcoses who were in power at the time, and who were then forced to flee. The assassination itself, however, was never resolved.
Tacloban, the devastated port city, is the hometown of our former first lady, Imelda Marcos, where the family still carries significant support. And the president, the son of the slain senator, never bothered to properly pass through the city, despite the staggering human loss.
How did you come across the child drawings of the typhoon? I noticed that they were also the only colored elements in the black and white film. What influenced that decision?
When I first started spending time in Tacloban, strangers, mothers, started coming up to me, telling me the stories of their children and how they hoped to find some therapy for them, as they were so traumatized from the storm. Even some slight rain or wind would cause them to go into a panic. Locals also started telling me about the many orphans who were left behind when their parents were taken during the storm.
This inspired me to start a scholarship initiative, Eskwela Haiyan, feeling that perhaps we could find a way to make life a little bit easier for some of these traumatized children. That maybe a few of these students might perhaps have at least one positive association from the storm. The process of finding children to support, who were most affected by the typhoon in different schools, allowed me to hear more of their stories first hand, both from the students and teachers alike.
When I first met with the students, instead of asking them about their experience, I asked their teachers if the students could draw what they had experienced instead. And some of the students voluntarily explained their drawings to me.
As I listened to their heartbreaking stories, the memories and trauma felt very much alive as they recounted their stories, and that’s how I thought it best to keep the drawings in color. It was also a way of emphasizing who the victims are, in these tragedies. I have quite a few of these drawings with me. One day we hope to hold an exhibition of them.
Memory comes across strongly in this short film. Memory can be nostalgic, but also traumatising. What were your thoughts on preserving the memory of this event in the consciousness of people when making this film?
It’s unfortunate but these recurring natural calamities and the response of the government seems to be consistently contentious. Seven years later, and it feels like the film is more relevant than ever. At the height of the pandemic and lockdown in the Philippines in August, our country has once again been rocked by another controversy with massive fraud exposed by whistleblowers. Systemic irregularities in COVID payments from our public health agency have been uncovered with billions of pesos unaccounted for. And just in the last weeks, our country has been pummeled by three typhoons one after the other, with parts of our country still flooded. And what’s consistent is the politicking of aid again.
I do not consider myself an activist, but I felt compelled to share the human stories I had come across, to share the despair and silent rage brewing. Each time a natural catastrophe takes place, I feel we seem to face two tragedies: first the natural calamity itself, and second, the mishandling and even human exploitation of the disaster, which I feel is even more devastating.
What influenced the anecdote on ghosts in your film? Was thinking about ghosts comforting or haunting?
I have always been drawn to stories of ghosts or spirits, so depending on the situation, it can either be comforting or haunting. And deep down, I must admit, I do want to believe in spirits. I want to believe that my two grandmothers whom I was very close to, are still with me, guiding me somehow, if I listen close enough.
So within that context, I feel that thinking about the ghosts in my film is perhaps more comforting, albeit melancholy. Most of the people who died during this tragedy were taken unexpectedly and so suddenly and violently, that perhaps it’s a way for people to cope with the sudden loss, to feel that their spirits are still amongst them. And it’s perhaps comforting to think that their spirits are lingering on until they are ready to finally leave.
How did the process of reflecting on and documenting this tragedy provide a cathartic release for you?
That’s an interesting question to consider. It may be subtle, but this is the first time where I allude to my own personal story in one of my films, the first time I brought it out to light. And yet the truth is, I’ve always been drawn, perhaps subconsciously, to the darker stories slowly boiling beneath the surface, unaddressed. And in interweaving parts of my own story, it made me reflect on the lingering effects of trauma, and the root of simmering rage.
Everyone probably carries some form of trauma. How do we resolve it? I feel its in getting to the source of the suffering, shedding light on it, acknowledging it, naming it, which I believe is where sharing our stories is important. Storytelling is a tool to make your voice heard, to be seen.
I feel a crucial step in healing is when somebody hears us. Yet, many of these tragic stories from Tacloban were not being heard, not acknowledged even. In relaying the stories I came across, I felt it was a way of shedding light on the suffering, bringing it to the surface, exposing it.
This, in effect, is the essence of the title of our film, To Calm the Pig Inside.
While To Calm The Pig Inside depicts the tragic aftermath of natural disaster, Rocketship deals with a different kind of devastation, one that occurs not on the national front but in the confines of a home.
Childlike longing and naive determination are pit against the harsh realities of marital splits as Samuel, a ten year old reminiscent of Moonrise Kingdom’s own Sam Shakusky in his yellow garb (think yellow cap, yellow wristwatch and yellow backpack), sets on a course of endearing resolve to reconcile his estranged parents during the annual Mid Autumn Festival.
What happens when the burden of care is taken upon by a child? When the tables are flipped between carer and cared for, an emotional yoke is prematurely fastened on tiny shoulders not designed to pull such weight. In Sam, this assumed duty is found in the insistence to safeguard toys and playtime traditions. Play, the cornerstone of an affectionate, nurturing relationship between parent and child, must be maintained at all costs. Indeed, his adamance on toy lanterns and toy rockets is a heartbreaking cry for normalcy as a family unit. Divorce is never explicitly mentioned, but its effects reverberate throughout the film.
Rocketship’s carefully crafted story world exudes old school, vintage vibes, making the film’s visual language a pleasure to absorb. While a hearty attempt to portray the complexities of a child’s inner world, the capturing of nuances could have been better refined. At times, the jerkiness in conversational synergy jolts one out of the story world into a reflexive realisation of staged performances, while editing pauses meant to elicit emotional weight come off as sluggish. In particular, the execution of dialogue still poses a challenge to newly minted Isaac Tan, as rushed emotional beats contribute to overall deadweight. His fresh off the oven performance still deserves applause, however, as the seeming fragility of Samuel is nevertheless conveyed through his forlorn expressions frequently evoked throughout the film.
While the film does not shy away from the realities of a broken marriage, it ultimately does hoist up a glimmer of hope, a raised sparkle crackling in the pitch black night. In its conclusion, this coming of age story presents the reality of dashed dreams as adversities that one must, and ultimately can, overcome.
SGIFF X RICE conducted an interview with filmmaker Mathias Choo.
Was Rocketship a personal story to you? What weight did you place on bringing this story to life?
Yes, to a large extent, Rocketship is a personal story for me. The film was inspired by an event that occurred while I was in my second year of Polytechnic, one which led to my parent’s separation for a couple of months. The entire process taught me the difficult lesson of adapting to and accepting things that are beyond my control, which is something that many others whose parents are or have separated understandably struggle with.
The genesis of the narrative was formed with that in mind. But of course the film evolved and grew into something much more with my team’s input. Everyone has a story to tell; and I am only grateful that I was able to tell mine with the support of people around me.
What was the process of working with a child actor like? How did you attempt to introduce Isaac to the psyche of Samuel and bring out the nuanced emotions needed for his performance?
It was an insightful and rewarding experience working with Isaac. Isaac had no prior acting experience (we street casted him), and so It was necessary to get to know him better before getting him on screen. Through extended conversations and regular meetups, I was able to find connections that I could draw between Isaac’s personality and Samuel’s character.
It was also important that I shared the inspiration behind the film to provide Isaac with a clearer understanding of what we had hoped to achieve. We were, of course, thoroughly impressed by his maturity for his age—he could easily pick up the emotional transitions reflected within our script. Isaac is such a curious individual, constantly asking questions regarding his motivations within the scenes, and also occasionally suggesting interesting choices of his own.
To ease him into the character, I attempted to utilize mostly improvisational techniques so as to allow for the two cast members to really connect with one another. Karen is someone who is sensitive and very self aware. Hence, she was able to get Isaac to open up, and I think this helped in generating a genuine and authentic connection between both casts which then resulted in a realistic presentation of the everyday.
The stylistic elements in this film are reminiscent of a dated time, from the use of aspect ratio to the faded, nostalgic look of the image quality. What influenced this artistic decision?
The main reason was our keen desire to compliment the use of the sparkler rockets, a key motif in our film. The sparkler rocket provides a strong visual representation of a part of my childhood. It is symbolic of Samuel’s aspirations for his parents’ reunion, and the underlying impermanence of events. On that note, it is also intriguing that playing with sparkler rockets is now something that most children in Singapore would not experience. Placing the film in a dated period is most apt.
The blunt and unrelenting character displayed by Sam’s mum came as a surprise., How did you go about crafting this character? Did you consider softening the image of Sam’s mum in the film?
I did initially consider softening Sharon’s character, but through the character developing process, realised that it would present an interesting dynamic to offer opposing reactions to an event – the separation. With Samuel as the anchor in his parents’ marriage, it is an intentional step to portray Sharon as an independent, strong-headed mother, keen to move forward albeit negatively from her experiences. Sharon embodies the struggle to strike a balance between her own desires, while also catering to her son’s emotional needs through the separation.
The architecture of the house provided interesting opportunities to advance the story using the blocking of the actors and camera movement. How much of camera movement was pre planned and how much was inspired by the space? Were there spontaneous moments on set?
Most of our shots had been pre-planned prior to filming with a different apartment in mind. Just weeks before production, however, we were granted access to film in this point block apartment at Mei Ling street. The team was drawn towards the architecture of the house as the layout provided alternatives and opportunities in our visual storytelling.
We did rewrite one scene after being inspired by the set (the scene where Samuel hides the box of sparkler rockets from Sharon), and it would have not been possible if not for the unique architecture of the house.
As for spontaneous moments, one particular event I remember occurred whilst filming the packing scene – I was struggling to bring out the desired performances from the cast. After a few takes, we called for a short break while I attempted to figure out how to adjust their performances. It was then that I noticed Isaac casually interacting with Karen, and cheekily entering the wardrobe to hide himself from her. It was perhaps this playful interaction that was needed, and we attempted the scene again with him trying that for the next take, which was eventually used in the final cut.
Do you think digging into your personal inventory of life experiences will be a mainstay for you? What is a story that you are looking next to tell?
At this point, yes, definitely. I do believe that there is value in tapping into personal experiences as it provides for a lived experience for my viewers. Personal narratives are also an invaluable source of research when attempting to translate preliminary ideas into actual events for a story.
I am drawn towards exploring the notion of growth both in the micro and macro levels. Having had the opportunity to tell a coming-of-age story about a character who struggles to grow, I’m now interested in exploring the other end of the spectrum, of what happens when there’s an exponential excess in growth. I do see this increasingly being reflected with technology and the digital age, and is something that I am currently eager to explore.
Screened as part of SGIFF’s SEA Short Film Competition Programme 3, these images of devastation remind us that loss is ultimately personal. National disaster or family rupture, the grief can be just as colossal. More than numerical figures, it is a son or daughter who is lost during a national disaster, a sibling suddenly snatched, a parent abruptly taken. The splinter of a nation, or of a family, inevitably inflicts harrowing consequences on the individual.
Films, then, provide solace. In the moving image, we see ourselves not as mere individuals, but as part of a larger whole that intimately knows and grapples with grief. It is an expression of mutual understanding, an assurance that we are not alone.

It feels like the social equivalent of the Ice Age. With the Covid-19 outbreak showing no signs of abating, the ordinary rhythms of life are freezing over, and more of us are preparing to hole up at home indefinitely.
As cases continue to rise, more Singaporeans may receive Stay-Home Notices, over and above practicing precautionary social distancing. As former NMP Kuik Shiao-Yin has vividly recounted, all it takes is one encounter with a confirmed case to find yourself staring down your bedroom walls for two weeks, sustained by Netflix, food delivery, and FaceTime sessions.
As painful as this is, it’s unavoidable. In such extraordinary times, social isolation is the responsible thing to do. But for hundreds of thousands of Singaporeans, it will also be disastrous or impossible.
Successfully self-isolating at home takes space, a safe home environment, and a support system to help tide you through. For many Singaporeans, some or all of the three do not exist.
The feasibility of isolation, and the degree of risk it poses to an individual and their family, varies widely depending on one’s circumstances. What might be troublesome but survivable for some will be nightmarish or outright unworkable for others.
And due to the overlap in risk factors—we know, for example, that many low-income individuals are also sick or elderly or both—many vulnerable Singaporeans will be pummelled on multiple fronts.
Let’s start with space. Singapore’s small size has given us advantages in tackling the outbreak, like less porous borders. It also means we have the third-highest population density in the world, just behind Hong Kong and Monaco.
Over 80% of our population lives in flats, often with three generations living under the same roof. To live in this country is to constantly be in each other’s faces. We can’t get away from each other even if we wanted to.
Naturally, this becomes tricky if you have a sick family member who needs to be confined to their own room for two weeks.
According to HDB data, 6.2% of households live in 1- or 2-room HDB flats. That’s hundreds of thousands of people for whom social isolation, even if desired, would be a logistical impossibility.
Let’s say you have five people—Mum, Dad, two children, and Grandma—sharing a two-room flexi flat, which is around 45 square metres and has one bedroom and one bathroom. They sleep shoulder-to-shoulder on a single mattress at night, and share one toilet and shower. (So far, none of this is purely hypothetical; it is the lived reality of thousands of families.)
One afternoon, Dad, the sole breadwinner, gets the dreaded call from MOH Contact Tracing, informing him that he’s been in close contact with a confirmed Covid-19 case.
He will have to remain at home for the next two weeks, because staying anywhere else would put more people at risk. But if he takes up their only bedroom, where is everyone else going to go? And without his salary coming in, what are they going to do?
We know that crises like Covid-19 hit the low-income hardest. You probably already intuited that our hypothetical family falls into this bracket, and you would probably be right. Currently, 11.8% of Singaporeans, at a ‘very conservative’ estimate, are thought to be living in absolute poverty (just under $1,900 for a four-person household).
Low-income individuals are already more likely to work in poorly paid jobs which carry a higher risk of exposure, like cashiers, cleaners, and delivery riders. However, their households also have less access to the resources which make isolation possible and endurable.
If I (touch wood) got the call and had to go into lockdown, it would be scary and inconvenient but not ruinous. Although I live with my parents, I have my own room and bathroom; if my family wanted to take extra precautions, they could afford to book themselves into a hotel for two weeks.
Not so for our hypothetical family, whose living situation, quite literally, cannot accommodate the effects of mandatory isolation.
Beyond Social Services, a local NGO which works with underprivileged families in several neighbourhoods, began calling their clients around a month ago to find out how they had been coping. They found that between worries about pay cuts, business closures, and caregiving, families were already in great distress over the financial strain of Covid-19. For any of them, a Stay-Home Notice could tip them over the edge.
Similarly, home isolation assumes, first and foremost, that your home is a safe place. This is not the case for individuals—overwhelmingly, women and children—who are experiencing family violence.
It’s well established that rates of gender-based violence spike during times of crisis, like wars, natural disasters, and yes, pandemics. In China, domestic violence rates in Hubei apparently tripled this February compared to the previous year, which activists attributed to the city’s lockdown. (The same reason was blamed for a spike in divorce rates in Xi’an, and similar rises are expected elsewhere.)
As a university student, I spent a year volunteering with a domestic violence hotline, taking calls from individuals who had suffered all kinds of horrific abuse. The stories I heard all followed a disturbingly similar pattern. Abusers began with demonstrations of coercion and control—dictating what victims could wear, restricting their social media use—which got progressively harsher, like cutting them off from friends and family.
Advocates, academics, and social workers have noted that family violence is rooted in a desire for power and control—the very things we feel we most lack at a time like this.
At the same time, social distancing means that avenues which would normally provide victims some relief, like going to work or spending time with friends, are fast drying up. More time at home means more time in the company of your abuser.
“Family violence often includes social isolation,” explains Shailey Hingorani, the Head of Research and Advocacy at AWARE. “Abusers can use isolation as a way to control and dominate, which may be made worse by measures such as stay-home notices, because they increase the amount of time spent with the abuser, and because these notices have the unintended consequence of ruling out usual forms of respite, such as going to work, or seeking out community support.”
Locally, there are four family violence shelters funded by MSF, each of which provided temporary refuge to around 240 women and children annually between 2013 to 2015. But with an average stay of around four months, beds in these may not always be readily available, not to mention that this is worst of all possible times to begin living with strangers.
An alternative is to seek refuge with friends or family, but victims might be reluctant to impose on loved ones at this time, particularly those living with elderly parents or young children. Prolonged uncertainty, not to mention the financial pressure brought on by unemployment or disappearing income, may also make it even harder for victims to leave abusive relationships.
To be clear, this is not the same as saying that people will suddenly turn abusive as a result of Covid-19. The pressures of the outbreak, however, correspond to the exact sort of triggers which could create or worsen violent situations. While social isolation might protect people from Covid-19, it may also leave victims more exposed to the dangers at home.
The last thing social isolation assumes is the presence of a support system. The irony of confinement is that you need other people to get through it: loved ones to bring you food, friends who call to check in, and technology to keep you connected and entertained.
Tens of thousands of elderly Singaporeans, especially those who live alone or with their spouses, already lack these resources in ordinary times.
Many are in poor physical health, and are already vulnerable to loneliness, isolation, and other mental health issues. A Covid-19-induced collapse in social contact will hit them particularly hard.
Following the SAFRA Jurong cluster, which was attended by many senior citizens, government agencies stopped all activities for senior citizens to reduce the risk of transmission; the suspension will now continue till April 7th. The People’s Association has estimated that as many as 290,000 participants will be affected by the closures.
Meanwhile, thousands of seniors rely on social service organisations (SSOs) and volunteers to deliver food and groceries, help them run errands, and provide companionship and social support through centre-based activities or befrienders’ visits.
A representative from Lions Befrienders, one such organisation I reached out to, highlighted that switching from social engagement to social distancing is a challenge, especially for those already living alone.
“Many seniors we serve are at risk of social isolation and often look forward to spending their day at the Senior Activity Centres or the home visits by the befrienders,” she continued.
“Due to the current situation, activities have been suspended and home visits are kept to a minimum. As such, seniors find it a struggle to pass the time and may feel increasingly isolated.”
She shared that to keep staff, volunteers, and beneficiaries safe, Lions Befrienders had suspended its centre-based activities since the DORSCON level was raised in February, although its centres have been kept open for urgent drop-ins and for beneficiaries to collect their meals.
Their befriending services have also been converted to weekly phone calls and text message support. Physical home visits are still made to seniors who are uncontactable by phone or assessed as moderate risk and above, but have been cut down to five to 10 minutes, done through the gate.
Make no mistake: social isolation is difficult, depressing, and stressful for everyone. Covid-19 does not discriminate, and nor does loneliness.
All of us, even the most hardened introverts, will hurt from having to be apart precisely when we need each other most, but some groups will find this far more painful and challenging than others.
We already know that Covid-19 will be catastrophic for mental health, between worrying about falling sick, loved ones falling sick, the looming recession, dramatic lifestyle changes, and coping with the prolonged and never-ending volatility. Providers of mental health support services, like the Singapore Counselling Centre (SCC), have already seen an increase in clients seeking assistance since the outbreak began.
In the months to come, the collective carnage of the economic, social, and psychological fallout is going to send a tsunami through the social care sector. Organisations which provide frontline services, including those in the civil service, are going to come under extraordinary pressure as the effects of Covid-19 ripple out in ways we do not yet understand.
Like Lions Befrienders, many organisations are doing their best to work around the limitations imposed by social isolation. The SCC, for example, provides counselling via video conferencing as an option, and Aware has tried to keep up its regular face-to-face services while practicing social distancing and taking some of its sessions online.
As a crisis, Covid-19 is unprecedented, but a common feature of all crises is that they either widen existing faultlines or expose previously hidden ones. You can learn a lot about a society by how it looks after its most vulnerable when shit hits the fan. We might all be bracing for the worst, but no one should be left behind as we prepare to be alone, together.

Is the XMM the New Ah Lian? Or Are They A Different Breed Altogether?",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
The Answer To Singapore’s Problems Is Child Labour,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-the-answer-to-singapores-problems-is-child-labour/,6-Jun-20,"Singapore’s labour policy is at an impasse:
1. Industry associations tell us that Singapore needs cheap labour.
2. The pandemic has caused the cost of labour to increase. (Because housing migrant workers as before poses significant risks to public health and national security, at least for the foreseeable future.
3. The government seems unwilling to accommodate the increased spending on its end.
4. Singaporeans will accept neither increased costs for goods & services, nor higher taxes, nor an increase in the number of foreigners.
How can we continue to enjoy the benefits of cheap labour, without incurring additional risks? How can we foster economic growth in face of such challenges? Such a debate has caused much bitterness on all sides. Luckily, I may have a solution, which I humbly offer here for public consideration. Let Singapore solve its perennial labour woes by legalising child labour from ages four and upwards.
Consider it. The value of child labour is indisputable. In countries with more liberal labour policies, they engage in all sorts of productive economic activity, from the manufacturing of clothing, to the mining of raw materials, to the recycling of used electronics. Many are also usefully employed in the service/tertiary industries. Food vendors and small businesses employ a great number of children to hawk their wares, while K-pop stars often sign contracts before puberty, some as young as 12.
The lack of proper footwear cannot be excused.
Historically, it’s nearly impossible to overstate children’s contributions to the advancement of human society. As any historian of the industrial revolution can tell you, children were no less important to the cotton mills of Lancashire than coal or sheep. The greatest expansion of British industrial capacity took place between the years 1780 – 1835, before the 1833 Factory Act began to restrict their participation in the urban economy. Their value to the textile/mining industries cannot be understated. They could perform the same jobs as adults at a fraction of the cost, but without the risk of labour militancy.
So why do we not allow children to be gainfully employed outside the home in shipyards and factories? I blame our restrictive labour laws, which forbid many forms of useful employment for those below the arbitrary ‘legal working age’. Children above 13 can be employed, but only in non-industrial settings and for a very meagre number of hours per day. You cannot, for example, hire a 9 year-old child to do basic construction work, nor can you make them cut grass or drive heavy vehicles–even though that’s the age when they are the most pliable and most effective. Even tech companies like Linkedin are complicit in restricting access to employment for children. The minimum age to create a Linkedin account is 16.
Iphones need cobalt. Cobalt is mined in the D.R. Congo by children. Congo's economy grew 2.2% whilst ours shrank.
But think of the possibilities if we repeal these laws and allow the free market to dictate our policy towards child labour just as we do with migrant labour. For the age-group between 5 – 9, the population is 176,184. For 10 – 14, the population is 181,471. These 350,000-odd Singaporeans children are nowhere close to the 999,000-plus work permit holders, but still, they represent the largest pool of untapped labour in Singapore right now. Furthermore, children already have spacious accommodation at home and are mostly immune to the most severe effects of covid-19; they thus represent an ideal workforce. If freed to participate more broadly in our economy, it would drastically reduce labour costs for companies, and thus increase our economic competitiveness.
The possibilities are limited only by our imagination. Shipping, microprocessors, construction, the SAF, oil & gas, financial services, hospitality, and even the media could all benefit from such a policy. I cannot speak definitely for other industries, but Singapore’s Media & PR industry would greatly benefit from such deregulation. Surely it does not take an undergraduate to write an angsty Rice Media word salad, nor to copy-paste from r/Singapore, nor to make a list of 10 Best Bubble Tea Shops, nor to blindly sing the PAP’s praises, nor to repost the same attacks on Chee Soon Juan or Kirsten Han that we’ve been reposting since at least 1992. Such ‘journalism’ could just as easily be outsourced to children of 9 or 10. Those in the industry who suggest otherwise are charlatans seeking to protect their own rice bowl at the taxpayer’s expense.
A Natalist Multiplier Effect?

Okay, I know what you are going to say: With Singapore’s already low-fertility rates, will such a policy even be sustainable? The costs of using child labour will go up over time. Furthermore, with our small population, we lack a comparative advantage in child exploitation.
Such concerns are valid, but they are—in my opinion—too pessimistic. In fact, child labour is the answer to Singapore’s low fertility.
One of the most frequently cited obstacles to starting a family is cost. Even though our government subsidises it through tax relief and cash bonuses, everyone knows that children are a time-consuming, loss-making venture. How then do we reconcile this apparent contradiction? Why is there such a dismal supply of children if they are as productive as I claim?
In the documentary Bojack Horseman, Vincent Adultman was able to fool most of the adults into thinking he was an adult.
This is not because children are a bad investment. Rather, the underproduction of children is caused by excessive regulation on what they can be used for. They can neither be bought or sold, nor leased, nor gotten rid of, and most do not start paying dividends until twenty years later. In some cases, never at all.
However, if we deregulate the labour market as we have done for telecommunications and allow our children to be leased out on 5 or 10 year contracts to employers, then their market value will appreciate astronomically. Parents would then be incentivised to produce more children to lease on the market, thus increasing our population growth/labour supply. It should come as no surprise that fertility is lowest in countries like Japan or Germany, where labour laws are pedantically enforced. Countries where child labour is booming rarely suffer such fertility problems.
Can Children be employed in the energy sector?
As for the question of education, I do not deny it has value. However, let us not forget the ultimate purpose of schooling, which is to produce employees for the labour market. Some children might benefit from a formal curriculum, but others might be better served by a ‘pedagogy of the production line’. After all, there is no one-size-fits-all solution when it comes to learning, and the free market can better decide what is best for our children’s future.
After all, a diversified labour pool is good for the country and a diversified portfolio is good for families. Parents should have the right to choose whether to send their children to school, or to the semiconductor industry, or both. Smarter children can be educated to become Ministers as a long-term, high-profit investment, while those with less potential can start work as soon as they are old enough to use their opposable thumbs.
Conclusion
We fancy ourselves a pragmatic people, but when it comes to things like child labour or migrant workers dorms or cardboard-collecting elderly folks, we suddenly turn into a bunch of social justice warriors. We tend to see these things as ‘social ills’ when in fact, they should be celebrated as a symbol of Singapore’s enlightened economic policies.
Surely the question is not whether an 80 year-old uncle should be collecting cardboard, but how to make card-board collecting more efficient. (Perhaps some venture capital firm can create a ‘CardboardTogether’ app which matches Singaporeans in need of trash disposal with elderly collectors—for a reasonable transaction fee.)
Ultimately, this problem occurs because our society has ‘values’; Values like; “all children have a right to education”, “respect for our elders”, “a basic right to safe living conditions”. Over time, these values–often arbitrary–coalesce into a system of ethics which serve to guide our thinking on policy and law. Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with these values, but they become problems when they interfere with the effective functioning of our free market; when these so-called values cause distortions and inefficiency. When this happens, we must act quickly to expunge them before they erode our global competitiveness, reduce wealth creation and ultimately hurt the very people they seek to protect. After all, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and sometimes the only way to help the powerless, the elderly, or the young is to exploit them more efficiently.
Endnotes
1. There were attempts to legislate working conditions before the 1833 Factory Act, as well as after, but it was the first piece of legislation that did not end in failure.
2. The population for various age groups of children refers to the citizen population. The total number of children available for employment is likely higher and closer to 400,000. There is no reason why child labour should be a protected privilege of Singaporean families.
3. As British Historian Eric Hobsbawm writes on Britain’s industrial output in ‘The Age Of Revolution’: In 1848, Britain’s trade was twice that of its nearest competitor, France, where in 1780, it merely exceeded it by a small margin … It produced half of the developed world’s supply of pig iron and used twice as much per inhabitant as the next most industrialised economy, Belgium.
4. Do the laws of supply and demand apply to procreation? I strongly believe it does. To quote the Libertarian philosopher Teo You Yenn’s 2011 book Neoliberal Morality: “As a small city-state highly-dependent on global capital, the logic of low taxation (particularly corporate taxes), and the corporatization of national industries has been embraced as a sort of survivalist common sense.” It naturally follows that reproduction can be stimulated using the very same logic.
5. To prevent abuse, CardboardTogether can be run as a social enterprise.

According to The Guardian, the high court found that “it was not enough that the jurors found the witness believable, compelling and honest. The other evidence should have called his account into question.”
The Victorial police made no comments, nor did the politicians who supported Pell during his trial.
But Daniel Andrew, the premier of Victoria, had something to say: “I have a message for every single victim and survivor of child sex abuse.”

Are Our Fears About The TraceTogether Token Justified? We Asked A Data Privacy Expert,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-tracetogether-token-data-privacy-expert-interview/,12-Jun-20,"Top image:: Priscilla du Preez//Unsplash
The government’s recent announcement that it will be rolling out wearable TraceTogether tokens has sparked furious debate and opposition. At the time of writing, a petition against the tokens has already gathered over 42,000 signatures, with many Singaporeans expressing discomfort towards the token and the implications of introducing it.
RICE spoke with Mr Roland Turner, a data privacy professional, to unpack some of our fears around the token, and whether we should indeed be proceeding with caution.
Roland is Chief Privacy Officer at TrustSphere, where he is responsible for the company’s information policy and practices. He is a HackerspaceSG founding member and FOSSASIA organiser, and an executive committee member of the Internet Society of Singapore.
Sophie: Let’s start with the tech side of things. Could you briefly explain how TraceTogether works?
Roland: The protocol that’s used is called BlueTrace. This was developed by a team in Govtech, and I have to say that it’s a very clever way of solving several problems simultaneously: identifying close physical contacts, controlling battery use, and avoiding the sort of location tracking that might seem like the obvious starting point.
When you encounter another phone with the app, TraceTogether generates a new random identifier that changes periodically. So even if someone tries to sniff through the data, they still can’t use it, because who you were, say, 15 minutes ago and who you are now looks like two different identities. That’s the first major thing TraceTogether solves.
Only MOH contact tracing officers have access to the database required to piece the identifiers together. To minimise the risk of abuse by someone in government, or by a successful intruder, that database does not include the complete set of recorded contacts for the entire population, only for the smaller number who have been diagnosed with Covid-19.
What BlueTrace allows is for the recorded information to not enter a central database. It broadcasts the randomised identifiers, which stay just on your phone or the token, and remembers it for 25 days. If and only if you are diagnosed as Covid+, then you have to turn it over because you are obligated to participate in the contact tracing process.
On the information we do have available, the token should do the same thing as the app, with some differences of necessity.
How would the authorities then use the data from the token to contact other people? Would the token still have to be linked to you by a unique identifier, like your NRIC number?
I mentioned that there are some necessary differences between the app and the token, and there’re two that I can see.
One is the updating of the randomised identifiers. The app contacts the MOH servers every 24 hours to generate a new set of identifiers, and the token can’t do that. We don’t yet have public details of how; cryptographically there are a few ways this can be done.
Both the app and the token need to be associated with a person. Without that, they’re useless. But the second difference is that method of association with the token will be different, in part because the token has to be useful even if the person doesn’t have a smartphone.
What are the risks associated with this?
Neither of these presents a major risk over and above the use of the app.
The broader risks remain the abuse of the system for purposes other than Covid-19 contact tracing, whether by a malicious actor within government, or by an outside attacker. The various features of the system that resist these abuses operate the same way for the app and for the token. These include the new random identifier every 15 minutes, the limited retention of data in the app and the token, and limiting access by the contact tracing team to the recorded contacts of positive cases.
Image credit: Jae park/Unsplash
Location tracking has been one majorly cited fear, despite all the assurances that TraceTogether does not track locations. Does no GPS and no data connectivity mean our locations cannot be tracked?
‘Cannot’ is a very high standard, and is not usually important in data protection discussions. More importantly, it is impractical to use TraceTogether as a tracking system.
It would be possible in principle to deploy a network of BlueTrace protocol devices at known locations. Each would have something like the token to perform BlueTrace communication, perhaps a small solar panel for power, and perhaps a mobile network module to allow it to report detections continually to a tracking system. TraceTogether apps and tokens would exchange information with these as usual, and the tracking system would therefore be able to determine from minute to minute where every device using TraceTogether was located, and therefore every person carrying a BlueTrace device.
Setting aside the enormous expense and high visibility of such a rollout (tens of thousands of devices would be required), networks with this capability already exist and are already able to provide tracking information for all mobile phones, not just smartphones: the devices are mobile phone towers and the networks are the 3G/4G mobile phone networks. Criminal investigators and courts are already able to use these networks for tracking suspects in serious cases.
To build a parallel network at greater expense (because of the larger number of locations required) to achieve what’s already possible with the existing networks makes no sense, and therefore isn’t a realistic threat.
No equivalent threat exists from non-government actors, because even a huge network of BlueTrace devices is useless for tracking without the database of registration information.
So is the furore over the tokens justified, from a data privacy standpoint?
It’s not obvious to me that the token deserves more pushback than the app on data privacy grounds.
In my opinion, it’s that three things happened together [which led to so much resistance]: mentioning that the app was not made mandatory because of its problems with iOS, the addition of the NRIC, and the token, which extinguishes all the reasons why people can’t use the app.
When Minister Balakrishnan said that they hadn’t made it mandatory because it doesn’t work well across all phones, I hope he was simplifying, and the iOS reason was not the primary one for not mandating it.
Do you think the 75% takeup target can be hit without making TraceTogether mandatory?
I’m not sure it’s helpful to speculate, but I guess I’d say that 75% is a little arbitrary—there is no point at which it goes from being ‘not good’ to ‘good’. You just get better as you go.
The importance of 75% is that it’s the point at which more transmissions are detected by the app than aren’t. Beyond that point, it’s a Pareto principle problem. After a while, you hit diminishing returns.
The risk of putting it this way is that it makes it sound like if we don’t hit 75%, it’s useless, and that’s not true. Even with the currently low takeup rate, it’s already delivering value. We don’t know how much, but it’s clear that this helps with jogging the patient’s memory.
Failure to achieve 75% is not a failure overall, so don’t confuse the end point that the government is shooting for with the success criteria, ie: as much as possible, or where beyond that it’s not worth expending more effort.
But I do think mandating TraceTogether would be a terrible idea, even with the extraordinary times we’re in. Getting the entire population to use contact tracing devices is straight-up freaky, for one; it would generate lots of distrust, anger, and resentment. And even if you were to make it a mandate with exceptions, there are very real problems with that.
So in your opinion, are the reassurances we’ve been given satisfactory? What other safeguards would be appropriate?
Broadly, yes, I think they’re okay. I guess there are two questions here: whether TraceTogether is a good idea, and what additional things are appropriate. It’s the latter which I feel has some gaps.
You might be aware that a review of the PDPA is imminent. One of the big things there is accountability improvements: if a private sector organisation wishes to process data, it will have to perform and document a balancing exercise—a due diligence type process where you identify the risks, the appropriate protective measures, the residual risks, all before you go ahead. The idea is that whatever benefit is being pursued must warrant the risks being taken.
In my opinion, what was missed with TraceTogether, first of all, is that this impact assessment was not published. For example, in Australia, OpenTrace was picked up, but they’re bound by a slightly more developed privacy regime, so they both performed and published this impact assessment.
I do accept the assurances being made, and given the diligence that I’ve seen in Singapore in dealing with information security, I think it’s reasonable to assume this is being handled well. But right now, we have some data points, some explicit, some speculative, but fundamentally we’re having to guess.
Publishing the assessment, and in particular what processing is being performed, would help us answer a lot of questions. It would allow specialists and civil society to review the information, and not just grab onto whatever small fragments have been released by government ministers. Even if some info has to be redacted for safety reasons, it would still be desirable.
The second thing is that the government should facilitate independent review of the software embedded in the tokens. This is a highly specialist area, but there are a number of people in Singapore who are able to do so.
This requires that two things be done. One, the source code be published, as was the case for TraceTogether or OpenTrace. Two, the hardware manufactured without some of the usual measures to prevent non-destructive examination (to get access to the chip without destroying it). Were the government to include this in its requirements, the comfort factor of having independent experts who have examined it would likely calm the public discourse somewhat.
A transparent approach increases the likelihood that when the dust settles, more people will have understood what is going on, and trust it. This is hugely important to retaining trust in government. It’s not adversarial; it’s about transparency.

Are we misguided in getting up in arms over the token when we already cede a lot of our privacy to both tech companies and the state?
The data that companies like Facebook and Google have—which they can use to benefit anyone willing to pay, based on the quite detailed profiles of users which they have—is not compatible with democracy. You can’t have an informed populace seeking and gaining and sharing info if the most powerful player is selling control of what’s shared to the highest bidder. It’s a real threat.
With regard to contact tracing, it’s hard to point to a serious risk of harm based on what has been done so far, what is proposed, and the likely trajectory. Nonetheless, a lack of diligence risks allowing this to slide and grow in scope.
If everything goes well and we get a vaccine before Christmas, that’s great. It’s short term. But if we’re stuck with this for ten years, then all the other changes to society and systems and protections will evolve around what we’ve got.
That is the risk. It’s not about yes/no to what is being proposed today. It’s a failure to remain diligent for the duration of this thing, such that when the risk is low enough that the measures can be removed, we will forget to remove them.

Singapore’s Top Astrologer Shares Insights For A Post-Pandemic Future",Sophie Chew,TRUE,TRUE
"What It Means For Today’s Millennials To Have A Voice, In A World Of Flux",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-sgiff-new-waves-what-it-means-for-millennials-to-have-a-voice-in-a-world-of-flux/,25-Nov-20,"All images from ‘Home, and A Distant Archive’ (2020), ‘A Hand Written Poster’ (2017), and ‘Blind Mouth’ (2017).
We’ve been labelled the “lost generation”.
A global pandemic. Record unemployment. Life plans shelved. Dreams disrupted. This is the way 2020 ends; not with a bang, but with a whimper.
With no end to the Covid-19 crisis in sight, one thing’s clear: it has become critical for us youths to step up and take charge of our own narratives—to have a voice, and to use this voice to shape our present and future.
Take the sheer power of the vote, as we’ve witnessed in a year dominated by watershed elections abroad and at home. In the recent United States presidential election, surging youth voter turnout propelled Joe Biden to a decisive victory. In Singapore’s July general election, young voters who desired to see diverse voices and more checks and balances in parliament lifted the opposition to its best-ever showing.
Voting is a right; a deliberate exercise in political participation. Yet surely it isn’t the only way for us to have our voices heard. How our generation chooses to make a political statement can vary in form, measure and tangibility. Some prefer the covert, starting by influencing social circles within reach. Others head to the streets in mass movements. Others take to the web.
But democracy is not a universal privilege—it’s a loaded concept that exists in spades and shades, all too often accompanied by caveats. For the disenfranchised trapped in environments besieged by violence, state censorship, or an erosion of basic human rights, it’s a daily battle spent fighting for causes held dear, through whatever channels available.
Therein lies the question: when the odds are against us, through what other unconventional and unique means can we youths of today manifest our voices? And with our voices, how much of a difference can we truly make—whether as individuals, or as a whole—in challenging the existing order, within a shifting global landscape fraught with uncertainty?
In Dorothy Cheung’s Home, and A Distant Archive (2020), making one’s voice heard is a collective duty that extends far beyond the personal into a broader national consciousness. Her lyrical experimental documentary is a portrait of four young Hong Kong women based in London, who volunteer for a project to retrieve and digitise past records of the handover agreement between the United Kingdom and China.
These women no longer recognise the present Hong Kong, which has been gradually silenced by Chinese Communist authorities determined to end the city’s semi-autonomous status. Unable to return home to physically partake in pro-democracy protests, how else can these four individuals, in their personal capacities, help their motherland reclaim its lost voice?
The first step is to revisit Hong Kong’s colonial history, a process that can paradoxically only be carried out in London rather than at home, as the city does not have a public archives law that grants its citizens access to important political documents.
By sifting through and decoding Hong Kong’s archives released by the United Kingdom, the volunteers interviewed in Home, and a Distant Archive unearth how the former British colony’s past, present and future intersect in ways that few of their countrymen have been privy to, in the hopes of understanding how, and why, Hong Kong came to be the way it is today.
Over the course of this project, these volunteers inadvertently uncover discrepancies in old documents about the Sino-British negotiations and Sino-British Joint Declaration over the then future of Hong Kong. While scanning a batch of records, one volunteer shares how she noticed that the British government had initially included Hong Kong in the equivalent of an international bill of human rights; yet, the political trials that continue to take place in the city today contradict the past freedoms allegedly promised.
“If you don’t know about your past, what we have done right or wrong, how can you reposition or reshape the future?” she asks.
It’s a cogent statement that underscores the importance of translating the learnings from the city’s bygone era for—and to—the future, in order to empower successive generations of citizens to rebuild Hong Kong’s fractured identity, to help their motherland find its voice back.
At its core, Home, and a Distant Archive is a meditation on the complexities of national identity and migration among the Hong Kong diaspora. Cheung elegantly juxtaposes anecdotes from her interviewees with her own personal narration, as a London-based Hong Konger struggling to articulate her conflicted emotions about a city that she is geographically alienated from.
“I seldom think about my sentiments towards this place,” she muses.
“Even if I like it, it is hard to say out loud.”
Decoding Hong Kong’s colonial history has ultimately been an avenue for these diaspora to confront, and reconcile, a fragmented and nebulous relationship with a homeland they feel guilty for forsaking, at a time of great political upheaval.
While Cheung’s film centres around the digitisation of physical records for preservation in a technological age, Kwak Eunmi’s A Hand Written Poster (2017), in contrast, is an embrace of the anachronistic. Her film casts aside the ubiquitous online petition of today for a more traditional form of protest—a big sheet of white paper, scrawled with lines of urgent block characters, plastered on the walls of a university campus.
Handwritten posters—known as daejobo in South Korea—have become increasingly popular with the nation’s youths in recent years, with more using these mediums to make social and political statements about the state of contemporary Korean society. What makes daejobo all the more distinctive, is that they are typically signed off by the writers behind the original protest message.
It is this idea of personal accountability for one’s words that inhabits the central conflict in A Hand Written Poster.
Hye-ri is the president of her school’s university poster club, which aims to be a voice for the student body in protesting against unfairness. Of late, she’s been signing off and pasting posters on campus calling for the dismissal of her professor, who has been accused of embezzling school funds. After finding out that her professor has filed a lawsuit against her, Hye-ri begins to have second thoughts about attributing subsequent protest posters to her own name.
As a more raw, rudimentary form of political expression and engagement, Hye-ri’s handwritten protest posters are a subtle rejection of current Internet culture, which has enabled netizens to anonymously start petitions on online platforms such as Change.org and GoPetition. Virtual anonymity has accorded us more power to freely express our views online, but it is also accompanied by the prospect for abuse. In this digital age of misinformation, can an emotionally-charged handwritten poster—signed off by an actual human being—function as a more authentic voice for the masses, a more veritable source of truth?
Speaking out against injustice is one thing, but A Hand Written Poster goes a step further to question audiences if we have the courage to wholeheartedly own our voices—to be accountable to the statements we promulgate—even if this responsibility comes at the price of institutional reprisal and punishment.
Shot in a 4:3 aspect ratio, the film’s close-up shots of Hye-ri articulate this internal tension, as she wrestles between directly expressing her voice to call out existing power structures that protect its perpetrators, and allowing herself to be silenced by fear of higher authority, thereby subjecting future generations of students to a continuing cycle of corruption.
While Hye-ri is presented with a choice to use her voice to speak up for a greater public cause, the protagonists in Siew-Hong Leong’s Blind Mouth (2017) are categorically denied using their voices for even the most basic interpersonal communication.
Set in a dystopian Malaysia, the father in Blind Mouth works as an assistant to doctors who conduct surgeries to seal every child’s mouth. The father’s mouth is also sealed, but his daughter is one of the few children who has not undergone the procedure; she manages to go undetected by donning a cloth mask.
Physically and psychologically conditioned to living without their voices, the pair transcend the boundaries of verbal speech to reach out to each other via a unique conduit—by listening to tape recordings of the daughter’s propaganda-tinged history lessons, an act of shared rebellion between them. But when tragedy strikes, these instruments end up being more than just a functional communication device; instead, they could hold the key for the pair to escape a life under extreme authoritarian regime.
With Blind Mouth shot three years ago, there’s no missing Leong’s social commentary on Malaysia’s state censorship and crackdown on freedom of speech, actualised in the literal “silencing” of the characters in her film. Then, the country was still under the reign of former Prime Minister Najib Razak, who sought to prosecute activists and even ordinary citizens who expressed any form of political discontent.
But how much change can be brought about, even when systems change hands over time? Perhaps certain power structures are ingrained—despite making a free speech pledge earlier in the year, Malaysia’s new government led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin has since charged multiple local and international journalists for reportage deemed critical of the administration.
Screened as part of the Singapore International Film Festival’s New Waves series this year, the above films each feature young protagonists forced to make difficult decisions and personal sacrifices amid challenging circumstances. In some ways, they squarely capture the zeitgeist of today’s Covid-19 climate—a time of being together, but also apart.
Every day, we weigh temporarily compromising creature comforts against the greater public good of keeping a global virus at bay; elsewhere, it’s a battle of more permanent proportions, between giving up on your community and homeland, or persisting in a unified national fight for one’s legitimate rights and freedom.
Our generation of youths may have accepted ceding a degree of control to the unknown, but we are not debilitated. It is time for us to take stock of the autonomy and agency we hold in our own remaining capacities, to speak out for the change we desire. The future remains ours to make, and take.
The Singapore International Film Festival will run from 26 November to 6 December. Get your tickets here.

Remember The Circuit Breaker? Many Singaporeans Actually Miss It,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-remember-circuit-breaker-singaporeans-actually-miss/,15-Aug-20,"Top image: Zachary Tang / Rice File Photo
Lockdown and the Covid-19 pandemic in general has created serious problems for society. Many have lost jobs, while others grapple with numerous uncertainties. At the same time, the circuit breaker has been for many an opportunity to learn about ourselves, time management, and health.
Case in point: me.
I fucking loved the circuit breaker.
Amidst the chaos, worry, and uncertainty of lockdown, I found it exhilarating to live a life free of traditional routines as we knew them. My weekends were mine to use and abuse. There were no social obligations keeping me from getting into artmaking for entire weekends. Not commuting meant sleeping that extra hour every morning. And yoga, meditation and journaling finally became a part of my routine after years of false promises to myself.
Would I want to do it again? Most certainly not. But it was a pivotal moment in history and in our lives, yet barely anyone speaks about it anymore. But we need to, because Covid-19 remains a health risk across the globe, and it’s keeping us from returning to a normal pace of life anytime soon.
So as we ease out of this pandemic, we now have an opportunity to learn from these turbulent times, to build a future more suited to our needs.
But is anyone else still thinking about the circuit breaker? Or have we all, as we suspected, begun transitioning back into life as we knew it, as though the pandemic never happened?
A survey we ran with Milieu actually shows that I’m not alone. Many Singaporeans miss their time in lockdown.
I spoke about this with my friend Julian, who told me why he liked his routine during lockdown.
“I loved that it forced me to cut out things like my commute, which as we know, is never really just about the commute,” he said.
“Because you need to wake up earlier and get ready, all of which are things that take time, but miraculously evaporate when you work from home. The extra time made it possible to do many other things like cooking my own meals, getting more time to decompress, and it allowed me to re-establish a bit more of a balance between work and life.”
“Now, at the end of a work day, I just throw on exercise clothes and go for a run. I would never do that if I had to throw a commute into the mix.”
Another insight the survey provided is how participants felt about their social lives. I expected to find that most individuals were ecstatic about being able to meet their friends and acquaintances again, but the survey results revealed otherwise.
41% said they only missed it a little, and 21% responded that they hardly missed it.
Less socialising means more time for ourselves and our families (with whom we stayed home during the circuit breaker), and this is the primary reason why participants might have enjoyed this period. But the reasons are also practical and financial—49% said it had to do with saving money, and 44% said they enjoyed not feeling pressured to go out.
After months of living with the extra headspace and reduced costs of going out, it isn’t easy to shift back into normality—especially if you have a busy schedule. From working, commuting, exercising, meeting friends, and attending to family, it may feel like there’s never enough time to be still.
And while I’m inclined to say that Singapore is a city of hustlers (based entirely off my personal assumptions), these results show that the circuit breaker may have given people a new affinity with alone time.
What these results show is that looking back at the circuit breaker isn’t about merely missing having more time to sleep in or chilling on your couch, but it’s a reflection of what we learned and what we’re changing in our life now.
From mental health to work-life balance, many of us didn’t realise how out of tune we were with our needs. Hopefully, we don’t jump back into pre-lockdown life as we knew it, and rather look to building a new normal in our personal life as well, whether in the form of structural changes to our routine or adopting new habits.
If these survey results are anything to go by, many Singaporeans are hankering for a slower pace of life (35%), want to engage in self-care (23%) and want time to pursue their hobbies (21%).
The biggest lesson Julian learned after lockdown was “how big a role your environment plays when it comes to your personal well-being.”
Beyond that, he has looked at reshaping his work-from-home routine, and more importantly, the way he handles his relationships. “It’s so important to make an effort when it comes to maintaining relationships, whether with colleagues or my wife,” he said. “If you don’t communicate, don’t expect anyone to understand what you think or feel, that’s just the way it is.”
“I also learned how much I actually enjoy not-working, and how having time to myself actually helps me work better.”
Relatable? I think so.

The Consequences of Singapore’s Snitching Culture in 2021,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-how-covid-19-revived-singapore-snitching-consequences/,1-Jan-21,"All unsourced images by Zachary Tang for RICE Media.
2020 was a Golden Age for snitching in Singapore.
With the events surrounding Covid-19 and GE2020, never before in Singapore’s 55-year history, had there been as many opportunities to inform on our neighbours and turn in our family members to the police. There were also more digital tools at our disposal to catch fellow Singaporeans with their pants down (see: NUS culture).
Never mind that this pandemic should’ve taught us that nobody is perfect, and that we could all learn to be more understanding of each other’s shortcomings. Instead, in 2020, Singaporeans elevated snitching to an art form.
But don’t take my word for it. Before we close the chapter on 2020, let’s take one final look at how snitching culture has flourished in Singapore, and why this local predilection will become more relevant (and dangerous) as we embark on the new year.
1. The Circuit Breaker: Sinkie Pwn Sinkie, Covidiots Pwn Covidiots
In the weeks leading up to the circuit breaker, online sheriffs who no one appointed started shaming people and posting footage of them without their consent on public Facebook groups—ostensibly in the name of public health.
According to these galaxy brains, the service that they were providing was better information for the police, to facilitate the doling out of jail-time and fines.
Just so we’re clear: they were performing this public service at a time when their fellow Singaporeans’ mental health and livelihoods were being jeopardised by the circuit breaker.
But hey, nobody’s perfect. Let’s just file this unfortunate and time-wasting saga away as growing pains in a civil society. After the year we’ve been through, I hope we’ve all learned a thing or two about forgiveness and empathy.
What this Covidiot episode did reveal, however, was how easily Singaporean society could devolve into panic, finger-pointing and snitching at a time when national unity was called for.
2. GE2020: ‘Hallo, Polis? Someone is Talking About Race Again.’
At RICE, we’ve covered many examples in 2020 of police reports that were filed because someone had the audacity to talk about race. During GE2020, the Raeesah Khan incident was the most prominent example.
Source: Workers' Party FB page
In her apology, Khan herself admitted to being ‘insensitive’ in her remarks on social media, as she expressed genuine frustrations about racial injustice in Singapore. However, any adult with a basic level of reading comprehension will know that her intention was not to sow ‘social unrest or division,’ but to raise awareness of an important issue.
Just when it looked like Singapore was finally ready to have a broader national conversation about race, Singaporean snitches came out of the woodwork to ruin it for the rest of us by filling out police reports like TOTO lottery tickets.
All of this was done in the name of preserving “racial harmony.”
Before you read me the 1965 riot act, I am aware of the history and the precarious balance to which the free speech laws in Singapore are there to protect. This is not at issue here.
The issue is that some Singaporeans seem a bit overeager to run to the authorities whenever their feelings get hurt. Instead of, you know, acting like rational and mature adults.
It’s a lot easier to file police reports through a veil of tears than actually trying to understand why some minorities in Singapore may have different experiences than you. Perhaps we might learn to be more tolerant when they choose not to express their frustration in sweet and dulcet tones.
Filing police reports against already marginalised groups in Singapore for hurting your feelings isn’t social responsibility—that’s just pettiness.
3. Phase 2: Self-Appointed SDAs Threaten to Shut Down Struggling F&B Businesses
There were a number of incidents last year where F&B operators had been caught between uncooperative customers and a random passerby armed with a smartphone threatening to report them to the authorities.
Here’s just one example where one KPO Singaporean with absolutely no context and a chip on his shoulder decided to butt in, making a difficult situation worse.
Source: Facebook
For the record: this doesn’t mean there weren’t F&B operators who brazenly flouted the Phase 2 rules. That’s the reason why real SDAs and enforcement personnel exist. Because they are trained to handle and de-escalate such situations.
What they didn’t need was your dumb ass armed with a phone, and absolutely no context, to complicate an already complicated situation.
4. Liew family v. Parti Liyani case: All Your CCTV Are Belong to Us
The 2020 Snitches of the Year award has to go to the Liew family, who according to the Law Minister Shanmugam’s own statement displayed a ‘cavalier attitude’ in reporting their domestic helper Parti Liyani to the police for theft.
How else can we explain why the Liews thought it was perfectly within their rights to call the authorities, then fail to adequately account for and document the items that were allegedly stolen?
Source: HOME
While justice eventually prevailed in Parti’s acquittal in the High Court, a judicial ruling which—and I can’t stress this enough—should not be impinged upon or questioned, Parti’s case was the most prominent example of how Singapore’s snitching culture extended all the way to the upper echelons of society.
On the subject of FDWs: I’ve noticed that for some families, Singapore’s CCTV surveillance culture extends into the family living room, mainly as a means to monitor their foreign domestic helper. As a newcomer to Singapore, I learned about this practice when many of these cameras were hacked in October and the footage shared online, including on pornography sites.
On one hand, this is terrible and wrong. But if I can be frank, it’s also a bit of poetic justice.
I get it. Some families, understandably, want to make sure that their children and elderly are being properly cared for by their helpers when they’re away at work. But I hope I don’t need to explain why this is still a creepy and dystopian practice.
It also raises more questions than it answers:
In what other workplace, outside of sensitive industries like defense, would constant CCTV surveillance be acceptable behaviour for an employer? Would a Singaporean subject themselves to the same treatment?
And if families are truly justified in thinking that FDWs might steal their valuables without surveillance, then why would they entrust such a person with the care of their own children and elders?
What does this say about the institution of FDWs in Singapore?
Why Singapore’s Snitching Culture Matters in 2021
I’m well aware that the trading-in of freedom and privacy for security isn’t something that’s unique to Singapore. It’s a phenomenon that’s happening globally. The restrictions around the pandemic has only accelerated this trend.
But as Singapore enters 2021, there are vulnerabilities that are unique to Singaporean society. This includes our deferential attitude towards authority, and the general acceptance of surveillance that extends beyond the public sphere.
And finally, for a certain segment of the population, there is an overzealous attitude towards enforcing the rules, and seeing things in black and white, when increasingly, everything in the world is turning shades of grey.
In this context, technology is a double-edged sword. As Facebook and the 2016 U.S. election demonstrated, tools that were meant to facilitate greater connection can be abused for political and social influence. Data that was originally intended for identifying Covid clusters, could fall into the wrong hands.
In 2021, as Chinese tech companies like Alibaba, Tencent, and Bytedance move in to make Singapore its regional headquarters in Southeast Asia, the risks and opportunities are acute.
It’s the reason why Singapore PM Lee Hsien Loong published a 6,000+ word history lesson this past summer on Foreign Affairs, titled ‘The Endangered Asian Century,’ which cautioned against the U.S-China trade war.
In his essay, LHL skillfully danced around his other unspoken thesis: that it would not be in Singapore’s interests for the United States to withdraw from Southeast Asia, as Singapore and its ASEAN partners would run the risk of becoming pseudo-vassal states under a Chinese hegemon.
With Trump and Covid-19 (hopefully) receding into the background in 2021, this is a development that RICE will be monitoring closely as we officially enter the new decade.

Singapore Needs To Catch Up In Its Approach To Interdisciplinary Education",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
The Progress Singapore Party Offers A ‘Progressive’ Vision for Singapore,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-progress-singapore-party-psp-tan-cheng-bock/,19-Jun-20,"Disclaimer: RICE does not endorse or support any political party in Singapore.
The Progress Singapore Party (PSP), founded by Dr Tan Cheng Bock, unveiled six new candidates this morning, making it one of the first political parties to introduce candidates ahead of an impending election.
The six members are:
– Brad Bowyer (53), a media professional and SME owner;
– Francis Yuen Kin Feng (70), a former SAF scholarship holder with experience in the military and private sector;
– Gigene Wong (54), the CEO of Gulf Oil China and CFO of another Shenzhen-listed company;
– Hazel Poa (50), founder of several educational enterprises and former Administrative Officer in the civil service;
– Muhammad Taufik Bin Supan (40), an IT professional “schooled in the university of hard knocks”; and
– Sri Nallakaruppan (56), a chartered accountant and former auditor with Ernst & Young.
In a press conference that lasted two hours, party members espoused their vision for Singapore, and elaborated on specific policies they would advocate for if elected.
Need For Economic Restructuring, SME-Driven Growth
Francis Yuen emphasized the need for a major economic restructuring post-Covid. He called for an urgent pivot towards SME-driven growth, arguing that the government has not done enough to create a supportive ecosystem for SMEs. In particular, he called for policies that would help SMEs digitalize, expand into overseas markets, and pursue “blue-ocean strategies”.
Although statutory boards like Enterprise Singapore (ESG) and the Economic Development Board (EDB) have been pursuing these growth strategies for years, PSP members felt that current policies have been largely ineffective, or at least, insufficient. “Our SMEs are subjected to a lot of unfair competition,” said Mr Yuen. “The current schemes offered to them may not meet the needs of what they want.”
Mr Yuen attributed this in part to the lack of political will in fully committing to a SME-backed growth policy, arguing that Singapore has been too reliant on MNCs and GLC-led growth over the past few years. Instead of hand-holding SMEs, Mr Yuen says one of his top priorities would be to give room to SMEs to grow, especially regionally, and create sustainable businesses that last. “Can we produce the next Alibaba or Google?”
Sri Nallakaruppan added that although government policies have been subsidizing on the labour front, they have been inadequate in addressing the other cost factor that SMEs struggle with rent. “It is time for the government to review exorbitant rents,” he urged, arguing that the growth of REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts) have led to a narrow focus on maximizing shareholder value. “Every year rentals increase by 5%, which eats up into margins. A lot of SMEs have folded up. Many can’t cope financially.”
Brad Bowyer added that while current policies were no doubt well-meaning, gaps still emerged in practice, citing the myriad “rules, regulations, and red tape” as one example. Mr Bowyer also questioned whether these statutory boards were staffed with the right expertise. “The problem is, business people trying to do business are being regulated by people who’ve never run a business in their life. They’re not being managed by people who understand what the needs of businesses are.”

Need for Education Reforms, More Collaborative and Creative Thinking
Members also pointed out that restructuring the economy into one that encourages entrepreneurship required a radical rethinking of our education system. Said Mr Nallakaruppan, “We need to encourage our graduates, polytechnic diploma holders to take risks.” He floated the possibility of creating more incubator programmes that could provide seed funding to aspiring entrepreneurs.
Mr Nallakaruppan also criticized Singapore’s government scholarship program for directing too many talents towards the civil service, at the expense of the private sector. Stressing that Singapore needs a mindset shift, Nalla pointed out that young people today are not as willing to take risks to venture into new professions or industries.
Ms Poa similarly criticized our education system for not preparing students well for the future economy. “Our current system is very exam-centric, and it rewards behaviour that’s regurgitating perfect answers. If you want to encourage creativity and innovative thinking, you want students to question those answers and explore new ones.” Hazel added that the high-stakes exams (such as the PSLE, O Levels, and A Levels) created a harmful culture of constant stress that teaches students to peg their self-worth to their grades.
In response to a question about whether Ms Poa contributes to, and benefits from, the very culture of stress she criticizes as the owner of several successful tuition agencies and a private school, Ms Poa said that her decision to run for office was precisely motivated by her experience in the tuition industry. She saw firsthand how stressed students were over examinations, and hopes to change this if voted into parliament.
She added that exam culture bred competition amongst students, encouraging individualistic over collaborative behaviour. She hopes that future education reforms can put more emphasis on teamwork and collaboration, as well as pivot towards longer industrial attachments that would focus more on process-oriented learning rather than simply a results-oriented one.

Need For Strong and Diverse Voices In Parliament
Many also stressed the need for diverse representation in parliament—one that would include not just civil servants and paper generals with impeccable academic credentials, but also the common man with a heart and hunger to serve. Dr Tan Cheng Bock, Secretary-General of the PSP, emphasized that PSP’s candidates came from all walks of life—some with backgrounds similar to those fielded by the ruling party, but others with much more varied experience, including leaders of MNCs, publicly-listed companies, and owners of SMEs.
Mr Yuen for example has experience in both the SAF and the private sector, and was honoured with the Magnolia Award from the Shanghai government for his contributions to their economy.
Said Mr Yuen, “I chose to leave the SAF at the peak of my career because I wanted to learn more about the real world outside. I only learned about real life in the private sector, understanding how the market and economy works, really learning the intricacies of what it takes to run a successful business.”
Francis says his experience as a business leader taught him about the importance of listening to people, and understanding their concerns. Whenever he visited clients, he would ask them not to tell him what was right, but what was wrong, so he could further improve the business.
Dr Tan also cited Taufik Supan as an example of someone who brings unique life experiences to the table, as someone who worked odd jobs to pay for his own tertiary education, and who successfully graduated with a masters degree with honours. Taufik says that as someone who experienced retrenchment, he understands Singaporeans’ fears about unemployment amidst a looming recession. He also empathises with Singaporeans’ concerns about the high cost of living, and hopes to be a champion for the underprivileged and low-income if elected.
Mr Supan says he also hopes to champion issues pertaining to the Malay community, adding that he was “very concerned about issues to its progression”. Instead of just “scratching the surface”, Taufik stressed that he wanted to conduct a “deep dive” into the underlying causes, citing education, poverty, inequality, and discrimination as some areas he planned to focus on.
Other members stressed the need for a credible opposition to take the government to task, and call attention to its faults when it makes mistakes.
Ms Poa cited the recent Covid-19 outbreak amongst the migrant worker dormitories as an example: “We have the Foreign Employer Dormitory Act (FEDA), but there was no commissioner appointed to enforce this piece of legislation. It shows a lack of will, and proper enforcement. Josephine Teo, the Minister for Manpower, herself admitted that 20 out of 43 dorm operators are flouting licensing requirements—a rather alarming figure. Now we are paying the price for neglect—hundreds of billions of dollars—not even considering the job losses that have happened and will happen over the course of the year.”
Framing her decision to enter politics as one motivated “out of a strong sense of necessity”, Ms Poa explained that had the political scene in Singapore been vibrant, she would probably have eschewed politics because she was shy of the limelight. However, the cited several “disturbing developments” such as constitutional changes to the Elected Presidency, lawsuits against people who spoke up, and POFMA as examples that reinforced her desire to remain in politics even after two previous unsuccessful runs.

A Party With Heart – Putting People’s Welfare First
Perhaps the defining factor of PSP is how much it emphasises the values of compassion. Party members constantly referenced the need for a more compassionate government, one that truly listened to its people, and was sincere in its desire to serve. This can be seen in the PSP’s approach towards accepting members—“Their heart must be in the right place,” said Dr Tan. “Their reason for joining this political party must be to serve the people, serve this country.”
Mr Supan emphasized that he was here to serve the people, and not just the economy—“I believe in investing in our people first.”
Members pointed to the need for a fundamental shift in the current compact between government and society, arguing that the ruling party has prioritized economic growth over the welfare of its people. Members cited Singapore’s high cost of living and high income inequality as indicators that the incumbent has not done enough to ensure that our national prosperity has truly benefited all in society, and expressed a desire to see more inclusive policies in future.
PSP members described their desire to run for office as “a calling to serve.” Choking a little, Ms Poa admitted, “The path we pick is not easy. It’s really easy to give up. I finally joined a party that is very compatible with my own values. I definitely won’t let any people or events get in the way this time.”
Party members also reiterated calls for the general elections not to be held amidst this crisis, with Dr Tan saying that “they may win the battle but lose the war”. Dr Tan expressed concerns about potential clusters forming after the elections, a risk that is particularly high for older voters. Party members echoed Dr Tan, arguing that a government that put the welfare of its people first would not be conducting elections now.
Nonetheless, with Singapore entering Phase 2 today and with the Elections Department (ELD) issuing campaign guidelines yesterday, it appears that elections are imminent.
With only three minutes of campaign time for televised political broadcasts allocated to each candidate, it remains to be seen how newer opposition parties can reach out to voters, particularly since physical rallies have been disallowed. Still, Mr Bowyer expressed confidence in the PSP’s communications strategy, explaining that the team has remained active through its various communication channels including Telegram, Wechat, and various social media platforms.
Dr Tan highlighted that the PSP plans to lay the groundwork for younger Singaporeans to come and take over, and speak for what is right without fear of repercussions, stressing that the PSP plans to stay in politics for the long term.
“All new parties have growing pains,” said Dr Tan, perhaps referencing the numerous gaffes and membership changes that seem to have plagued the party in recent months. Still, he remains hopeful that the party can differentiate itself through its clear commitment to serve, its credible slate of candidates, and its progressive vision for the future.

Why Future-Proofing Workers Is Critical as Singapore’s Factories Automate,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-a-star-future-proofing-workers-critical-singapores-factories-automate/,17-Dec-20,"Illustrations by Ansh Sirohi.
Four years ago, the strategy for Singapore’s economy to remain relevant in a fast-changing world was clear: automate our factories and future-proof the manufacturing output of our country. This strategy was necessary, since manufacturing accounts for one-fifth of our GDP.
The plan was to ride on a revolutionary global trend: Industry 4.0, or I4.0—a race where manufacturers would leverage data and technology in their factories and labs to boost productivity. This would “transform” systems and processes using sensors, robotics, AI, Big Data, Cloud technology … essentially smart production plants Tony Stark himself would be proud of.
While I4.0 would enable quicker, more efficient and sustainable manufacturing output, Industry 4.0 cannot be complete without its workforce. The transformation itself would affect some 472,000 manufacturing-related jobs in Singapore.
As such, in October this year, A*STAR with the Singapore Economic Development Board, Enterprise SG, NTU Singapore, and SkillsFuture Singapore (SSG), launched the Advanced Manufacturing Training Academy (AMTA), which is based in Jurong. A national programme to identify emerging skills for Industry 4.0, it would develop the right curriculum to train and scale workers.
The eventual goal: an ecosystem where every player grows together, leaving no one behind.
“Change brings surprises, increases stress and a feeling of discomfort, resulting in resistance to change in some cases.”
— Phillip Choo, Vice President and Managing Director, Michelman Asia-Pacific.
Manufacturers have always known this, and for the longest time, they’ve had to figure out ways to retrain workers and hire new ones so that workers do not end up being displaced by smart tech. This means creating new roles or redefining existing ones as the ecosystem evolves.
“Singapore cannot compete in the global manufacturing arena based on low cost labour and rental,” says Phillip Choo, Vice President and Managing Director of Michelman Asia-Pacific. Michelman’s staff have been participating in SIMTech’s Digital Transformation & Innovation™ Programme, enabling it to build a roadmap for its digitalisation journey.
“For a business to succeed, our workforce needs to keep pace with skills of the future workplace, in tandem with the transformation towards I4.0.”
Workforce training for Industry 4.0 should be accessible for both young and older workers.
As a global manufacturer of environmentally-friendly advanced materials, Michelman faces the same challenges most manufacturing companies in Singapore face—cost-competitiveness and finding the right talent.
“Humans are social beings and are generally used to routine. These routines become ‘automatic’ in many instances. Change brings surprises, increases stress and a feeling of discomfort, resulting in resistance to change in some cases,” Phillip adds.
According to him, there will be an adjustment period. Once the workforce is confident enough to embrace the change or, better yet, lead the change, they become the “designated change agent” or “first-line people managers” that employers seek.
Not only that, employers need to ensure existing workers are ready for this change.
“Some of our workers stay with us till they retire, so we have invested in training our older workers. They are important to us because they know the culture and system of Racer,” says Willy Koh, CEO of Racer Technology, a 25-year-old original equipment manufacturing company with factories in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, USA, and China.
Willy believes that getting workers to embrace training, especially disruptive ones like learning how to use new technologies and embrace automated processes at work, starts from the top. Even before starting on their Industry 4.0 journey, Racer Technology had been implementing standards through certifications, from ISO Quality Management Systems, the 5S Lean Management framework, ISO 13485 (for medical supplies), and many more.
Upgrading the manufacturing sector into Industry 4.0 requires a synergy where future-ready workers leverage on data-driven technologies and automation.
Yet just as manufacturers like Michelman and Racer were synergising automation with a future-ready workforce, COVID-19 struck.
Factories had to shut down, workers were sent home, and borders closed. The after-effects seven months later are still being felt, but not for entirely negative reasons.
For many, COVID-19 has become a litmus test for manufacturers and workers, on their ability to transform quickly and adapt better.
Due to travel and supply-line restrictions, production plants have converted their factory floors and labs to make face masks, shields, ventilators, diagnostic test kits, and so on. In a way, I4.0-readiness and their adaptability has allowed them to pivot quickly to meet demand.
Racer dedicated two of its production lines to producing face masks for the healthcare sector. It also changed some of its clean rooms to run swab kits and antibody COVID-19 test kits.
Teckwah Industrial Corporation Limited, a packaging printing and logistics solutions firm, had to quickly replace some manual procedures and extend its in-house digital solutions to customers. This included sending physical sample prints to customers and then following-up with video-calls for approvals.
Still, I4.0-preparedness is not all about adapting quickly. It is also about having the right ecosystem to innovate quickly.
“Some of our workers stay with us till they retire, so we’ve invested a lot of training in our older workers. They are important to us because they know the culture and system.”
— Willy Koh, CEO, Racer Technology
Michelman’s Phillip is quick to point out that the roadmaps and pathways for workforce learning are already in place.
The firm already has a digital team (named Project Vernie) where department leaders use a digital learning roadmap to align staff with the overall digital vision of the company. It includes strengthening core skills while embracing digital and technical exposure in other domains.
For example, a few of its customer service staff are cross-trained with production scheduling skills; warehouse assistants are cross-trained as technicians.
With Manufacturing 4.0, Singapore factories (and its future-ready workers) can withstand any disruption to our supply lines or demand caused by events like the pandemic, supply-route restrictions or economic turmoil.
“We train our staff to be skilled in various areas and operate multiple machines. This extends their knowledge and skillset, while increasing their confidence levels. It has proved useful during the pandemic, especially when we have to contend with split-team arrangements and reduced manpower due to safe management measures,” says Ng Chee Mun, Infocomm Technology Director, Teckwah Industrial Corporation Limited.
“Skills developments are imperative for I4.0. We have upskilled and deep-skilled more than 60% of our workforce through SIMTech’s LEAN programme. Given the pandemic, we are leveraging on our digital learning platforms to continue our goal of mass training,” Phillip explains.
The company’s learning programmes are driving the fundamental shift in employee focus from equipment to data.
This means a machine operated by one technician today could potentially be multiple machines remotely operated by a supervisor tomorrow, usually through a networked interface, with data analytics and location-tracking thrown in.
More importantly, these programmes should start early or accessible at any age. Michelman partnered with Singapore Polytechnic on a Career Workforce Transformation programme to extend these learning pathways for its employees.
“We train our staff to be skilled in various areas and operate multiple machines. This extends their knowledge and skillset, while increasing their confidence levels.”
— Ng Chee Mun, Infocomm Technology Director, Teckwah Industrial Corporation Ltd.
Racer, on the other hand, sent their staff, who have stayed with the company for nearly 30 years, to train at A*STAR’s Model Factory’s Training Module.
“We did not dismiss any staff or recruit new employees for Factory 4.0. We deployed excess staff to a new line or project so that we can increase capacity,” Willy says.
Despite some setbacks from COVID-19, it’s clear that manufacturers and their workers are adjusting to these changes at work.
Despite many other businesses struggling to pay wages despite flagging demand for their goods and services, some manufacturers and their workers have continued to show a can-do mindset to transform and adapt, especially during this crisis.
“If we want to overcome such natural disruptions which are beyond our control, we need to diversify our manufacturing ecosystem to make our supply chain more resilient and robust,” says Teckwah’s Ng.
And he’s right. Their resilience will not go unnoticed. Eventually, when our borders reopen and the crisis wanes, our manufacturing sector will indeed be far more future-ready than ever.
At the recent ITAP 2020 virtual conference in October—which you can recap here—the pandemic was viewed as the real villain to some of the progress made, yet also accepted as a galvanising force.
When Singapore’s economy recovers, our Industry 4.0-ready manufacturing sector will sustain us for the next era of growth. For the rest of us, we just need to make sure we’re just as ready, and just as resilient as they are.

Why Investing in ETFs is Like Keeping Mint Condition Cards in Album Sleeves,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-investing-etfs-like-keeping-mint-condition-cards-album-sleeves-nikko/,27-Oct-20,"All illustrations by Ansh Sirohi.
Note: This is the third part of a series on financial literacy and ETFs. Here’re the first and second parts.
Till today, once in a while at least, I would pull out my Magic The Gathering (MtG) album and gaze transfixed at the black-framed collector’s edition cards I own. If you’re not in the know, MtG is a popular and competitive collectible card game that blends slick artwork and strategic gameplay, which became extremely popular in the early 1990s. It is still massively played today, with online versions on mobile and PC.
Anyway, my cards have been preserved since I was a pimply-faced Polytechnic student in 1993. Short of owning a Black Lotus card—the mother of all MtG cards—my collection now commands a respectable value if I choose to put them up for sale.
What’s even better, is that the Russo brothers (who did the Marvel Cinematic Universe two-part Avengers films) will be creating an animated series of Magic The Gathering for Netflix. Who knows? Maybe we’ll see a resurgence in value for mint-condition MtG collectible cards, especially the ones I’ve kept since 1993.
But where am I going with all this? Well, for starters, everything we do and invest our time in life has a perceived value. It gets better if everyone else sees that value the same way I do, like MtG cards.
With the investments I’ve made since I started earning my first pay cheque, whether they’re a house, stocks, ETFs, commodities or investment-linked savings plans, I’ve adopted the same principle as I did with my MtG card collection: I try to forecast their perceived value.
As you mature and age, you usually get less inclined to try new things. Let’s just say we all fall into our favourite ‘routines’ and figure out what works for each one of us. So, as a teenager, I was doing a lot of experimenting, which made sense at the time, because the future was way ahead of me. But well, times are different now. I’m older, with a family, with loans and bills to pay.
Which explains why, over the years, I’ve taken a greater interest in exchange-traded funds.
Sure, you may argue that hot stocks and gold are all the rave these days, but I’ve been there enough times to know anxiety and panic when I feel it. And as I’ve gotten older, with responsibilities that include not just myself as an individual, but my family and kids, I need to steer clear of FOMOs and crashes, and look towards steady money and growth.
Nope. Don’t do it…
By now, you’ve probably heard about Nikko Asset Management and its suite of exchange-traded funds. We already talked about it here and here.
The appeal behind Nikko AM’s two funds—the ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund and Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF—resonates with me on different levels. For starters, it comes with terms like “AAA-rated Government bonds”, “Investment-Grade” household names and “dollar-cost-averaging”.
RICE-pedia time:
AAA-rated: Also known as Triple-A (AAA), like when you score an A in Additional Mathematics and you go home and tell your mummy you scored a triple A. I’m kidding. A Triple-A bond rating is the highest rating bond agencies award to an investment, which means it has a lower risk of default and thus, is more creditworthy. Once again, less stress. Note that the AAA rating applies to the Singapore government bonds held by the ABF Singapore Bond Index.
Government bonds: I think it’s safe (sort of) to liken this to those grand movie finales where your sidekick (the government in this case) walks up to you after an intense shoot-out, puts a hand on your shoulder and says ‘I’ve got your back’. Once again, while it’s no guarantee, it’s always good to hear. Note that the Singapore government bonds are held under the ABF Singapore Bond Index.
Investment-Grade (IG) household names: This usually refers to the quality of a company’s credit. In financial speak, to be “investment-grade”, the company must be rated ‘BBB’ or higher by bond credit rating agencies like Standard and Poor or Moody. Anything rated ‘BB’ or lower is known as junk grade. So IG is a reflection of how probable the company is in repaying its debt. Note that when we’re referring to household names, we’re talking about companies like OCBC, NTUC, LTA, etc. in the Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF.
Dollar-cost-averaging: DCA for short, it’s a strategy where investors divide up the total amount invested across periodic purchases of an asset to reduce volatility in the overall purchase. It’s like buying supplies at the supermarket. As prices fluctuate over time, you buy more when prices are lower (or discounted) and less when prices are high—the net effect is the average cost of your supplies is cheaper overall.
Through a regular savings plan, it’s as simple as parking as little as S$100 per month into each of them. Just like how I stash aside my checkered winter-wear in a remote portion of my cubby or know that my MtG cards are mint-cozy in their jacket sleeves, appreciating in value (and usefulness) when the time’s right, so it is with ETFs.
Just in case you’re a fairly risk averse individual who has been monitoring the Singapore government’s policies and successes, Nikko AM’s ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund seems to echo the same sentiment. I mean, it’s basically investing in the Singapore government. Image credit: Nikko Asset Management, August 2020.
A majority of the ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund invests into the government of Singapore. The rest are made up by LTA, HDB, Temasek Financial, SP PowerAssets and so on. Even a layman can tell you that this fund is “quite solid”…
To put things in perspective, if you’re investing in the ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund, you’re hopeful that the government of Singapore will see things through. If you’re looking for diversification in assets, it’s a good step into government bonds as an asset class (other than your mandated CPF contributions of course).
Investing in the ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund is like having a pizza party in your house with the Singapore government. You’re basically hoping fiscal and monetary policies come through in the long run and you get to partake in the eventual success of the government’s performance.
On the other hand, the Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, slides a notch into government-linked, corporate finance territory. It counts finance corporations as its key holders. OCBC, DBS, UOB, NTUC Income Insurance, Manulife, National Australia Bank, Temasek Financial and LTA, you name them. (as of 31 August 2020)
When you look at its sector allocation, we’re talking a diverse spread across sovereign, banks, investment firms, insurance, real estate, REITS and others.
The Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF broadens the weightage across corporate finance, most of which are government-linked. Image credit: Nikko Asset Management, August 2020
Here’s a visual to help explain what the SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF really means—remember how you’re always wondering which wedding table and guests you’ll be seated with? With this ETF, you’re seated with some corporate bankers, insurers, sovereign wealth fund managers and real estate investors. Oh, and you get to yam seng with them.
If you’re investing in this ETF, you’re spreading your risk across multiple sectors, but keeping them to traditionally higher performing ones. Despite what naysayers are saying about Covid-19 being a dampener of sorts, don’t forget what would happen when a vaccine is eventually found, everyone’s gunning to hit the ground running and the turnaround swoops us off our feet.
Trust me. It’s happened several times before. After the Asian and Global Financial Crises of 1997 and 2008-09 respectively, Singapore policymakers undertook unprecedented monetary and fiscal policy measures to stem an outflow of capital. These policies helped the city state bounce back faster and stronger than many other regional economies.
Which brings me back to my earlier example. If you’re going to invest in ETFs, and you want to diversify your S$200 or more a month at least, both ETFs are there to cover you along the spectrum between aversion and appetite.
Like I’ve said, it’s not just because these ETFs are simple to understand, or that their fees are much lower and they offer diversification, it’s also that just-in-case, when the weather turns, and the line on the chart suddenly swings. So it makes sense that when it comes to ETFs, both the ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund and the Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF keep that see-saw of risk balanced.
Like past crises we’ve seen since the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997, 9/11, SARS and the Global Financial Crisis, it’s always prudent to spread out our risks. The impact of the financial crisis affected primarily the housing and financial markets, 9/11 and SARS affected the travel and healthcare industries, and now, with Covid-19, we’re seeing impacts, and the need for critical changes, across industries.
And like any swinging pendulum, when every industry starts to find its footing and recovers, I hope to be on the right side of it … and you should too.

How To Have Your Steak And Eat It Too: A RICE Guide To Exchange-Traded Funds,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-how-have-steak-and-eat-rice-guide-exchange-traded-funds-nikko/,28-Jul-20,"Image credit: Vitaliy Zalishchyker on Unsplash
You know, what’s the difference between someone who invests and someone who doesn’t? A S$500 steak.
You heard me. An 8-year-old aged succulent steak from one of the finest restaurants here, which poor old me will never touch with a 10-foot pole.
But that’s what my well-to-do friend treated me to for a weekday lunch. And he had the same thing two weeks ago.
Mind you, he’s only 2 years older than me. Of course, he didn’t get this wealthy from simply investing. He was someone who worked in the finance industry for years.
Still, let’s contrast the two of us. We are now working independently for ourselves. Except I didn’t work in the finance industry and am part of the financially illiterate masses.
Chances are, you are like me. You feel like me. Working in some deadbeat job, counting the hours away. What’s wrong with simple cai png lunches? Life sucks but bubble tea is my perk, okay?
Let’s not delude ourselves. To be in a position like my friend is admirable. Now we don’t have to be that rich. But who doesn’t want being able to have broader lifestyle choices without worries? That’s priceless. That’s what financial independence is all about.
So let’s stop salivating about the steak for the time being. Instead, feast on these succulent tips from my friend (let’s call him Mr Wise) which are as big and helpful as his tip to the waiter.
Tip #1 – “Don’t just focus on saving. Think Invest.”
You must have heard these golden rules incessantly by now. Save 20% of your salary. Accumulate up to 6 months’ worth of expenses as emergency savings. Move your money around banks with higher interest rates.
Oh yea, don’t eat that avocado toast. Hey, do I see you reaching out your credit card to pay that off?
Just assume this is my friend, Mr. Wise. The real dude is camera-shy. Image credit: mentatdgt from Pexels
In all seriousness, meeting these fundamentals is really the bare minimum. I have seen vociferous debates among colleagues about which credit card for this fancy dinner date, how to shop smartly to earn airflyer points, etc.
But Mr Wise frankly regards all these chatter as mindless and time-consuming. Yes, do find ways to spend less, but let’s use that brain to grow more notes in our bank accounts.
Because if you don’t know by now, banks generally offer you low interest rates on your deposits. Especially with Covid-19, banks have moved to cut these rates further. Even with a fixed deposit of S$20,000 to S$30,000 dollars, you are looking at 1-3% annual interest.
Dude, that can’t afford my S$500 steak.
Face it. Saving isn’t enough. So we better learn to get comfortable with investing. Play it right and conservatively, you may be able to still gain more than a measly 1%.
Especially if you truly do not have S$20,000 to S$30,000 dollars (if not…pssstt no worries, you and I are the same. Let’s jump in together).
Tip #2 – “Can’t play big? Start small and build steadily.”
In the world of investments, there are many options. You got stocks, bonds, unit trusts, equity funds, physical property, REITs. Heck, I know some guys who invest in wines and art pieces. A doctor I know spends anywhere from $10,000 to $30,000 on a single modern Chinese art piece. If you know the art of it, you can grow the value of these assets.
But if you are like me, who knows nuts about these things and doesn’t have the money to spend on branded goods, tough. You already work from 7AM to 6PM, working OT almost every other day. Maybe you have children, or you are spending your free time in the gym (which is important!). Recently, it was found that 1 in 3 Singaporeans do not invest and are not financially prepared for retirement. Sounds like you?
Let’s be honest. We may not have the time or patience to read business reports, scrutinise the business press from page to page or attending AGM meetings as it can be daunting and feel boring.

Simply put, it pays to acknowledge our risk appetite honestly. Not all of us are cut out for it. We need an option for dummies. One that has low cost entry and is transparent.
After all the hours of research into financial guide books and conversations with knowledgeable investors, including Mr Wise, I realize this: we have to consider investing in stocks. But not just stocks of any kind. Specifically Exchange-traded funds (ETFs) because “they are one of the best ways for an average person to build wealth steadily.”
Why? Simple. As I said, unless you truly have the interest to research the industry of your chosen stock, dig into the company’s financial records, track their performance over the years, it’s a foolhardy option to think you can do it by yourself. In textbook jargon, we are essentially pursuing passive investment strategies, since we can’t actively watch our investments.
Perhaps you heard of people saying just dive into blue-chip companies. There’s local companies like Singapore Airlines, ComfortDelGro and Genting Singapore which you can buy shares into. But as the unpredictable COVID-19 pandemic has shown, these businesses can take a beating when consumers stop flying, travelling and holidaying. If you aren’t stressed enough with losing your job, you will have to worry about the volatility of your investments.
Plus, I am going to show you there are some advantages to ETFs than buying stocks on your own.
You get my drift? Okay, now you are probably asking, what are ETFs?
Start small, build steadily and diversify
Tip #3 – “Go low and diversify.”
The textbook definition of ETFs reads: ETFs are unit trusts that are listed and traded on the stock exchange and can hold assets such as stocks, commodities, or bonds. Investors can buy and sell the units in ETFs at market prices any time during trading hours on an exchange, just like how stocks of listed companies are transacted on the exchange.
Huh? I hear you stammer.
It’s simple. You know how they say don’t put all your eggs into one basket? Especially for investments? Diversify, diversify, diversify. You must have heard this motto cited repetitiously.
I cautioned not to invest in stocks on your own. But with an ETF, you are investing into a basket (fund) of different stocks, commodities or bonds mixed together. Why choose only chocolate when you can have an amalgamation of chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, coconut and hazelnut flavours?
A good start would be ETFs that allows you to gain easy access to sovereign bonds, or government bonds, which are issued by governments with periodic returns and a face-value repayment upon maturity. There are also bonds offered by established institutions (ie. corporate bonds). Nikko AM’s ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund and SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF are two such examples.
The ABF Singapore Bond Index Fund primarily invests in high-quality bonds issued primarily by the Singapore government and quasi-Singapore government entities. Bonds may be viewed as a safer option than stocks because they are less volatile. And with a Bond ETF, you can diversify your investment portfolio even more with a small amount of capital.

There’s also the Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF, which consists of corporate bonds from established and credible institutions such as the Housing Development Board (HDB), DBS Bank, Temasek Financial and the Land Transport Authority (LTA)*.

Investing can be pretty daunting for a first time investor as you may be worried about which stock to invest in but Mr Wise explained to me, when you invest in ETFs, you don’t have to worry about stock picking as the ETF just invests into the stocks or bonds held by the index that the ETF invests into.
Sounds good, right? That’s why ETFs have become popular (if you never heard of this, it’s probably because nobody around you is aware of their affordability). It’s considered ideal for beginners since it has low expense fees, lower investment risk and offers a wide range of choices.
I remind you again, unless you are the sort who has money at hand to invest into the next Creative or Facebook, or afford the increasing taxes on property purchase, ETFs are generally a safer choice.
Tip #4 – “Don’t bite off more than you can chew. Budget with eyes wide open.”
Now this is where things get tricky. The options for ETFs are indeed vast. Do a Google search, and you will be swamped with ETF product advertisements from various banks. There are also private asset management firms that offer their own too. You can also choose from the list of popular ETFs, like the ones from Nikko Asset Management in Singapore.
But just like choosing your flavour of bubble tea, or the delicacy of steak, you want to weigh your options. Choosing food is easy if you already know your palate, how do you choose which fund if you don’t know your appetite for risk yet?
To make it real simple for now, Mr Wise narrows it down to two main factors—just like choosing your favourite food: budget and risk appetite.
Maybe you can only afford $100. Or $1000. If you truly can afford to, maybe $5000 to $10,000.
However, make sure it’s something you can afford without hurting your future. Whatever the amount, Mr Wise says you can “spread it the same way” because there is no minimum purchase commitment.
If a lump sum investment is difficult, you can opt for a regular savings plan, which is subscription-based. This method relies on dollar-cost averaging, i.e. the same amount of funds is used to buy more units of ETFs when prices are low and buy less when prices are high.
No calculated risk, no potential gain, is that how it is these days? Image credit: Lum3n from Pexels
Simply put, by investing passively, it reduces the stress of investing as a response to market trends. You have less to worry when the markets fall and drop like a busted hot-air balloon, as you are investing for the long term.
Another advantage of investing with an ETF like the ABF Singapore Bond Index is you can tap on your CPF money to invest into it. Pretty neat huh? You don’t even have to use the money you’ve been saving for your next holiday. And unlike spending hundreds of dollars, other than using your CPF monies to invest, you can invest via a Regular Savings Plan which can start from as low as S$100 per month (not for all funds lah. But remember, this is the start).
That addresses your budget concerns. What about risk appetite? Like how you rather pay more for a nice five-course meal than cheap fast food for your partner’s birthday—you should invest with an understanding of how much you can gain or lose. Don’t forsake your relationship for a cheap bite.
Mr Wise loves his exquisite steaks and Malaysia-style curry chicken rice (which he nominated for his last meal), and advises you to approach investment based on a balance of risk and reward. You can choose McDonalds today because you are feeling good and can indulge. But when you are feeling unwell and eating junk food means receiving a medical bill in the end, why take the risk? Check the health of your finances and make regular assessments of your investments.
When you look at the various ETFs to buy from, you should look at their strengths and weaknesses under different conditions. Some ETFs stay resilient during hard times and some react accordingly to the dictates of market forces. Some will provide dividends.
Under the CPF website, you can find information on the level of risks for different investment options. For instance, as of 22 April 2020, the ABF Singapore Bond Index and Nikko AM SGD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF are featured as low- to medium-risk while the Nikko AM Singapore STI Index are relatively higher-risk but may provide higher returns. You may refer to the CPF website for the latest info.
To minimize risk, always check authorized websites (like the CPF website above) to get the right information about financial products. Always do your own due diligence.
If all this is confusing to you, don’t be embarrassed. There are thousands of articles out there offering different advice, when to buy this ETF or that ETF, why this ETF isn’t as good or that ETF is better. This isn’t as intuitive as knowing your appetite or your loved ones’.
So instead of spending hours sieving through all this, why not get a little help?
Tip #5 – “You are not alone. Get help. Real help.”
In the immortal words of Jerry Maguire, “show me the money!” (Has this quote outlived the millennial generation?). But money is not going to rain down by shouting into a phone so let’s see how we can be smarter about ETFs.
Now some of you may want to be like Jerry Maguire (with matching dashing looks to Tom Cruise) and you want to strike out on your own. Maybe this article makes it sound so fool-proof. It’s not impossible; there are ways to buy ETFs on your own. With countless coaching websites and books on investments, my friend supports the idea that people can work their way up.
No, we're not going to say it. Image credit: Jerry Maguire, Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group
But if you work a 60-hour job, that’s a tall order. And just like how you rely on an insurance agent to build your portfolio, it is perfectly fine to look into financial institutions to kickstart your insurance portfolio. Asset management firms can add value and help provide options for you to build your investment portfolio.
Now don’t search for any random firm that pops up from your 10-minute Google search. As any counsel will advise you, look at aspects like the track record of the institution or the profile of the fund managers. They won’t make you as rich as Warren Buffet by next year so have a reasonable expectation of their performance.
On your own, whether you use them or not, you will want to study the intricacies of ETFs. Look into aspects like the size of the fund, performance history, expense ratio, dividend distribution and other KPIs.
Especially expense ratio and dividend distribution. Since the former determines how much of your returns are eaten by expenses, and the latter determines how much and when you are getting back your returns. Show me more money, right?
In addition, don’t forget if you want to diversify your investment even further, you can consider other types of ETFs.
For instance, consider a company like Nikko Asset Management who is one of Asia’s largest asset managers and ETF provider. They provide sophisticated and diverse solutions and have a broad range of Asian-based ETFs. Heck, if you have an environmental conscience, they are certified as a carbon-neutral organisation!

Stepping into the World of Investment
If there’s one thing I may be too presumptuous about, it’s this: you are not going to get instantly rich like my friend just by investing into ETFs.
It’s not in me to pull a Wolf of Wall Street act here.
He gets to have S$500 steaks and S$200 Japanese lunches because he put his life’s work into the intricate world of investment. His portfolio consists of many other stuff that I haven’t touched on, e.g. equities, REITs, property investments.
But we all have to start somewhere. If you are someone younger, it’s not impossible to develop a richer investment portfolio eventually. If like me, time (and money) is running out because you got a mortgage and bills and a family to feed, then this is one of the best routes to start.
Like knowing your food preferences and allergies, get acquainted with your risk appetite. Look into questionnaires or have a financial adviser assess your risk preferences and design a conservative approach.

Be prudent about how much you are putting in. Nobody has ever not lost money in the world of investment. Even with ETFs, you could lose money because the returns don’t equate to the fees paid and money you have put in.
But if you are looking for a low-cost entry, invest for the long haul, and utilise many of the tips here, there’s no reason why your money can’t start growing today.
With ETFs, it’s like a secret weapon to level up your money first and fast.
And maybe one day, you can treat me to that S$500 steak.

Learning To Code Won't Save Us From An Uncertain Future",Douglas Oh,TRUE,TRUE
More Than 900 Families Don’t Have A Laptop For HBL. Volunteers Are Trying To Fix This Problem,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-engineering-good-laptop-hbl/,18-Apr-20,"Images courtesy of Engineering Good.
When the decision to close schools and conduct home-based learning (HBL) was announced on 4th April, Rebecca (not her real name), a single mother, approached her child’s primary school for help. She didn’t have a laptop, and was worried that her child could not do HBL.
The school didn’t dismiss Rebecca, but neither did it offer a solution. It simply recommended that she let her child access Student Learning Space (SLS) via her smartphone.
But SLS didn’t work on her smartphone, perhaps because it was on an old operating system, or because the hardware couldn’t support it.
Panicking that her child would be left behind in their studies, Rebecca reached out to community organisations and self-organised groups of parents. Eventually, she stumbled upon Engineering Good, a local non-profit organisation that was refurbishing donated laptops and distributing them to needy families for HBL.
Here, she thought, she could finally get the help that families like hers needed.
After some back-and-forth emails with MTI, Engineering Good managed to get classified an essential service, so its volunteers are allowed to go to the office.
Engineering Good‘s campaign, Computers Against Covid, had its seeds in an urgent request the group received from South Central Family Services Centre (SCFSC) on 31st March.
Would Engineering Good happen to have eight spare laptops?
SCFSC was in contact with families who lived in 1- to 2-room rental flats around Redhill, many of whom struggle to afford basic necessities, let alone laptops, and were worried their children would not be able to do HBL.
Within two days of that request, Engineering Good—with the typical efficiency of engineers—activated its network of volunteers, solicited donations, refurbished laptops, and sent them off to these families.
That was supposed to be it. But word got out that a group was refurbishing donated laptops and distributing them to underprivileged children who needed them for HBL. Engineering Good’s Facebook page, which receives around two messages yearly, was suddenly flooded by pleas from needy families like Rebecca’s.
Wishing to support these families, Engineering Good officially launched their Computers Against Covid campaign on 4th April.
From the eight laptop requests last week, today—just a week and a half later—that number has mushroomed hundred-fold to 879. The group is also talking to the Ministry of Education (MOE): How can they work together to support these families? Why, in the first place, are there families who were not properly equipped before HBL started? Is there a digital divide in Singapore that schools are widening, not bridging?
Saad Chinoy, a volunteer at Engineering Good.
“I don’t know,” Saad Chinoy, who handles marcomms at Engineering Good, says helplessly. “I’m a geek. I don’t know anything about this … All I see is, kids need laptops. Let’s give it to them.”
In ordinary times, Engineering Good provides assistive technology to people with disabilities.
For instance, they teach caregivers of cerebral palsy patients how to turn a $5 doorbell button into one that works with assistive technology devices. These buttons are important because they allow patients to get used to physical stimuli of various shapes and pressures; the buttons can also be used to operate mechanised drawers, for example, that patients are otherwise unable to open.
But manufacturers of assistive technology devices often charge upwards of $50 for one button.
“And that’s just a button, not including the thing that the button turns on,” Saad exclaims, incredulous.
Engineering Good, in other words, makes assistive technology accessible to people who need them the most.
Since the circuit breaker and HBL began, however, Engineering Good has devoted all its time and manpower to soliciting laptop donations, refurbishing these laptops, and sending them off to families in need.
This is how the process works:
First, people who wish to donate a laptop—regardless of its working condition—and any spare accessories, such as mice or laptop bags, fill in a form online.
Next, a volunteer will pick up the laptop and send it to the nearest of Engineering Good’s 12 distributed processing centres (DPC)—”which is a fancy way of describing [the place where] a bunch of geeks who have no life fix laptops,” Saad laughs.
At the DPC, a tech-savvy volunteer will sanitise the laptop and try to boot it. If it doesn’t work, they will check the internal components, reinstall Windows, and so on, until they resurrect it.
Once 5 to 10 laptops have been refurbished, a volunteer will courier them to Engineering Good’s head office at Henderson Road. There, the logistics of sending these laptops out to beneficiaries will be handled by another team of volunteers.
I make it sound simple. But, as anyone who has tried to reformat Windows knows, it really isn’t.
“When you install Windows, it’s an exercise in patience. And if you install Windows on a clunky old laptop …” Saad groans, the silence that follows capturing his frustration.
So volunteers don’t only need the technical expertise, but also supernatural patience. Saad estimates that it can take hours just to refurbish one laptop, though he can work on a few of them simultaneously while he waits for Windows to finish installing.
Furthermore, because of privacy issues, some laptops are donated without a hard disk drive, so volunteers have to scavenge components from unsalvageable “craptops” and put them into these hollowed out laptops, creating a “franken-laptop”.
And this doesn’t even take into account the logistical headache volunteers face of matching and delivering laptops to beneficiaries, a task made more painful by the circuit breaker measures.
I’ve mentioned the word “volunteer” about 10 times in the above paragraphs, which should give you a hint that Engineering Good runs solely on the goodwill and generosity of volunteers. Saad explains that the group only has “one-and-a-half employees: our executive director [Johann Annuar], and a finance person who works part-time”
In fact, prior to launching their Computers against Covid campaign, Engineering Good only had 4 to 5 volunteers. Within two weeks, they now count 85 people—as of 17 April— who have signed up to contribute their time and labour despite most having other commitments.
Saad himself is juggling a full-time job with his volunteering efforts. I ask him how he balances the two.
“Badly. Very badly … I think I’m going to get fired soon,” he laughs.
“Half the day I spend with [my company], the other half at Engineering Good … weekends are completely a blackhole. I go to [Engineering Good’s office] on Friday and I’m back [home] on Monday.”
Saad pauses.
“What’s the date today?”
Saad is surprised at how quickly the initial call for help has exploded and taken on a life of its own.
“[Singapore] has WiFi coming out of our ears. If our WiFi goes down, everybody freaks out, everybody looks for me, the Indian tech guy, to fix the WiFi.’”
Saad is speaking satirically, but like all satire, it has its basis in truth. Just two days ago, the whole RICE office panicked when StarHub’s internet started dying in patches. As a nation, we’ve taken fast and seamless internet connection for granted. It’s almost inconceivable that any home in Singapore does not have WiFi.
Statistics concur. Singapore’s Wireless Broadband Penetration Rate in Jan 2020 was 190.5%, which suggests that each person in Singapore has more than one smartphone and more than one internet connection.
So, as Saad points out, it is puzzling—and concerning—that there are families whom we don’t know about who do not have the ability to provide their children with a laptop and internet connection.
“What this seems to reveal,” Saad reflects, “is that [this digital divide] is common. It’s more widespread than we thought. We have very little visibility into these gaps across Singapore.”
“This is not a tech problem. This is a social problem.”
Engineering Good, Saad is careful to stress, is not trying to solve this social problem. They are only providing the tools as a band-aid, a stopgap measure.
As Saad implies, there are larger structural cracks in Singapore society that have given rise to the wound Engineering Good is attempting to staunch. But these are issues so fundamental that a small non-profit organisation like Engineering Good is by no means able to address.
“So we started talking to the agencies,” Saad says, “the normal channels that are supposed to fill in this gap.”
Saad emphasises that these channels have already initiated some support schemes.
For example, MOE has loaned about 3300 laptops to students after the HBL announcement was made. A CNA article reports that “MOE expects more students and parents to come forward on Monday and Tuesday, before the first day of full-home based learning on Wednesday, and is prepared to loan out more devices.”
In addition, the Infocomm Media Development Authority runs a NEU PC Plus Programme that allows disadvantaged households to buy a new computer at a subsidised rate.
Saad is not privy to the discussions with MOE either: they are being handled by Johann, Engineering Good’s executive director. So he can’t comment on the principles shaping Singapore’s social and educational policies.
All he knows is what the numbers on the ground tell him: “Yes, it is true that [3300] devices are going out … but it leaves people with a false impression that it’s going to be more than enough. There is still a minority group that somehow doesn’t qualify.”
“We are just organically picking up people, like Rebecca, who fall into the gap.”
This photograph was taken a few days ago so it doesn't reflect the most updated figures. But it gives a sense of how quickly the numbers—both of requests and requests fulfilled—are jumping.
A happy recipient of Engineering Good's refurbishment and donation drive.
Since HBL started, Engineering Good has sent out 160 laptops—152 more than they were supposed to.
But there are still 719 children waiting for a laptop so they can carry out their HBL. Even though people have pledged approximately 700 laptops within two weeks, only 40% can be refurbished, Saad says. Engineering Good still needs more laptop donations so no child is left behind.
And despite the disheartening reality of underprivileged families in Singapore falling through the cracks, Saad is remarkably optimistic about the situation.
Yes, there are gaps in the system, Saad acknowledges. But there’s a silver lining to it.
“I am Indian but I have been in Singapore for 20 years … In India this would not even be a thing. It would be a dream for me, as an Indian, to be able to reach out to a ministry and even have them listen.”
“Singapore has got everything it needs. It has the ability to respond to the situation. It has agencies that are listening, it has agencies that are talking … It just needs to work.”
In the meantime, as the agencies are working on patching these holes, the community—among them, Engineering Good and its volunteers—has stepped up.
“There are skilled and experienced people who are channeling their skills to bridge it.”
“I’m generally very cynical. I feel like we’re living in a Black Mirror episode, mostly,” Saad laughs. “But this … It sort of restores my faith in humanity.”

What The Zaobao Forum Letter Incident Reveals About Singapore's Echo Chambers",Yeo Boon Ping,TRUE,TRUE
"Meet Jane, The Insurance Agent Who Gave Up Career, Marriage, And Condo To Be A Digital Nomad",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-meet-jane-insurance-agent-gave-up-career-marriage-condo-digital-nomad/,21-May-21,"Immigration has become a hot topic in the past year. But thus far, the discussion has mainly been centred around foreigners that choose to come to Singapore. But what about the other side of the picture? In this ‘Singaporeans Abroad’ series, we share with you the stories of locals who—thanks to living in a globalised world—have found success in different corners of the globe, whether financially, romantically, or for the pure joy of adventure.
Recently, we brought you the Singaporean working with refugees in Syria, and the Singaporean who moved to Australia to become a land developer.
Now, we bring you Jane Tor Ying Le, the Singaporean who had it all: the career, car, and condo. But after her marriage fell apart, she decided to leave it all behind and start a new life as a digital nomad. This is how her journey began.
My name is Jane, and I’m a digital nomad. I’m far from living what most Singaporeans consider to be a “successful life,” but success to me means being able to unlearn those toxic benchmarks of what happiness looks like. Success to me means living a life I’m proud of. Success to me means having an individual thought process, not manipulated by society or family. It took me a long time to realise I didn’t want what most of my friends wanted, and it took one year of backpacking in 2020 to realize I thrive the best in situations where I’m physically and mentally challenged.
I used to have what most of my friends wanted. I went to a good JC, then I studied politics at NUS. About 4 years ago, I got to the point where I was earning about $7000 a month in an insurance career. I had a husband who was an airforce pilot, I lived in a condo, had a car, had everything that I thought would make me happy. Except it didn’t. They were good goals and dreams—but they weren’t mine.
In 2016 when I won top case count in my insurance company.
3 years ago, I quit my insurance job and travelled to China to learn about businesses there. It was then that I realized how small our bubble is in Singapore.
My marriage was also not doing well. We had very idealistic visions of what love is. I now believe that you receive what you are putting out into the universe, and at that time, we were giving each other what we were looking for. Eventually, we learned that’s not the best foundation on which to build a relationship. If you get into a relationship to nurse your own wounds or to fill a gap in you, it can be toxic. So within two years, it all fell apart.
It was a very powerful wake up call for me because I realised I had gotten myself in this situation. There was no one else to blame but myself.
May 2018 wedding ceremony.
In an attempt to nurse a broken heart, I left Singapore in January of 2020 to go on a one month backpacking trip to Mexico. Covid was exploding all over Asia and Europe, and against all odds, I decided to stay out of Singapore.
It was the best decision I could have made, because the energy in Mexico didn’t allow me to be down. And because it was the first time I solo travelled, I was forced to get out of my comfort zone. I didn’t have time to be sad. I met so many amazing travellers with whom I shared my story, and every time they would share something of their life too. Speaking to others about their pain helped me deal with my own.
There was one Australian woman in Mexico who really inspired me to change my life. She has been travelling for 12 years, and the more she backpacks the more she wants to do it long term. When I met her she was running an Aussie cafe and giving haircuts.
When I asked her why she was travelling for so long, she said: “I come from a first world country. In Australia, the minimum wage is high enough that I could always go back, get a decent job and live a decent life. I probably won’t be super happy but I wouldn’t be suffering either. Look around you, besides you and me, everyone comes from a developing country. If they can make it work, why can’t you? Anytime you want, you always have a home to return to.”
That’s when I realised: I need to stop worrying about my future if I’m not even enjoying my present. Like that, I decided not to return to Singapore.
Building a makeshift shelter in Chacahua, Mexico.
I went to Europe and I picked up volunteering opportunities so I could continue traveling while reducing expenses. I worked in exchange for food and a bed—I was a babysitter, worked in a hostel in Albania, and did construction work as the only girl in the team. One month became one year. One year has now become an indefinite amount of time.
During the first lockdown, I spent 5 months in England doing light construction work and helping out with chores. It was the most liberating few months of my life. I was “working” 25 hours a week in exchange for a bed and all meals provided—money was not really the point of work.
I did the chores I was given because I really wanted to. I took every job as a way to learn a new skill. I got upgraded by mowing with an entry level mower to a diesel powered one, and that day, I mowed the lawn with the biggest smile on my face. I had earned this ‘promotion’. For those few months, I spent so much time gardening, weeding, playing with chickens, pigs, one horse and a few dogs, and I cooked so much with my host family. Every other week, we had bonfires, something Singaporeans don’t really get to experience.
Raising chickens in the UK. This one is called Paulie.
Those jobs taught me that the life I thought I enjoyed in Singapore was not actually for me. All I need to be happy is a good sunset, to be close to the sea, to surf, and to connect with good people. I also realised how little I need materially as I just kept shedding luggage weight the more I travelled.
When I came back to visit Singapore for two months at the start of 2021, I couldn’t adapt. I was so happy and free the whole year, but the minute I arrived in Singapore I felt like I re-downloaded all the stress, worries and concerns most Singaporeans have. My entire headspace just went nuts from everything that was going on. I felt detached, and I would find myself in conversations my friends were having and I’d think, “Why am I here? Why are we talking about things that don’t matter to me at all?”
I love Singapore, and I love my country, but if I can’t feel at home there, then where can I feel at home? I felt sad because I knew I would no longer be able to fit in, at least for the time being. So I bought a one-way ticket to Croatia, and here I am now.
Van tripping around Scotland.
I live a digital nomad life, working remotely for a Singapore Edu-tech company. While I live in Zagreb, I regularly move around to different coastal towns and other cities. I intend to work as a nomad for the next few years at least. Now that I’ve tasted the freedom … it will be hard to go back to being plugged into the Matrix.
Finding a company that would let me work remotely was a testament to me that if you live life the way you want it to, things will fall into place over time. I took about a 50% pay cut, but considering how expensive life in Singapore is, it still works out better for me this way.
Despite me being happy, there is of course a lot of judgment from people. One of my mum’s friends had recently written a whole article for Lianhe Wanbao about how her friend’s daughter (i.e. me) gave up a good life and a marriage to become a hippie. She was worried that I was getting older and that I wasn’t on the right path in life, so she was basically writing asking how to confront my mum about this. Luckily my mum stopped her from publishing the article and told her that she believed I was resilient, and that it was up to me to live my life how I wanted to.
While I actually don’t mind people calling me a hippie, I wish I could tell them that if you’re not living life the way you want to, then a lot of the decisions you make are based on what you think you should do, not what you want. That’s how people wake up at 40 and realize they lived their last 10 years clueless, and ask themselves how they got here. I see that with people my age too in fact. There are so many people who are lost, even young kids and people in their early twenties.
Showing my parents around Croatia.
I know many people who are in the same situation as me, with no real obligations to stay in Singapore and have always wanted to venture abroad but hold so much fear that they will be ‘lagging behind’ in society if they put their careers on hold for even just a few months.
It’s also so sad that people care so much about what others think of them—reputation is everything in Singapore (and around the world too.) When you’re young, it’s who is on the VIP list in the club, or who is in the box by the DJ. At F1, are you invited to the after-party or the after-after party? Then when people go through divorces or any other difficult situation, we don’t talk about them. We only talk about the good things—like the 100,000 dollar wedding this or that person had, but we don’t talk about the divorce that came after that.
Even when I was talking about my divorce it was shocking to people. They would say, ‘how can you talk about this so publicly? Aren’t you embarrassed?’ And I thought, if I have to sit through you reposting your wedding photos month after month, why can’t I speak about something that equally impacted me?
To wrap it up, yes—I’m 29, divorced, working in a completely different industry than I started with, I no longer have the car or condo, but I’ve never been happier in my life. I remember owning so many material things and spending more because I had more earning power, but none of them ever made me feel fulfilled. In fact, the more I owned, the more empty I felt.
Growing up, we weren’t given many choices. We weren’t even told that we can choose to not make a decision right away. We weren’t introduced to the idea of a gap year, which I am happy to hear now is being encouraged in some institutions. Our educational system creates unrealistic goals of what studying hard can get you.
I want to tell people out there, to live a life they want. To live a life that they will be happy with after the next 2 decades. I want to inspire more Singaporeans to journey out, go slow traveling, really face their fears and conquer them. I think as a small and mighty population, we have a lot of power to do more good in our societies and in the world. But when we stay in our bubbles of security and comfort, we remain selfish and unkind to each other, we remain indifferent and self serving.
Of course, I’m not saying that’s true of all Singaporeans. I know that Singaporeans are full of heart, full of joy and many are just trapped in a vicious cycle of wanting to live up to expectations and obligations. I’m just saying that it’s time for us to face these limitations we put upon ourselves and allow us to make our own decisions.

Looking Ahead: The Case For Why Youth Are Our Nation's Hope",Edoardo Liotta,TRUE,TRUE
The Singapore-Hong Kong Travel Bubble Was Always a Risk Worth Taking,https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-opinion-singapore-hong-kong-air-travel-bubble-always-risk-worth-taking/,23-Nov-20,"In Netflix’s hit show Crash Landing On You, translated literally as Love’s Emergency Landing, Yoon Se-ri, a wealthy South Korean heiress gets blown off course by ‘a sudden tornado’ while paragliding over Seoul, South Korea.
After crash-landing in the DMZ of North Korea, Se-ri awakens to find herself staring deeply into the eyes of North Korean Captain Ri Jeong-hyeok, played by Korean heartthrob Hyun Bin.
The face that launched a thousand nuclear warheads.
Cue the will-they-won’t-they foreplay, until, to no one’s surprise, the two fall madly in love, proving once again that in order to have the fairytale ending we want, someone needs to throw caution to the wind and say ‘I love you’—even amidst the possibility of a thermonuclear war.
This, in essence, was what the postponed Singapore-Hong Kong travel bubble was all about: two star-crossed cities, separated by a global pandemic, who were willing to take that first step towards opening up again.
The Travel Bubble Crash Lands Into Reality
First, let me state for the record: there is absolutely no sane reason to travel to Hong Kong for leisure amidst a global pandemic.
In fact, the risk vs. reward made so little sense that I was baffled when announcing the travel bubble, ticket prices to Hong Kong skyrocketed from S$300 to over S$1,000, and both Cathay and SIA reported ‘overwhelming’ demand.
Even if you take the cost of airfare and hotels out of the equation, travellers would be on the hook for at least three Covid tests, plus any medical and quarantine bills they’d wrack up if they end up catching Covid.
Like the plot of Crash Landing On You, it’s so fucking stupid, I still worry about the residual brain damage I’m going to get from reading the Wikipedia summary.
But on the other hand, the heart wants what it wants. No matter how wrong it sounds in our heads. Perhaps it’s precisely because it’s wrong that the idea appeals to our inner romantic.
As an outsider (I’m Taiwanese), I found it quite endearing that some Singaporeans were willing to shed their national pragmatism in favour of taking a bold risk. Despite the online ridicule, these intrepid travellers had decided to take the leap, for only the slim chance of experiencing the freedom and romance of travel again.
I’m not being facetious here. In 2020, I’ve sorely missed the sense of hope and optimism that travel can sometimes provide. We need it for the sake of our mental health, and to relieve the burnout and stress from a year of WFH. More importantly, the travel and hospitality sector, and by extension, the entire Singapore economy needs it to bounce back.
To that end, someone had to be first.
In tech, we call this group the early adopters.
Depending on how you look at it, they’re either the digital vanguard that makes products better for the rest of us, or the first penguin pushed off the ice floe as sacrifice to the orcas.
Either way, they deserve to be celebrated instead of ridiculed.
Careful, he's a hero.
Hindsight is Always 20/20
Despite being a card-carrying cynical asshole, I hate ‘I told you so’s from people with no skin in the game.
If you truly believed, like some online commenters, that the travel bubble was always doomed to be a failure, then you should’ve had the foresight to short SIA stock, or bet against the Hong Kong hospitality sector.
Otherwise, you don’t get to take credit for something that you weren’t willing to stake anything on.
Which is why as a strictly non-partisan and neutral observer, I have to agree with Professor Donald Low’s assessment of Minister Ong Ye Kung and the Singapore team, that they erred by commission rather than omission.
What other public servants, globally, were willing to put their necks on the line to resume travel? Even before the recent surge of cases in Hong Kong, Singapore’s Covid situation was the more stable of the two cities, and therefore, it had the most to lose.
Essentially, OYK and his team assumed most of the downside risk—to their reputations and careers—when they could have just as easily done nothing and gotten none of the blame.
Regardless of how the travel bubble plays out, you have to respect politicians who put their own necks on the line when making decisions that affect all Singaporeans.
Someone Had to be First
On a more serious note, the failure of the HK-SG travel bubble has broader implications beyond just schadenfreude and heartbreak. If anything, it was meant to be a dress rehearsal to the bigger challenge of mass reopening upon the availability of the Covid vaccine. If you know anything about global supply chains, we can expect that the rollout of such a vaccine will likely not be smooth, and trust in its efficacy will also take time.
In effect, next year, travellers will be faced with the same dilemma as those who were considering the travel bubble. Singaporeans only have to think back to the massive queues in front of bubble tea stalls before the circuit breaker to get a sense of the disaster that’s awaiting us on a global scale.
In many ways, this puts the HK-SG travel bubble in its proper perspective—as an experiment that was worth pursuing—if only to give us a few more data points to figure out how to reopen successfully.
To that end, we need the hopeless romantics (or sacrificial lambs) who are willing to take the first leap.
Because as any Korean drama will tell us, love is always a risk worth taking.

Ex-Offenders and Employment: How The Pandemic Increased Their Barriers To Entry",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
Travelling to Little India Means Seeing It With New Eyes,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-life-deepavali-travelling-to-little-india-means-seeing-it-with-new-eyes/,14-Nov-20,"All images by Marisse Caine for RICE Media.
The colours of Deepavali are everywhere, but the mood in Little India feels far from festive.
The tourists have disappeared. So have the elderly Indian uncles, who used to linger at cafes and restaurants, reading the paper and drinking chai. The shop owners, usually a friendly and welcoming bunch, look at our camera with apprehension.
“It’s sad,” says Vinita. “Before this pandemic, Little India was a community that felt authentic to me. What you see is what you get here. It doesn’t feel manufactured.”
For Vinita Ramani, 42, that sense of authenticity in Singapore was hard to come by.
Vinita shows me around her favourite neighbourhood.
Her family migrated to Singapore in 1991, when Vinita was 13. By then she’d lived in Hong Kong, the UK and Middle East and had experienced life as a minority in radically different environments. Her family took up a small flat in the verdant pastures of Yishun, then the last stop on the MRT line. Immediately upon arrival, she enrolled in the now-defunct Thomson Secondary School.
The transition from life as an expatriate in Hong Kong to that of a Yishun girl was jarring.
Whereas in Hong Kong, Vinita was just ‘Indian,’ moving to Singapore meant dealing with not fitting into the Singaporean expectation of what being ‘Indian’ entailed, from her Tamil ethnicity to her too-light skin colour (‘are you Eurasian?’). In her late teens, she joined a rock band as a bass guitarist and developed an unrequited crush on a ‘James Dean ah beng,’ who lived on the ground floor with his family.
Her life has been one of change. And in that period, Little India has changed at a much slower pace. For decades, the neighborhood was a tribute to another time.
The Little India MRT station on the North-East Line was completed in 2003, and a further link was made to the Downtown Line in 2015. Tekka Place now greets visitors at the beginning of Serangoon Road. But the neighborhood today has largely retained its original character since the 90s.
That is, until the pandemic struck.
“I don’t think we’ve come to terms yet with what we’ve lost,“ says Vinita. “Or how many things we’ve taken for granted.”
Little India is in the Daily Rituals of Its People
To get the full experience of Little India, you’d have to go on a Sunday morning, when locals run their errands and go through their weekly rituals. The point of visiting the neighbourhood is to feel the energy of the crowd, to take in the people, sights, and smells.
That’s the feeling I was hoping to discover in Singapore when I approached Vinita, who’s also my former Editor at RICE, with the idea of a walking tour around Little India. Having moved to Singapore from Taiwan just before the circuit breaker, I never really got to know Vinita and the neighbourhood she’s raved so much about.
“So you want to follow me around for a morning while I run errands?” she asks.
“Yup,” I say. “Just do what you’d normally do. I want to see the neighbourhood through your eyes.”
To me, that’s the most interesting part of travel. It’s not about grand destinations or exotic retreats, but about getting to know strangers better through the ordinary and mundane rituals of their lives.
Which is how we found ourselves standing in front of Mitraa Flower Shop on Buffalo Road, as Vinita selected wreathes of jasmine and bermuda grass garlands to hang on the statue of Lord Ganesha sitting on her altar at home—an elephant-like deity known for being the patron of the arts, as well as the remover of obstacles.
As a Tamil Singaporean, is she religious?
“Not devoutly so,” says Vinita. “It’s more a matter of keeping the traditions alive. I enjoy many aspects of the rituals, and increasingly, the things that preserve the Tamil sense of identity.”
Vinita picking out Bermuda grass garlands for Lord Ganesha.
Our next stop is a grocery run for bananas. Instead of the typical items you’d see at an NTUC, the Indian grocery store stocks produce that I’ve never seen before, including a variety of gourd called tinda and an Indian gooseberry that’s been used in Ayurvedic medicine for thousands of years.
Tinda gourd and Indian gooseberries.
Vinita walks me through the store’s selection of spices, like the Venus brand Idli and Dosa Podi, a condiment made of lentils, seeds, and spices that’s typically served with idli and ghee butter.
I also recognize the Mother’s Recipe jar of pickled vegetables (achar), which I was first introduced to by a Nepali-Indian family on the hill station of Darjeeling. A tangy and flavourful pickle, Indian families have it with everything, and it rivals the Chinese Lao Gan Ma for its ubiquity in the family fridge.
Venus brand Idli and Dosa Podi.
The third and final stop is Jothi Pushpa Kadai for new bangles for Vinita’s daughter Sahana, now three and a half. Vinita wants to make this year’s Deepavali a memorable one for Sahana. With any luck, she’ll get her to sit still for long enough to apply henna on her palms. Again, it’s a ritual she fondly remembers from her childhood when they went to Chennai during the holidays to spend time with relatives. Her grandmother would pluck the leaves from the henna tree (Lawsonia inermis) in their backyard, grind it with a bit of water into a paste, and apply it for all her granddaughters during the festive season.
Balancing her Tamil heritage with her Singaporean identity has been a constant struggle. Having only started her Singapore education at Secondary 1, Vinita can speak Tamil, but can’t read or write the language. The job of teaching her daughter has fallen upon the grandparents and her husband.

They’ve Run Out of Appam
It’s barely 11 AM when we finish shopping, and they’ve already run out of appam at New Madras Woodlands Restaurant.
The owner is apologetic, and explains that since Phase 2 reopening, they’ve had fewer customers in the mornings, so they’ve been making smaller batches of the fermented rice batter for the Sri Lankan pancake dish.
Disappointed, we settle for idli and thosai sets along with cups of Madras tea. A side order of delicious vadais cheers us up greatly, arriving at our table still piping hot from the fryer.

Our meal was accompanied by Madras tea.
The vadais, which arrived piping hot from the fryer.
At the adjacent table sits a group of four—acquaintances of Vinita’s who work in the creative and performing arts. When we enter the restaurant, Vinita says a quick hello before we sit down for our meal.
Due to restrictions against intermingling between groups, a conversation that would’ve happened under normal circumstances didn’t. Both groups keep mostly to themselves.
Even the restaurant’s open kitchen is off-limits to our camera, although we can clearly see that the staff are equipped with masks and are taking all the necessary precautions. But with businesses struggling as it is, photography is just too great a risk.
After our meal, we get the same polite rejection at Rupini’s, an institution in Little India, where Vinita is scheduled to get her eyebrows threaded. So our walking tour of Little India ends with no resolution and we have to say goodbye.
Walking back toward the MRT station, I feel an unexplainable sense of loss. When I read the Whatsapp message from Vinita on the train, I know that she feels it too.
Will Little India Ever Return to Normal?
Through the changes in Vinita’s life in Singapore, Little India has been the one constant. As a former bassist in a rock band, she remembers heading to Anandha Bhavan, an Indian vegetarian restaurant on Selegie Road, after every jam session at Paradiz Centre. Once situated in Ellison Building, that branch of Anandha Bhavan has now disappeared, and the historic Ellison Building itself will be partially razed, and rebuilt, to make way for construction of a highway.
And yet life carries on. Little India remains a source of freedom and comfort to both the Singaporean Indian community, and homesick migrant workers who are just passing through. You bump into family or friends and stop to have chai or filter coffee. You get to know your local vegetable market seller. The temple priests, or Imams in the mosques know your ritual routines and the cafes know how you like your thosai or prata.
Today, even as Singapore moves from Phase 2 into Phase 3, Vinita still senses an underlying tension in this community. Life may be inching back to normal, yet some things still don’t feel the same. Little India, like many other communities in Singapore, is more on edge now, existing in a grey area where any move towards normality might cause everything to shut down again.
The crowds, which had once been part of the attraction of visiting Little India, has become a source of stress and caution.
Perhaps more damagingly, this pandemic has created a physical and emotional distance between people. The longer COVID-19 forces countries and communities to close themselves off, the less we’ll be able to understand and empathize with each other.
All Singaporean communities are living in this limbo right now. We’re all waiting for something to happen. And it’s against this backdrop, with our jobs and livelihoods at stake, that we move forward as best we can, with more questions than answers.
But maybe that’s what rediscovering Singapore is all about: meeting people from different walks of life, and finding the interesting questions to ask, and not necessarily having the answers.
Domestic travel can be more than Sentosa and USS. It can be a walk through a neighbourhood with someone you barely know. It can be an antidote against prejudice and the arrogance of certainty.
Singapore doesn’t have to be boring. If we wanted to, we could recreate the feeling of newness right here, by breaking out of our familiar routines. We could discover something new about this city that was unfamiliar to us, even though after all these decades, it was right here at our doorstep.

For Trans Women In Singapore, Appealing To High Beauty Standards Is A Matter Of Survival",Ivan K. Wu,TRUE,TRUE
A New Era of Travel: From the Eyes Of a Cabin Crew Flying During Covid-19,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-scoot-travel-airlines-flights-safety-cabin-crew-covid-19/,8-Jun-20,"Flight attendants, or cabin crew, have always been something of a curiosity for the flying public. What kind of secret lives do they lead? Is their jet-setting career really as glamorous as it looks?
Like the Mona Lisa, we wonder who this person really is behind their uniform and professional smile.
At Scoot, a crew member’s cheerful demeanour is a testament to their excellent training. Yet conversely, this creates a distance that makes it harder for us to see them as human beings. We often forget that these are working people just like us, who have both good and bad days on the job. They, too, have to adapt and adjust to the new Covid-19 normal.
Take Cherene, for example, a Scoot Crew-in-Charge and Team Leader who is responsible for the safety and well-being of 50 cabin crew members under her care. While the rest of Singapore has been under a two-month circuit breaker, Cherene has been flying Scoot’s essential routes, which have been operating on a limited basis.
Looking forward to this summer, travel routes will gradually open up. Talks are ongoing about establishing ‘green routes’ from Singapore to places like Australia and South Korea. Recently, Singapore launched a ‘fast lane’ with China for essential travel. This will only heighten passenger concerns about whether it’s safe enough to board a flight.
Luckily, Cherene was happy to talk about her flying experience during Covid-19, as well as provide updates on the enhanced precautions rolled out by Scoot.
Below is a lightly edited account in her own words:
The New Normal of Air Travel, According to a Scoot Cabin Crew Member
Unlike most Singaporeans, I’ve been flying regularly during the circuit breaker period. Over the past few months, I’ve done a number of flights to Perth, Australia. Yesterday I just completed a flight to and from Hong Kong. I feel lucky that I still get to do a job that I love. Flying is such a big part of my life that I can’t imagine going without it.
Obviously, my mother still worries about me. Even though during this time, we only fly turnarounds, which means every day I get to come home to my family without having to spend the night at the destination.
My parents have a routine of waiting for me to return home after my flights, even if it’s 1am or 3am, so that they can see that I am home safe and sound. My mother is 75 and my father is 83. They are getting on in years, and I feel bad that they have to worry this much even though I keep assuring them that I take good care of myself.
Scoot passengers practicing social distancing.
Before this pandemic, one of my favourite parts of my job was watching the excitement of passengers just before takeoff, sitting side-by-side, chatting, anticipating what lies ahead. All the couples, families, and friends going out on new adventures.
I also miss feeling connected to our passengers. I used to love chatting with them whenever there was time, but now I only engage them on safety issues or to assist passengers with special needs. It’s even difficult to exchange smiles when both the crew and passengers are wearing masks (laughs). But masks are required, of course!
Two thumbs up from the Scoot crew
Working and Safety During the Circuit Breaker
For the safety and well-being of our passengers, airline staff and the wider community, there’s unprecedented emphasis on precautionary measures across the travel journey, from pre-flight and in-flight to post-flight. Entry restrictions by respective countries and regulatory advice on these measures are also continuously evolving. As a cabin crew on the front-lines, it helps to reassure me that the company has been actively taking measures to keep us safe.
For example, we are supplied with masks and gloves to wear during the flight, and a gown to wear over our uniform for extra protection when required. Recently, we’ve been given face shields as extra protection when we take temperatures for passengers. All cabin crew also have to get their temperatures taken twice: when they report to work, and before boarding the flight. Even on our off days, we studiously monitor our health and make sure to see a doctor if we are not feeling well.
Crew temperature taking before their flight
During the flight, crew have to ensure to keep a safe distance from each other. This means standing apart during briefings, reporting for flight at the aircraft rather than walking alongside each other in a group. Also making sure we stay within our assigned zones onboard and take turns to patrol the cabin during the flight. Nevertheless, we can still chat and bond while standing apart, so despite the new measures I still feel quite happy!
Prioritising The Morale and Wellbeing of the Cabin Crew
This has been a rather stressful time for my crew members, especially the foreign crew who are away from home and miss their family, and have been affected by the drop in income due to the grounded flights.
As Crew-in-Charge and a Team Leader, it is my job to ensure that the crew members under my care maintain a positive mindset. I listen to their woes and we try our best to encourage each other, with some of them starting virtual karaoke sessions together to sing away the blues.
During a flight, the cabin crew are all part of a group chat to check on each other’s well-being. If any member of the crew is feeling unwell for whatever reason, they know to report it immediately to their flight supervisor. During this downtime, Scoot has also enrolled cabin crew who are not rostered for flights in several training programmes on topics such as emerging technologies and service excellence, to hone our skills and prepare us for return to work.
The crew is in high spirits
Passengers can also do their part by cooperating with crew instructions. During the circuit breaker, I’ve had really pleasant experiences with passengers. Everyone seems to appreciate the importance of what we’re doing.
As they disembark, some passengers go out of their way to thank us for our hard work. These small gestures mean a lot to us. Yes, it’s part of our duty, but it’s rewarding to know that passengers notice all the work we’ve put in.
It really makes a huge difference to the morale of the crew.
What New Measures Passengers Can Expect from 1 June 2020
When it comes to the ‘new normal’ of flying, Scoot introduced a couple of new measures from 1 June 2020. To avoid any delay, I recommend passengers arrive early to ensure sufficient time for additional check-in procedures, including temperature screening and submitting a health declaration form before check-in, either at the counters or via an online form.
Scoot’s self-service check-in kiosks at Changi Airport
Going forward, passengers are only allowed 3kg of carry-on luggage on board and this has to fit underneath their seats. So make sure you bring along any essential medication or baby food for your child in your carry-on. The rest of the 7kg allowance will have to be checked in (at no cost). Keeping this in mind can save you having to find a corner to re-pack your carry-on luggage at the airport! So far I’ve observed that this adjustment really smoothens the boarding and disembarkation process, and therefore reduces unnecessary congestion at the aisles.
Once on board, the biggest difference passengers will notice is that masks are mandatory except when eating and drinking. We have temporarily suspended sale of food and beverages to minimise interaction between us and passengers, so complimentary refreshments will be placed on the seats in advance. Alongside the refreshments is a care kit for passengers’ use, which will include items such as anti-bacterial wipes, a surgical mask and sanitiser.
Scoot’s complimentary refreshments are waiting for passengers at their seats
We have to practice safe distancing, so everyone is assigned their seats and unfortunately we cannot allow them to change seats in-flight. Safe distancing is essential everywhere – from check-in, the gatehold room, boarding to disembarkation. Even the queue to the restroom is limited to one person at a time! If a passenger is unwell, we’ve a designated seating area for them too.
For those who are fans of perusing our in-flight magazine, or our Scoot Café menu and our duty-free catalogue during their flights, sadly these are removed too, so that we can minimise surface contact.
Sorry, no inflight magazine 🙁
I know that moving forward, some passengers might feel anxious about flying. In these situations, my job is to be empathetic. First, I’d listen and try to understand their concerns. Then I will share what we are doing and the measures we have taken on board to safeguard their wellbeing and safety.
Looking to the Future: New Measures Means New Habits
Scoot has been operating a reduced schedule, but more routes are slowly starting to come back online.
In June, I’ve been rostered on flights to Penang and Ipoh. Currently, Scoot cabin crew don’t layover at any destinations. Should we have to do overnight stays, we will be sticking closely to the guidelines and directives provided by CAAS. This means ensuring a safe means of transport from airport to the hotel, wearing masks in public areas, and to stay and dine in our rooms during the stay, and keeping close checks on our well-being.
During this alone time, I like to pamper myself with a Chinese novel. It doesn’t matter what genre. Romance. Mystery. I’ll read anything. It’s my favourite hobby. Reading helps me relieve stress, and mellows me down after work.
At the same time, it’s hard to be alone sometimes. Before Covid-19, the crew would have lunch or dinner together and bond over our love of food and travel. I’m looking forward to that after this is over. I miss the closeness and camaraderie of taking meals together.
I don’t know, so much has happened since then. It feels like a long time ago.
It’s anyone’s guess when we can resume flying and travelling to see the world again, but you can bet that when the time comes, the Scoot crew will be here to warmly welcome you on board

"Amidst Chaos and Confusion, Migrant Workers Describe Fears Over Safety and Salaries",https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-chaos-confusion-migrant-workers-fears-safety-salaries-covid-19/,6-Apr-20,"In Singapore, more than one third of the recent COVID-19 clusters have emerged from migrant worker dormitories. Just last night, the government announced that two dormitories housing more than 20,000 migrant workers would be gazetted as isolation areas to stem transmission of the coronavirus in the community. Yet, it is uncertain if the quarantine would actually address the underlying public health threats faced by the migrant community, and if provisions will be made for migrant workers not on government quarantine, but still under company-issued lockdowns amidst this crisis.
Lack of Masks, Sanitiser
Disappointingly, migrant workers have been excluded from free provisions of sanitiser, and with the exception of domestic helpers, have also been excluded from the provision of free reusable masks. This comes at a time when migrant workers are already extremely worried for their health and safety, and unable to purchase masks for themselves due to their meagre salaries.
Some members of the migrant community have taken the situation into their own hands by independently asking for mask and sanitiser donations and distributing them to the migrant community. Earlier in February, Zakir, a Bangladeshi migrant worker, had partnered with a few community organizations to distribute more than 4,000 face masks, 3,000 bottles of hand sanitiser and 2,500 soap bars.
Crowded Dorms and Lorries Make Social Distancing Impossible
As the crisis rapidly evolves, some migrant workers are also increasingly pessimistic about the efficacy of masks or sanitiser in curbing the situation, arguing that the dorms represent a greater public health threat. As many have pointed out, the physical conditions of the dormitories themselves—tightly packed quarters that house thousands of migrant workers—make social distancing nearly impossible to achieve.
Said Zakir, “Inside one room, twelve, maybe twenty people live together. They don’t have much ventilation. How can we practice social distancing?” Indeed, according to Zakir, the lack of ventilation has resulted in workers sleeping in the canteen or other available open spaces. He added, “They use the kitchen, toilet, everything together—don’t have scope to make social distancing work.”
To address this, Zakir suggested that the government build dormitories for social distancing purposes, while NGOs like TWC2 have called for existing spaces like army barracks or community centers into temporary housing to help de-densify existing dormitories until the pandemic is over.
Beyond the dormitories, the very transportation that migrant workers use also represents a public health threat. Said Madhavan, an Indian migrant construction worker, “We cannot maintain 1m distance everywhere—the migrant transport, the lorries, maybe 13-15 people all sit together. Big lorry, maybe got 40 people.”
Lack of Reliable Information
With new updates and guidelines every day, migrant workers also struggle to keep track of the information flood, especially in an unfamiliar language.
While organizations like the Migrant Workers’ Center (MWC) have been trying to communicate social distancing measures and translate government advisories for workers, the rapid development of new cases has strained translation efforts. As such, information dissemination amongst dormitories is unequal and limited, and some migrant workers have had to rely on news outlets from their home countries to keep abreast of information in Singapore. This has contributed to the spread of misinformation amongst the community—for instance, there were rumours circulating about a worker who had purportedly died from Covid-19, though nothing of that sort had happened.
Without reliable and accessible information, some migrant communities have stepped up to fill these perceived gaps. Migrant workers like Omar Faroque Shipon have taken it upon themselves to provide regular updates of the Covid-19 situation in Singapore for the substantial Bengali-speaking community, translating important information and providing live updates through this Facebook page which is followed by more than 30,000 people.
Shipon was inspired to start this after seeing “many people spread rumors through social media.” He added, “I thought I needed to do something, so I started translating updates from Singapore’s Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Health into Bengali. Many of the migrant workers’ families back in Bangladesh also started following the page, and thanked me via messenger.”
Said Rocky, a Bangladeshi migrant worker who follows the page, “This is important because not everyone is equally informed about what is going on. Some people still come to ask me, what are the precaution measures we can take?”
In this pandemic, information flow is crucial to curb unnecessary panic, as well as to educate migrant workers on how to practice proper hygiene to make up for the squalid conditions in dormitories. Indeed, Zakir observed how, during his earlier distribution of hand sanitiser, some migrant workers had rejected it, saying, “I don’t want this one—this one do what? I don’t know,” opting for soap instead.
Zakir explained, “You have to educate people how to use them—most of migrant workers come from the Third World, they don’t use these kinds of things.”
Uneven Response by Dormitories
While some dormitories had put in place stringent temperature taking measures at the start of the pandemic, it appears some dormitories have quietly abandoned these practices due to the long queues that inevitably form before and after work hours. Further, while there is still yellow tape on the ground for social distancing purposes, there is a lack of enforcement on whether these measures are actually observed.
Said Rocky, “I never see social distancing, from the beginning to now—people never comply. I just see the entrance got temperature scanning, but no people monitor, no control measures, nothing.”
As more migrant workers have tested positive, other dormitories have stepped up efforts to contain the crisis through increased health checks. According to Madhavan, police officers will be coming into the dormitories to conduct temperature checks for everyone from today evening, and anyone with a fever will be sent to the hospital immediately. While this might be a sign that dormitories are taking precautions more seriously, greater police involvement might also create unnecessary stress and panic amongst a population already wary of enforcement.
Uncertain Salaries, Uncertain Futures
Beyond health, migrant workers also remain uncertain about the financial implications of a “circuit breaker” announced by PM Lee last Friday, for the physical nature of their jobs makes working from home impossible. Most companies have already issued advisories to their workers informing them of a one-month work from home policy—for most migrant workers, this simply means waiting in their dormitories, until the one month ends.
Madhavan says nothing has been communicated about salaries so far: “All the workers waiting for official information”. When his fellow workers clarified with their companies, they were told to wait till Monday, where Minister Heng is expected to make a speech about government provisions to support construction companies during this period.
For the moment, it seems like each company is adopting its own policy. At Zakir’s company, migrant workers have been asked to take a 5% pay cut. “My company is kind,” Zakir says, “but others have not been so lucky.” Some of his friends have had to accept 50% wage cuts, while others have had to forfeit their salaries altogether.
Migrant workers, as non-citizens, are not currently entitled to the Budget benefits announced by the government. For instance, the Enhanced Jobs Support Scheme, which covers up to 75% of employees’ salaries up to a cap of $4,600, only applies to local workers. It is unclear if the Ministry of Manpower would issue further guidelines on salaries for an already precarious population—many of whom already owe existing debt obligations to brokerage agents, and whose families back home depend on their monthly remittances to survive.
In today’s Solidarity Budget, Minister Heng announced that the government would waive this month’s foreign worker levy for employers, and also provide employers with a $750 rebate for each Work Permit and S-Pass holder.
However, absent of any legislation, it is not certain that firms will necessarily pass off these cost savings to migrant workers. As the earlier debacle over the property tax rebates has shown, “trickle-down economics” is nothing more than a bizarre fantasy, as tenants remain sceptical that landlords will pass on rebates to tenants. The government has since rectified this by introducing a law that would compel landlords into compliance. Similar legislation should be extended in this case to ensure that companies pass on rebates to migrant workers, and to hold companies accountable for firing workers or imposing severe pay cuts.
The (Government) Lockdown of Dormitories
Yesterday, the government announced an official quarantine for all twenty thousand workers living in the two dormitories in Punggol and Toh Guan West Lite. Although Minister Josephine Teo said that all affected workers living in the government-gazetted dormitories for isolation will be paid wages, as their quarantine will be treated as part of their paid hospitalization fees guaranteed under workers’ statutory leave liability, it is not clear if this applies to workers living in dormitories whose companies—rather than the government—imposed lockdowns.
For these migrant workers, wages are not the only issue—many are also worried about what a “lockdown” means exactly. Said Ripon, a Bangladeshi migrant worker who lives in a dormitory in Penjuru, “from tomorrow onwards, my dorm will also be in lockdown, but I’m not sure if I can still go out to get food and other essential necessities.”
Other migrant workers like Rocky worry about what he is going to do to pass the time in a small and crowded room while in quarantine. “They don’t have Wi-Fi in the rooms, only in the corridors,” he explains, “so I’ve downloaded lots of PDF books, but I’m not sure it will last me two weeks.”
More crucially, while Minister Teo has said that they are “actively converting more spaces” to facilitate social distancing, it remains unclear how quickly and how well this can be achieved. Said Nizam, a Bangladeshi migrant worker currently living in the gazetted Punggol dormitory—“We living very crowded, we are scared, this is more dangerous.” For as Nizam explained, “one room we living is twelve people, one floor has fourteen rooms. All fourteen rooms, everyone use one common toilet—if one man have [Covid-19], everyone will be infected.”
These fears are exacerbated by the fact that dormitories have not seemed to step up hygiene practices, despite being gazetted by the government as official isolation areas. According to a migrant worker interviewed by the Straits Times, “You can see cockroaches crawling in the rooms. There are also many mosquitoes. Many people just stood outside their rooms, in the corridors. There are also smoking areas at each end of the corridors, and the toilets are also there. You can smell urine when you stand outside the rooms.”
What Next?
The pandemic has taken a significant mental toll on migrant workers, who fret about their uncertain futures against this climate of fear. Said Rocky, “I am very worried and very stressed, because I don’t know what’s going on.” Their families back home fret for them too—“My family in Bangladesh is worried about me,” says Zakir.
“They call me every day to ask me how I’m doing.”
The psychological toll for migrant workers living in the affected dormitories is also substantial. Said Nizam, “Some people are panicked, because everyday we see people being taken out—we see in front of our eyes. Every morning, every evening, got ambulance come and take people. It’s very scary.” Yet, there remains no mental health resources available for migrant workers during this trying period—a disappointing, but perhaps unsurprising fact considering how this was already status quo prior to the crisis.
Many of these migrant workers are simply existing in a state of limbo, awaiting further information. It remains to be seen if the Ministry of Manpower and Ministry of Health would issue further advisories regarding public health provisions and workers’ salaries, and whether the much-anticipated speech by Minister Heng would indeed address all of these pressing concerns.
Regardless, it is extremely concerning that the government is only now rolling out these reactionary measures, when more could have been done earlier to contain the public health crisis. In a scathing Facebook post today, Prof. Tommy Koh echoed the sentiments of many NGOs when he wrote, “the dormitories were like a time bomb waiting to explode.” Back in early March, doctors from HealthServe were already warning about the lack of provisions for the migrant community, arguing that migrant workers represent “the weakest link” in our public health chain—a sentiment that other articles have similarly pointed out.
To be clear, we should not view these measures as important only insofar as they threaten locals’ health. As fellow human beings—and as a group that has contributed to and sacrificed so much for Singapore—it is only right that we take our responsibilities to keep migrant workers and their families safe seriously.
Further, many of these issues—poor living conditions, public health inequities—were issues long before the Covid-19 crisis emerged. Post-crisis, we need systemic and permanent change rather than a temporary knee-jerk one that only deals with the immediate pandemic.
Still, not all is lost. The government can still commit to measures that can assuage the current situation, even if it cannot turn back the clock. Each of the issues raised here can be addressed with specific measures that will go a long way in both curbing the public health threat and in improving the quality of lives of affected migrant workers.
For one, there is an urgent need to de-densify the dormitories to make social distancing a workable—rather than laughable—reality. For another, the measures provided for those under official quarantine should be extended to all migrant workers: the provision of free masks and thermometers, the reassurance about wages, the provision of essential food and services, as well as on-site medical care. There are other seemingly trivial, but actually material measures that can be introduced: ensuring that migrant workers have accessible and up-to-date information in their native languages, providing mental health resources, and providing free Wifi in dormitories.
These measures cannot excuse the government from its earlier oversights, but they can be how it makes amends. The best time to enact these measures was yesterday. The next best time is now.

With Covid-19, Apathy Is A Luxury We Cannot Afford",Poh Yong Han,TRUE,TRUE
Covid Taught This Teacher To Take Risks. So He Quit To Turn His Hobby Into A Business,https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-people-covid-teacher-sourdough-baker/,22-Dec-20,"All images by Feline Lim.
“When I was doing the sums on how much sales I’m making,” Justin Lin, 31, says, “I was like, ‘Wait, I only made $50 bucks today and I worked so hard last night? I gotta change my menu items or I gotta increase the prices.’”
Justin is a trained sculptor and an art teacher in a secondary school, but is probably better known as half of the duo who runs the popular Serangoon Sourdough, a home-based bakery that sells, well, sourdough bread (surprise!).
Actually, let me correct the above statement. Justin is a soon-to-be ex-teacher in a secondary school, for he has since tendered his resignation and is leaving his teaching job at the end of the year to attend pastry school and focus on his baking business.
Giving up a corporate-ish job to pursue your passion may sound like the millennial fantasy come true. But, like so many Tinder profiles, the dream is not as beautiful as it initially appears, and, for Justin, neither is the decision as straightforward.
Money, for one, is a problem. Exacerbating his financial worries is his mother’s reaction. When she learnt of Justin’s decision to quit teaching and pursue baking, her first response was: “How much was your last drawn pay ah? How long do you intend to not work?”
“Then I fall down into this anxiety stream—” Justin continues, before he corrects himself as he chuckles self-deprecatingly, “Sorry, I said I’m hopeful right? I am excited about the future. I’m hopeful.”
Like many of us, Justin and his partner, Jenny, started baking sourdough bread during the circuit breaker. However, what, for most, was an ill-disguised attempt at finding companionship in a decomposing chunk of dough, was a necessity for the both of them.
Justin explains that Jenny works as a freelance jeweller who earns most of her money through public sales and teaching corporate classes. A virulent pandemic put an end to pop-up markets and office attendance, and, with them, Jenny’s means of supporting herself.
“So we had to find some way of getting an income,” Justin says.
Prior to the circuit breaker, Justin was already baking sourdough bread for his friends and colleagues, purely as a hobby. When the stay-home notice was implemented, he started receiving bread requests from them because “they didn’t want to leave the house”.
“So we thought, ‘Okay, let’s try this out.’”
Justin then baked a batch of cinnamon rolls with his sourdough starter, took some photographs, and posted them on the Instagram account of Serangoon Sourdough.
“There was a good response,” Justin recalls. “I had a few DMs that asked, ‘Are you going to sell this?’”
But his follower and customer count only exploded when Justin’s sister-in-law sent a box to her friend, who owns a business called Hock Siong. (Justin explains that “it’s like a fancy corporate karang guni.”) That friend, in turn, posted a photograph of said cinnamon rolls on her company’s very popular Instagram account, which single-handedly tripled Serangoon Sourdough’s followers in two days.
“For a whole weekend, I was just responding to people’s DMs,” Justin exhales. “They were asking, ‘Can I get a box? Can I get a box?’
“I was also going into it without any sales background. I’m a teacher, right? I’ve never had to do any sales. I didn’t know what people needed in a transaction. Do people want a receipt or confirmation? Do they pay first or pay later?”
Justin chuckles, “It was a stressful weekend. But suddenly I realised people want cinnamon rolls. So, sure, let’s give it to them.”

Baking bread at home to make up for income loss during the circuit breaker is perfectly understandable. It is enterprising. But to trade a stable and relatively well-paying job for it seems like a nightmare to the (stereo)typically pragmatic Singaporean—so why did Justin choose to do it?
Justin pauses to organise his thoughts, and reflects, “In my 20s, I told myself that by the time I hit 30, I would figure out what I want to do in life. I turned 31 in June and I realised I still don’t know what to do.
“During my birthday this year, we were in the thick of baking … it wasn’t a fantastic income from bread, you can’t make a lot of money through bread, but it was enough sales for me to realise that I can do something no one told me to do.
“I think, growing up as a Singaporean, a lot of the decisions get made for you. But baking bread was one thing that I could decide for myself. It’s just something that I wanted to do of my own accord. And people seem to be willing to pay me money for it. So why not? Let’s just do it.”

Still, Justin is careful to stress that his decision was motivated more by pull, not push, factors. He clarifies that he is very happy at his current workplace: “The kids are great, my co-workers are fun to work with, there’s a lot of innovation happening.”
Having taught for over five years, however, made Justin itch for new experiences. Moreover, he couldn’t dismiss that niggling sense of cognitive dissonance at how he, as a teacher, would “peddle all these things about life-long learning, taking SkillsFuture course, without actually practising them [him]self.”
“I figured if I really want to be a better teacher in the future, I should do all these things. I need to get some life experience that puts me outside of school and gets me to be around other parts of society.
“Teaching in school can be a bit insular. For me, I felt like [quitting my job as a teacher and picking up new skills] would make me a better teacher in the future.”
And if it weren’t for Covid, he would probably have continued teaching in his secondary school.
He reasons: “Covid has shown that the world can explode at any time. Let’s make things happen before things really go to shit.”
But the course of dreams never did run smooth. Throughout our conversation, Justin constantly brings up his worries about his finances. Then, realising this, he sheepishly admits, “Money will always be at the back of my mind because … [this is] Singapore.”
Money aside, Justin’s “main existential crisis” in baking sourdough bread, as he puts it, is that he is “building on this whole capitalist culture of buying fancy shit and eating fancy shit.”
It’s a hard charge to defend against. Sourdough, in Singapore at least, is inextricably associated with yuppie and bougie culture.
You’re not going to find ah peks dipping kaya sourdough toast into their kopi, or aunties placing $3 plastic-wrapped sourdough loaves into their green NTUC shopping baskets. You’re more likely to spot some buff dude with coiffed hair or a svelte lady in Lululemons nibbling on a $20 slice of sourdough smothered with avocado and smoked salmon at a café in Upper Thomson as a reward for completing their F45 session.
A loaf of sourdough itself can run up to a heart-pain price of $30, though most hover in the range of $12 to $18, depending on how atas their fillings are (which run the gamut from smoked mushroom, duck, to rum-soaked cherries, chestnut, etc.).
This is why Justin refuses to raise his prices—his basic country loaf starts at $7, a third less than the cheapest loaf from most commercial bakeries, and, indeed, other home bakers.
“I do get pushback from other home bakers who tell me I’m spoiling the market,”
Justin reveals. “It’s not outright, but they tell me, ‘You might want to match my prices’.
“But how many people can afford a $10 loaf of bread? If you ask me whether I will buy a $10 loaf of bread to feed myself, I wouldn’t,” he continues indignantly.
“This is a HDB estate. I like to be able to sell this bread to someone in the other block—which I do—and I like them to be able to afford this. I cannot sell it to my neighbour for more than $7 … I’d feel bad for making her pay that.”
Showing off the medieval kink instrument he carved from the leg of a discarded wooden chair.
In the same anti-capitalistic vein, Justin eschews commercial machinery in making his bread. Not wanting to purchase new machinery just to mix his dough, Justin carved a spurtle—a traditional Scottish tool used for stirring oats—from the leg of a discarded wooden chair for that purpose.
“For example, I’m doing 21 loaves this Sunday. So I take out this big bowl—what we affectionately call ‘Big Boi’, tie a headband, banzai-style, blast ABBA, and go at the dough with both hands.
“It’s an experience,” he grins.
Sculptures made by Justin punctuated the clean, cosy lines of his home.
Part of Justin’s resistance to raising his prices must stem from his background in education. As a teacher, his “main schtick”, in his own words, is that as long as his students emerge from his class with the ability to appreciate beautiful and joyous things, he doesn’t care what grades they get.
This ethos translates into how Justin operates as a baker. To him, profits—to a certain extent—don’t matter as much as someone finding joy in a loaf of bread that he bakes. When he sells a loaf of bread to a customer, it’s not just a transaction. It’s almost akin to a communion, which is why Justin keeps one loaf of every batch.
“So when I eat the loaf, it’s like I’m breaking bread with you.”
“And if my bread can help someone find joy in life and see beauty in something simple, I’ll be happy with my place in life.”
The boss demanded her dinner so our interview was paused.
Justin hopes to expand Serangoon Sourdough to a full bakery eventually. Specifically, Justin and Jenny dream of running a “café/bed and breakfast/bakery/cat shelter/jewellery studio” (my hand cramped as I struggled to write all of that down whilst he was reciting it).
Before that, however, he is aware that he has several years of working in a bakery before he can even dream of opening his own. So, for Justin, it is off to pastry school first, before finding employment as a baker somewhere. (As for Jenny, she is currently pursuing a job opportunity overseas.)
I ask Justin if he has any regrets about quitting his job as a teacher and devoting his time to a potentially risky venture, something in which he, at his own admission, has no experience.
With the Zen of a Buddhist monk, he replies, “If there’s anything we picked up this year, it’s not to worry so much about what is going to happen. If, in January, suddenly no one wants to eat sourdough bread, that’s fine.
“5 years ago, I was pretty rigid about what I wanted to do. There was a certain kind of art I was trying to make. I wasn’t listening to the market, to the art world. So I just wasn’t hitting certain things that could have gotten me somewhere in art.
“Today, if I could tell the me from 5 years ago something, it’s to be flexible and respond to what is happening in the world. Be willing to change how you operate and what you do. Don’t be afraid to go in a direction you didn’t expect.”
With one very important caveat: “I don’t want to fall into the trap of making desserts for rich people having high tea. That will kill me, I think,” he laughs.
A few days later, when I return to Justin’s house to collect a loaf of bread that I had ordered prior to the interview, I hear Sufjan Steven’s plaintive crooning drift out of his house.
The only reason why I continue at all / Faith in reason, I wasted my life playing dumb.
“I love this song”, I gush to Justin as he hands me my turmeric spice loaf.
“It’s been on loop the whole day,” he smiles, before turning back to his kitchen, disappearing into the smells of bread baking, of wheat, under intense heat, transforming into the substance of life.

How My Head Ended Up On A Steamed Dish (And Why It Matters),https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-head-ended-steamed-dish-matters-food-security-wastage-nyc/,28-Aug-20,"Top image: Zachary Tang / RICE File Photo. All other images credited to Apollo Aquaculture Group, unless otherwise stated.
Thanks to the circuit breaker, I somehow got famous. I was pampered, well-fed and got on social media. More importantly, I got famous because a pandemic called COVID-19 shone a spotlight on how fragile our overseas food supply lines are.
This is my life story…
For starters, my parents had very odd names. Officially, my father was called Epinephelus lanceolatus. He was a male giant grouper of the sea. My mother, Epinephelus fuscoguttatus, was a female tiger or brown marbled grouper. Somehow, since 2007, folks found a way to get my dad to fertilise my mother’s eggs and lo and behold, through the miracle of IVF, my ‘breed’ was born.
In wet markets, Hokkien ‘aunties’ love touting my kind as a delicious hybrid grouper, Hybrid Longhu Grouper, or 龙虎斑. But yes, we’re often viewed as outsiders of the sea, a cross-breed with a voracious appetite.
If you dive or snorkel at sea, you will see many of my kind—flitting around tropical and temperate waters with our bulbous eyes, thick protruding lower lip and brown-and-white mottled spots and patches. Some of us can mature up to weights of 1-5 kilogrammes, so it’s no surprise that we can draw a crowd.
Throughout my entire life, I only saw the four walls of my cobalt-blue tank. And for good reason too, as I was not exposed to potential external contaminants from the open sea.
Unfortunately, for me, I wasn’t born in the sea. In fact, I was born five months ago in a bright, cobalt-blue tank, in a Lim Chu Kang fish farm called Apollo Marine Seafood.
My first few months swimming in the tank were mostly … well, just swimming around. There were others with me but we’re just all calling each other by the same names. From a fry to a fingerling, I had dreams—what will my life look like, will a family adopt me and put me in a tank, will I be released out to sea so I can meet my larger brethren or will I grow up, meet the love of my life and breed more groupers? Oh, such fanciful, fishy dreams.
And why not? From the moment I was born, I’ve had everything being taken care of for me.
Besides my breed, there’re also Coral Trout, white and blue shrimps, apparently all locally bred. My caretakers even have an in-house nutritionist to research and ensure the fish-feed we get are well-balanced. They even include delicious cod liver oil.
My country, my home. I was born in the world’s first land-based vertical farm. Can’t get any better than that!
Besides hybrid groupers, the farm breeds Coral Trout and shrimps too.
In fact, the farm I grew up in is the world’s first land-based vertical farm. Tanks upon tanks of fries and fingerlings like me swim around in stacked-up tiers, apparently for better use of land space, cost and energy. I fish you not, it’s happening right here, in Singapore.
I found out, much later on, that Singapore is really land-scarce, so local farming is far more restrictive when it comes to space. Just like how most Singaporeans live in HDB flats, I now understand how it feels to be constrained within these tanks!
Here’s how a coastal or open-sea fish farm looks like. Image credit: Shutterstock
Unlike fishes bred in other farms, which are located in coastal areas or open seas, I’m bred inland, inside an enclosed environment, away from the threat of open sea contamination, like algal blooms and microplastics pollution. But I think there are now smarter technologies to detect these early.
Anyway, the tank I swam in was using recirculated water, free of antibiotics and growth hormones. I mean, all I saw were the green netting to keep me within four walls and weird sensors for temperature and pH, among others. But I guess they’re all there to keep me healthy, or as some of my minders would always say—’filled with vitamins and minerals which are essential for a healthy diet’. The Apollo Marine guys call the system RAS, or Recirculating Aquaculture System. In simple terms, it means a self-contained ecosystem of good water quality, nutrition and agriculture. Oh, you can RAS me anytime, guys.
One time, some VIP from the government ministry came to visit the farm and I was selected among my school to be briefly lifted above the waterline and displayed for the humans. I heard mentions of Good Aquaculture Practice (GAP) and sustainable farming in their conversations.
Apparently, the VIP and my caretakers had an exchange about land and labour costs, and how this so-called COVID-19 pandemic has put a spotlight on the fragility of food supplies from overseas. Which also explained why they needed to work closer together—the government, local farmers and community—to embrace this ‘kampong spirit’ of protecting our food security interests during and after this pandemic.
Naturally, locally grown food supplies also reduce carbon footprint and energy use from the need for overseas transportation and storage. It also means the food is fresher too! #supportlocal
There’s also talk among the humans to try and have one-third of Singapore’s food sources to be home-grown by 2030. They call it the “30 by 30” goal, where the agri-food industry incorporates technologies like indoor multi-storey LED lighting (for veggie farms) and multi-storey recirculating aquaculture systems (like mine!) to produce 10 to 15 times what traditional setups can produce.
Appearing in a live auction is intense but there’s a voracious appetite among bidders online for good, safe and healthy seafood.
Anyway, the day arrived when I hit about 500 grammes. I remember the day as clear as the afternoon sun—I was put on the scale and the boss said I was ‘ready for trade’. At first, I didn’t understand what that phrase meant, but soon enough, I was moved from the ‘breeding tank’ to one of their public tanks.
I was held up for a photograph, then apparently picked to be the ‘star’ with one other companion in their twice-weekly live-stream on Facebook. Geez, why can’t they just call it Fishbook or something?
But what’s the point for all this?
Apparently, this COVID-19 thing has spurred my caretakers to be ‘all hands on deck’ even more. They’re doing the online auctions as part of a concerted marketing effort to promote the consistent supply of locally produced food, including seafood. The auctions are a good way to create awareness and accessibility for folks on the hunt for locally bred food supply and there are quite a lot of these auctions on social media.
At first, I thought my breed has a voracious appetite, wait till you see the human folks with seafood cravings. These humans can really eat!
The other day, I made friends with a bunch of white shrimps. The next day, some folks made an online order on GrabFood and some dude came by, picked them up in a bag, and they were gone.
When I grew to about 800 grammes, the Apollo Marine ‘Horeca’ sales team came to check on me. Unlike my minders, these guys were like the networking folks, who travelled and made connections. They were the B2B specialists who help expand the distribution network from farm to food supply outlets, like restaurants and supermarkets.
What got me excited was the prospect that I had been chosen to go on a ride. It felt special, like somehow, I’d been earmarked for a significant moment in my life.
I overheard one of them saying that they’d secured a wholesale rate for me and several others like me, but someone in particular had taken an interest in me. I was excited because someone somewhere finally saw my value.
That’s me all ready for primetime.
For the first time in my life, I was finally able to see the outside world! No more green netting, cobalt-blue walls, constant bubbling sounds of RAS and the burps of my companions. I was ready for my primetime.
The next morning, my transport came without much fanfare. All I heard was the hum of the delivery truck in the wee hours of dawn and a glimpse of the facade of my birth home for the past few months.
As I left my birthplace, I saw what I gathered to be the Singapore flag.
The ride to my destination was smooth, with the occasional bumps and sloshing of water in my tank. Along the journey, I looked up through a crack in the cover and tarp to see the first gleaming hint of sunlight and a bright, blue sky.
The other hybrid groupers in my tank were all nervous and afraid. But I reassured them. I tell them wherever it is we’re going, we all have a purpose. How else could anyone explain the care and tenderness our minders had taken great pains to develop? We were fed, cleaned, monitored and lived a stress-free and healthy life.
Surely, the last thing anyone would want to do to us is to toss us aside as food waste, right?
Anyway, when I finally arrived at my destination, I was put into a tank with several other companions.
I saw many Singaporeans from all walks of life coming and going, ordering food and drinks, while their children leaned close towards our glass tanks to see us parade. Image credit: Shutterstock
One by one, my companions were picked. I saw how they were descaled, gutted and later served with garnishing on a platter for couples and families. I began to understand why. I saw the smiles and laughter on the diners’ faces. The joy we were bringing, not just in the short-term through our flesh and essence, but the long-term effects of our nutritious value from being locally farmed, all of our vitamins and minerals, minus external contaminants.
So it stands to reason for me to fume when some diners neglect to finish their food on the table, leaving unnecessary waste for stray crows and flies. It showed utter disrespect to the entire lifecycle of what my friends and I stood for. Over time, this cycle of wastage will accumulate and bring additional strain to cleaners and waste disposal systems. I may be just a fish in the larger scheme of things, but my contribution should not, for lack of a better word, go to waste.
Consume in moderation—I blurted out through the glass—pick the right size for your table! Image credit: Shutterstock
As I swam and pondered, I realised that food security in this small island of Singapore is often taken for granted. Maybe they haven’t been in my fins long enough to understand what my world is like. Or seen how much time and effort my caretakers and this entire chain of locally farmed food supplies has been built from the ground up.
I hope we can continue to build and strengthen our locally farmed food supply without wastage. It’s important not just for today’s generation, but for future generations, when food supplies become scarcer due to other unpredictable world events. Just like how COVID-19 has done.
So, in time, a family of diners came and looked at me intently. Image credit: Shutterstock
Due to COVID-19, there was a limitation on the number of people who could sit around the dining table and enjoy a meal. My size was just right for them. The family had a young daughter amongst them and she picked me.
Call it fate or a sense of comfort and security, but I looked her in the eye and saw a reminder of myself when I was a wee fingerling in a cobalt-blue tank. I saw a part of who I was in her—still figuring out what the world is going to be like.
As I was lifted off the tank in a net and taken towards the kitchen, I felt my purpose. I hardly struggled. I just lay there on the block flapping my gills as if to say goodbye. I was proud to be the healthiest, locally bred seafood in that tank and I was finally sacrificing myself for the good health of that little girl.
As the chef’s knife struck, I hoped, through me, and many others like me, she and anyone who knew where I’d come from, would appreciate what I represent, and not take my worth for granted.
Practice moderation when ordering food. Treasure our locally farmed produce without wastage. #supportlocal Image credit: Shutterstock

I Tried A 4-Day Work Week For A Month And Hated It (Please Hear Me Out Before Cancelling Me)",Terry Ng,TRUE,TRUE
"To Foster True Multiculturalism, We Need To Rethink What Having A “Dialogue” Means",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-events-night-walker-multicultural/,27-Feb-20,"All photographs by Zachary Tang.
In Singapore, we like to crow about how multicultural and multiracial our society is.
But how much of it is reality and how much of it is empty boasting?
If we take recent events as a barometer, it seems that our talk is mostly hot air. Just think of the e-pay brownface fiasco, the subsequent Preetipls video, the influencer who complained about two Sikh men’s turbans blocking her view at a concert, the artist who hurled vile slurs in an Instagram story at two Indian ladies … I could go on, but you get the idea—and man, it’s depressing enough listing these episodes.
In other words, our multiracialism and multiculturalism seem characterised more by ignorance and tolerance—or even intolerance—than harmony and understanding.
Clearly, to foster genuine interracial relations, we need more than talks, initiatives like “harmony games”, and festivals. But what else can we do?
Neil Chua, 38, and Artistic Director and Founder of RuanAtWorkz Musical Arts, has a radical proposal: he wants to forgo everyday conversation. In its place, Neil thinks a new type of collaborative, non-hierarchical dialogue would serve better to heal our fractured society.
From left: Bala Saravanan Loganathan, Neil Chua, and Aw Wei Zheng.
Neil is one-third of the trio behind Night Walker, a theatrical production that fuses together Ruan music (a traditional Chinese string instrument), Bharatanatyam (a classical Indian dance), and modern electronic music.
Clearly, Night Walker is a multicultural work. That in itself is important: despite all our claims of societal integration, we are still stuck in our respective racial bubbles, rarely venturing out to experience something different.
“Chinese people don’t usually watch Indian dances. Indian people don’t go to Chinese orchestra shows,” Neil points out. (Ouch. Guilty as charged.)
Night Walker attempts to remedy this deficiency by “showing how [different cultural forms can] assimilate and integrate with each other—and not just tolerate each other”.
Admittedly, none of that is anything new. It’s the ethos underpinning all multicultural works—of which Singapore does not lack.
But Night Walker differs by telling us something without saying anything at all. It’s a theatrical work with no dialogue—no one in the show speaks a word to each other.
The team—Neil, Bala Saravanan Loganathan, the 23-year-old Bharatanatyam dancer, and Aw Wei Zheng, who, at 27, is their sound designer—believes that such an approach is, paradoxically, more effective in fostering interracial relations than all the words you can say to one another.
As Bala says, “Words are not the most important thing for a conversation. The most important thing is the two parties can understand each other.”
The word “dialogue”, Bala thinks, can be a bit of a misnomer in Singapore society. It denotes a discussion between two or more people or groups, but dialogue sessions here, more often than not, play out like this: one party—usually the person in power—“is the only one talking … [and we go there] just to absorb like a sponge, and leave”.
Worse, the point of our questions can get questioned, or requests for information sidestepped. In Singapore, dialogues become monologues.
This is why Neil, Bala, and Wei Zheng have intentionally avoided incorporating verbal dialogue into Night Walker. As the Preetipls video illustrates, even when the sentiment behind an expression is legitimate (in this case, outrage over the offensiveness of brownface and what we, as a society, can do better), the tone or choice of words might inadvertently incite the very thing—i.e., racial insensitivity—it was calling out.
Dialogue, when not properly done, can be claustrophobic and ironically close off avenues for communication.
That is not to say the stage of Night Walker will be starkly barren, silent, and still. Or that it presents indecipherable avant-garde movements set to atonal music.
All three of them stress that there is still dialogue in the show—just that the dialogue is not verbal.
“The dialogue is between the music and the movement,” Bala explains.
He means it literally: each night, Neil and Bala will be responding to each other’s music and movement on the spot, so no two performances of Night Walker will be the same.
But can two such different artforms really integrate so organically and spontaneously? Is this a symptom of the utopian pipe dream of racial harmony to which Singapore is in thrall?
I am immediately corrected by Neil. “Indian dance and Chinese music mesh well together,” he says. “Rhythm plays a fundamental role in both Chinese music and traditional Indian dance.”
Neil then launches into a mini-lecture about rhythm cycles (of 3, 5, 7 …) in Chinese music and Indian dance, completely losing me because the only time I listen to classical music is when movies use it to announce something dramatic is going to happen.
What I do understand is that Night Walker borrows heavily from different cultures even as it innovates on them. This, too, is a form of dialogue.
As Bala says, “Even though I’m taking a few things from your culture, I’m also embracing it as part of mine. It’s about relying on each other’s strengths and abilities.”
“I think that’s very important. You have to take from each other’s cultures. You have to move society together as one.”
And in Bala’s dance and Neil’s music, Night Walker literally embodies this in-tandem movement of society.
“You can see there’s something happening between these two characters,” Bala concludes.
“They’re communicating without realising it. That’s the idea of a dialogue.”
The second dialogue that happens in Night Walker occurs between the show and the audience.
Aside from the lack of verbal dialogue, Night Walker demolishes the traditional boundary between performance and audience in another way—to avoid spoiling the experience, I won’t say how, but it really thrust the play into my face.
This staging decision, in combination with the absence of words in the play, “gives the audience a lot of freedom to interpret the action”, Neil says. Without any grand narrative voice and everyday dialogue, audiences are compelled to fill in the background with their personal experiences.
And it is only when we have the space to draw from our own life and form our own thoughts—instead of being told what to feel or think from a didactic source—when a genuine dialogue happens, and real connections can be forged.
If not genuine connections, then at least genuine questions. The team is aware that some of the more technical aspects of the show—like the symbolism of the hand gestures in Bharatanatyam or the classical compositions of the Ruan—will be lost on people unfamiliar with either (or both) cultures.
But having questions is also a dialogue, and one of the best ways to combat ignorance and intolerance. “It shows that people want to understand. Which I think is important in today’s context,” Bala says.
Will being in the same space and participating in a shared experience help us develop a more genuine and organic sense of multiculturalism?
My sense is yes, but I hesitate to make any far-reaching statement. All I know is that the racist episodes by which Singapore has been gripped clearly show that talking is not enough. In fact, talking can be more incendiary than instructive.
The best dialogue, then, is one that we carry out rather than say. In the words of Bala: “Dialogue is not verbal. It is something that has to be experienced.”
And yes, I’m aware of the irony here if I end my article with words. But anyway I’ll be watching Night Walker for that full-fledged multicultural experience, so I think I can be pardoned.

The CBD Was Where My Heart Belonged. Until I Worked A Week At Jurong",Yeo Boon Ping,TRUE,TRUE
"After the Pandemic, We’ll Start Seeing Singaporean Coffee Shops In a New Light",https://www.ricemedia.co/culture-food-singapore-kim-san-leng-old-school-coffee-shop/,26-Jun-20,"All images by Zachary Tang.
For my first non-Zoom interview since the end of the circuit breaker, my Editor sent me out to Yishun on a weekday afternoon. It was Wednesday. A few days before Phase 2 reopening. On the Grab ride over, we crossed a bridge over the Lower Seletar Reservoir. The gray clouds hung low and heavy on the horizon, nearly touching the water’s surface.
Sure enough, by the time we reached Yishun, it was pouring rain.
While Yishun may be an inside joke to Singaporeans, to me, an outsider who just moved to Singapore four months ago, it’s a blank slate. Virgin territory that’s still untainted by cat killers and the mythologized exploits of Yishun man.
So you can imagine my excitement when the Grab driver dropped me off in the parking lot of Northpoint Bizhub, a half hour before my scheduled appointment. I walked through the loading bays, past a tuition centre and an oddly placed interior design shop, on my way to the Kim San Leng canteen.
Aside from the hawker stall owners and a few Kim San Leng staff, I was the only customer there. Most of the yellow plastic chairs were still stacked up in a corner, as were the round plastic tables marked with social distancing red tape. Against another wall, there was a row of red and white plastic bags filled with meals being prepared for delivery.
So this was a Yishun coffee shop, I thought to myself.
The Kim San Leng Hawkers
If I’ve learned one thing about Singaporeans, it’s that they like to complain. One would assume that this makes them less productive workers, but in fact, the opposite is true. Complaining is the national stress relief that propels Singaporeans to even greater heights of productivity.
Consider hawker stall owners. They are world class multi-taskers. Chop chicken and complain. Make kimchi and complain. Scrub pots and complain. All while keeping their orders fulfilled and customers fed.
The trick, I’ve learned, to interviewing hawkers is to ask triggering questions, sit back, and wait for the fireworks. Questions like: How is your business doing during the CB? What do you think about the timing of Phase 2? Any opinions on Grab, online dabao systems and cashless payments?
In their downtime, the hawker will expound, in passionate and sometimes conspiratorial tones, on the way things truly are:
(on Business) “Of course business is bad leh! What do you expect? Our boss here is OK. Treats us fairly (in reference to Andy, Kim San Leng’s CEO). At other companies, hawkers are not getting the rental relief they need to survive.”
(on Phase 2) “Let me tell you, for sure there’s going to be a second wave! This Phase 2 is not for health reasons, it’s economic and political reasons only.’
(on Technology) “Cashless payment? Too difficult! When I have trouble, who come and fix for me? Cash is faster. No need to wait two days to see the money (in reference to NETS).”
Kim San Leng hawkers hold court in their kingdom.
Meals Aren’t Just About Survival, It’s Also About Delivering Comfort
That day, the hawkers at Yishun had just finished preparing meals for the Food Bank and DBS’s Feed the City Initiative. It’s a partnership between F&B owners like Kim San Leng and community NGOs to distribute over 200,000 meals to vulnerable families across Singapore.
Zach, the RICE photographer, and I, decided to ride along with Thana, a private contract driver hired by Kim San Leng to make deliveries. On the menu that day was Korean BBQ, a Halal chicken rice bento and a vegetarian option. 250 boxes in total.
Over the past 4-6 weeks, Kim San Leng has delivered over 10,000 meals to communities across Singapore. Normally, the CEO Andy and his family would help pack, load and deliver the boxes personally.
“The two brothers, Andy and Alfred are very hands on,” remarked Thana. “Whenever we deliver to a new place, they are always there on the ground, talking to people.”
On the drive over, Thana shared with us his struggles working as a Grab driver during the circuit breaker, a job that includes picking up hospital workers after their late night shifts. On longer commutes, his passengers would fall asleep almost instantly after getting into the car. Thana would wake them up when they reached their destination.
“Here we are,” said Thana as we parked in front of an HDB complex in Buangkok.
We had arrived at our first drop-off point.
Thana, the delivery driver.
NGOs In HDB Flats
New Hope Community Services is a volunteer organisation that is literally embedded within the community they serve. Their offices are located on the 13th floor of a HDB flat in Buangkok.
The floor comes with an office space and a built-in examination / counseling room.
“I’ve never seen that before,” said Zach, as he snapped photos.
We followed Thana as he handed over the meals to the New Hope volunteer. On the lift back down, Thana received a call.
“The girls from the Food Bank are waiting for you at the next location,” he told me after hanging up. “Let’s go.”
The Food Bank Girls and Vending Machines for the Needy
Margarita and her colleague Jessie met us at the second drop-off location at Ang Mo Kio. As coordinators for the Food Bank, their job is to serve as the liaison between F&B owners and the NGOs in their network.
During the circuit breaker, they’ve made a shift from distributing non-perishable foods to cooked meals in response to an alarming spike in demand.
“People are losing their jobs,” said Margarita. “Some are working fewer hours. We’ve been seeing this trend in our database. Across Singapore, the demand for cooked meals has been rising steadily.”
Sometimes, this demand can pop up in places Singaporeans least expect. Like private condo flats.
“People have certain ideas of what a ‘needy’ family looks like,” said Margarita. “But you often can’t judge on the surface.”
What happens when both parents lose their jobs suddenly? Would living in a condo flat disqualify their children for aid?
It is the job of the Food Bank to carefully vet all profiles and backgrounds through questionnaires, surveys, and data, working closely with local NGOs who understand their communities best.
By compiling city-wide data on the food needs of vulnerable families and communities, the Food Bank hopes to set up 20 food-on-demand vending machines across Singapore by the end of the year, as a way to ensure food security, while eliminating food waste.
A pilot project of 3 machines has already been rolled out in neighborhoods like Toa Payoh.
For this to work, training for the elderly is critical.
“The cards we issued had to be simple to use. Basically, you just scan your card and select your item on the vending machine. Still, extensive training will need to be done at community centres to ensure the elderly get used to it,” said Margarita.
The digital future is coming, even for charities like the Food Bank.
Bridging the Generation Gap With Technology
I purposefully saved my interview with Andy, Kim San Leng’s CEO for last.
You can learn a lot about a CEO not by what he has to say for himself, but by listening to what people say about him—especially from those who don’t receive their paychecks directly from him.
From hawker stall owners, delivery drivers, to the various NGO beneficiaries that work with the Food Bank, everyone had positive things to say about Andy and his family. Even before this crisis, the Hoon family had been a constant and active presence in the communities they serve.
But praise is one thing. Respect is another. The latter has to be earned over many years, and sometimes can only be tested during the most difficult times.
Andy is in his early forties, a third generation CEO of Kim San Leng, taking the reins from their father, who has ‘retired,’ if not in presence, but at least in name. The ‘CEO emeritus’ still retains a dominant voice in the running of the business.
And in the eyes of the old-timers who’ve run KSL’s hawker stalls for decades, Andy and his brother Alfred are still just the “boss’s sons.” Their past attempts to digitise Kim San Leng have sometimes fallen on deaf ears. For example, reception was muted when Kim San Leng set up the coffee shop industry’s first online dabao ordering system, making the hawker selections of its various locations available island-wide.
But the attitude quickly changed after the pandemic. During the circuit breaker, nobody complained when they realised that the online dabao system was working for them.
The hawkers also started noticing that the ‘boss’s sons’ were actively trying to help them through hard times. Kim San Leng took no cut from the Feed the City initiative, and diverted all the proceeds directly to the hawkers and the delivery drivers.
Andy, CEO of Kim San Leng.
Unbeknownst to them, Andy was also analysing the delivery data behind the scenes, actively promoting the stalls with the fewest number of orders on Kim San Leng’s social media pages.
“In order for Kim San Leng to become a household name, I want all of my hawkers to do well, not just the superstar stalls,” explained Andy.
In the future, he wanted Singaporean families to say, ‘let’s go to Kim San Leng’ and not ‘let’s go to Famous Chicken Rice Stall X.’
The brand itself should be synonymous with quality, both in person as a communal experience and online as a dabao option offering a wide selection of favourites.
“The most important thing I’ve learned through this pandemic is the value of trust, respect, and relationships,” said Andy. “Most importantly, my generation needs to be humble to the hawkers. They are my business.”
The future that Andy envisions won’t come easy. But during this pandemic, he’s seeing a silver lining in the clouds.
“My brother and I have made more progress in the past two months with the old hawkers and my father than we have over the past four years!” laughed Andy.
Sixty-plus-year-old hawker uncles have begun approaching the brothers with questions about online dabao systems and cashless payments. His father has also taken a backseat, trusting Andy and his brother to handle the crisis.
All of this was inconceivable before Covid-19.
Perhaps we’ve all been too quick to write off traditional coffee shops like Kim San Leng as a sunset industry.
Who knows? There might just be some daylight left.
This story was brought to you by Kim San Leng.
Kim San Leng is one of the oldest coffee shop chains in Singapore, having been in business since the 1950s. Today, they have over 30 outlets islandwide, and have launched an in-house delivery service where you can get delicious local delicacies delivered to your doorstep.
