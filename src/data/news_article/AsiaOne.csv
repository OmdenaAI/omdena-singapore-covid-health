1,'It took months to see the end of the tunnel': Gymnast opens up about how her coaches caused her eating disorder – and why she still loves the sport,https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/it-took-months-see-end-tunnel-gymnast-opens-about-how-her-coaches-caused-her-eating,Kimberly Anne Lim,"June 05, 2021","When she first started gymnastics at the age of eight, Joy Koh recalls being mesmerised by cartwheels and splits. But she was soon hit with a reality check. Subscribing to the ""no pain, no gain"" mindset, her coaches would body shame her and push her beyond her limits, the 36-year-old tells AsiaOne. ""If a child is crying and puking, it's correct [to them], because the more pain you're in, the more progress there is,"" she says of her coaches. The constant abuse even caused her to develop a host of eating disorders, from body dysmorphia to bulimia. Now an accomplished coach herself, Joy says she's determined not to let her students go through the same thing. She's also had a whirlwind stint on television as part of the cast of The Apprentice: One Championship Edition, competing with 15 other contestants for the chance to win a one year job with the sports media company and US$250,000 (S$331,121). While her pitch on developing the company's brand in the children's sport industry didn't get her far (she was 'fired' in the fifth week of the competition), Joy says the experience was ""amazing"" and further cemented her passion for working with kids. [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CMnyzSIHAI7/[/embed] Enduring eight years of abuse Back when she first took up gymnastics, her parents had objected as they were afraid of her getting injured, Joy recalls. But she insisted as she was drawn to the sport. So when her coaches began berating her for being ""too fat"", she felt like she had nowhere to turn. ""I couldn't tell them the struggles that I was facing in the gym. Because as soon as as I did that, they were like, 'Well, see, I told you, so you should stop.'"" The granular focus on her body was only intensified by the 'talent ID' process – her coaches would keep track of everything from bone density to the length of her arms and legs. [[nid:531043]] As someone who was naturally ""big boned"", she wasn't considered ""physically gifted"" for the sport, she explains. Whenever she couldn't get certain skills or moves down, her coaches would chalk it up to her weight, says Joy. By her teenage years, she'd developed body dysmorphia and bulimia, and also suffered late onset of puberty as a result. It was only when she left the sport at 16 that she began the process of working through everything, she says. Things got better once she was out of the toxic coaching environment, she shares, but it took her years to get back into fitness and healthy eating. ""And it doesn't happen overnight, it took months, if not years, to see the light at the end of the tunnel,"" Joy says . ""And you're like, wow, I can actually look at myself and not be terribly disgusted at what I see in the mirror."" Going back to gymnastics Despite the detrimental effect her coaches had on her, Joy says she's not giving up on the sport – which she still loves, she makes sure to emphasise. Citing Athlete A, a Netflix documentary covering the notorious sexual abuse scandal involving former US gymnastics national team doctor Larry Nassar, she acknowledges that the gymnastics field does indeed have ""a very bad rep"". Closer to home, Singaporean gymnasts have said that they were pressured to lose weight and diet. ""And so part of me wanting to come back to the sport is to have a positive influence, and to hopefully develop the sport. ""I think definitely just knowing that, somewhere, another child can be going through the same thing is part of the reason why I'm back coaching gymnastics,"" she explains. For her, seeing them surpass their limits and learn new skills is ""priceless"", she says. [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CLIeobDH2IG/[/embed] Since she's returned to gymnastics, she's been doing better than ever, coaching at prestigious events including International Gymnastics Camp in the US and judging at the Asian Games and World Championships. She's also landed a new gymnastics coaching gig in Thailand. Her eyes light up when she tells us about her new role as the head of gymnastics at an international school, where she'll work with kids from kindergarten, up to secondary school. ""Some coaches are very results oriented. They only want to work with talented kids. ""But I think about it this way. I'm really lucky that this child wants to sign up to do gymnastics. They want to learn so we're here to support them completely and help them in their journey."" kimberlylim@asiaone.com ",FALSE
2,'Everyone watching makes me feel uneasy': Students speak up on mental health struggles during home-based learning,https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/everyone-watching-makes-me-feel-uneasy-students-speak-mental-health-struggles-during-home,Mardhiah Haslan,"June 01, 2021","These days, Natasha Osman would sit in front of her laptop, her fingers fiddling with the wire of her earphones as she waited for her turn to speak. For the National University of Singapore (NUS) student, she could feel the nerves running through her with each Zoom class – her palms sweaty as she prepared to answer a question. The moment the 22-year-old unmuted her microphone and opened her mouth, she felt herself freeze as the thoughts and vision of her classmates, from the Faculty of Arts & Social Sciences, blurred. She felt as though she was drowning in water as she tried to gasp for air, her lecturer's concerned voice fading in and out of her ears. As soon as the dreaded feeling was over, she muted herself while – seemingly unable to speak further – her thoughts interrupted by her cats' purring in her room. Natasha is not alone. Some students cheered while others jeered when most schools started home-based learning on May 19. For many students, home-based learning (HBL) meant – among other mental health struggles – coping with the anxiety of being seen and speaking up for participation points during lessons. ""Although I have no issue with turning on my camera,"" Natasha told AsiaOne, ""I feel immense pressure to participate during lessons especially since the majority of the modules I'm taking now have graded class participation."" Having started HBL since last year's circuit breaker, she added that an increased percentage of graded class participation meant increased competitiveness among students in the digital space. [[nid:529611]] She said: ""The competitiveness among students had worsened my discomfort and anxiety before and during lessons, especially since I find it terrifying and difficult to ideate or answer questions on the spot."" Campus Technology conducted a recent survey of over 1,000 college students in the United States, addressing the struggles they faced while learning during a pandemic. 63 per cent said their overall learning experience was worse. Meanwhile, 53 per cent of online students and 38 per cent of in-person students felt the same. ""I think I'm more productive in school than at home,"" Republic Polytechnic (RP) student Manushri Rajesvaran told AsiaOne. ""There are a lot more teamwork-based assignments that require communication among the group which is tougher to do if it is online."" Anxiety heightens online communication  Some students like Manushri, who studies human resource and psychology, find it uncomfortable to keep their microphones and cameras switched on and engage in online team discussions due to existing living conditions. ""As I live in a household of seven members, it can get quite noisy as my family members are very loud,"" the 20-year-old told AsiaOne. ""I get really anxious whenever our lecturers would ask us to turn on our camera and mic for presentations as I am afraid that they might hear the chaos around me."" ""I also struggle to present sometimes as the pressure of being put on the spot with everyone watching makes me feel uneasy,"" she added, who started HBL on May 19.  According to media reports, students are often expected to turn on their camera for the entire lesson to ensure that they stay focused. While this may help educators ensure students pay attention, the prolonged eye contact during lessons may feel uncomfortable for some. It creates the feeling as though everyone is watching, and students may be distracted as they are seemingly more aware of how they appear on camera. [[nid:529143]] Meanwhile, secondary one student Danish Muhammad Noordin has learnt to enjoy HBL, since it started on May 19. The 13-year-old told AsiaOne: ""I can wake up a bit later and end school earlier, which gives me more time to relax."" Though he was worried about his performance during lessons, he does not feel pressured when it comes to openly answering questions in class. He added: ""I would say I am a very confident person so I have no worry turning on my camera when the teacher tells me to."" Common mental health issues students face The top three common mental health struggles students face include anxiety, social connectedness, and irritation students feel at home, founder and principal psychologist at The Therapy Room (TTR) Dr Geraldine Tan told AsiaOne. She said: ""As the method of teaching is different, online learning has been tough for many students as they require a more dynamic learning environment. ""They are anxious as they cannot understand the lessons."" Additionally, being confined at home with their families is another challenge students face – some feel that their home environment is not an ideal place to work or study in. Manushri, who lives with seven family members, found it a challenge to work and study with limited space. She said: ""There will always be noise despite telling them to quieten down and they would somehow disrupt my presentations."" Given the situation, Dr Tan explained that the number of students that have sought help had increased about 10 to 15 per cent over the last year. In addition, Dr Tan shared that the recent cases are due to the ""prolonged situation that did not seem to ease but appear to be worsening"". She added: ""(We should) understand that these teens need their space from home and to find their identities."" Also, some students who struggle with mental health issues tend to seek help without their parent's knowledge as they fear being dismissed, according to media reports. Dr Tan highlighted that there are times whereby students may turn to external help instead of their school counsellors. She said there could be several reasons but the common ones include not wanting their friends to know about their struggles, some worry about the information being in their records, while others were recommended from friends to seek external help.  Mental health care tips Dr Tan suggested five ways for students to cope with their mental health struggles: 1. Stay connected with friends and family as social isolation can cause your mood to dip. 2. Include exercise as part of your daily routine to perk up your day. 3. Eat healthily as a poor diet can affect your mood and cause sluggishness. With many students holed up at home – or in their rooms – they would snack or order meals that may be balanced. 4. Have a to-do list, and keep to it. It helps to keep you on track and motivated. Strike the items off the list as you go along.  5. Instead of just watching Netflix, challenge and stimulate your brain with reading or playing board games.    SINGAPORE HELPLINES  Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444 Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019 Care Corner Counselling Centre (Mandarin): 1800-353-5800 Institute of Mental Health's Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222 Silver Ribbon: 6386-1928   mardhiahhaslan@asiaone.com ",FALSE

5,'I wanted to push the aircon out and jump down with it': Entrepreneur's epic meltdown changed his life... for the better,https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/i-wanted-push-aircon-out-and-jump-down-it-entrepreneurs-epic-meltdown-changed-his-life,Candice Cai,"January 09, 2021","In his 30s and at the peak of his life and career, Daniel Lim's world unravelled in dramatic fashion, while on holiday in New York, no less. It ended with him throwing up and screaming incoherently at the Guggenheim Museum, before he was put on an emergency flight back to Singapore.  The trigger for the meltdown was an innocent confluence of factors — a bad case of the flu, a body drugged up by medication, and pre-vacation work stress — something many of us might have experienced. But brewing unseen were years of living with an unhealthy mindset, providing the 'perfect' backdrop for everything to come together explosively at the end of 2012. In a podcast which he co-hosts twice a month, the entrepreneur turned life coach shared that the first glimpse of what was to come occurred the moment he landed in New York. Sudden spiral  Upon touching down in the city, Daniel puzzled over why the world around him appeared in dull, monochromatic tones, ""like Gotham City"". Over the next few days, he experienced ""mini waves of anxiety"". Physically, his body had also started to revolt by refusing to keep food down. The tipping point came one morning, when he remembered feeling ""very harassed"" by the noise of the rattling air-conditioning unit in his hotel room. Suddenly, he felt an urge to not only push it out of the window but also jump out along with it. ""I told myself I wanted to jump out because I wanted relief. I was so annoyed,"" he shared. Catching himself harbouring that ""nasty thought"" made Daniel realise for the first time that he needed help. He tried to call someone but descended into panic when he realised he didn't know how to unlock his mobile phone.  ""I stared at the unlock button and I realised I didn't know what to do with the phone to unlock it. And I freaked out,"" he shared. He didn't know what to do with the hotel phone either.  Daniel finally managed to connect with a friend online through his laptop, and he was quickly booked on a return flight to Singapore. With that reassurance that he was going home, Daniel's body and mind relaxed and things returned to regular programming — or so he thought.  The last thing Daniel recalled of the whole trip was an outing to New York's famed Guggenheim Museum. He was laughing with friends one minute, and the next thing he knew, the ceiling was spinning above him. Till today, he has no recollection of what happened next. According to what friends later told him, Daniel vomited thrice while at the museum and was in hysterics. The only coherent thing which came out of his mouth was ""I want to go home!"", which he yelled throughout the museum. ""My friends thought I was possessed,"" he shared. Next thing he knew, he was packed on an emergency flight back to Singapore, but Daniel doesn't even remember how he managed to get home. ""Mind-body dissociation"" Daniel had suffered what his therapist called a mind-body dissociation, which left him broken, physically and mentally. Back at home, he lost control of his motor skills and bodily functions, which also meant wetting the bed on several occasions. ""That freaked me out because I realised I was very unwell,"" he shared. ""I thought this was it, I have seen the bottom of the barrel of Daniel Lim."" Recovery took months, through therapy and lots of prescribed rest and ""low-stimuli"" activities. Speaking to AsiaOne, the 45-year-old admitted that the scariest thing was that he had no inkling of what was stirring within. In fact, at the point of his meltdown, the serial entrepreneur was riding on a high from his achievements and searching for the next feather in his cap.  He was running two successful digital businesses and negotiating a third and fourth set-up. ""Outwardly and inwardly, everything in my world was unicorns and rainbows. ""That shows how f***ed up my perception was. I had totally wrong priorities. All I wanted was more, more, more."" His insatiable appetite for excess extended to his lifestyle. The former shopaholic could buy up to 20 pairs of shoes at a store he liked. ""I would buy so many things when I went on holiday that when I landed at Changi Airport, I would get taxed because they thought I was a wholesaler,"" Daniel laughed. In his own mind, he thought he had it all and was thriving on the adrenaline, but little did he know that psychologically, he was unravelling. ""The way in which I worked, the manner in which I lived was very, very unhealthy. ""I was clocking two to three hours of sleep every day, and I felt sleep was a waste of time,"" he added. ""I continued to not pay attention to the signs that were already screaming, like the fatigue, the hives that kept breaking out, my heartburn. I didn't really think about whether something was wrong."" With help, Daniel recognised his troubled childhood had ingrained in him the constant need to overachieve, thanks to his 'tiger mum' and a dad who left the family when he was 10. The abandonment plunged the family into poverty almost overnight. Daniel, who has a younger brother, felt the responsibility to ""step up"" and take care of the family.  But today, he credits both his traumatic past and his mental breakdown as the ""best things to happen"" in his life. On the advice of his therapist, Daniel shared his entire meltdown story on Facebook when he came out of recovery after six months. Almost immediately, friends began sharing with him how they too were struggling.  ""That was when I had this revelation that so many people are experiencing similar things. And on the outside, you cannot tell how people are suffering because they are so good at projecting (an image of normality)."" Redefining success  From splashing out $20,000 a month on his wardrobe and living life in the fast lane, Daniel's life is considerably pared down these days. He wears T-shirts from Uniqlo, he has sold off his two cars as well as his house, and he can count the number of shoes that he has at home (around five pairs). The breakdown has also made him someone who's more emotionally connected to himself and others. ""I burst into tears very easily these days,"" he offered, sharing that he teared up simply from watching a moving orchestral performance the night before. It has also led him to pursue another path in life — that of a mindset coach. He works with clients on a range of issues, from relationship problems to anxiety, helping those who are struggling in life or in their business. [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CDGbwPXHpIl/[/embed] His youngest client is a 9-year-old with dreams of starting her own business, while his oldest clients are in their 50s. Many of them have attained their goals in life but find themselves lost.  Success to Daniel now, he said, is the feeling of connection to others, and when he sees people thriving. ""I have done away with the word success, because I think success is a very archaic, old-fashioned thing that everyone's chasing."" ""It's not that money is not important, but it's not how I measure my life,"" said Daniel, who revealed that financially, he's able to retire at this very moment, but isn't doing so because he's found his life purpose.  ""Success for me is time to call my own, freedom, autonomy, great health and vitality."" Worst thing in life is not failure [embed]https://www.instagram.com/p/CJjIKSlJe3V/[/embed] After more than two years in coaching others on emotional management and mental hygiene, we asked Daniel for the secret to bullet-proof oneself from life's slingshots. The answer came almost immediately. ""Other people can be whoever the f*** they want to be, and you have no control over them,"" he stated. ""The only person that you can control is yourself, and your own thinking. This is where our power lies."" He explained further, voice breaking: ""For people who are suffering, who feel trapped or suffocated, what I want to tell them is that pain is inevitable, but suffering is optional. The feeling we have towards the challenges in our lives is truly optional, don't give up. ""The worst thing that can happen in our lives is not failure, it's the emotion [of failure]. And you have a choice, even when you think you don't.""

In the latest episode of the meWATCH talkshow Hear U Out, the 51-year-old actor told local host Quan Yi Fong that it was a dark time for him after he received his diagnosis in 2008.  Back then, the actor was told that he has Kennedy's disease — a rare inherited neuromuscular disorder that causes progressive weakening and wasting of the muscles, particularly the arms and legs. He said: ""I was struggling and couldn't come to terms with it, and I thought, 'Forget it. Why live so miserably?' Other ups and downs in life are easier to deal with and I wondered why my life was such a prank. ""I didn't have a good environment growing up, then life got a bit better and I had fame, money and whatnot; but then my fame declined and when that happened, there were issues with my health. ""I didn't know what lay ahead. I didn't know how to face people and deal with the weird looks they gave me. I also didn't know how long more I could live. There were times when I felt vulnerable. So when I felt vulnerable and couldn't let myself off, negative thoughts started flooding my mind."" Chor Meng was only given 18 months to live at that time, terrible news for a man who has two daughters who were still very young then.  However, it's been 12 years since he was diagnosed and he's become a more positive person. He told Yi Fong that the reason he was able to pull through was because of his faith, and the support and concern from his family and friends. ""For example, when I was shooting (the Chinese drama) 118, [Pan] Lingling and I supported each other. I said, 'Lingling, you're a cancer survivor right? I'm now walking a similar path so let's keep fighting this together. This journey really isn't easy,"" he said. Emotionally, it also took a toll on him as he tearily admitted that he had no choice but to move forward, not knowing what will happen in life. He also said he's ""not a strong person"" but he's ""more persistent"" compared to the average person. In the past, when Chor Meng faced difficulties pertaining to his illness, such as mobility problems, he would not dare to ask for help. But now, he's learnt to look past his ego and seek help from people. He recounted an incident when he was at Tanglin Halt and he needed to ask a female passer-by for help to climb a flight of stairs.  ALSO READ: Chew Chor Meng was shunned by other kids growing up because he didn't have a father Chor Meng said: ""I said I was ill and can't go up the stairs and asked if she could help me. She said okay. I was proud of myself because I was able to let go of my ego and ask for help. I wouldn't have dared to do so in the past."" He added: ""You sometimes find that there's a story behind every smile. Each of them has their own unbearable side. We need to learn how to deal with it. I told myself, 'It's okay. There are others who are worse off and having a tougher time. I must overcome this obstacle.' I'll occasionally feel lousy but I'll try to recover quickly.""

People who have worked with me would know that back then, I was always either sleeping or waking up from it. ""I also either felt very hyper or felt very low. Once I exploded, which was what the public saw in the news, it meant that I had 'short-circuited' in my brain. Through all this, you were there with me. Were my negative news a form of pressure to you?"" Eleanor ?— who appears wise beyond her years in the interview ?— replied while occasionally referring to her mother in the third person: ""A lot of people said on Facebook and other media that I would definitely grow up to be like my mother, and this and that. I see what you are truly like. ""So when people said those things, I thought to myself, why is it an insult if I turn out like my mother? This is a compliment because my mother is very strong. She could control her emotions to this point, when other people in that same position might have already killed themselves. You were able to reach where you are now. You fell many times but managed to pick yourself up.""

Eleanor also added: ""No one knows how strong my mother is. I even told her to write her experiences into a book, and maybe someone would turn it into a movie. ""No one can be like her. After going through the bullying and abuses as a child, she had to endure a lot of people's criticisms and pretend to be resilient. Whether it was family or love, she failed in all her relationships. How do you pick yourself up from all these? She was alone. And she had to support a daughter, too.""

According to an 8world report, the woman had been arguing with her mother since 12pm that day.  The woman, who remains unnamed, then reportedly locked herself and her mother in the flat and threatened suicide. The police said they were alerted to the situation at 1.02 pm. Over 10 police officers, five Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF) officers and two Special Operations Command vehicles were seen at the scene, an eyewitness told the Chinese daily. Officers from the SCDF's Disaster Assistance and Rescue Team were also spotted on the roof of the block. The foot of the block was cordoned off and an inflatable safety life air pack was set up. The six-hour stand-off came to an end when police officers forced open the door and arrested the woman under the Mental Health Act. No one was injured, the police said. According to the pair's neighbours, the daughter frequently threw things around and argued with her mother.  ""The daughter is usually responsible for taking care of her mother, but she spends a lot and can be unstable. The mother was once so angry that she threw her daughter’s belongings away. It got so bad that social workers visited to mediate,” one neighbour revealed to Lianhe Wanbao.  Her daughter has had mental health issues since she was a teenager, the mother told 8world in an interview after the commotion. Although her daughter's condition improved after seeking professional help, this is not the first time she has had such an episode, the mother said, adding that she was ""used to it"". Nevertheless, the two of them have a good relationship and she forgives her daughter, the mother, who is in her eighties, added.  Her daughter is actually the biological child of a former colleague, she shared. She officially adopted her as a child when her family was not able to care for her.

However, months of working from home have taken a toll on some employees, with growing concern about their mental health. Radin Mas MP Melvin Yong touched on the issue in Parliament on Monday (Aug 31). In his speech, he cited a recent survey that found those working from home who were feeling more stressed as compared to frontline workers.  [[nid:498938]] ""I hope that the Government could expand the list of occupational diseases under the Work Injury Compensation Act, to include mental health illnesses related to work stress,"" Yong said. ""I also hope that the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Health can be expedited so that those who are currently struggling with mental health issues related to work can get the necessary support that they need."" In April, a psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health shared how some of her patients were clocking in longer hours at work than before, as they struggled to draw the line between work and home. Overworking, as well as isolation, added to the stress and anxiety that they were facing while working from home, she said. Right to disconnect In Singapore, some employees reported that their superiors at work expected them to be on-call around the clock, even on weekends and public holidays since they were stuck at home during the pandemic. This led to an increase in their workloads.  As more people are now working from home, the MP urged the Government to consider a ""right to disconnect"" legislation, which allows employees to negotiate with their employers on answering work calls and emails outside of office hours. France pioneered the law in 2017, aimed to address the problems caused by an ""always-on"" work culture. The overuse of digital devices in modern workplaces is also linked to issues such as burnout, sleeplessness and relationship problems. ""Having a dedicated break can certainly help to reduce employee fatigue and burnout,"" Yong said.

However, while the 26-year-old is currently recuperating in the intensive care unit (ICU), her employer now faces a hospital bill of $72,000 and growing. Speaking with Shin Min Daily News, Chin Nyet Mei, a 51-year-old hawker, shared that due to the multiple fractures sustained by her domestic helper, doctors had informed her that further operations would be required. ""She's been in the ICU for a week now, and the bill per day is over a thousand dollars. Including her operation fee, her hospital bill is around $72,000,"" Chin lamented. [[nid:499160]] Her domestic helper's insurance only provided a payout of $15,000, leaving her as the employer to foot the rest of it. As much as she wants to help, she still has to pay $500 a month for her mother's accommodation in an old folk's home, making it difficult for her to pay the bill with her earnings as a hawker, she told the Chinese daily. Chin's son, Goh Meng Huang, has since turned to fundraising to cover the cost of May Thu's treatment.  Chin had also got in contact with her domestic helper's family to inform them of the situation, recounting how her maid's mother had burst into tears.  Temporarily living in maid agency dormitory The maid, known as May Thu, had jumped after a failed attempt at stabbing her housemate with a pair of scissors. According to her housemate, May Thu had shown worrying signs since they first met, once even attempting to burn her passport. May Thu had renewed her contract back in December but grew depressed when she found out she couldn't return home to Myanmar in April as promised. The flight had been cancelled due to the Covid-19 pandemic, but May Thu didn't seem to understand, Chin explained. Hoping to provide her with a positive change of environment, Chin paid $140 for her to spend a week off resting at the maid agency's dormitory.  According to the maid agency's boss, several others who roomed with May Thu had attempted to socialise with her, but she often kept to herself. Seeing that her situation had not improved, the 43-year-old had suggested extending her rest. However, she didn't respond and later jumped. He added that relevant authorities have since stepped in to lend their assistance. The Centre for Domestic Employees (CDE) stated that investigations are still underway. While they are currently unable to comment on the case, they urged domestic helpers not to endanger themselves recklessly. Should any of them require assistance, they may contact the CDE through their 24-hour hotline at 1800-2255-233.

The incident occurred on Sunday morning (Aug 16) at Lorong 1 Toa Payoh. Speaking with Shin Min Daily News, the housemate recounted how she had finished taking a shower that day when the 26-year-old woman attempted to stab her with a pair of scissors. The housemate managed to dodge the attack and escape into the living room, where other inhabitants tried to restrain the attacker. However, she managed to break free and started running up and down the corridor, even hitting her head against the wall at one point. Despite their best efforts at reigning her in, they were unable to do so. One of them sustained light injuries on their arm in the process. But before anyone could call the police, the helper suddenly turned tail and ran towards the end of the building and threw herself off the fourth storey ledge. A neighbour was woken up by screams of ""call the police"", he told the Chinese daily. The 35-year-old said: ""When I came out to see what happened, the helper had already jumped. There was blood splattered around her and her body was twitching. It was a horrifying sight."" The police told AsiaOne the woman was found lying motionless at the foot of the block and was conveyed conscious to Tan Tock Seng Hospital. According to the housemate, the helper was showing worrying signs ever since she first moved into the flat, as per their agency's arrangements. ""When I first moved in, she was already here. During this period we'd regularly see her crying and laughing. We once heard her say her work permit was about to expire, but due to our language barrier, I wasn't able to understand further."" At one point in time, the helper attempted to burn her passport too. Police investigations are ongoing. [[nid:490246]] In May, a Filipino domestic helper based in Lebanon jumped to her death due to financial difficulties caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. It was believed she had been laid off after her employers themselves had financial troubles. In Singapore, it was reported that domestic helpers found themselves working more since the circuit breaker was imposed on April 7. Even after the country entered phase one and two of reopening, domestic helpers have been encouraged to stay home during their rest days or take their days off during the weekday to curb the spread of the coronavirus. According to the Centre for Domestic Employees, calls to their helpline had doubled in the month the circuit breaker began, with three in 10 of them related to employment issues. The Foreign Domestic Worker Association for Social Support and Training also noted that the number of helpers who had run away from their employers has doubled.

13,"Singaporeans working from home more stressed than frontline workers, says survey ",https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/singaporeans-working-home-more-stressed-frontline-workers-says-survey,Seow Kai Lun,"August 19, 2020","If there's one thing that many of us can agree on, it's that ever since the circuit breaker hit Singapore, we've felt more stressed than usual — coping with new restrictions and work situations, as well as dealing with a pandemic at hand.  And these changes, which took most of us by surprise, have taken its toll. A survey done by the National University Health System Mind Science Centre (NUHS MSC) in partnership with iamaccb website showed that more than 60 per cent of those who were working from home (WFH) reported feeling stressed at work.  What's surprising though is that only 53 per cent of the those working at the frontline, referring to those who still went out to work during circuit breaker, were feeling stressed at work.  The survey was done with 1,407 respondents — 114 of them frontline workers and 1,074 who work from home. And perhaps because of the lack of differentiation between home and work environments for those WFH, 51 per cent were stressed at home, compared to just 32 per cent for frontliners.  Similar findings were found in a study done by Cigna that saw an increase in the number of people in Singapore who suffered from work-related stress after WFH measures were implemented. Females feeling more stressed  In an interview with Nikkei Asian Review, Mind Care Therapy Suites' principal clinical psychologist Gifford Chan said that handling personal and business commitments in the same physical setting is not easy, and this alone can be enough to induce stress.  ""It is difficult to juggle being a manager and being a mother in the same place and at, literally, the same time. This lack of role clarity creates mental stress for the individual, which can spill over to create stress at work."" The handling of multiple roles at home during the pandemic is perhaps why women (63.8 per cent) were also more likely to report being stressed while WFH compared to men (52.5 per cent). For example, project manager, Leong Lye Yin had to be the main caregiver for her children, aged five and 11, manage her son's home-based learning programme and work on her projects from home. Hence she was admittedly under higher stress levels while WFH. ""Naturally bosses expect the same level of productivity when employees work from home, but my time was divided between work and helping my son with his school work, as well as keeping my younger daughter occupied and engaged at home. ""My husband did try to help when he is home, but I feel that men are less detail-oriented, so the kids still come to me for the little things which can add up to a lot of time,"" she shared.  Coping well with WFH despite the higher stress levels Based on the findings from NUHS MSC, despite the higher levels of stress, Singaporeans were still coping with work during this Covid-19 period, finding it manageable. Only 21 per cent felt that they were not coping well.  A survey done by EngageRocket with 20,000 respondents across 127 companies showed that Singaporeans have also learnt to cope better with WFH over time.  [[nid:497862]] A higher percentage of people (23 per cent) when surveyed in June said they were more productive working from home than in the office, compared to in April (15 per cent). The number of people who said they required more time to do tasks at home compared to their workplace also dropped from 42 per cent to 29 per cent over the same time period.  Another finding from the EngageRocket survey was that two-thirds of respondents would prefer to WFH 50 to 75 per cent of the time across all sizes of organisations and industries. Nearly 10 per cent of respondents also indicated that they didn't want to work from home completely.  The report suggested that experiences over this compulsory WFH period has made the in-office, nine-to-five workday no longer the norm, and employees' expectations of their employers would also have been altered for good.   kailun@asiaone.com ",TRUE
14,Finding circuit breaker hard to cope with? Help is just a call or click away,https://www.asiaone.com/lifestyle/finding-circuit-breaker-hard-cope-help-just-call-or-click-away,Seow Kai Lun,"April 24, 2020","[UPDATED, April 29, 2020]: With extension and tightening of circuit breaker measures, allied health services outside of the public healthcare institutions will be classified as essential services from April 29. This includes rehabilitation or therapy services, and other allied health services including counselling, social work and psychology, though with restrictions in place to reduce movements and interactions.  Telephone and online services will still be available for those who need to speak to someone during this period.   Perhaps it is worrying about potentially losing your job, finding it difficult to cope with work from home and home-based learning arrangements or simply feeling trapped due to the strict stay-home guidelines. These feelings of fear, stress and isolation can easily overwhelm and take over during these uncertain times of Covid-19. Already in other countries around the world, people are finding it increasingly difficult to cope. In Indonesia, being isolated has led to cabin fever and people talking to stray cats, while in Hong Kong, there has been a rise in the number of mental health patients.  Sandro Galea, Dean and Robert A. Knox Professor at Boston University of Public Health in an interview with the World Economic Forum said, ""The fact that social isolation is associated with poor mental health is unquestionable"". He suggested keeping to a routine, exercising and keeping connected with loved ones via technology as ways to mitigate the toll. While there are tips you can follow to keep calm, everyone is built differently and manages stressors and anxiety differently. Needing help should not be seen as a sign of weakness. Psychological treatment may have been classified as a non-essential service in Singapore during the current circuit breaker, but the good news is that help is still available via phone and online.

In an emotional Facebook post, Kim Hyung-kook, a pastor, confessed his regret at not recognising the severity of Sulli's problems when she asked him for help. Kim opened up about his encounter with Sulli, whose real name is Choi Jin-ri, sharing that he first met her two years ago through mutual friends.

She already had suicidal thoughts. ""Her condition didn't look very bad at the time, so I told her I could put a band-aid on it, but it was better to solve the underlying problem."" Hoping that Sulli would experience ""true recovery though a genuine encounter with God"", Kim recommended that she attend bible study and worship sessions. [[nid:464532]] According to Kim, Sulli only attended several meetings before she stopped coming ""for one reason or another"". ""I have a heavy heart, thinking that I did not respond more urgently to a person in crisis,"" Kim lamented. ""I just hope for her to rest in peace in the arms of the Lord."" Sulli, who started her showbiz career as a child actress and later joined the girl group f(x), had gone on a hiatus in 2014 due to hate comments from online trolls. Her sudden death at 25 took fans by surprise as she had just released a new single, Goblin. She had also recently hosted JTBC's Night of Hate Comments, a talk show where celebrity guests tackle hateful comments, malicious rumours, and cyberbullying.
