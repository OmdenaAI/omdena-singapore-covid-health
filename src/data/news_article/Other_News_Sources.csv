0,Singapore's stressed workers highlight COVID mental health strain,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMicGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1Nwb3RsaWdodC9Db3JvbmF2aXJ1cy9TaW5nYXBvcmUtcy1zdHJlc3NlZC13b3JrZXJzLWhpZ2hsaWdodC1DT1ZJRC1tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoLXN0cmFpbjLSAQA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Nikkei Asia,7/7/2021,"SINGAPORE -- Fed up with his job, Singaporean lawyer Nick Ng resigned from a financial services company in March without alternative employment lined up.

For the 37-year-old, teleworking conditions under the COVID-19 crisis had become unbearable, since the company essentially expected its legal team to be available round the clock.

""Coupled with today's technology allowing for instant messaging, this blurred the work-life balance to a point where I dreaded receiving constant notifications on my mobile,"" he recalled. Amid the frequent pings, he said he experienced severe heart palpitations and breathlessness, and ended up consulting both a doctor and a psychologist.

Feeling ""always on"" is a pandemic experience many in Asia and around the world can relate to. Some countries are also confronting serious health and economic emergencies, from the alarming collapse of Indonesian hospital services to cash-strapped Malaysians pleading for help with white flags.

But recent studies suggest workers in Singapore -- often held up as an example of largely successful COVID-19 containment -- are taking a relatively heavy mental and emotional toll. Regardless of location, experts warn the personal strain of the relentless pandemic should not be overlooked.

One survey, conducted by Australian payroll software company Employment Hero, found the Singaporean workforce to be the unhappiest among five markets.

Singapore tied with Britain for the dubious honor of having the most miserable workers, with 48% in both countries saying they were unhappy in their jobs and would not recommend their companies as places to work.

The study, conducted from March to May to gauge the impact of COVID-19 on employees and employers, covered more than 3,000 employees in the two countries as well as Malaysia, New Zealand and Australia.

Malaysia's unhappiness ratio was 42%, while New Zealand's was 41% and Australia's was 40%.

This year, Singapore has moved back and forth on restrictions limiting social and workplace interactions -- at times re-tightening rules to combat infection clusters. While its virus numbers are far below those seen in some other Southeast Asian countries, concerns about imported cases of the more contagious delta variant have kept the city-state on edge.

""The financial pressures, continued COVID-19 outbreaks, and the uncertainty of lockdowns are contributors to increased stress levels among the Singaporean workforce,"" observed Ben Thompson, co-founder and CEO of Employment Hero.

""When we asked Singaporeans what they would need to help reduce their stress levels and feel happier, the majority -- 69% -- said they want better work-life balance, whether this is flexible working hours, or options for remote-working and work-life integration,"" he added.

Another study highlighted concerns about well-being not only in Singapore but also several other centers of Asian commerce.

Cigna, a U.S. health services company, in April conducted a mental wellness survey of over 18,000 respondents across different markets. On an index measuring perceptions of health and well-being based on social activity, family life and work, Singapore fell below the global benchmark of 61.3 with a score of 59.2.

Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and Hong Kong were behind Singapore in the 50s. In contrast, China scored 65.9, Indonesia 63.8 and Thailand 62.5. India also scored highly, at 73.2, though Cigna noted that in some cases, the research predated serious COVID-19 resurgences.

Globally, 72% of respondents rated mental health as a very important influence on their personal health and well-being, followed by physical health at 70%.

""The pandemic has led to a greater awareness of mental health issues with increasing numbers of people seeking help,"" said Dawn Soo, regional medical officer for the Asia-Pacific at Cigna International Markets.

Across Asia, burnout and even ""death by overwork"" were major issues long before the coronavirus arrived. Attitudes toward mental health and the availability of help also differ widely from country to country. But the pandemic has brought increased global recognition that it is a crucial public health factor, perhaps especially during crises.

At the World Health Assembly in May, delegates endorsed a Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2030, the World Health Organization said on its website. ""For the first time, the plan includes an indicator on preparedness for providing mental health and psychosocial support during emergencies.""

The WHO said member states are encouraged to ""develop and strengthen comprehensive mental health services and psychosocial support as part of universal health coverage, with a particular focus on improving understanding and acceptance of mental health conditions, vulnerable populations, and use of innovative technologies.""

In the case of Singapore, Cigna's Soo suggested some of the burden may also fall on individuals to build their own resilience.

""One key challenge that Singaporeans continue to face is the insufficient preventive work that should be done alongside efforts to destigmatize mental health issues,"" she said. ""Focusing on improving wellness will be critical if we want to emerge from this pandemic stronger together, as we will learn how to take better care of ourselves and manage stress better than before.""

She recommended trying to build supportive social circles, reacting and offering help when friends or colleagues appear to be in distress.

At the workplace, she said bosses should look into giving workers greater flexibility to alleviate the pandemic's negative fallout. She said this should include awareness of the need for family time, which can contribute to a more positive outlook and decrease stress levels.

""Employers should note this trend and explore ways to better support their staff, such as enabling people to spend quality time with their loved ones, rather than simply focusing on work outcomes,"" Soo said.

For professionals like Ng -- who landed a new job as legal counsel for a medical services company in May -- the hope is that bosses will be more understanding of the pressures of working during a pandemic.

""An employee's physical, mental and emotional health is far more important than anything else right now,"" Ng said. ""Employees are not working from home -- they are at home trying to work in a crisis."""
1,Covid-19: Singapore schools tackle mental health amid pandemic stress,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiLGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmJiYy5jb20vbmV3cy93b3JsZC1hc2lhLTU2NzIwMzY40gEwaHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuYmJjLmNvbS9uZXdzL3dvcmxkLWFzaWEtNTY3MjAzNjguYW1w?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,BBC News,25/6/2021,"In the UK, where schools were shut for the best part of half a year, a government report said one in six children aged five to 16 had a probable mental health disorder in 2020 - up from one in nine three years earlier. The situation is similar in the US, where hospitals saw a 31% rise in mental health emergency visits by 12- to 17-year-olds in April to October from a year earlier, according to the CDC."
2,Physical Activity Levels and Mental Health Burden of Healthcare Workers during COVID-19 Lockdown,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiNGh0dHBzOi8vb25saW5lbGlicmFyeS53aWxleS5jb20vZG9pLzEwLjEwMDIvc21pLjMwNzjSAQA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Wiley,8/7/2021,"The outbreak of COVID-19 has precipitated international lockdown measures to curb disease transmissions. The closure of public activity spaces as well as changes in pandemic workload may disrupt healthcare workers’ physical activity and self-care routines. We sought to examine the association between physical activity levels and mental health burden of healthcare workers during the COVID-19 lockdown in Singapore. This cross-sectional study comprised of an multidomain survey that was administered digitally to 707 healthcare workers between May 17 and June 18 2020. Exercise frequency, duration and intensity of these healthcare workers had reduced significantly during the lockdown compared to pre-lockdown. 25.3%, 37.2%, and 11.9% had screened positive for moderate-to-extremely-severe depression, anxiety and stress respectively. Reductions in exercise duration was a significant risk factor for mild stress and moderate-to-severe depression while increase in exercise frequency was found to be a protective factor against depressed mood. Our study revealed that a short-term reduction in physical activity levels during lockdown was associated with poorer psychological outcomes. Given the protection that exercise confers on depression, physical activity should be promoted at the workplace and at home to support healthcare workers to cope through this protracted health crisis.

3,Singapore’s migrant workers have endured interminable lockdowns,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaGh0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmVjb25vbWlzdC5jb20vYXNpYS8yMDIxLzA2LzE5L3NpbmdhcG9yZXMtbWlncmFudC13b3JrZXJzLWhhdmUtZW5kdXJlZC1pbnRlcm1pbmFibGUtbG9ja2Rvd25z0gEA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,The Economist,19/6/2021,"I T IS MORE than a year since Mohammad Sharif Uddin leafed through a book at the National Library or wandered beneath Singapore’s skyscrapers, two of his favourite pastimes. Since early 2020 migrant workers such as Mr Sharif, a Bangladeshi who oversees safety on construction sites, have endured lockdowns far stricter and longer than those imposed on the rest of Singapore’s population. His employer ferries him to and from work. But otherwise he must remain in his dormitory, where he shares a room with eight others. He passes the time on a top bunk reading, writing, praying and trying to stay cool amid the heat. “I feel like I am trapped in a cage.”

More than 300,000 of Singapore’s migrant workers live in dormitories (one is pictured). Most are men from India, Bangladesh or China, sharing rooms that accommodate as many as 20 people. These cramped conditions made it easy for covid-19 to spread. Four out of five dorm-dwellers surveyed in April 2020 by HOME , a charity, said it was difficult to keep a distance from others. That month new cases of covid-19 in the dorms peaked at nearly 1,400 a day. Foreign workers living in dormitories account for nearly 90% of all the people who have tested positive for covid-19 in Singapore. Antibody tests suggest that by December nearly half of the workers in dormitories had been infected.

At the beginning of the crisis strict lockdowns prevented many migrants from leaving their dormitory rooms, even to cook meals. By November most were back at work and had been given limited freedom to visit “recreation centres” set aside for them, where they can shop for groceries and send money home. At first the government allowed them to visit these places once a week for three hours; this was increased to three times a week for four hours. But the visits were stopped in May, after a slight rise in infections. Workers must get approval to run essential errands.

HealthServe, a charity that helps provide medical care to migrant workers, says that the restrictions have exacerbated “feelings of isolation, anxiety and despair”. Last year journalists reported several cases of migrant workers killing themselves (the government said it had not observed a spike in such deaths). In December HOME said stories reported in the media were the “tip of the iceberg”. It says a hotline that it runs has received many more calls related to suicide than in previous years.

The crisis could improve conditions in the long term. Last year the government set up a task force that is seeking ways to improve migrant workers’ mental health. Officials thinned crowds in dormitories by moving some residents into former schools and vacant factories. The government says it is building new permanent accommodation blocks that will offer slightly better conditions. It says polls of migrant workers find that most are “coping well”. But it says restrictions on their movements will remain tight until more of the people living in dormitories are vaccinated and “the covid-19 situation in Singapore further improves”. By early June only a fifth of dorm-dwellers had received all their jabs, compared with a third of the overall population.

Many migrants have gone home. Last year the number of foreigners employed in industries such as construction and shipbuilding shrank by about 16%. Mr Sharif would be on a flight back to Bangladesh if he could afford it. Instead he has made use of his idle hours to write and publish a diary of his days under lockdown. As he puts it: “The government has locked us in invisible shackles.” ■

4,Can leaders help ease employees' mental health struggles?,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMid2h0dHBzOi8vd3d3LmhjYW1hZy5jb20vYXNpYS9zcGVjaWFsaXNhdGlvbi9tZW50YWwtaGVhbHRoL2Nhbi1sZWFkZXJzLWhlbHAtZWFzZS1lbXBsb3llZXMtbWVudGFsLWhlYWx0aC1zdHJ1Z2dsZXMvMjYwMzA20gEA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Human Resources Director,9/7/2021,"Then a separate study by Samaritans of Singapore reported that 2020 saw the highest number of suicide cases in eight years. The number of cases for youths and adults, or those under 59 years old, saw a rise by 7% from the year before. Findings showed that it was likely due to the isolation and psychological distress caused by the pandemic. Is there anything that leaders can do to help employees?

How to support staff struggling with mental health

At a recent panel event discussing men’s mental health by AmCham Hong Kong (AmCham), leaders shared small steps firms can take to support staff through tough times. Brian Henderson, former C-suite leader and founder of Whole Business Wellness Ltd believes employers have an obligation to raise awareness and educate staff on mental health and well-being. He shared that in his days as a top rank exec, he somewhat knew that he had symptoms of burnout and depression, “but I didn’t know that I really needed to act on them and get some help”.

Yes, you should help create a safe space for staff to share their experiences and role model practices that you want seen in employees, but there are also tools available that can help individuals as well as companies evaluate their level of resilience – especially whether they’re thriving or struggling. Such assessment tools can help individuals hone in on specific areas of vulnerability, and suggest what you can do about it, be it simple, practical self-care habits or more serious solutions.

Sometimes what can help manage your well-being is firstly, an acknowledgement of your struggle, and next, an adoption of “simple stuff” that can be built into your day, like mindfulness, breathing exercises or going outdoors, he said. “All of those little steps, if you stick with them early enough, because you actually knew you needed to pay attention to this thing [can] avoid you ending up where I ended up,” he said. “I didn’t take the steps at the right time and there was a long, long time to recover.”"
5,Third APAC Psychiatry Symposium discusses treatment of mental disorders during COVID-19,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiigFodHRwczovL3d3dy5iaW9zcGVjdHJ1bWFzaWEuY29tL25ld3MvMzAvMTg0NTgvdGhpcmQtYXBhYy1wc3ljaGlhdHJ5LXN5bXBvc2l1bS1kaXNjdXNzZXMtdHJlYXRtZW50LW9mLW1lbnRhbC1kaXNvcmRlcnMtZHVyaW5nLWNvdmlkLTE5Lmh0bWzSAQA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,BSA bureau,28/6/2021,"Over One Thousand Psychiatrists Gather to Discuss the Diagnosis and Treatment of Mental Disorders During COVID-19

At the third Asia Pacific (APAC) Psychiatry Symposium, held online on June 26, more than 1,000 psychiatrists, general practitioners and healthcare professionals from 10 countries and regions including Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Hong Kong and Taiwan of China, discussed the challenges faced in managing mental disorders during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the clinical treatment strategies and difficulties in this field.

Organized by China-based Luye Pharma Group, the annual Asia Pacific Psychiatry Symposium is now in its third year.

This year, three current presidents of national psychiatric associations in the Asia-Pacific region were invited to serve as lecturers at the symposium: Prof. Chawanun Charnsil from Thailand, Prof. Ahmad Hatim Bin Sulaiman from Malaysia, and Dr. Luzviminda Katigbak from the Philippines.

Psychiatrists from a total of seven Asia Pacific countries and regions also delivered presentations. The agenda focused primarily on the challenges of treating mental health problems during the pandemic and the management of bipolar disorder.

Symposium experts said that patients suffering from both a mental illness and COVID-19 can continue using psychotropic medication, but need to consider the possibility of drug interactions between psychotropic drugs and medication for COVID-19 treatment, with effects such as respiratory sedation caused by psychotropic medication.

Experts also suggested that people with severe mental illness should be prioritized in vaccine allocation strategies, and during the vaccination process they should continue to receive treatment with antipsychotics.

The Asia Pacific Psychiatry Symposium is positioned to be forward-looking, practical, and innovative, and acts as an academic platform combining the most up-to-date topics on the frontiers of psychiatry and clinical practice."
6,Singapore PM lauds Sikh community for their services during Covid-19 pandemic,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiELC3BIRkIh7V0AL7UB2OEF8qMwgEKioIACIQjry_YPDACxKLbeLPU-ztoCoUCAoiEI68v2DwwAsSi23iz1Ps7aAwy4DGBg?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Deccan Herald,3/7/2021,"Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong on Saturday lauded the local Sikh community for providing support to people through various assistance programmes during the Covid-19 pandemic regardless of race, religion or background.

Wearing a white Sikh turban, Prime Minister Lee, who attended the inauguration ceremony of Silat Road Sikh Temple which was renovated during the pandemic, greeted the community members with a ""Sat Sri Akal"".

Prime Minister Lee said that places of worship, including the Silat Road temple and other Gurdwaras, have had to cope with disruptions brought about by the pandemic.

""It has been a trying time for the worshippers,"" he noted.

Gurdwaras, along with other places of worship, have adapted to the various Covid-19 pandemic management measures such as by live-streaming services so that devotees can still be part of a congregation, he said.

""I have been even more encouraged to see the Gurdwaras rally the Sikh community to pitch in and help out during this difficult period,"" Lee said, noting that they organised charity drives, provided rations, and organised various assistance programmes.

Like other religious groups, Sikh leaders helped their worshippers adjust to disruptions caused by the pandemic.

To address the stresses caused by the pandemic, the Coordinating Council of Sikh Institutions commissioned a taskforce called 'Project Akaal' to provide support for mental health within the Sikh community of about 13,000 Sikhs.

""Our Gurdwaras rallied the Sikh community to help those in need during this difficult period, regardless of race, religion or background,"" said Lee in his Facebook post after the inauguration ceremony.

""These initiatives set a good example for the wider community, as we move towards a new normal of living with an endemic virus. Silat Road Sikh Temple is not just a sacred place of worship, but a shining icon in the multi-religious and multi-racial landscape of Singapore,"" he said.

In the past, volunteers at Silat Road Sikh Temple used to serve up to 1,500 vegetarian meals daily as part of langgar, a sacred religious practice of catering food for visitors and devotees at Sikh temples.

After renovation and refurbishment works that lasted close to a year wrapped up recently, the temple's kitchen and its food preparation and dining areas have expanded in size by about 20 per cent, allowing volunteers to serve up to 2,000 meals a day in what is also a safer and more comfortable environment.

On Saturday, the temple in Jalan Bukit Merah, just on the outskirt of central business district, marked the completion of the works with an inauguration event where the Prime Minister was the guest of honour.

The budget for the refurbishment works was SGD 2.5 million, with funds raised from donors. The temple now has an expanded kitchen and a bigger main prayer hall.

Baljit Singh, president of the Central Sikh Gurdwara Board which oversees the temple, said the expansion of the prayer hall will allow for weddings to be held at the temple.

Previously, there was insufficient space to conduct some wedding rituals.

The works were due to start in March last year, but were disrupted due to the Covid-related circuit breaker. But it gave the temple management time to tweak renovation plans to better adapt to the coronavirus situation, such as ensuring better ventilation and reorganising spaces to reduce crowding, said Singh.

The temple in Jalan Bukit Merah, which is also known as the Gurdwara Sahib Silat Road, was built by the Sikh Police Contingent in 1924.

It served as a safe home for the families of Sikhs who were killed during the Japanese Occupation and serves the Sikh congregation as well as the needs of the wider community today.

The temple houses a memorial dedicated to Bhai Maharaj Singh, the Sikh revolutionary who fought for India's independence and was transferred to a Singapore prison in Outram Road by the British colonial government in 1850.

The saint-soldier was the first Sikh in recorded history to set foot in Singapore.

The memorial has occupied its current spot since 2010. It was moved from its original position in the Singapore General Hospital compound, near where Outram Prison once stood, to the entrance of the temple in 1966, before a dedicated memorial building was built."
7,Mental health of athletes becomes concern at pandemic Olympics,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMidGh0dHBzOi8vYXNpYS5uaWtrZWkuY29tL1Nwb3RsaWdodC9Ub2t5by0yMDIwLU9seW1waWNzL01lbnRhbC1oZWFsdGgtb2YtYXRobGV0ZXMtYmVjb21lcy1jb25jZXJuLWF0LXBhbmRlbWljLU9seW1waWNz0gEA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Nikkei Asia,13/6/2021,"TOKYO -- The COVID-19 pandemic has dominated discussions around the Tokyo Olympics, but the mental well-being of athletes is also a health concern for visiting teams.

In addition to the pressure of competition this summer, measures aimed at reducing the spread of the virus mean that athletes will have little opportunity to blow off steam. Human interaction will be discouraged, and competitors will be requested not to visit places other than venues, training centers, and their accommodation.

The Olympic Village, where many events usually take place, will be a lot quieter. Athletes will be asked to eat meals in the main dining areas as quickly as possible, and alcohol may be banned. Their families will not be able to come to Japan to watch them compete.

Such restrictions could affect athletes' mental health, experts say. ""Many athletes may feel isolated. They need empathy, understanding, and support to ease the sense of loneliness,"" said Hisashi Tanegashima, sports psychologist and professor at Nihon University.

A clinic with services that include psychiatric counselling will be set up in the Olympic and Paralympic Village. But some countries are taking extra steps to keep athletes in a healthy state of mind. For example, the British Olympic Association will be sending a mental health expert team to support athletes and staff.

""From a GB perspective, the mental health and well-being of the athletes and staff is a primary objective for the British Olympic Association,"" a BOA spokesperson said. ""Mental health is an important facet of making sure everyone can perform at the Olympics.""

While doctors trained in mental health have accompanied the team before, ""this is the first time there is a dedicated mental health team. It is a really important element of our support for the delegation,"" the spokesperson added.

The mental health team will be led by a clinical psychologist and supported by a specialist in mental health, as well as a team of around 10 mental health champions, who have training and knowledge in this area. Overall, the BOA expects to take around 370 athletes and more than 500 support staff to the games.

The Australian softball team was the first foreign sports organization to come to Japan, arriving on June 1. They are staying in Gunma, a prefecture northwest of the capital.

Deidre Anderson, athlete well-being manager for Softball Australia, said that the team monitored athletes' well-being on an app. By having them rate their sleep -- the first thing impacted when one's well-being is diminished -- the team would get an update if an athlete's sleep quality was below a certain level, Anderson said.

The Singapore delegation will include three sport psychologists. “The mental well-being of our athlete is very important for them to excel safely,” the Singapore Sport Institute's senior sport psychologist Stevenson Lai told Nikkei Asia.

China in January published a manual called ""Psychological Guide For Active Athletes,"" as part of the country's preparation for the Tokyo Olympics. ""When you fail, tell yourself it's because you haven't tried hard enough, not because of your capability,"" it said. The manual is downloadable to smartphones.

Earlier this month, tennis champion Naomi Osaka spoke about her depression, raising global awareness about athletes' mental health.

""Her remarks gave society an opportunity to look at the fact that even top athletes suffer from mental health issues. More people including coaches should be aware of this,"" said Hiroaki Yamamoto, a psychiatrist who is also a board member of the Japanese Associationof Sports Psychiatry.

Osaka is not alone in her suffering.

A survey conducted last year by Stanford University and Strava found that one in five U.S. professional athletes reported difficulty exercising due to mental health issues, a lack of motivation, or COVID-19.

A 2020 survey conducted by Japan's National Center of Neurology and Psychiatry found that 32.3% of Japan Rugby Top League players had experienced symptoms of mild anxiety and depression in the previous 30 days. Some 7.6% of respondents said that they had suicidal thoughts in the previous two weeks.

Yamamoto at the Japanese Association of Sports Psychiatry warned that athletes could be exposed to online attacks.

Some are already experiencing this. On May 7, 20-year-old Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee said that she had been receiving messages on social media that called on her to skip the games. ""To be honest, there were some messages that really hurt my feelings,"" she said in a Twitter post.

Yamamoto added, ""Social distancing is important in Tokyo Olympics, but an effort should be made to narrow the psychological distance with the athletes through online tools.""

Many Olympic Committees in Asian countries see hurdles to bringing mental experts to Tokyo.

The Chinese Taipei Olympic Committee said while it has mental health therapists in Taiwan's national sports training centers, it does not have a plan to send any of these experts to Tokyo due to limits on the number of participants.

Tokyo organizers have cut the number of officials and other personnel coming to Japan from 180,000 to under 78,000, as part of infection prevention measures.

""We continue to host simulation competitions to create a positive atmosphere and help athletes build positive goals to ensure both their mental and physical statuses are ready for competitions,"" said a spokesperson for the committee.

""Except for qualifying athletes, we can't add any new names to the list now, and as far as I know it doesn't have any mental health expert,"" said Rajeev Mehta, secretary-general of the Indian Olympic Association.

""It's not possible right now [for us to add a mental health expert] but it's a very good idea"" to be considered for large events, especially given rules around the current COVID situation that could leave many feeling isolated, he added.

Thana Chaiprasit, who oversees the Thai team, said there were no plans to bring any mental health specialists to Tokyo due to COVID limitations. This in large part has to do with the small team of 40 to 50 athletes the country is sending, which means their quota for other officials is just three. As such, the team is only taking two doctors and a medical assistant.

But Thana said athletes can be supported using online tools.

""If there is some mental stress or any mental problems in the Thailand team during the Olympics, we could use a video call to allow our athletes to consult psychiatrists here in Bangkok,"" Thana said.

8,HR guide: How to develop a pandemic-proof employee wellbeing strategy,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiaWh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lmh1bWFucmVzb3VyY2Vzb25saW5lLm5ldC9oci1ndWlkZS1ob3ctdG8tZGV2ZWxvcC1hLXBhbmRlbWljLXByb29mLWVtcGxveWVlLXdlbGxiZWluZy1zdHJhdGVnedIBAA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Human Resources Online,9/7/2021,"HR guide: How to develop a pandemic-proof employee wellbeing strategy

This article is brought to you by AIA Singapore.

It’s not difficult – have a look at what HSBC Singapore, Singtel, and UTAC Headquarters are doing.

Search for ‘employee wellbeing’ on Google, and you will find several reports that only point to one key takeaway: mental health has gained more prominence than ever before.

Since COVID-19, stress levels of employees have shot up, thanks to long hours of social isolation, job uncertainty, and anxiety associated with ever-changing safe distancing rules.

Whilst many employers put great effort into the physical wellbeing of their employees, they struggle to prioritise their mental wellbeing. Employees cite mental health stigma as a top concern and are uncomfortable to discuss it with their superiors.

With most of us working remotely and cooped up behind computer screens, what is needed are high-impact digital engagement and wellbeing solutions for employers and people managers that can be rolled out conveniently and easily.

And these are exactly what the following leaders are championing: Brandon Coate, Head of HR, HSBC Singapore; Aileen Tan, Group CHRO, Singtel, and Alexander Yap, Head of Total Rewards (APAC & USA), UTAC Headquarters. Let us find out what they are doing so well.

The trio’s digital engagement and wellbeing strategies are performing far better for their employees than what studies suggest. Let us deep dive into what they are getting right.

#Tip 1: Create a wellbeing framework to define your actions

HSBC Singapore has created a framework that focuses on four wellbeing pillars: mental health, physical health, financial health, and work-life balance. Coate says: “We support our colleagues by regularly promoting the wellbeing resources offered and advocating through wellbeing-dedicated communications and events.”

Examples would be HSBC Singapore’s reimbursement allowance to set up an ergonomic home office, as well as a virtual wellness campaign to keep everyone healthy while working remotely.

“We also collaborated with our insurance provider, AIA, to offer all colleagues telemedicine by Whitecoat so that they can seek medical help from the comfort of their home,” shares Coate.

Similarly, UTAC Group’s wellbeing framework is underpinned by its core values of unity, trust, accountability, and communication, to guide all employee-related decisions. “Consistent with these values, we believe in having a positive environment in our workplaces and lending support for employees’ physical, mental, and emotional wellbeing,” Yap explains.

#Tip 2: Listen and adapt to your employees’ needs constantly

Besides traditional medical and insurance offerings, Singtel is giving employees what they really need in the midst of a pandemic, i.e. a proactive stance on preventive and early intervention measures. This includes a confidential, 24/7 professional counselling service, as well as coaching and mindfulness sessions on developing a resilient mindset.

Tan firmly believes: “When people are in a state of wellbeing at work, they are inspired to stay healthy, happy and positive,” adding this also enables them to develop their fullest potential, be creative, stay productive, and build positive relationships with others.

One of the best ways to understand what employees want, is simply, to ask them.

At UTAC Group, employees feel heard and engaged through engagement surveys (called U-Pulse), while at HSBC, focus groups are another valuable tool to gather feedback and help shape new policies.

#Tip 3: Partner your insurer for maximum wellbeing impact

Across the organisations we spoke to, the support of a reliable partner, AIA, has been crucial in delivering the message on employee wellbeing, anchored in its signature programme, AIA Vitality, which supports over 100,000 customers towards healthier, longer, better lives.

At UTAC, Yap relies on AIA’s quarterly and yearly reports for performance comparisons on factors such as real age versus company age, improvements in step count, number of employees actively doing their personal online health assessment, and more.

He shares: “We have seen an incremental increase in overall Vitality platform engagement scores from when we first started in 2017 at 47% to current scores at 62%.” He adds that improvements are also evident in the total number of steps being 3.38x, and member-level achievements (where nearly 40% are now gold-member level achievers).

In addition to better health, there are real cost savings involved. Singtel, for instance, reviewed the underlying drivers behind medical claims to identify areas for targeted intervention.

Tan shares: “Over a three-year period, the proportion of employees screened as overweight has come down by more than 15%. With better health practices, the average incidence of GP doctor visits up to pre-COVID had reduced by as much as 10%.

“The qualitative benefits are also notable, as employees have also been making more informed and better lifestyle choices, for example, in nutrition and exercise.”

We hope the practical sharing by Coate, Tan and Yap, provides you with renewed passion to pandemic proof your employee wellbeing programme and help your colleagues live better lives.

9,Psychological Impacts During the Initial COVID-19 Outbreak,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMihAFodHRwczovL3d3dy5kb3ZlcHJlc3MuY29tL3RoZS1wc3ljaG9sb2dpY2FsLWltcGFjdHMtZHVyaW5nLXRoZS1pbml0aWFsLXBoYXNlLW9mLXRoZS1jb3ZpZC0xOS1vdXQtcGVlci1yZXZpZXdlZC1mdWxsdGV4dC1hcnRpY2xlLVBSQk3SAQA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Dove Medical Press,22/6/2021,"Introduction

Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that can cause a range of illnesses, ranging from the common cold to more severe illnesses.1 Several types of coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet been infected human beings. The 2019 coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an emerging disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2), a new strain of coronavirus that has not been previously seen in humans beings.1,2

Pastoralism is a culture, livelihoods system and extensive use of rangelands. It is the primary production method used in arid and semi-arid dry land environments.3 Pastoral groups account for 10% of Ethiopia’s total population and 61% of the total land mass, 97% of them found in low land areas of Afar, Somali, Oromia, and SNNPR.3,4 Pastoral areas in Ethiopia are characterized by frequent drought with high livestock mortality which often results in threatening the viability of pastoral livelihood, famine, psychological harm and death in the human population.5,6 They are the most marginalized group of people in Ethiopia. Even by the standard of Ethiopia, pastoral areas have the lowest access for basic public services such as education, human health services and infrastructures (roads, telephone, markets) are poorly developed.5,7

In December 2019, an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, has been evolving rapidly across China and several nations.8,9 WHO declared this outbreak of COVID-19 a public health emergency of international concern on 30 January 2020, posing a high risk to countries with weak health systems, and declared the outbreak a pandemic on 12 March 2020.10 Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness,11,12 however the elderly and those who have underlying medical problems are experiencing serious illness.11–13

By 17 July 2019, over 12 million cases had been confirmed, nearly 4 million recovered cases, and over 2.5 million confirmed deaths had been recorded worldwide.14 In Africa there were over four million confirmed cases, nearly two million recovered cases and five hundred thousand reported deaths. The most affected countries were Egypt, South Africa, Morocco and Ethiopia.15

A large body of evidence ties social isolation and loneliness to poor mental health, and recent data revealed that substantially more people who were sheltering (47%) experienced negative mental health effects as a result of concern or stress linked to the coronavirus.16 Since older adults and families of teenagers are already at risk of depression and suicidal ideation, the negative mental health consequences of social isolation may be more pronounced.17 During the initial COVID-19 outbreak in China, a survey found that 53.8% of respondents rated the outbreak’s psychological effect as moderate to extreme, with 16.5% reporting moderate to severe depression, 28.8% reporting moderate to severe anxiety, and 8.1% reporting moderate to severe stress.18

A systematic review and a meta-analysis were conducted to examine the overall prevalence of psychological health outcomes during COVID-19 from seven databases indicated, the pooled prevalence of primary psychological outcomes was 26%, Moreover the pooled prevalence for symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, stress and depression was 33% 28%, 27%, 22%, respectively.19 Another similar study in Africa also showed the pooled prevalence of anxiety in 27 studies was 37%, depression in 24 studies was 45% and insomnia in nine studies was 28%. The pooled prevalence rates of anxiety, depression, and insomnia in North Africa (44%, 55%, and 31%, respectively) are higher than the rates in sub-Saharan Africa (31%, 30%, and 24%, respectively).20

ue to repeated broadcasting the 'stay at home' message by governments of countries around the world, individuals’ mobility to different working places, learning, and religious institutions (schools, colleges, universities, and churches) has been continually limited. Furthermore, the factors such as having limited interactions, marginalization, poor infrastructure, and complete isolation of individuals will have a negative impact on the well-being of mental health.21

Different studies have been carried out in Ethiopia to assess the mental health impact of the COVID-19 outbreak.22,23 However, none of these studies have been done among the pastoral community. So this study aimed to assess the psychological impacts during the initial phases of COVID-19 outbreak among the pastoral community of West Omo zone, south-west Ethiopia. Determining the mental health impact of the COVID-19 outbreak among the community is crucial to developing strategies for the pastoral community to minimize the outbreak related to mental health consequences.

Methods and Materials

Study Setting, Design and Period

Cross-sectional study in pastoral community of West Omo zone was conducted from May 1st, 2020 up to June 15, 2020. The West Omo zone is a newly formed zone of the South Nation Nationalities and Peoples of Ethiopian Regional State, with seven districts and 116 kebeles (112 rural and 4 urban), with a total population of 272,943 people, accounting for 12% of the regional population, and inhibited by a pastoral group of 135, 025 (49.47%) males, 137,918 (50.53%) rural residents, and 243,=738 (89.3%) (10.7%). The total number of households is 55,703, among them more than 60% were the pastoral community. In terms of health facilities, this zone has two hospitals, 13 health centers, and nineteen-four health posts, giving it a basic health service coverage of 90% and health center and health post coverage of 98% and 90%, respectively. It also has one prison facility and nine detention centers.

Population

All permanently residing pastoral people aged ≥18 years in the selected zones.

Study Population

All permanently residing pastoral people aged ≥18 years in the selected zone who full fill the eligibility criteria.

Eligibility Criteria

Participants who were resident for a minimum of six months, and age 18 years and older were included in the study. But those who were critically ill and unable to give a response during data collection time were excluded.

Sample Size Determination and Sampling Procedure

The single population proportion formula is used to calculate sample size. Since no studies have been carried out on the psychological effects of COVID-19 and its related factors among the pastoral community in Ethiopia, we took 50% to determine the sample size. Considering assumptions of reliability coefficient of 1.96, degree of precision 0.05, with a 10% non-response rate and a design effect of 2, the final sample size became 845.

The study subjects were chosen using a multistage sampling technique. First, the primary sampling units (woreda/districts), in which the four five pastoral districts were selected using the lottery method. Second, the secondary sampling units (Kebele), from each selected districts' 30% pastoral kebeles were selected using the lottery method.

After selecting pastoral kebeles, the fourth sampling units (households) were identified taking list of households from health extension workers’ as sampling frame. Using population proportion to size (PPS) formula, the final sample size was proportionally allocated to each selected kebeles. Finally, eligible study participants were selected using systematic sampling method. The overall sampling procedure is found in Supplementary Figure 1 . The lottery method was used when there was more than one eligible participant in a single household.

Study Variables

The Psychological impact (Anxiety, Depression, Stress) was the dependent variable whereas, Socio-demographic (age, maternal status, education level, occupation, ethnicity and religion, income), Clinical factors (comorbid mental illness, childhood traumatic experience, family mental illness history, using privative measure, having suggestive symptom and comorbid medical illness), Psychosocial factors (social support, substance use history and having perceive life threat) were the independent variables.

Operational Definitions of Variables

Depression: A DASS-D score of 10 or higher suggests the existence of depression.24

Anxiety: A DASS-D score of 8 or higher suggests the existence of anxiety.24

Stress: A DASS-D score of 15 or higher suggests the existence of stress.24

Social Support: Oslo a three-item questionnaire with a sum score scale ranging from 3 to 14, with three categories: weak support 3–8, moderate support 9–11, and good support 12–14.25

Perceive life threat: was measured using perceived life threat scale having possible scores ranging from Low perceived stress – scores ranging from 0–13 on PSS; moderate perceived stress – scores ranging from 14–26 on PSS; and high perceived stress –scores ranging from 27–40 on PSS.26

Substance use: use of chat, alcohol, cigarette smoking, or others at least once in the last three months.

Data Collection Tools and Procedure

The English version validated data collection tools (DASS, Oslo-3 item social support scale, ASSIST) were adopted and widely used in Ethiopia. After adopting these tools translation to the national language of Ethiopia (Amharic) was done to ensure common understanding and consistency. The data were collected via interview administered questionnaires by nine trained health professionals and three supervisors. The questionnaire was pretested among 5% of the sample size in the districts (woredas) which were out of the selected study areas. After the pretest, the questionnaires coherence and skip pattern were corrected.

Outcome variables, Depression, Anxiety and stress were assessed by DASS-21 which is adapted in our country. Depression, anxiety and stress were collected by DASS which has 21 items and 7 items for each. It has been widely used in Ethiopia to assess the emotional state of depression, anxiety and stress; it is Likert scale which ranges from 0 to 3. The sum scores of 10 and above is indicative of depression, 8 and above are indicative of anxiety and 15 and above is for stress.24

Social support was assessed through Oslo-3 item social support scale, the sum score scale ranging from 3–14, which has three categories: poor support 3–8; moderate support 9–11; and strong support 12–14.25 Perceive life threat will be measured using perceived life threat scale having possible scores ranging from 0 to 40 with a 5-point Likert scale (0 = never, 1 = almost never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = fairly often, 4 = very often). Low perceived stress – scores ranging from 0–13 on PSS; moderate perceived stress – scores ranging from 14–26 on PSS; and high perceived stress – scores ranging from 27–40 on PSS.26

ASSIST, a WHO-developed brief screening questionnaire, was used to determine substance-related factors. This tool is used to determine the participant’s current use of psychoactive substances. Current Substance use was those who had a substance use of history for the last three months, for non-medical purposes.

Data Quality Assurance

The data collection tools were written in English, then translated into Amharic (the national language) and then back to English to ensure consistency. A pretest was done among 5% of study sample size. Three days training was given for nine data collectors and three supervisors regarding study objectives, content, context and filling of questionnaires, interviewing technique, household selection method and respondents approaching technique. Every day, a supervisor reviewed the completeness of the collected data, and investigators kept track of the total data set. Until entering the data into EpiData 3.1, the completeness of the data was reviewed, and data coding and cleaning were done by cross-checking the printout data for potential errors. Furthermore, descriptive analysis was used to search for missing values and outliers. Furthermore, good relationships using a respectful approach and encouraging gestures were made during the data collection process.

Data Processing and Analysis

First data were coded, cleaned and entered in to Epi-Data version 3.1, then exported to SPSS version 23 statistical software for analysis. Frequency, charts, and graphs were used to display the descriptive statistics. Logistic regressions were used and those independent variables that were statistically significant with a p-value of < 0.20 and 95% confidence level at the bivariate level were included in the multivariate logistic regression model to identify independent factors affecting depression, anxiety, and stress.

The model was built using a backward likelihood ratio with a 0.1 probability of exclusion. The Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test, which considers good fit at P-value > 0.05, was used to verify the final model’s goodness of fit. Finally, independent predictors of depression, anxiety, and stress were established using a P-value of 0.05 as a cut-off point, and the strength of the correlation was evaluated using AORs with 95% confidence levels.

Results

Socio-Demographic Characteristics

The study interviewed a total of 798 qualified participants, with a 94.4% response rate. The mean (±SD) age of the respondents were 31.80 [10.70]. Slightly above three quarters of 622 (77.9%) study participants were rural residents. A similar proportion of 347 (43.5%) and 341 (42.7%) of the total participants were married and single, respectively. Slightly more than half (429; 53.8%) of respondents were male [Table 1].

Clinical and Substance Use Related Characteristics of Respondent’s

From all the study participants about 102 (12.8%), 97 (12.2%), 117 (14.7%), and 569 (71.3%) of them had history of mental illness, history of trauma in childhood, history of chronic medical illness and have used any specific preventive measures respectively. Regarding to their history of substance use, less than half of 356 (44.6%) and about 228 (28.6%) of the total respondents used alcohol and khat, respectively [Table 2].

Mental Health Related Characteristics of Participants’

The prevalence of positive for anxiety, depression and stress among the pastoral community were 246 (30.8%) with 95% CI,27,34 210 (26.3%) with 95% CI,23,29 and 195 (24.4%) with 95% CI,21,27 respectively [Figure 1].

Factor Associated with Depression

In a bi-variable binary logistic analysis variables like; sex, social support, marital status, perceived life threat, history of mental illness, history of chronic medical illness, alcohol and khat use were the factors found to be significantly associated with depression among participants towards COVID-19 outbreak.

Being female, social help, perceived life threat, and history of mental illness were found to be statistically significant in association with depression in multivariable logistic regression variables with p-values less than 0.05.

The odds of developing depression during the COVID-19 outbreak among female respondents were almost twice as highthan for males (AOR = 2.09, 95% CI = [1.42, 3.09]). Participants who had poor and moderate social support were almost four and two times more likely to have depression during the COVID-19 outbreak than those with strong social support (AOR = 3.96, 95% CI = [2.17, 7.23] and AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = [1.04, 3.80]).

The odds of having depression during the COVID-19 outbreak among respondents who have high and medium perceived life threat were six and three times higher when compared to those who have low perceived life threat (AOR = 5.60, 95% CI = [2.98, 10.53]) and (AOR = 2.61, 95% CI = [1.32, 5.15]). Respondents with a history of mental illness were five times more likely than those without a history of mental illness to be depressed during the COVID-19 outbreak (AOR = 4.97, 95% CI = [2.95, 8.36]) (Table 3).

Table 3 Factors Associated with Depression During the COVID-19 Outbreak of the Participants Among the Pastoral Community in West Omo Zone, South-West Ethiopia, 2020 (N= 798)

Factors Associated with Anxiety

Variables such as sex, family size, marital status, social support, perceived life threat, history of mental illness, history of chronic medical illness, and khat use were found to be significantly correlated with probable anxiety among COVID-19 outbreak participants in a bi-variable binary logistic analysis.

From multivariate binary logistic regression only variables (sex, family size, poor social support, history of mental illness and high perceive life threat) were statistically significant with positive anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak with a p-value less than 0.05.

The odds of having positive anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak among respondents who have more than or equal to three and two family members in the household is almost three and two times higher when compared to those who have one member in the family (AOR = 3.01, 95% CI = [1.95, 4.65] and AOR = 1.70, 95% CI = [1.07, 2.70]). Female respondents were almost two times more likely to have positive anxiety towards the COVID-19 outbreak than men (AOR = 2.35, 95% CI = [1.63, 3.40]). Participants who have poor and moderate social support were almost four and two times more likely to have anxiety towards the COVID-19 outbreak than those with strong social support (AOR = 3.96, 95% CI = [2.17, 7.23] and AOR = 1.99, 95% CI = [1.04, 3.80]).

The odds of having positive anxiety during the COVID-19 outbreak among respondents who have high and medium perceived life threat were five and two times higher as compared to those who have low perceived life threat (AOR = 4.75, 95% CI = [2.76, 8.18] and AOR = 2.05, 95% CI = [1.15, 3.67]). Respondents with a history of mental illness were four times more likely have anxiety towards the COVID-19 outbreak than those who had no history of mental illness (AOR = 4.04, 95% CI = [2.40, 6.79]) [Table 4].

Table 4 Factor Associated with Anxiety Among Participants’ Towards the COVID-19 Outbreak Among Pastoral Community Residents in South-West Ethiopia, 2020 (N=798)

Factor Associated with Stress

On bivariate analysis, different variables such as; sex, family size, social support, history of mental illness, history of chronic medical illness, perceive life threat, monthly income, alcohol and khat use were the factors found to be significantly associated with positive stress among participants towards the COVID-19 outbreak on bi-variable analysis. The result of multivariable analysis showed that social support, history of mental illness, and perceive life threat use were found to be statistically significant at p-value less than 0.05.

Respondents who had poor social support were almost six times more likely to have positive stress towards COVID-19 outbreak than those who had strong social support (AOR = 5.74, 95% CI = [2.98, 11.04]). The odds of having stress during the COVID-19 outbreak among respondents who have high perceived life threat were seven times higher compared to those who have low perceived life threat (AOR = 6.88, 95% CI = [3.63, 13.03]). Respondents with a history of mental illness were four times more likely to have stress towards the COVID-19 outbreak than their counterparts (AOR = 3.63, 95% CI = [2.15, 6.12]) (Table 5).

Discussion

The current research looked at the pastoral community’s psychological effects (depression, anxiety, and stress) as well as related causes. The COVID-19 epidemic has been declared a global public health emergency, and this crisis has a mental health effect on the entire population. The WHO urged taking a preventive measure to tackle the negative impact of the spread of COVID-19 on individual mental health and well-being.5

The prevalence of positive anxiety, depression, and stress were 30.8%, 26.3%, and 24.4%, respectively. Our findings are consistent with previous findings of studies conducted during the pandemic in Saudi Arabia, which reported that the prevalence of depression and stress was 28% and 22%, respectively.27 The prevalence of anxiety was in line with a study conducted in Spain (32%)28 and systematic review and meta-analysis reported 28%.19 These finding were lower in a recently published study in India in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, where it reported the level of anxiety, depression, and stress were 43%, 39%, and 36%, respectively.29 The lower prevalence in our study could be attributed to the early day of the outbreak when only a few cases had been reported in Ethiopia, the majority of the cases reported were imported from abroad. It might be also the effect of a nationwide lockdown on Indian study participants.

Contrary to our findings, significantly lower proportions of anxiety (10.8%), depression (8.1%), and stress (6.4%) were found among health care workers in Singapore.30 The possible reason for this could be a difference in the study population. Health care workers have first-hand medical information about the outbreak, disease characteristics and its prevention mechanisms. It could be attributed to increase mental preparedness for the outbreak in Singapore after the previous SARS outbreak experience.30

Positive anxiety and depression were found to be strongly linked to sex. Female was two times more likely to develop anxiety and depression compared to males. This finding is in agreement with studies done in India, Iran, and China.18,31–33 The possible rationale might be that women are more vulnerable to the socio-cultural risk factors associated with mental impact. Compared to males, females experience more fluctuations of hormone levels that are associated with emotional symptoms.34 It has been that common mental illness such as depression and anxiety are more prevalent in women.35 Moreover, it should be noted that a higher rate of domestic violence against women was reported during this outbreak.36

This study found that respondents who had two or more family members were more likely to have positive anxiety compared with those who had one family member. This result is supported by studies done in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia,22 and China.18 This might be explained by households with large family members may have more contact with different people in their daily activities; this may increase their worry about getting the disease since the virus is highly contagious through personal contact. Long-term confinement at home has an impact on the relationships between family members, given that conflict may increase in this unusual and stressful situation.37

Respondents who had a previous history of mental illness were more likely to develop probable depression, anxiety and stress than their counterparts. People with a history of mental illness are more susceptible to the psychological impact compared to the general public, such an outbreak can provoke a relapse or even worsen the already existing psychological problem.38 The result is in agreement with other studies done in Ethiopia23 and China.18

Similarly, people with low to moderate social support were more likely to suffer from depression, anxiety, and stress than those with good social support. This is in line with studies done in China,39 Ethiopia,40 and Kenya.26 The possible reason might be the feeling of being loved and wanted may contribute to a supportive environment which would help individuals to cope with different psychosocial challenges.

Having high perceived life threat was more likely to have positive depression, anxiety, and stress. This finding was in line with a similar study done in Iran,41 and the United States where the prevalence of depression, and stress was more common among respondents with positive perceived life threat.42 The reason might be due to the pandemic causing feelings of susceptibility and loss of control of self, and family life could be complicated. It is likely that people within such an outbreak are afraid of contracting the coronavirus, have a fear of falling sick, suffering with feelings of hopelessness, worry about stigma and even death.43

Conclusion and Recommendation

The prevalence of depression, anxiety, and stress was found to be high among pastoral communities in the West Omo zone of south-west Ethiopia, according to the report. Female gender, a history of mental illness, a lack of social support, and a high perceived stigma were all related to depression, anxiety, and stress.

Compared to the general population, the pastoral community is neglected and mostly found rural areas, which are not accessible for updated information. So the Ethiopian government and other local governmental organizations should give special attention to psychosocial and mental health programs alongside other medical services. Moreover, mechanisms should be designed to provide accurate information through different media outlets with local languages to reduce the psychological impacts related to misinformation.

Psychosocial intervention by mental health specialists should be designed directly for pastoral dwellers, basically for female adults who had a history of mental illness, individuals with poor social support and high perceived stigma. Researchers should conduct a longitudinal study in order to know the long-term impact of the COVID 19 pandemic on people’s mental health in the pastoral community.

Study Limitation

This study was conducted at the early stage of COVID-19 pandemic, which may have underestimated prevalence of anxiety, depression and stress. Second, there might be social desirability bias regarding to the question assess about substance use. Furthermore, the data is cross-sectional, making it difficult to draw conclusions about the direction of relationships among study variables."
10,Singapore wants to stop counting COVID-19 cases. Its roadmap could be a model for other countries,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiECuoaqCAsUvrYEBtxOvDwX4qGQgEKhAIACoHCAow6f-ICzDjj4gDMNC_nwY?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,CTV News,30/6/2021,"As countries around the Asia-Pacific region tighten restrictions once again to curb potential breakouts of the Delta coronavirus variant, Singapore has laid out a new vision for life to return to normal.

The roadmap, proposed by three members of Singapore's COVID-19 task force, would scrap lockdowns and mass contact tracing and allow for a return to quarantine-free travel and the resumption of large gatherings. It would even stop counting the daily COVID-19 cases.

The proposal is a radical departure from the so-called ""zero transmission"" model adopted by several countries and territories -- including rival Asian business hub Hong Kong -- which have so far proved successful at avoiding large outbreaks.

But this ""zero transmission"" model, which requires stringent, often punishing quarantine measures, will be almost impossible to maintain as new variants spread, and long term is simply not sustainable, the task force members claim. Instead, they say living with COVID-19 can be done.

""The bad news is that COVID-19 may never go away. The good news is that it is possible to live normally with it in our midst,"" said Singapore's Trade Minister Gan Kim Yong, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung, in an op-ed in the Straits Times last week.

""We can turn the pandemic into something much less threatening, like influenza, hand, foot and mouth disease, or chickenpox, and get on with our lives.""

It's a bold plan that could become a template for other countries looking to return to normal life and resume travel and tourism -- and offer hope for frustrated residents eager to get their lives back on track after 18 months of pandemic restrictions.

HOW THEY'LL DO IT

The key for a lighter approach to the pandemic? High vaccination rates.

Singapore is on track for two-thirds of its population to have received their first vaccine dose by early July, and aims to fully vaccinate that figure by August 9.

""Vaccines are highly effective in reducing the risk of infection as well as transmission. Even if you are infected, vaccines will help prevent severe COVID-19 symptoms,"" the ministers said.

As more people get vaccinated, the way Singapore monitors daily COVID-19 infection numbers will change. Following a path similar to how it tracks influenza infections, Singapore will monitor those who fall seriously sick or how many are in intensive care units. Infected people will be allowed to recover at home.

""We will worry less about the healthcare system being overwhelmed,"" they said.

With new, potentially more contagious variants posing a concern around the world, the minsters said booster shots may be needed in the future and suggested a ""multi-year vaccination program"" be established.

While testing and surveillance will still be needed, they propose conducting tests in specific scenarios such as ahead of large social events, or when traveling back from abroad, rather than to track and quarantine close contacts.

To do this, the ministers say faster and easier methods of testing will be rolled out as PCR tests take too long to provide results. Other methods ""in the pipeline"" include breathalysers that take about one to two minutes to produce results.

In time, more treatments will become available for COVID-19. Already, the ministers point to therapeutics that are effective in treating the critically ill, and quicken recovery, as well as reducing severity of illness and deaths.

They also say citizens will be urged to practice ""social responsibility"" such as good hygiene and staying away from crowds when feeling unwell to reduce transmission rates.

""With vaccination, testing, treatment and social responsibility, it may mean that in the near future, when someone gets COVID-19, our response can be very different from now,"" the ministers said.

OTHER COUNTRIES REMAIN CAUTIOUS

Singapore had been held up as a success story in controlling the virus, thanks to strict border controls, instituting quarantines and contact tracing as well as rules on social gatherings and mask wearing.

It managed to contain earlier outbreaks, including a peak of cases in April last year. In May, a small cluster of cases was connected to Changi Airport employees, promoting tighter curbs.

The city state of 5.7 million people has been averaging about 18 cases a day in the past month and has recorded just 36 deaths since the pandemic started, according to Johns Hopkins University.

Its new approach is a departure from other places that have been successful at managing the pandemic but have comparatively low vaccination rates and have recently reimposed tougher restrictions.

Several Australian states put their capital cities -- home to around 10.2 million people -- into lockdown on Monday over concerns the Delta strain could spark significant outbreaks.

Australia was celebrated for its initial response to the COVID-19 pandemic but vaccine rates are low. Australia has fully vaccinated nearly 5% of its population, compared with more than 46% in the United States and 48% in the UK, according to Our World in Data.

New Zealand said it was considering making masks compulsory at high alert levels and halted a quarantine-free travel bubble with neighboring Australia following an outbreak of the Delta variant.

And financial center Hong Kong, where vaccine hesitancy is high and only 21% of the population has been fully vaccinated, announced it will suspend passenger flights from the United Kingdom from July 1, over rising cases of the Delta variant there.

Meanwhile, mainland China may have administered more than 1 billion COVID-19 vaccine doses, but it is thinking about keeping its borders shut for another year. The southern city of Guangzhou, a major international travel hub, is planning on building a huge quarantine center with 5,000 rooms to house travelers and Covid-19 close contacts over fears of the Delta variant's spread, according to state-run newspaper Global Times."

13,COVID and schools: the evidence for reopening safely,https://news.google.com/articles/CBMiMmh0dHBzOi8vd3d3Lm5hdHVyZS5jb20vYXJ0aWNsZXMvZDQxNTg2LTAyMS0wMTgyNi140gEA?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Nature.com,7/7/2021,"On a bright, crisp morning in March, Salah Goyut said goodbye to his stuffed tiger, Stripes, and his cat, Meowington, and started walking the two short blocks to Herbert Schenk Elementary School in Madison, Wisconsin. He had started kindergarten there months ago, but he had only seen his teacher on a computer screen.

This would be his first day inside the school. He looked tiny in his NASA mask and raccoon hat, which he had pulled down over the hood of his coat. He felt shy and a little nervous about the transition from ‘zoomie’ to ‘roomie’.

Outside the school, carefully chalked messages lined the pavement: “We can’t wait to see you!” and “Welcome Ks”. Signs directed parents to “Drop your shark off here” and “Hug and kiss goodbye here”. Salah hesitated briefly, then made his way to the open double doors.

Back in March, the decision to reopen Schenk and other shuttered schools across the United States sparked heated debate. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had announced that schools could reopen safely without driving up community spread or putting teachers and students at risk, as long as steps were taken to mitigate transmission of the virus. But that did little to calm the anxiety among parents, school staff and even scientists. It sometimes spilled into public arguments.

Monica Gandhi, an infectious-disease researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, often tweets about COVID-19 and schools, but she took a break in March. The discourse became too emotional, especially when people lobbed horrible accusations at her. “There is one thing that always ends an argument,” she says. That’s “the statement that you would want children dead”.

Now, as the academic year wraps up in many countries, school administrators are taking stock of their experiences and looking to public-health officials to help them plan for the coming school year. In the United Kingdom, children returned to school in March and April. In France, a third COVID-19 wave shuttered schools briefly around that time, but pupils were back in class by May. In the United States, more than half of all school districts had resumed full-time instruction by early June, and nearly all offered at least some in-person learning.

But across the world, 770 million children still weren’t going to school full time by the end of June 2021. And more than 150 million kids in 19 countries had no access to in-person schooling. They were either learning virtually or had no schooling at all. Even when schools open back up, many kids won’t return. The United Nations cultural organization UNESCO estimated last year that around 24 million schoolchildren will drop out as a result of the pandemic. Because they provide so many essential services in addition to learning, schools should be the last to close and the first to open, says Robert Jenkins, chief of education for the UN children’s charity UNICEF in New York City. “There are many countries in which parents can go out and have a nice steak dinner, but their seven-year-old is not going to school,” he says. “That’s a problem.”

A growing body of evidence suggests that schools can be opened safely. But that hasn’t quelled debate over whether they should be open and, if so, what steps should be taken to limit the spread of the virus. By September, when schools in many parts of the world will open again, fresh concerns and debates will be in play. Many teenagers and preteens will have been vaccinated in the United States and other wealthy countries. But in some low- and middle-income countries, vaccine access will still be limited. Younger children will probably still be in the queue in most parts of the world. And the virus continues to mutate and evolve. “The big unknown is a new variant,” says Christina Pagel, a mathematician at University College London.

Debate club

In March 2020, when many schools shut their doors, little was known about SARS-CoV-2. “We closed schools early, not only to help flatten the curve, but also because for most respiratory illnesses, children are the most at risk,” says John Bailey, a visiting fellow at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute think tank in Washington DC who recently reviewed the literature on schools and COVID-19.

Scientists soon discovered that kids are the least likely to develop serious illness, but it wasn’t yet clear whether children were as susceptible to infection as adults, and whether kids who did get infected could pass the virus on to others. Some researchers worried that sending children back to school might fuel the pandemic. But the debate soon shifted from a scientific one to a political one.

“SCHOOLS MUST OPEN IN THE FALL!!!” tweeted then-President Donald Trump in July 2020. “That became a partisan moment,” Bailey says. “So many of us we were wired to not believe anything the president was saying.” Tracy Høeg, an epidemiologist at the University of California, Davis, agrees. “It suddenly became sacrilegious for anyone in science to say it was OK for schools to be open,” she says.

Some of the political divisiveness was inevitable, says Ellen Peters, a decision researcher and director of the Center for Science Communication Research at the University of Oregon in Eugene. People who are conservative have different world views from people who are more liberal. But “Trump so vastly exacerbated that”, she says.

Other countries weren’t immune to the squabbling. When Danish primary schools reopened in April 2020, some parents worried that their kids were being used as guinea pigs. In France, where schools have mostly remained open, teens protested last November, saying that COVID-19 protections inside classrooms were inadequate. In some districts, teachers failed to show up as the coronavirus swept through communities. And parents were reluctant to report cases because they would have to isolate at home with their children and might lose their jobs. In Berlin, authorities scrapped plans to partially reopen schools in January, in the middle of a national lockdown, after backlash from parents, teachers and government officials.

One sticking point was the issue of prioritizing vaccines. When schools began to open up in March and April, the vast majority of teachers hadn’t yet been vaccinated. That made weighing up the risks and benefits particularly tricky. “The biggest risks are for the adults in the school system,” says Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore, Maryland. “And the benefits of being in the classroom are for the kids.”

Equity also became a flashpoint in the debate. Researchers argued that remote learning would widen disparities between white students and students of colour in many countries. “The fear is that achievement gaps will become achievement chasms for those kids,” says Robin Lake, director of the Center on Reinventing Public Education, a non-partisan research and policy analysis organization in Seattle, Washington. And kids of colour aren’t the only groups that have been forgotten, Lake says. “We also know that students with disabilities have been left behind, and kids with other complex needs.”

In the United States, however, surveys showed that families of colour didn’t necessarily want in-person schooling. When schools did open, these families were among those least willing to send their kids back. That’s not surprising, says Durryle Brooks, a social scientist at Johns Hopkins University and policy chair for the Baltimore City Board of School Commissioners. “Systems have continually failed Black and brown people in this country,” he adds. Why would that trust suddenly appear now? And sending pupils back to in-person school wouldn’t fix the achievement gap. “In Baltimore City, Black students have been underperforming” for a long time, even before the pandemic, Brooks says.

Study hall

Now, more than a year after the pandemic began, researchers know a lot more about COVID-19. And they know more about how the disease does (and doesn’t) spread. Although some kids and teachers have caught SARS-CoV-2, schools don’t seem to be environments where transmission is rampant. “The rates in the schools have not been higher than in the community,” Høeg says.

Tracking cases in schools is relatively straightforward. But what public-health officials really want to know is whether students and staff are spreading the virus on school grounds, or just bringing in cases they acquired elsewhere. That’s trickier to tease out.

One of the largest studies1 on COVID-19 in schools in the United States looked at more than 90,000 pupils and teachers in North Carolina over 9 weeks last autumn. Given the rate of transmission in the community, “we would have expected to see about 900 cases” in the schools, says Daniel Benjamin, a paediatrician at Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, and co-lead author on the study. But when the researchers conducted contact tracing to identify school-related transmissions, they identified only 32 cases (see ‘Meagre spread’).

Source: Ref. 1

That study, published in January, “should have been a watershed event for people who were really going to just be data driven with their policy”, says Jeanne Noble, an emergency physician who directs the COVID-19 response at the University of California, San Francisco’s medical centre. Yet many schools remained closed. Since then, “it’s just been a slew of other similar studies”, Noble says.

Another study2 looked at 17 schools in rural Wisconsin. The research team observed 191 COVID-19 cases in staff and students during 13 weeks in the autumn of 2020, a time of high transmission for that area. Only seven of those cases seemed to originate in the schools. A second study, not yet published, looked at Nebraska. “They were open the whole year with over 20,000 students and staff, and there were only 2 transmission events during that entire study period,” Høeg says.

Critics argue that without surveillance testing, kids who don’t have symptoms won’t be identified or counted, so the true number could be much higher. But even if the real case numbers were double or even triple the numbers in these studies, the transmission rate would have been much lower than in the community, Benjamin says. “It’s safer for them to be in school than to be outside of school.”

Studies that have included testing tend to show similarly low transmission rates. Researchers in Norway3 identified 13 confirmed cases in children aged 5–13 in schools, and tested nearly 300 of their close contacts to assess the secondary attack rate — the percentage of contacts who become infected from a single case. Just 0.9% of the child contacts and 1.7% of the adult contacts contracted the virus.

In Salt Lake City4, researchers went one step further. They offered COVID-19 tests to more than 1,000 students and staff who had come into contact with any of 51 pupils who had tested positive. Of the roughly 700 people who took the tests, just 12 tested positive. The scientists then used contact tracing and genetic sequencing to identify transmissions that occurred at school. Only 5 of the 12 were school-related — an attack rate of just 0.7%. This suggests that students who contract the virus don’t tend to spread it at school. A similar study5 in New York City found that the attack rate was even lower, just 0.5%.

When mitigation measures aren’t in place, however, attack rates can be much higher. In Israel6, schools reopened in mid-May 2020. Within two weeks, a large outbreak occurred in one secondary school. Administrators tested more than 1,200 close contacts of the two people who initially tested positive. They identified 153 infected students and 25 infected staff members — attack rates of 13.2% and 16.6%, respectively. By mid-June, the Ministry of Health had identified nearly 90 more cases among the close contacts of those who were initially infected, including family members, friends and team mates. The outbreak was probably exacerbated by a heatwave. To make conditions less stifling, the government had rolled back its mask-wearing rules, and schools had closed windows and started using air conditioning, which recycled air inside the classroom. There were too many students to ensure social distancing.

The bulk of the literature on transmission in schools, however, suggests that kids aren’t driving viral spread. Investigations in Germany, France, Ireland, Australia, Singapore and the United States show no, or very low, secondary attack rates within school settings.

“It has been perpetuated in the American media that COVID is dangerous and kids are superspreaders and schools are super-spreader places,” Høeg says. “And none of that has been validated in the scientific literature.”

That’s not to say there are no risks. Some children have died of the disease. A study7 looking at COVID-19-related deaths in children in 7 countries found that 231 kids died of the disease between March 2020 and February 2021. In the United States, the number as of June was 471. Some who died succumbed to a rare, but terrifying inflammatory syndrome. And emerging evidence hints that at least some kids who become infected have symptoms that persist. Deepti Gurdasani, an epidemiologist at the Queen Mary University of London, says some of her colleagues seem too blasé about the impact of COVID-19 on children. “It has really puzzled me why we’re so comfortable exposing children to a virus that we haven’t studied that much,” she says.

But keeping kids out of school comes with its own set of risks. Many parents have seen the social isolation take its toll and witnessed their children struggling to stay engaged with lessons delivered by screen. Emerging studies suggest that kids in remote-learning situations are falling behind academically, especially children who were already struggling. Schools provide more than education. They serve as a safety net for many kids, offering free meals and a safe place to spend the day. Educators and school counsellors are often the first to spot signs of domestic or sexual abuse and intervene. What’s more, the closure of schools has been a disaster for many working parents. Those with young children were left trying to juggle virtual school, normal parenting duties and their own jobs.

Emergency physician Leana Wen, currently at George Washington University’s Milken Institute School of Public Health in Washington DC, argues that many have been focused on the wrong question. “Stop asking whether schools are safe. Instead, acknowledge that in-person instruction is essential; then apply the principles we learned from other essential services to keep schools open,” she wrote in a Washington Post opinion piece.

Justin Lessler, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University, agrees. “We’ve already decided school is important,” he says. And “we should do important things, even when they’re hard”.

Advanced calculus

In countries where vaccination programmes have moved forwards rapidly, it looks like schools will open in the next academic year with fewer restrictions and mitigation measures than they have had over the past few months.

The greatest source of uncertainty, however, is the emergence of new variants. The variant of concern B.1.617.2, or Delta, which was first identified in India, seems to be about 40–60% more transmissible than the Alpha variant, B.1.1.7, which was first noticed in the United Kingdom, and has supplanted Alpha to become the dominant variant.

In the United Kingdom, cases have begun to skyrocket. In a study8 posted on a preprint server, researchers randomly swabbed individuals across the nation for COVID-19. Between 20 May and 7 June, the rate of positive cases grew exponentially, with a doubling time of 11 days. By 7 June, about 90% of the cases were attributed to the Delta variant. The prevalence was highest in children aged 5–12 and in young adults. That worries Gurdasani.

Measures such as mask wearing and improved ventilation should help to curb the spread of the virus in schools, even for the more transmissible variants. But the science around which mitigation measures matter most is not yet settled. Initially, the CDC advised schools to keep students 6 feet (1.83 metres) apart; in March, it halved that, on the basis of new studies. In the United Kingdom, the guidance is to distance when and where it’s feasible. “Doing this where you can, even some of the time will help,” the documents note. In the Wisconsin schools, says Høeg, “we actually had students at less than three feet in the classroom this spring”, she says. Yet they identified only two cases of in-school spread even with surveillance testing of people with no symptoms. “The distance of two, versus three, versus six feet doesn’t seem to be what’s making the difference,” she says.

And although the evidence supporting mask use indoors has been accumulating, it is still a controversial topic. When schools reopened in England in March, only secondary-school students were required to wear masks. But the UK Department of Education stopped recommending face coverings for pupils and staff on 17 May “based on the current state of the pandemic and the positive progress being made”. Some schools in which cases have surged have reintroduced mask policies. In US schools, mask use varies from state to state and district to district. The CDC changed its guidance on masks in May, and now says that vaccinated people do not need to wear them. In the wake of that announcement, mask mandates have been dropped across the country. A handful of states even passed laws that prohibit local school districts from requiring them indoors.

Gandhi, Høeg and two other specialists wrote an op-ed in the Washington Post arguing that kids should “return to their normal lives in the upcoming school year, without masks and regardless of their vaccination status”.

But others take a more cautious view. Katelyn Jetelina, an epidemiologist at the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, found the op-ed unconvincing. “It doesn’t give the full story,” she says. Jetelina points out that transmission is still really high among unvaccinated people in the United States, and most kids aren’t yet vaccinated. “We need to keep that at the forefront of our minds,” she says.

Still, case numbers in the United States are at the lowest they’ve been since late March 2020. The number of deaths has plummeted, and more than 80% of teachers have been vaccinated. In May, New York City, the country’s largest school district, announced that schools will be opening full time in the autumn. “We have every reason for optimism,” Gandhi says.

Høeg agrees: “At some point we have to say that COVID has reached a level of risk where we would be better served by going back to a more normal life.”

Whether that time is now is up for debate. The United Kingdom might prove to be a cautionary tale about the risks of lifting restrictions and mitigation measures too soon in the face of fresh variants such as Delta.

Lake hopes the pandemic will provide a much-needed reset for public schools. “Public education has really been designed to do things the same way and to minimize risk, not to innovate and solve unsolved problems,” Lake says. The pandemic highlighted the huge disadvantages of that model. “The system just collapsed because everybody was looking at everybody else waiting for direction,” she says.

UNICEF’s Jenkins also wants to avoid a return to the status quo. Even before the pandemic, there were plenty of schools that were failing kids. Jenkins wants teachers and administrators to think creatively about how to bring the technology that students relied on for virtual learning into the classrooms, how to teach important skills such as problem solving, and how to address not just learning, but mental health, nutrition, social-emotional development and more. “We have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to welcome kids back to vibrant new interactive ways of learning,” Jenkins says. “It would be a great shame if we didn’t seize that opportunity.”"

Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong wore an immaculate white turban at the inauguration of a gurdwara and greeted the community members in perfect Punjabi, saying ""Sat Sri Akaal"". Speaking at the event, he praised the Sikh community for their contribution in mitigating the disruptions caused by the pandemic. He said the gurdwaras in Singapore rallied members to help those in need during this difficult period, regardless of race, religion, or background. The Silat Road gurdwara is a shining icon in the multi-religious landscape of Singapore, the prime minister said.

The gurdwara was renovated during the pandemic when Sikh leaders helped worshippers adjust to disruptions caused by the pandemic by innovating and using technology to adapt to the ""new normal"". The gurdwara started live-streaming services of congregations for devotees and the Coordinating Council of Sikh Institutions commissioned a task force called 'Project Akaal' to provide support for mental health within the Sikh community.

""These initiatives set a good example for the wider community, as we move towards a new normal of living with an endemic virus,"" PM Lee said during his speech. He shared a part of his speech and some photographs of his visit to the gurdwara on his Facebook page as well as on Twitter.

The Tokyo Olympics bars spectators as other countries navigate the return of in-person events

Yesterday, Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga announced that there won’t be any in-person spectators at the upcoming Tokyo Olympics due to rising cases of Covid-19. A new state of emergency will go into effect in Tokyo on Monday and last through August 22. The news is a reversal of an announcement from a few weeks ago, when the International Olympic Committee said a reduced number of local fans would be allowed to attend the games in person. Vaccination rates in Japan remain low compared to other countries like the US and Britain.

Meanwhile, as vaccinations continue to rise in other parts of the world, some countries are navigating the return of large in-person events, albeit not without a few hiccups. Singapore has said it will allow larger gatherings for people who are fully vaccinated when more than half of its population has gotten shots, later this month. In the US, concert venues are filling once more. And fans have been gathering across England to watch the European Championship soccer tournament, though researchers think this could be linked to a sudden spike in cases.

The Delta variant causes an uptick of cases in the US and around the world

As of this week, the Delta variant is officially the dominant strain of coronavirus circulating in the US. While current vaccines are still effective against the mutation, unvaccinated Americans are at a significant risk. Hospitalizations and new cases are up, particularly in parts of the country where vaccination rates have stayed relatively low. More than 99 percent of Americans who died from the disease in June were unvaccinated. All of this is happening as people are traveling more freely this summer, and other diseases quashed by pandemic prevention measures are able to make their comeback.

The Delta variant continues to cause problems around the world, as well. South Korea, where the virus was once thought to be largely under control, is increasing social distancing measures in Seoul as it faces what might be the worst wave the country has seen yet. And the World Health Organization said yesterday that Africa is experiencing its worst surge in cases, with cases rising in more than 16 countries across the continent.

Drugmakers investigate boosters and third doses amid new research about vaccine efficacy

Pfizer recently announced that it intends to seek emergency authorization from the Food and Drug Administration in August for a third dose of the vaccine to boost immunity, especially amid the rise of the Delta variant. The drugmaker said that early data from its booster study indicates that antibody levels jump significantly after a third dose. That said, even if Pfizer is granted FDA approval, it will be up to public health authorities to determine whether a booster is necessary when many people haven’t gotten their initial doses of the shot. Pfizer and BioNTech are also developing a booster shot that specifically targets the Delta variant.

Researchers are working hard to understand the new strain as well as what continued mutations could mean for immunity. New research published this week found that fully vaccinated people are well protected against the Delta variant but that only receiving one shot of the two doses offers little protection, another reminder of how important it is to receive the full course of vaccination.

One Question

How did the pandemic change sleep habits?

When many workers weren’t commuting to the office and students weren’t going to in-person class, lots of people found themselves sleeping later and longer. For researchers who look at sleep, this provided an opportunity for a real-time study and demonstrated that work schedules often cause people to sleep less and rise earlier than they would if they were listening to their bodies. Now, as more and more people return to work and school in person, some experts are saying this new knowledge about how people sleep and wake should inform schedules.

18,6 takeaways from Safe Space and ACE’s report on startup founders’ mental health,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEG_vjYIfRO8tMwWWqmgKbsAqMwgEKioIACIQOdBWcbLsvyM9V4feOTvYoCoUCAoiEDnQVnGy7L8jPVeH3jk72KAwvcDKBg?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,KrASIA,9/7/2021,"Building a company from scratch is draining. Entrepreneurs deal with immense workloads and intense schedules, not to mention the financial snags that will inevitably crop up. All of this can be devastating to a person’s physical and mental health. If the founder of a company brings that stress home with them, it could even ruin marriages, families, and the overall quality of life.

Safe Space, a Singapore-based mental wellness startup, teamed up with Action Community for Entrepreneurship (ACE) to release a report about the mental health of startup founders in Singapore, drawing results from a survey involving more than 150 founders from entrepreneur networks, incubators, and accelerators across the city-state. Here are six key points from the report.

#1: Most founders are stressed out

In all, 59% of the respondents agreed or strongly agreed that running a startup has taken a toll on their mental health, while 58% of them reported they felt exhausted in the past three months. Business uncertainty and daily challenges have led to longer hours at work.

#2: Founders’ personal relationships are at risk

Stress can lead to mood problems like anger, anxiety, and sadness. When queried, 75% of respondents reported being touchy and easily irritated, while 70% of founders said that maintaining close relationships has been difficult and frustrating for them. As seeking comfort from loved ones can help people cope with daily stress, the report’s authors suggest founders always show appreciation and dedicate time to spend with their family or partners every day, even if it’s only for a short period, to maintain healthy communication.

#3: Many cite a competitive business landscape as a key source of pressure

There are various causes of stress, but a challenging business environment is a top factor for founders (62%), followed by cash flow issues (48%), team dynamics (35%), and long work hours (34%). Other stressors include self-doubt, problems with business ideas, fundraising challenges, as well as relationships with investors and clients. Founders have a variety of coping strategies, but exercise is the most popular one (54%).

#4: Most startups don’t have a mental health advocate

The report says that 78% of respondents gave a high score—8 or above—for the importance of their team’s mental health, yet 88% of startups did not have dedicated advocates, as 79% of startup founders assess their team’s mental health through informal conversations. Safe Space suggests that CEOs offer subsidies for therapy to help employees deal with stress and mental health challenges.

#5: Male founders are more vulnerable

Male founders were twice as likely to strongly agree that running a startup had challenged their mental health. Men are also less likely to seek help due to stigma. Female founders were significantly more likely to confide in a friend.

#6: The pandemic has had a negative impact on young startups

The pandemic has forced businesses from various sectors to adjust their operations or even pivot entirely. All startups formed less than ten years ago reported being negatively impacted by COVID-19; most have solo founders. Companies that said they were positively impacted had co-founders. The report’s authors suggest solo founders be more active in forming personal and professional networks, as the simple act of sharing one’s thoughts can eliminate feelings of loneliness.

While self-care activities like working out, maintaining a healthy diet, and confiding in loved ones can help people cope with everyday tensions, engaging mental health experts for counseling is the next logical step for those struggling with stress and anxiety. Taking charge of mental wellness can lead to improvements in one’s professional life. Moreover, experts from Safe Space believe that managing daily stress from startup life and finding support quickly can bring significant benefits to the long-term growth of a business."

Disparities in Learning by Region and Race: New report from the CDC:

“Reduced access to in-person learning is associated with poorer learning outcomes and adverse mental health and behavioral effects in children.”

“Disparities in full-time in-person learning by race/ethnicity existed across school levels and by geographic region and state. These disparities underscore the importance of prioritizing equitable access to this learning mode for the 2021-22 school year.”

Massive differences in different parts of the country. More students (including students of color) were in-person in the South than in the West and Northeast.

Really good visualization from The Philadelphia Inquirer.

July 9, 2021 — The Big Three

COVID-19 and Schools — The Evidence for Reopening Safely: Via Nature

“A growing body of evidence suggests that schools can be opened safely. But that hasn’t quelled debate over whether they should be open and, if so, what steps should be taken to limit the spread of the virus.”

“Equity also became a flashpoint in the debate. Researchers argued that remote learning would widen disparities between white students and students of color in many countries.”

“One of the largest studies on COVID-19 in schools in the United States looked at more than 90,000 pupils and teachers in North Carolina over nine weeks last autumn. Given the rate of transmission in the community, ‘we would have expected to see about 900 cases’ in the schools, says Daniel Benjamin, a pediatrician at Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, North Carolina, and co-lead author on the study. But when the researchers conducted contact tracing to identify school-related transmissions, they identified only 32 cases.”

“The bulk of the literature on transmission in schools … suggests that kids aren’t driving viral spread. Investigations in Germany, France, Ireland, Australia, Singapore and the United States show no, or very low, secondary attack rates within school settings.”

Vaccine Mandates at Colleges: A Washington Post report shows the percentage of two- and four-year colleges and universities that are requiring students to be vaccinated against the coronavirus.

“More than 500 colleges and universities plan to require coronavirus vaccination for at least some of their students and employees, according to data as of Tuesday from the Chronicle of Higher Education.”

Texas state test results reveal dramatic drop in the number of students on grade level: Nearly 4 in 10 failed math tests.

“In districts where fewer than a quarter of classes were held in person, the number of students who met math test expectations dropped by 32 percentage points, and the number of students who met reading expectations dropped by 9 percentage points compared to 2019, the last time the test was administered.”

“In districts with more than three-quarters in-person instruction, the number of students meeting math expectations only dropped by 9 percentage points and those who met reading expectations by 1 percentage point. Students of color and lower-income students saw greater gaps as well, although those gaps were smaller than the one between remote and in-person instruction.”

“Math test performance saw the most significant drop, from 50 percent of students meeting their grade level in 2019 to only 35 percent this year.”

“This is probably 800,000 more students in Texas in mathematics that are noticeably below grade level this year as a result of COVID than in normal years,” Education Commissioner Mike Morath said. “It is important to remember that these are not numbers. These are children.”

Federal Updates

Infrastructure deal: The bipartisan 58 member Problem Solvers Caucus endorses the bipartisan infrastructure plan.

A Punchbowl News survey of senior Capitol Hill staffers finds that 40 percent say that only a “hard” infrastructure bill will pass, and the American Families Plan and the full American Jobs Plan will be left by the wayside.

“The White House’s long sought-after bipartisan infrastructure deal could hit the Senate floor as early as the week of July 19,” Politico reports.

Education Department:

Approved state American Rescue Plan Elementary and Secondary School Emergency Relief plans for South Dakota, Texas, Massachusetts, Utah, Arkansas, Rhode Island and Washington D.C.

Is inviting states to complete the application for their share of the second disbursement of $800 million in funds for homeless youth.

Announced new appointees: Katy Neas, deputy assistant secretary, Office of Special Education and Rehabilitative Services Toby Merrill, deputy general counsel, Office of the General Counsel Hayley Matz Meadvin, senior adviser, Office of the Secretary Chris Soto, senior adviser, Office of the Secretary Antoinette Flores, senior adviser for American Rescue Plan implementation, Office of Postsecondary Education Deven Comen, chief of staff, Office of Communications and Outreach Abel McDaniels, special assistant, Office of Elementary and Secondary Education



Emergency Connectivity Fund: The Federal Communications Commission officially opened the application window for schools and libraries to file applications for the $7.17 billion fund aimed at closing the homework gap. Education Superhighway has guides, resources and webinars on the program.

National Center for Education Statistics: Total K-12 enrollment dropped by roughly 3 percent in 2020-21 compared with the previous school year. More via The 74.

City & State News

Illinois: The Chicago Teachers Union released a proposal for reopening schools. The union is asking for:

80 percent of students 12 and older to be vaccinated against COVID-19 by October and 80 percent of younger students within 60 days after FDA emergency use authorization for their age group.

Ventilation system upgrades at school buildings.

A 10 percent increase in special education teachers, bilingual teachers, English language program teachers, teacher assistants and arts educators by Jan. 27 to support community recovery.

The union also wants members who are medically unable to return in-person to fill positions at the district’s new remote-learning Virtual Academy for students with qualifying health conditions.

Florida: Full-time enrollment in Florida Virtual School was up between July and September by 5,644 – a 98 percent increase – while the flexible virtual program saw course requests increase by 231,128, or 57 percent, from the same time in 2019.

Maryland: Maryland schools should drop all mask mandates, writes Margery Smelkinson, an immunology and infectious-disease scientist.

Michigan: Health department releases new mask and physical distance recommendations for schools which mostly points to CDC guidance.

New Jersey: The pandemic set back student learning. Newark kept the data under wraps. “Nearly 80 percent of third-graders and almost 90 percent of fourth-graders would ‘not meet the passing score’ on the state math exams, according to a district analysis that was not made public,” Chalkbeat reports.

Masks Can Prevent COVID-19 Transmission in Schools: New study from Duke (and an interview): “Proper masking is the most effective mitigation strategy to prevent secondary transmission in schools when COVID-19 is circulating and when vaccination is unavailable, or there is insufficient uptake.”

Doctors Are Puzzled by Heart Inflammation in the Young and Vaccinated: Via Katherine Wu in The Atlantic.

“These events are, so far, not matching the most terrifying versions of the condition, which have been observed with coronavirus infections.”

“Rather, compared with more typical cases of myocarditis, the ones linked to the vaccines, on average, involve briefer symptoms and speedier recoveries, even with less invasive treatments. Still, the incidents are showing up in the few days that follow each vaccine’s second dose at higher-than-expected rates, especially in boys and young men, and no one is yet sure why.”

“All of these factors make the risk of this complication tough to quantify, and several researchers have criticized the CDC’s recent evaluation. But most of the experts I spoke with said that the calculations still come out strongly in favor of vaccination, in part because of another set of disconcerting ambiguities, this time on the side of the virus.”

What Parents With Unvaccinated Kids Need to Know About the Delta Variant This Summer: Via The Wall Street Journal

Vaccinating Teens: To fully vaccinate children against COVID-19 by the time school starts, many parents must act now, CNN reports.

“It takes five weeks to be fully vaccinated with Pfizer’s vaccine, the only one authorized for adolescents ages 12 to 17. That means, for example, Atlanta students need to get their first shot by July 1 to be fully immunized by the first day of school on Aug. 5.”

Viewpoints

How COVID-19 is Inspiring Education Reform: Via The Economist

“Big shocks have sometimes changed schooling for the better. The Second World War midwifed the Butler Act in Britain, which increased years of compulsory schooling and abolished the fees still charged by many state schools. After Hurricane Katrina inundated New Orleans, officials there embarked on sweeping school reforms. Nine years later graduation rates had increased by 9-13 percentage points.”

“Struggling learners would benefit enormously if expanded tutoring schemes become core parts of education systems. A long-running tutoring programme at Match Charter Public School in Boston provides one model. Before the pandemic it offered all children in four grades daily tutoring in maths. It operates a longer school day than is common in its neighbourhood, so Match manages to slot these sessions into students’ timetables without them having to give up anything else.”

Make Telemedicine Services for Children Permanent: Kelly Wolfe, a former educator and advocacy leader for children’s health in Minnesota and vice president of strategic partnerships and regulatory compliance at PresenceLearning, writes at The 74: During COVID, states let students get speech therapy, mental health counseling and other services online. Make those changes permanent.

Survey of Black Parents: From Morning Consult/EdChoice

Black parents remain less likely than white and Hispanic parents to vaccinate themselves or their children.

Roughly half of Black parents believe it will be safe to send children back to school for in-person classes by September. But 31 percent said it will take longer.

Read the brief and the crosstabs.

How the Pandemic Helped Fuel the Private School Choice Movement: Via EdWeek:

“Six states had enacted new programs by July 1, and a bill to create a new program in Missouri awaited Gov. Mike Parson’s signature. Governors also approved expansions of 14 existing voucher and tax-credit scholarship programs by loosening eligibility restrictions or expanding their budgets.”

“Among the biggest moves in states’ 2021 legislative sessions: West Virginia created the most-expansive education savings account program in the country, making most of the state’s students eligible for the Hope Scholarship Program, which will provide up to $4,600 in state funds per student. New Hampshire’s budget includes a new educational savings account program available to families with incomes up to 300 percent of the federal poverty line.”

21,Singaporeans struggling with mental health a year into the COVID-19 pandemic,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiEJcbvk_JkhpXfU4E8_ikc04qGQgEKhAIACoHCAow2JOcCzDsnbQDMPOi4QY?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,Insurance Business Asia,16/4/2021,"The AIA Health Matters Survey 2021 polled over 300 Singaporeans aged 30 to 55, across a spectrum of working adults that is representative of the resident population, the insurer said.

Respondents’ concerns for critical illness also grew by 10% compared to 2016. Cancer (73%) and stroke (68%) were the most pressing concerns among Singaporeans. Mental health conditions such as anxiety and major depressive disorders were also major issues. Singaporeans expressed worry not only for their own health, but also for the health and well-being of family and loved ones.

A majority of the male respondents who are breadwinners stated that they are more likely to report when they are facing mental health and critical illness conditions compared to women.

Millennials (aged 30-39) reported higher stress coping with daily stressors at work as compared to pre-retirees (aged 40 and above). Millennials are also more worried about cancer than older adults.

“While our nation is heading for a post-pandemic recovery, mentally, we are still trying to navigate our way out of COVID-19 uncertainties,” said Wong Sze Keed, CEO of AIA Singapore.

“It is not enough to only take care of our physical health. This conviction drives our holistic approach to protect the many aspects of our customers’ wellbeing – such as financial, physical, and mental health – to enable everyone to truly lead healthier, longer, better lives.”

In 2019, AIA launched its Beyond Critical Care product, a critical illness plan that includes coverage for five prominent mental illnesses: major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and Tourette syndrome (up to age 21)."

Various recreational activities are being organised under a new programme to improve the mental well-being of migrant workers living in the more than 300 dormitories here.

The mental wellness programme, launched yesterday by non-profit organisation Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth Centre and the Ministry of Manpower, comes as migrant workers in the dorms have faced significant anxiety and stress during the Covid-19 pandemic.

Various activities, including a poetry-sharing session by local and foreign poets and a mental health talk, were held online yesterday.

The workers were taught relaxation and meditation techniques by traditional Chinese medicine physician Lim Xiang Jun.

Since the outbreak of Covid-19 in the dorms, the movement of more than 300,000 migrant workers has been restricted.

Often, the workers are confined to their dormitory.

The Tzu Chi Humanistic Youth Centre has built up expertise in serving this community over the past year and formed a social network to safeguard the mental health of migrant workers.

It has partnered several organisations, including cooperative society A Good Space and literary interest group Migrant Writers of Singapore.

The centre's manager, Ms Lim Choon Choon, said the pandemic has highlighted the plight of migrant workers here."
23,Bigger push to encourage seniors to get vaccinated: Health Minister,https://news.google.com/articles/CAIiENOj6BOJMvtg0t3k-oX86kAqGQgEKhAIACoHCAow4b_0CjDC7doCMNP-0QY?hl=en-SG&gl=SG&ceid=SG%3Aen,The New Paper,7/7/2021,"The vaccination rate for those above the age of 70 is now 71 per cent.

The good news: More seniors are getting vaccinated. The not so good: It is still not enough.

Minister for Health Ong Ye Kung said during a virtual press conference by the multi-ministry task force on Covid-19 yesterday that the vaccination rate for those above 70 years of age is now 71 per cent, from under 70 per cent in the last update on June 24.

However, 71 per cent is still a far cry from the figure that Mr Ong hopes to see - close to 90 per cent of seniors vaccinated.

""Those above 70 have the lowest first dose and booking rates. It really should be the other way round, we really ought to have them have the highest percentage,"" he said.

Stressing the importance of convincing seniors to get vaccinated as they remain the most vulnerable, Mr Ong pointed to how, in countries with higher vaccination rates that have opened up, most of those who have suffered severe illness from Covid-19 are still the elderly.

Among people over 70 years old, 71 per cent have had at least one dose of the vaccine, or have booked an appointment, he said.

For those aged 60 to 69, the figure is 85 per cent. For those who are 50 to 59, as well as 40 to 49, it is 86 per cent.

For those aged 30 to 39, the figure is 78 per cent. For the 20- to 29-year-olds, it is 80 per cent, and it is the same for those aged 12 to 19.

Mr Ong, co-chair of the task force, said that in countries such as the United Kingdom, United States and Israel, which have opened up, infections have also gone up among young people as they are out and about and less vaccinated, although hospitalisation and severe illness numbers are ""quite stable, but mostly among the old"".

He added: ""It is not a matter of the elderly saying, 'I don't go out therefore I'm safe'... because these days when we look at our infections and our cases, many of our infections have actually occurred at home. Family members can go out and bring the virus back home.""

Announcing that the authorities will be making a bigger push to reach out to seniors, ""knocking on their doors if necessary"", Mr Ong urged more people to encourage seniors to get vaccinated.

""This is the work we need to do, so any one of us, if we know of an elderly person, a neighbour or a relative who is still hesitating, please help reach out to them and persuade them,"" he said.

Singapore Management University (SMU) researcher Micah Tan, who recently conducted a study on why some seniors still continue to resist Covid-19 vaccines, agree that the responsibility to get more older adults vaccinated does not lie with only the Government.

Singaporeans, too, should play a part in encouraging older relatives or friends to get vaccinated and supporting them through the process, like accompanying their older relatives to get their vaccinations and taking care of them if they experience any side effects, he said.

Mr Tan, the lead author of the study conducted by SMU's Centre for Research on Successful Ageing, said a survey of 7,288 respondents showed that older adults who were hesitant placed the greatest amount of trust in their family members for information on Covid-19.

TRUSTED VOICES

Mr Anthony Tay, chairman of Lion Befrienders, which serves mostly the elderly with little or no family support, agreed that seniors tend to trust those ""who support them on a daily basis"" and would be more likely to heed their advice.

""It might be more effective to educate them through the people they interact with.""

Madam Kam May Yoke, 61, is a hawker assistant who eventually managed to convince her 86-year-old mother, who lives in Redhill, to get vaccinated.

""We felt it was really unsafe and that we need to take the necessary precautions now.""

However, the in-laws of Ms Josephine Chin, who are in their 60s, are still extremely unwilling to get vaccinated.

Ms Chin, who works in a bank, suggested ""monetary benefits"" or taking away their ""everyday benefits"", such as not allowing them to leave the house, go to the market or coffee shop, to push them to get vaccinated.

But SMU's Mr Tan said punitive measures may not be the best solution.

""Older adults have already had a very difficult time during the pandemic and such drastic measures would be significantly detrimental to their mental well-being,"" he said.

Mr Tan said it is important for people to not be critical of unvaccinated seniors.

""Many of them are worried for their safety, and we need to strive to reassure them by listening to and addressing their concerns, and to more generally adopt a posture of empathy towards their worries,"" he said.

Lion Befrienders told TNP it has been equipping its staff and volunteers with information so that they can advise its seniors during home visits and assist them with the booking of vaccination slots.

""Our staff and volunteers will also answer questions and educate the seniors on the vaccination process, how the vaccines will protect them, and side effects to look out for,"" said Mr Tay.

The Agency for Integrated Care's (AIC) outreach arm, Silver Generation Office (SGO), said it, too, has been engaging seniors through house visits and telephone calls since February, together with the People's Association.

AIC told TNP that most of the seniors were generally receptive to being vaccinated.

For those who are hesitant, SGO will engage them again to listen to and understand their reservations, and help reassure them about the vaccination."
