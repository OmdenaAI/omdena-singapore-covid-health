Efforts that must be undertaken include looking out for vulnerable seniors, strengthening partnerships between care providers and helping the elderly become more resilient, they said.
The mental health of seniors is in the spotlight amid a report by suicide prevention organisation Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) that stated elderly suicides hit a nearly two-decade high in the country last year.
Out of the 452 suicides reported in Singapore in 2020, 154 were among people aged 60 and above – the highest recorded figure since 1991.
This also marked a 26 per cent increase from the year before, according to SOS.
""COVID-19 has severely affected the nation's economy, lifestyle and mental health. We are extremely worried about how our elderly are coping during this public health crisis,"" said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan when the data was released on Thursday.
Apart from social isolation, the difficulty in constantly adapting to changes was also a key issue among this group.
""IT’S EVERYBODY’S BUSINESS""
Moving forward, to better care for seniors’ wellbeing, every member of society has a role to play, said Ms Porsche Poh, the executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore).
“Some will say it’s the Government’s responsibility, it’s the charity’s responsibility. But mental health is everyone’s business … Everyone has a role to play in promoting a caring society.”
She noted that while social service agencies implement programmes to engage the elderly, grassroots organisations and individuals can also reach out to involve those in their circles.
One can simply start by paying attention to the elderly in their families, she said.
“We’ve really heard of elderly saying they’re very lonely … For the elderly with children, the kids could spend some time just by having a meal with them ... Educate them, speak to them (about mental health),” said Ms Poh.
She added: “Show your concern and keep a look out for your neighbours too … Just say: ‘Hello, how are you? Are you okay?’”
Ms Joyz Tan, a senior social worker at Fei Yue Community Services, echoed the importance of interactions within the community.
""We really hope that the elderly will find that the environment that they stay in is a pleasant one - (where there's a face that they're familiar with) that will say hello to them.
“When we have such a vibrant community of people who can still make friends, I think that will really build up a sense of positivity in their lives.”
At an organisational level, institutions serving the elderly – such as hospitals and social service agencies – should also partner up because a single agency cannot do everything, said Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation.
“When we have discussions, we can talk about the observations we have, what kind of care plan we can come up with and who can do which part - the monitoring, the psychosocial intervention.
“That is a very helpful strategy … It is so important that we share the same direction, understand the needs of the client and come up with a more holistic care plan together,” she said.
From an operational perspective, the recent relaxation of COVID-19 safe management measures is also an essential move for protecting seniors’ wellbeing, said Ms Poh.
This is because face-to-face meetings, which provide a human touch, are critical for seniors who feel isolated, she said.
Ms Poh also noted that many prefer in-person meetings as they are not digitally savvy, hence making door-to-door visits all the more important.
These must be kept up, she said, stressing that one must not assume all seniors can catch up with technology, even if there are growing efforts to help them go online.
“We should know that the elderly can be quite stubborn. You can have all the courses to educate them, but (some are) not ready or do not believe in it.”
Ms Wang stressed that this is unfamiliar territory for many seniors, who may lack the confidence to try new things.
""It's not so easy for the elderly to step out of their comfort zone ... (We can) be more patient, be more encouraging, help them to learn.""
But it is also important to empower the elderly with more confidence and skills to cope with change, she said.
So far, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 may have led to fear, anxiety and a sense of helplessness among seniors, and teaching them to examine these could make them more resilient, Ms Wang said.
“What’s behind these emotions? I think a lot of times it's the yearning for safety and a sense of control.
“So then, we need to help them see … How are we able to learn from these feelings? How are we able to provide some comfort and (soothe) ourselves? And how can they accept that this change could be the new normal?
“That's the important part for them to really feel more confident and can take back control in a way,” said Ms Wang.
“We do have the ability to make choices to adapt to changes. I think we need to help them to build their confidence,” she said.
She also said that helping the elderly tap on these “internal resources” is just as important as giving them external resources.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/suicide-highest-record-elderly-mental-health-isolation-covid-19-15179528,Suicide cases in Singapore highest in 8 years amid COVID-19 pandemic - CNA,08/07/2021,"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 452 suicides last year, the nation's highest count since 2012, amid the isolation and psychological distress brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Last year's case count was a 13 per cent increase from the 400 cases recorded in 2019, according to data released by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) on Thursday (Jul 8).
The increase was observed across all age groups but in particular the elderly, which recorded the highest number of suicides since 1991.
Among people aged 60 and above, a total of 154 took their own lives. This was a 26 per cent increase from 2019.
In the other age groups - youths aged 10 to 29 and adults aged 30 to 59 - the number of suicides rose by 7 per cent from 2019.
Overall, the number of suicide deaths rose to 8.88 per 100,000 residents, up by 0.88 when compared to 2019.
""COVID-19 has severely affected the nation's economy, lifestyle and mental health. We are extremely worried about how our elderly are coping during this public health crisis,"" said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan.
ELDERLY IN DISTRESS
During the pandemic, the elderly are more likely to face social isolation and financial worries, said Mr Tan.
They may also face difficulties with constantly adapting to changes and prolonged feelings of loneliness, which may be ""devastating"", he said.
Despite the higher number of elderly suicides, SOS saw a fall in the number of calls it received from this group through its 24-hour suicide prevention hotline.
There were 4,455 calls to the hotline from the elderly last year, compared to 4,816 calls in 2019.
Among those who revealed their age, 17 per cent of all calls were made by those aged 60 and above in the financial year 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous financial year.
FIND WAYS TO CONNECT
Callers faced difficulties in coping with loneliness and inactivity due to isolation, psychological distress, and impaired social and family relationships, said SOS.
Some elderly people live alone and lack the support to cope with the pandemic, said Adjunct Associate Professor Lee Cheng, clinical director at the Institute of Mental Health's Office of Population Health.
""For example, while they wish to comply with the call by the Government to stay at home as much as possible, they may still have to go out to get their necessities.
""Those who are used to attending social activities outside on a regular basis will also likely feel socially isolated during this period,"" he said.
As many in-person activities for the elderly have gone digital since the pandemic, those with limited proficiency at technology may find themselves ""lost and helpless"", said SOS' Mr Tan.
""Given the uncertainty of how long the pandemic will last, it is imperative that we continue to build on existing efforts and find new ways to support the mental health of the elderly,"" he said.
People should find as many ways as possible to connect with the elderly who are lonely and socially isolated, said Associated Professor Helen Ko, who teaches gerontology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.
""Very often, most elderly persons want to hear a human voice and they long to hear the familiar voice of a loved one. For those who are not digitally savvy, please be very patient as they may need more time to pick up digital skills,"" she said.
DIAL 1-767 FOR HELP
From Jul 26, the public will be able to reach SOS' 24-hour hotline through a new four-digit number, 1-767 (1-SOS), the organisation announced.
Many people who have suicide ideations remain hesitant and fearful of reaching out for help, noted SOS, which attended to a total of 39,779 calls in the last financial year.
The shortened number is intended to be easier for those who are feeling overwhelmed and in crisis to recall, said Mr Tan.
The hotline will remain toll-free and can also be reached at the existing number, 1800 221 4444.
""The acknowledgment as a special service in the community and the assignment of the new four-digit short code marks a humbling milestone for SOS,"" said the organisation.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/night-owls-work-home-more-rest-morning-lark-revenge-bedtime-15082770,Commentary: Why some night owls are flourishing during this work-from-home era - CNA,25/06/2021,"SINGAPORE: To paraphrase Linda Evangelista, the model who famously said she does not get out of bed for less than US$10,000 a day, I don’t get out of bed before 10am.
I did pry my eyes open for a 9am Zoom appointment the other day, but after wrapping up, I promptly wiped off my lipstick and changed back into pyjamas to catch more zzzs before starting my day proper at noon.
As a lifelong creature of nocturnal habits, I have finally embraced the fact that some of us function much more effectively and productively as late risers and rising before the sun does like most model CEOs supposedly do is just pointless.
This epiphany struck after one sleepless night during last year’s circuit breaker, when I stopped regarding my sleeplessness as “losing sleep”, treating it as “extra” leisure time instead.
These days, I will read a book or scroll through social media when unable to drift off to dreamland and set the alarm for seven hours later once fatigue sets in.
Instead of trying in vain to conform to norms of waking up before 8am, then feeling groggy and grumpy for the next few hours, I now happily stay up past 1am or 2am and rouse gently from slumber at about 10am every day.
THE GENES OF NIGHT OWLS
Please don’t hate me. It’s not a late sleeper’s fault they’re wired that way when sleeping patterns are written into our genetic codes.
UK research involving 700,000 in 2019 identified genes that determined how much of an early bird a person is. The researchers from the University of Exeter say night owls keeping to a morning lark’s schedule may be forced to fight their internal body clock.
Night owls can clock eight hours of work too, just not necessarily from nine to five. Instead, by syncing working hours to when energy levels are at their highest, they can be more efficient and productive.

The fortunate flexibility my career offers has been a key enabler allowing me to get more done despite these odd hours. And with WFH as the default for most of the past year, the people I work with do not even notice that I keep to “jetlag hours”.
Starting the day late does mean work occasionally continues into the wee hours of the night. But the silence and solitude allows me to get things done with fewer interruptions and greater focus.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Most of all, I no longer feel guilty about sleeping late nor do I worry about waking by a certain time. This, to me, is happiness.
WHY OWLS ARE OFTEN SLEEP DEPRIVED
Sleep experts point to the COVID-19 pandemic as the cause of multiple sleeping disorders such as revenge bedtime procrastination, where people choose to go to bed later to reclaim some spare time for themselves; and coronasomnia, sleeplessness caused by pandemic-related worries.
There is no doubt insufficient sleep can affect job performance, in diminishing one’s concentration, causing slower reaction times and increasing irritability.
In the long run, poor-quality or insufficient sleep can heighten the risk of health problems like obesity, heart disease and dementia, studies have shown. Late risers are at a greater risk of depression or tend to have a shorter lifespan.
But what these don’t consider is that owls often do not get enough quality sleep because even though their internal body clock makes them sleepy at a later hour, they typically still have to wake early.

“The health problems associated with being a night owl are likely a result of being a night owl living in a morning person's world, which leads to disruption in their body's circadian rhythms,"" said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
To counter this, experts recommend finding ways to embrace the body’s natural rhythm, which in the case of late sleepers could mean working more flexible hours so they can sleep when they feel tired.
BENEFITS OF BEING NOCTURNAL
This might not be possible for some firms and many operational roles, but the pandemic’s rewriting of corporate norms has forced a refocus towards employees’ well-being and engagement, so there is no better time like the present to review those boundaries.
Indeed, this has been the silver lining of pandemic living. After years of frustration over being unable to sleep early, I am finally leaning into my vampiric nature thanks to the flexi work hours afforded by widespread WFH practices.
All of this might seem unconventional to those accustomed to keeping deskbound hours in an office but they are more achievable than you might imagine.
I am fortunate because my job does not require me accounting for every waking minute so long as deadlines are met and high standards are adhered to.
But with many of us now working from home, there are certain owl habits that may benefit even the morning larks.
For example, why not wake up a little later since you do not need to commute, instead of sticking to your usual early rising schedule because it’s the “hardworking” thing to do? And how about finding small breaks in the day if you find value in working and thinking in the quiet of the night?
Parents who care for their kids in the morning could also fit in an afternoon nap with their young ones when they return home from school.
After all, short naps are known to offer benefits such as improved memory and stress relief, so there is no need to feel like you are skiving. Take it from me: Waking up after a snooze can make you feel like your brain has undergone a reset, such that you are ready to tackle whatever deadline lies in wait.
That WFH is likely to extend into the foreseeable future also allows employers to warm up to a hybrid style of juggling work and life.
Society has long tended to think of people who wake up late as lazy, unproductive and spoilt. That sort of old-fashioned thinking needs to find the door in an Internet age when work has become somewhat 24/7 for so many industries.
A more constructive and mature way of approaching this situation is to first assess whether workers have the right priorities and can deliver results, juggle their work and get the rest they need. Then the firm can decide how to offer more flexibility in when and how they work.
When so many traditional notions of work have been disrupted by the pandemic, there is no better time than the present than to allow the owls to rise and lead the way – just not before 10am please.

This was a point reiterated by President Halimah who in a Facebook post said people have to walk away from toxic environments despite the stigma.
Because most adults spend the bulk of their time working, the workplace is naturally one environment facing fresh challenges in a new normal. In a 2020 survey by EngageRocket, one in six workers said they felt stressed.
In particular, 30 per cent of employees working in the education sector and 22 per cent from consumer industries indicated their stress levels were unacceptable. 
The 2021 survey results are expected at the end of June and it will come as no surprise if more employees feel this way.
So what can employers do when they find themselves with requests from employees for time out? How can employers tell apart workers feeling isolated and exhausted trying to cope with work and family from those genuinely struggling with issues such as anxiety and depression? 
They are two distinct conditions although both could manifest with similar symptoms such as the lack of energy or cynicism towards work and colleagues. 
Being aware of these differences can help employers differentiate when adjustments at work may help and when medical interventions including treatment in the form of therapy or medication may be needed instead.

There are useful resources to tap on so that managers can understand the difference. In Singapore, these range from self-help assessment tools such as iWorkHealth developed by the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Institute to online mental health platforms such as the My Mental Health microsite.
The Health Promotion Board (HPB) also runs workshops to equip managers and human resource personnel with the knowledge to recognise staff facing difficulties at work and may need help and be supportive leaders at their workplace.
But the reality for many organisations is employees shy away from speaking to their bosses about their personal struggles for fear of being seen as weak or even worse, stigmatised. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
So the problem is often not knowing there is a problem in the first place. The good news is that companies can adopt good management practices to uncover insights using data, recognise the sensitivities, set the right tone and nurture a culture of trust and openness on mental wellbeing.
CHECK-INS AND SURVEYS
Almost every company utilises surveys to take the pulse on a number of issues – from corporate culture to change management and views on leadership. Done well, this sort of data provides critical real-time information on how employees feel about their work, their bosses or their prospects in the organisation. 
The Harvard Business Review has good resources on how a well-designed survey can lead to quantifiable gains. Tech giant Facebook took things even further and worked with Wharton Professor Adam Grant to study what keeps employees engaged.
Companies that use regular check-ins and surveys to take the pulse of how employees are coping have data to pinpoint where the pain points are instead of relying on “gut feel”.
This is especially at a time when WFH is the default and bosses may not get to meet their staff as often as they would like to and cannot have conversations by the corridor that give them a sense of how they are coping.
When done properly, data and insights on employees can drive effective decision-making for the organisation. 
For example, HR can have an overview of its entire workforce’s mental well-being and identify opportunities to drive better engagement. Or they can use this data to target interventions on specific departments needing more support. 
CHANGES TO HR POLICY
Your company’s HR policies can help promote a conducive environment that respects an individual’s privacy and accommodates those with mental health issues.
While it is not always possible to remove the stigma, keeping mental health information strictly private and confidential and separate from an employee’s normal personnel file can help reassure and encourage more staff struggling to come forward for help. 
Some companies have expanded leave policies to allow for mental health days without a medical certificate to encourage people to take time off when they need it and reduce stress and burnout.

LinkedIn gave its 15,900 full-time employees a paid week off in April to help them combat burnout and encourage them to unplug and recharge. Global companies including SAP, Cisco, Google and Thomson Reuters have instituted companywide “mental health days”. 
Smaller companies with more limited resources can start by instituting more flexi-work arrangements. In 2020, more than 8,000 companies comprising 90,000 employees took advantage of government funding support to implement and sustain flexible work arrangements (FWAs) for all employees. 
Flexible employee benefits can be expanded to include mental health consultations and treatments, as well as mental well-being programmes.
Indeed, because working from home has blurred the boundaries, clarity on an after-hours policy is one of the recommendations of the Tripartite Advisory issued in November last year.
Don’t leave it for another day - start relooking longstanding HR policies out of sync with the new realities of work. With more staff aware they can work effectively from anywhere, more employees will feel empowered to ask for flexible work arrangements. 
This is especially if they have dependents and find it easier to balance work and family. This will also benefit those who are starting to feel the effects of isolation from going for long periods without interaction with their teams. 
Companies that make accommodations to make flexible work as part of their life to get ahead of this curve will get the talent they need who will make an impact to their business.
(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on CNA's Heart of the Matter.)
 
CREATING SUPPORT TEAMS IN COMPANIES
Greater flexible work arrangements, the blurring of boundaries between work and home and managing burnout is bringing into sharper focus this greater burden on the manager to pick up. 
So companies must level up managers, support them with these tools and get a handle on what’s going on. When a manager shows that supporting someone with mental health challenges does not mean he is any less valuable or will not be promoted or given increments goes a long way in getting employees to not just get help but to be committed to your organisation. 
Other employees should also get mental health training to recognise “psychosocial hazards”, so they can identify a problem and extend help before it develops, and step in to cover for colleagues who need time off to protect their mental health. 
There is no one-size-fits-all approach to accommodating workers with mental illness. The key is to try out various approaches to see what works. Even small companies can start by surveys to gather feedback and benchmark their employee perceptions. 
While there is plenty that employers can do to help prevent stress and burnout, the best vaccine for mental health is a strong foundation of personal relationships at work with managers and teams that builds trust and goodwill.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/revenge-bedtime-procrastination-sleep-difficulty-falling-asleep-14971486,Commentary: Revenge bedtime procrastination in Singapore is coming at a cost - CNA,15/06/2021,"SINGAPORE: The benefits of good sleep are well known.
After a poor night of sleep, we feel groggy, moody, and we have trouble staying focused. There is enough evidence that people do not perform their best when they are not well-rested.
Yet, many of us find ourselves regularly going to bed later then we had intended. Even if we have a busy day ahead, we may be tempted to stay up later than we know is good for us.
Bedtime procrastination, as this phenomenon is called, was first described by Dutch psychologist Dr Floor Kroese and refers to a pattern of choosing to go to bed later than intended despite being aware of negative consequences.
This behaviour was found in 53 per cent of persons in the original Dutch study in 2014. In work we conducted among Singaporean adolescents, university students, and working adults, 28 per cent of the 321 respondents surveyed over the past two years indicated that they occasionally go to bed later than intended, while 55 per cent reported frequently struggling with this.
People often find it hard to disengage from their activities and go to sleep. When we are catching up on our favourite TV drama shows, it may not seem so important to be refreshed the next morning.

JUST ONE MORE EPISODE
In this era of digital media, it is hardly surprising that people feel tempted to stay up late. The Internet provides an endless offering of entertainment, education, and everything in between.
Studies have shown that using e-devices close to bedtime can disrupt sleep and push back bedtime. Phones can have an alerting effect due to the content and light emitted. Often, we are engrossed in the media and cannot resist the urge to watch just one more YouTube clip.
Our data shows that people who use their phones more heavily during the hours before bedtime, sleep later by 40 minutes on average, compared with a group of light phone users.
Furthermore, 65 per cent of respondents indicated that scrolling on their phones, or engaging with some types of electronic media, was one of the activities that kept them from going to bed on time.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
SWEET REVENGE
Another factor that may influence our sleep habits is our work or school pressure.
A Duke-NUS study found that Singaporean secondary school students spent on average 2.9 hours a day on homework during weekdays and 4.5 hours during weekends. Time spent on homework was directly related to shorter time spent in bed for sleeping. On weekdays, the primary pre-condition for going to sleep, was that homework was finished.
Browsing our phones might be the last thing that we do before sleeping, but often the time before is packed with school and work assignments. In our data, after digital media, finishing school or work assignments was the second most often mentioned reason for bedtime procrastination.
Moreover, high pressure and packed schedules could push our sleep back further, as we seek to regain some “me time”.
This phenomenon has recently become known as “revenge bedtime procrastination”.
Popularised on Chinese social media, many people describe how they feel the strong need to reclaim time for themselves, freeing themselves from the constant demands of their jobs. 
Respondents in our study described that after a day of work, family duties, and chores they need some time to relax. “Watching videos, reading online. That keeps me happy” as one respondent puts it.
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?
While it is easy to recognise this issue, it is harder to prevent it. Studies have shown that providing people with knowledge about the importance of sleep, does not necessarily result in people adopting better sleep habits.

                ​​​​​​​
This is known as the intention-behaviour gap. To plug this gap between knowledge and good intentions, we often need actionable strategies to achieve our goals.   
Here are some things that we can do to counter the urge to procrastinate our bedtime.
First, have a planned bedtime, and have a bedtime plan. Adolescents whose parents set bedtime sleep significantly longer than those whose parents do not.
But equally important is to have a plan in mind on how to go about it. What time should you get ready for bed? When should you put away your phone? What are the obstacles to achieving your plan?
Be intentional about limiting screen time before bed. Start a movement among your friends not to message beyond 10pm, except for emergencies.
Second, plan to get some physical exercise. Only 35 per cent of Singaporeans exercise regularly and overall, 44 per cent of physical activity comes from commuting which has been significantly reduced as a result of hybrid work.
Moderately intense aerobic exercise benefits sleep and often exposes one to natural light. Morning light exposure perks up the brain and keeps our circadian clock from drifting to seeking a later bedtime.
Third, there needs to be a sea change in how we influence one another about after-hours work. The potential time savings and work-hour productivity gains from not having to battle through the daily commute should be gains. Both employees and managers should co-operate to complete planned tasks in a timely fashion.
Homework can be cut if learning is paced in a manner that accommodates different learning rates to ensure thoughtful assimilation.
This will leave time to all to collectively reflect on how to be more effective instead of merely ticking off check-boxes.
Everyone should collectively review the hosting of serial virtual meetings where participants are mentally absent. Consideration should also be given for time and energy chipped away by childcare and home-based learning.
Lastly, we should be aware that, in the attention economy, our waking hours have become a commodity.
Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once said that the company’s biggest competitor is sleep. Companies are competing for your engagement and will fight for every opportunity to do that.

Whether through dwelling on whether to make that online purchase, e-games, video streaming, sports offerings or e-gossiping, the addictive nature of engaging in any or all of these activities through a single device is something few can resist.
Be aware that you may be trading your health and mental well-being for taps, clicks and swipes. By cutting your sleep, you may become the victim of your own revenge.

“Being at a cafe means I get to be an adult and read and unwind, journal and eat something nice (which I don’t have to share). It’s also a rare chance for me not to have to meet anyone else’s needs at least for a couple of hours.”
For another friend who used to enjoy a spot of me-time at her local coffeeshop when everyone else was still in bed, such mental and physical breaks provide her quiet moments for reflection, setting the tone for the day that she says sometimes helps to improve her relationships at home.
PARENTING BURNOUT 
Psychologist John Duffy, author of Parenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety, identifies a hidden form of labour specific to mothers – “emotional labour”.

In a CNN commentary, he defines it as “the ability and willingness to gauge the emotional temperature of the home – who is struggling, who may be nearing a boiling point, who needs some time alone, who might need therapy – that has kept our households reasonably sane for the length of the pandemic.”
Emotional labour, which stands separately from managing the home, is “esoteric, ongoing and endlessly taxing. And the emotional labour in most every household tends to fall squarely on moms.”
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
In pandemic times, with families stuck in small spaces, caregiving can be a slippery slope to burnout if we don't take sufficient steps to rest.
“Taking care of yourself,” according to the American Psychological Association, “helps to keep your mind and body primed to deal with situations that require resilience.”
In an interview last year when the circuit breaker was first pulled, Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, suggests that mums carve out time for themselves in the family timetable or establish areas out of bounds to the kids.
For many, a short break away from the family could help us feel calmer and more emotionally regulated, at a time when parental stress levels continue to rise and along with it, irritability and resentment within the home.
SELF-CARE CAN MAKE US BETTER PARENTS
To be sure, the loss of the kopi pit stop affects everyone, and some essential workers might feel the pain sharply.
An affordable and accessible everyday luxury for some, it can be a critical juncture for others taking a break between gigs.
People constantly on the move, such as food deliverers, taxi and private car drivers, contractors and insurance agents are going to feel the displacement the most.

At the coffeeshop I escaped to each day before these new restrictions, some of them could  be spotted at lunchtime sitting and resting. Now they eat in their vehicles or at a void deck.
Thankfully, the Government saw their need and quickly carved out spaces in community centres for them to sit and have their meals at a safe distance. Attention has also been paid to establishing rest places for low-wage workers before the pandemic, with funding to set up such areas available.
I would also argue that just as essential workers need a dedicated rest area, so do mums. You may wave this off as self-indulgence, but self-care makes us better parents.
Self-care habits can be small, like catching up with a good friend or enjoying a book at bedtime by ourselves. The rest or relaxation helps us stay healthy, emotionally regulated and at the top of our game.
The University of Chicago’s Centre for the Study of Social Policy says self-care for parents is a critical resource. Whether it is yoga, quiet journaling, or a coffee with a friend, self-care reduces stress and enhances our sense of wellbeing.
These meet our needs, whether physical, emotional, spiritual or social and help us be in a better place to care for those of our spouse and children.
For caregivers of children with special needs or elderly parents, the practice of taking regular time-off is all the more crucial.

PRACTISING GOOD EMOTIONAL HYGIENE
I know I shouldn’t lament the loss of dining-in privileges at my local coffeeshop too much, after all the situation in Singapore remains very much under control.
We are not in a full lockdown, and we can still step out for a jog, a walk, or to do a grocery run. Malls and shops remain open. My husband also tends to the kids when I need a break.

Now, I still go down on some days to grab a takeaway cuppa but instead of sitting at the coffeeshop, I wander off to find an empty park bench.
It may just be 15 minutes of stillness, but it is a cocoon of calm in such unsettling times.
COVID-19 may have warped our sense of time and shrunk our sense of space. It may have even hampered our ability to look ahead and make plans for the future.
But what it has not taken away is our ability to breathe and live within the everyday.
As we’re all experts in physical hygiene now, so we should become in emotional hygiene – especially considering the long bumpy road ahead for this pandemic.
CHERISHING WHAT WE HAVE NOW
We may have lost a lot in terms of freedom and normalcy, but the good news is we’re adapting and coping alright in our own unique ways.
The friend who said she misses her early morning me-time is now compensating with longer trips to the supermarket.
Some of us are also making the effort to call our loved ones more often, just to check in and find out if they’re okay.
I find myself looking for excuses to make contact, by delivering food to friends, or picking up delicious bakes from them.
Our contact with family and friends may be shorter and more transient than before, but even these can make a difference.
While we look forward to the day when restrictions are relaxed and we can dine out once again, whether solo, in pairs or in small groups, perhaps there are already small pleasures we can relish now.
As a mummy-friend of mine quipped after I dropped by her place last week, “I guess one can go a long time without contact but it only takes a physical meetup to make you realise how precious that is.”
The same goes for our first coffee cup once dining in at hawker centres is allowed again.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-stigma-conditions-depression-14903772,The rise of mental health awareness – and the stigma that remains attached to certain conditions - CNA,05/06/2021,"SINGAPORE: It’s been five years since Sabrina Ooi, 30, attempted suicide - and two since she penned a blog post discussing her attempt.  
The blog post, published on October 9, 2019 - one day before World Mental Health Day on October 10 - was the first time Sabrina publicly shared about that dark period in her life.
Since that fateful day in 2016, suicide has been decriminalised in Singapore after the committee reviewing the Penal Code acknowledged that treatment, rather than prosecution, was the appropriate response to people who feel they have no choice but to take their own lives. 
Sabrina has also co-founded a mental health community, Calm Collective Asia, with two friends during the “circuit breaker” period. 
While she’s been called an advocate for mental health, she prefers the term: “Mental health expert by experience”. 
“I think this advocacy thing just happened because I’m in my personal journey of processing what I’ve gone through and wanting to help others going through something similar,” she told CNA over the phone.  
Occasionally, being open about her anxiety and depression has even led to strangers pouring out their stories to her on social media. 
“Whenever I share, I go through a vulnerability hangover. It can be really tiring, but I know that sharing my story is helpful, both to others and for myself in getting clarity about my own story,” she said. 
But Sabrina noted that this candour about anxiety and depression doesn’t always extend to another mental health condition she lives with: Bipolar disorder. 
This condition causes extreme and unusual shifts in mood, energy, concentration, and activity levels that affect one’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. 
“While I've been open with talking about anxiety and depression, I'm still very careful about the term ‘bipolar disorder’ because people tend to freak out and make their own assumptions about the condition,” she said. 
“I've had friends completely wash their hands of me. They decided they didn’t really understand it and couldn’t support me in this part of my journey.”







                                    

The circuit breaker almost broke Syazwan.



Like Sabrina, 30-year-old Syazwan Rahmad, who is also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is no stranger to a fear of judgement. 
This partly stems from his own “shock” when he got the unexpected diagnosis recently, he explained, as he thought he only had depression. 
“I don’t want people to think that I’m crazy. I’m scared they don’t want to be around me because I have a disorder. Till today, I have this thought in my head,” he told CNA. 
Syazwan has since disclosed his condition to family, close friends and even to the public in a CNA Insider story that tracked the economic impact of COVID-19 on his dance career. But he admitted that he still struggles with criticism. 
“About 20 per cent respond with negative comments about my career and me as a Muslim (when I talk about my mental health). But ultimately, I’m so open because I want people to know it’s okay not to be okay. Be true to who you are and that’s where healing will start,” he said. 
SOME CONDITIONS HARDER TO DISCUSS
The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a need for more mental health support, with an increase in people calling in to mental health helplines. 
Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore saw an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019.
Likewise, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) received an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020. 
Yet, despite more people seeking help for their mental health over the past year, and the increasing awareness around conditions like anxiety or depression, other conditions remain difficult to disclose, said seven individuals who spoke to CNA. 
Some of these conditions are bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia. 
The traits of people with BPD include a feeling of emptiness, fear of abandonment, intense anger and irritability, unstable emotion, idealising and devaluing people, possible psychosis when stressed, and even binge eating, said Dr Roger Ho, an associate professor and senior consultant at the Department of Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore.

He added that there is also the possibility of physical self-harm among those with BPD, which is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). 
“Another symptom we pick up is they will cut themselves. In the emergency department, when you see someone with a lot of scars on their forearm, the patient might have BPD,” he said. 
“But society doesn't know much about BPD; they think it’s just depression. The self-laceration is a very unique sign. When you ask someone with BPD why they cut themselves, they usually don't say they want to end their life. They want to experience the emotional pain they’ve had in the past.”
Dr Ho, however, reinforced that while some people might possess the traits of BPD, having a personality disorder is more than just checking off these traits.
“Having a personality disorder means that the traits become so strong that the person has interpersonal problems. These problems affect their life, whether it’s family, work or study,” he said.  
Similarly, the stigma attached to schizophrenia - a psychotic disorder - prevails in Singapore. 
According to a 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on May 21, about one-third of the population who have been diagnosed with psychotic disorders had a diagnosis of schizophrenia at some point in their lives. This makes schizophrenia the most common psychotic disorder here. 
The results were part of the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among those living in Singapore aged 18 and above, their associated factors, and the treatment gap of the disorders. 
Despite the prevalence of schizophrenia, public understanding is lacking, with people with the condition being perceived as “dangerous or as individuals incapable of managing themselves”, said Ms Lim Lay Keow, a senior case manager at the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme at the Department of Psychosis in IMH. 
“Schizophrenia is still sensationalised by the media. The accessibility to smart phones allow for photo or video taking of a person in distress, subjecting them to be judged online.”
This behaviour, Ms Lim noted, doesn’t just make it difficult for those with schizophrenia to disclose their condition for fear of discrimination. It also results in self-stigmatisation, where the person with schizophrenia finds it difficult to “differentiate themselves from the condition”. 
The deeply entrenched stereotypes about schizophrenia also make it harder for the public to understand that schizophrenia is “not a personality flaw but a disease of the brain”, she added. 
YOUTH MORE CANDID, BUT STIGMA REMAINS
Even before the pandemic last year, younger people were increasingly open about their mental health on social media, with some talking about therapy sessions or situations where their mental health conditions might flare up.
But Ron Yap, who was diagnosed with OCD three years ago, said this conversation doesn’t translate into less stigma for all conditions. 
“While there has been more conversation for disorders like generalised anxiety disorder and depression, there’s still stigma surrounding more uncommon disorders, like OCD,” the 23-year-old said.
“Even though non-sufferers (of anxiety disorders and depression) will never experience the depths of pain and discomfort those conditions cause, they can at least get a rough, if imperfect, idea of what it’s like to suffer, by taking the times in which they experienced anxiety or sadness and amplifying the intensity and duration.” 
But with OCD, the 23-year-old said, “It’s harder to fathom how and why someone would wash their hands 50 times to the point of breaking their skin, go to the bathroom 20 times before bed or dwell on a distressing thought for a whole day to the point of paralysis.” 
To a non-sufferer, he added, such behaviour is “simply irrational, and even insane, and this impression hinders one’s ability to empathise with the sufferer”. 
Ron, who runs the Instagram account @mentalhealthceo, believes misconceptions about OCD don’t help, such as that there’s only one type of OCD “exemplified by someone who obsessively washes their hands or clothes over and over again”.
“OCD and its rituals can manifest in countless different forms. I know someone who has to eat their food in a certain order, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to consume the meal at all,” he said.

Although a huge part of Ron’s life involves breaking the stigma around mental health, he still hesitates to disclose some of the “more personal symptoms” of OCD to people around him, such as going to the bathroom multiple times. 
“I sometimes mask it by coming up with stories about why I usually spend so much time in the bathroom or through humour, especially when I don’t feel comfortable talking about my OCD in the moment or if I feel like they wouldn’t understand,” he said. 
ADDRESSING BLINDSPOTS WITH NUANCE
That said, openness about anxiety or depression doesn’t mean a lack of stigma around these conditions, experts observed. 
“From what we’ve observed, some of the challenges faced by those living with mental illness include being labelled as ‘attention seeking’ when they talk about their mental illness, or that they’re ‘overreacting’,” said Ms Jasmine Chang, a clinical psychologist at IMH.
“Even though there’s awareness around mental illnesses, admitting to having a mental illness is actually a different story.”
She added that some of her clients fear that their diagnosis might affect their employment and appraisal, while those serving National Service worry about being negatively evaluated by their peers.
With increased awareness about mental health, more nuance is now needed to take people's understanding to the next level, advised clinical psychologist Ms Chang. 
For example, there is a difference between having a couple of bad days and having prolonged periods of bad days that debilitate you and prevent you from doing anything else.
“All of us experience varying levels of sadness and anxiety. While we experience sadness and anxiety in our everyday life, depression and anxiety disorders lead to significant impairment and distress in someone’s life. It affects their ability to go to work, to sleep, and for a sustained period of time,” she said.
Public education about the diagnosis would also help, she added.
“This involves highlighting to people that mental illnesses can be managed with the right treatment and support, and those living with mental illnesses can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.” 
Besides managing symptoms, Sabrina, who has depression in addition to bipolar disorder, believes it would be better to look deeper at what causes them. 
“Usually the triggers stem from your childhood trauma, environmental triggers, and even biological factors. So it’s good that we start talking about anxiety and depression, but we need to take it a step further and understand the root cause,” she said.

And while media campaigns like Beyond the Label aim to change public perception around mental health conditions, some said labels actually help them make light of what they go through. 
Sabrina, for example, doesn’t mind that some mental health conditions are more prominent than others, because it helps her “reshape her perspective” on what she’s going through. 
“I’ve had people tell me they honestly don’t know what bipolar disorder is. And I realise I have to link it to depression or something more familiar to them for them to understand,” she said. 
“So at least the increasing awareness of anxiety and depression has helped me talk about my condition.”

Many in the community are deeply troubled and have voiced their concerns, wanting to see quick action taken to find the suspect.
This is unfortunately not the first time Singapore has seen serial cruelty enacted against cats. Some of the past perpetrators have been prosecuted, while other cases involving multiple injured cats remain unsolved.
COMMUNITY CATS ARE PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENT 
These cats are in our communities through no fault of their own. Many have been abandoned or are descendants of abandoned cats.
There are extensive efforts by numerous organisations and countless individuals to humanely manage and reduce the cat population in Singapore. This is done via surgical sterilisation of the cats so they can no longer reproduce and the provision of dedicated care for the animals while they live out their lives.
The act of feeding sterilised cats does not increase the cat population. It is thus unfair to blame feeders for the presence of the cats. Many a time, when someone complains, there are also efforts to understand their frustrations through mediation so that a compromise can be reached.
We know of many feeders who have moved their feeding sites or adjusted their feeding schedules so as to minimise any potential nuisance.
Cats are part of our built-up environment and live comfortably alongside humans. Many dedicated caregivers contribute immensely to their care.
We have heard many stories of neighbours coming together to care for the cats, developing lifelong friendships and connections in the process.
Affinity or not, we have to learn to co-exist with the animals around us.
WE CAN’T ACCEPT ANIMAL CRUELTY 
Animal cruelty has no place in our society and nobody should want to see a sentient being experience unnecessary pain or suffering.
Of course, even if one thinks that an animal is a nuisance, there is just no excuse for violence. Just as there would be no excuse to commit a crime against a person because they have bothered another.

This reason alone should be sufficient to cause us great concern and spur fast and strong action in animal cruelty cases. Thankfully we see many people speaking up when a case makes the news, giving us hope that we have a significant part of our society that rejects animal abuse.
If we needed another reason to be concerned, it is that studies have long found a link between animal cruelty and violence towards humans. Leaving animal abuse unpunished and otherwise not dealt with, be it in a treatment or correctional facility, may place the people in a society in danger too.
The injuries found on the cats in Ang Mo Kio reflect a determined, intentional, and committed pattern to inflict suffering on the animals. The intentional and cruel nature of the abuse and the hunting of multiple cats to commit the violence is disconcerting.
This should thus concern all of us.
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ABUSE
There could be a number of reasons why people commit cruelty to an innocent being, though we have to accept that we might never fully understand the motivations.
In some of these cases, human mental illness may play a part. In 2006 and 2007, a serial cat abuser in Bedok who had tortured multiple cats by strangling them was reported to have been diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder. In 2016, a man suffocated and then stabbed his pet dog to death. He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and given a 12-month mandatory treatment order.

In other cases, the person may enjoy control over another being or be taking out their frustrations on an animal that cannot retaliate. Individuals may also displace their aggression from a human to an animal, or use cruelty as a means to threaten someone.
In 2020, a man was charged with animal cruelty for killing a kitten during an argument with his wife. He flung the animal against a cupboard and then picked it up and told his wife, “Look at this because of you”. He then flung the animal on the floor and said to his wife, “If I can do this (to the cat), you I don’t care”. He later threw the kitten down the rubbish chute.
On social media, we also see cases where people post videos that they think are entertaining, seemingly trying to attract attention and obtain “likes” and “shares”. Last year, a series of videos went viral in which youth were seen abusing frogs.
Profit has also driven some to commit horrendous acts of cruelty. “Crush” videos where people are seen literally crushing animals to death surface every now and then. These videos, associated with sexual fetishes, are produced overseas for an underground international market.
When it comes to community cats, it is also possible that abuse stems from a dislike or hatred of having these animals around.
It is not uncommon for us to hear of cases where community cat caregivers have been verbally abused by individuals who have asked them to stop feeding the cats. In some of these cases, the individuals have threatened to hurt the cats if the feeding doesn’t stop.
WE NEED TO DO BETTER
Regardless of the reason for the abuse, animals rely on us to be their voices and advocates and this places a heavy responsibility on our shoulders.
Cruelty cases need to be solved faster so that more animals are not harmed. In the 2006 and 2007 Bedok case mentioned above, the community mobilised in a big way and it was through their efforts of patrols and constant monitoring that the case was solved and the perpetrator brought to justice.

Today, with a wide CCTV network and other tools available to enforcement agencies, such cases should be solved much more quickly, similar to how fast many other cases involving crimes against humans are solved.
If this means we need to put more resources towards animal cruelty investigations, such as more manpower or the use of technology and forensics, then this should be done.  
The cats in Ang Mo Kio and the other animals in our midst deserve better.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-singapore-mental-health-hotline-resource-14899148,Commentary: Worries over COVID-19 situation are taking a mental toll on Singapore - CNA,30/05/2021,"SINGAPORE: “It feels like deja vu,” a young community worker said, a day after the tightened measures for Phase 2 came into effect.
He remembers the stress and manic scramble to support children living in rental flats and transitional shelters for home-based learning. He recalls helping migrant workers with food and essential items during the outbreak in the dormitories at the onset of circuit breaker last year.
Just 10 days later, two friends with home-based businesses reliant on clients coming to their homes experienced heart palpitations following the announcement of the two-person cap as part of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).
They are not alone in feeling nervous about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. Calls to some mental health hotlines saw a spike on Sunday (May 16), the first day of the latest phase of COVID-19 restrictions, executives who run these hotlines tell me.
COVID-19 HAS TAKEN AN EMOTIONAL TOLL ON US
Psychologists have pointed out how stressors released over the uncertainty over livelihoods, routines and catching a deadly virus have created a sense of constant danger and exerted an emotional toll on us.
After a year of dealing with a raging pandemic, we have seen signs of increased stress and worry, even when Singapore was doing well in curbing infection numbers. More than nine in 10 Singaporeans (91 per cent) have said that their mental health has declined in the last year, according to a study by AIA last month.
The sources are multifold. In the #AreWeOkay poll by SG Mental Health Matters conducted between March and April, 51.2 per cent of respondents said the restrictions on social activities and interactions have negatively impacted their mental health. Forty-four per cent said that changes to work and school had a similar effect.

As cases ticked up in recent weeks, fuelling calls for a clean circuit breaker to be pulled, I would argue we should be careful not to do so lightly, not without preparing for the mental health support needed.
After all, during the circuit breaker last year, the Samaritans of Singapore received over 10,000 calls in distress, a 36 per cent increase.
Over the same period, the non-profit organisation Caregivers’ Alliance supported 11 caregivers, of which six had lost their loved ones to suicide and the remaining five struggling with family members attempting suicide.
(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.)

MANY INITIATIVES SPRINGING UP OVER PAST YEAR
People focus on the financial costs and risk of deep economic scarring when restrictions slow recovery.
Just as important but less talked about is the price of loneliness and social withdrawal, domestic violence and unresolved grief, not to mention work-from-home stress and the helplessness over an uncertain, volatile future.
There are baby steps to build resilience and support people as this coronavirus persists and should additional restrictions be required. Many government-led and community initiatives have sprung up.
A National Care Hotline was set up in April last year manned by officers trained to provide mental health first aid and refer cases to public healthcare institutions and community service providers to follow up if necessary. These benefitted 30,000 calls as of October 2020.
The Ministry of Social & Family Development also recently launched a 24-hour National Anti-Violence Helpline for the public to report cases of family violence, abuse and neglect.
It is also heartening to see targeted efforts to aid specific groups, like the Seniors Go Digital Programme to help seniors connect online with friends, family and government services.

There is also a budding recognition that workplaces must step up where the stressors can come from work. More employers, like the CEOs and leaders I work with at the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, have accelerated plans for employee mental well-being including work-from-home support programmes in the last year.
THE BIG CHALLENGES FOR MENTAL HEALTH
Yet let’s be clear about the enormity of the mental health challenges that lie head.
While we are better prepared for a second circuit breaker, we carry more baggage picked up from a year of economic uncertainty, pandemic fatigue and the emotional roller-coaster of on-off restriction measures.
The mental health divide has also widened, as pandemic measures have a greater impact on segments requiring more attention.
Blue-collar workers and low-income individuals were the hardest hit by the circuit breaker. Incomes at the 20th percentile fell 4.5 per cent in June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, according to the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Force report.
Last year’s circuit breaker also shone the spotlight on isolation’s ill effects - on victims of family violence trapped with abusers, migrant workers confined to dorms and foreign domestic workers with little space away from their employers.
Would people also know how to find help? Less than one in three (29.7 per cent) of respondents to the #AreWeOkay knew how to seek out subsidised mental healthcare.
REFRAMING THE CONVERSATIONS OVER MENTAL HEALTH
Updates given by the COVID-19 Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) have rightly been focused on the number and breakdown of infections, the ensuing control measures and economic relief support for those affected.
Yet let’s also hope that each MTF incorporates an update on mental health strategies included into our pandemic management approach and provide reminders on the mental health support resources available, as much as reminders to see the doctor if unwell or take a swab test if one has been to an area of infections have become commonplace.
“What gets measured gets done” is a maxim that should apply to the rate of infections as much as rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental health issues from this pandemic, an urgent call also made by psychiatrists and psychologists in The Lancet.
The Government had promised a whole-of-government review of all mental health policies in the Budget 2020 parliamentary debates, an inter-agency mental health task force has been set up last October and three new priorities were announced during the Budget this year. Yet more needs to be done urgently, including improving accessibility, affordability and quality of mental healthcare.
Here is also where our national leaders could show compassion to acknowledge the dread and apprehension among those who have been quarantined or received a notification of possible exposure on their TraceTogether app.
Leaders can also demonstrate sensitivity to people’s concerns and needs.
Each day’s updates brings a sense of fear reflecting uncertainties around elderly relatives who live away by themselves, employment, healthcare and family care for many - even if others may just merely let out another collective sigh and move on.
The trauma experienced from COVID-19 also gets repeated in varying degrees with every announcement of more clusters and each round of new restrictions.
This persistent COVID-19 crisis is equally a mental health crisis. Not all of us get infected by the virus but all of us are affected by the mental health impact of the pandemic.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/lady-wearing-mask-people-with-strange-behaviour-mentally-ill-14882128,"Commentary: When we call people with strange behaviour mentally ill, we reinforce mental health stigma  - CNA",28/05/2021,"SINGAPORE: There was a silver lining amid the grey cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.
Much was reported about how working from home frankly made it hard to separate work from life, causing more burnout among employees. 
In our private circles, it became increasingly common for friends to share refreshingly honest confessions about having bouts of anxiety and a general sense of ennui. 
There has been much forthright talk of collective pandemic fatigue and acceptance that such commonplace challenges should lead us to cut each other some slack. 
Blindsided by a pandemic that changed life as we knew it to be, and the loss of lives and livelihoods globally, we struggled to cope - but that struggle saw a beneficial rise in mental health awareness. 
The resulting, urgent focus on mental health felt like a tiny but significant win.  
(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.)

THEN SOME INCIDENTS HAPPENED
Yet, two videos that went viral on social media this year suggest we may still have some way to go in understanding and talking about mental health. 
The first offensive clip was a woman making race-related comments on the MRT, where she asked commuters about their race. When a commuter responded she was Malay, the woman said, “Malay, is it? Okay, no wonder.” 
Later in the video, she added that she would “never mix around with you guys because you are so different”. 
The second and more recent video featured a woman without a mask in Marina Bay Sands. When a safe distancing ambassador asked her to put on her mask, she refused and asked instead for the ambassador’s credentials. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
In both incidents, several online commenters called these women  “crazy”, “with a hole in the brain” and “confirm mentally ill”. 
The actions in the videos were problematic, but these comments left an even more bitter aftertaste.
MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT A PUNCHLINE
While some commenters explicitly mocked them, others seemed to have jumped the gun to assume these women had mental illness and urged others to understand. 
Either way, such assumptions seem to reinforce the dated stereotype that those with mental illness would necessarily behave in “crazy” ways, and cannot be taken seriously - a fundamental reason for the prevailing stigma around mental illness. 
“I still believe there’s a portion of Singaporeans who are not well-versed or have limited knowledge of mental health. That’s why they’re making such comments,” Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore) said to me. 
She cautioned against knee-jerk reactions to label others. “Some people might have unpleasant encounters, and they might draw conclusions based on those encounters. They have not attended any talks or workshops or learnt much about mental health issues.”  
The comments also implied that mental illness must have caused their disruptive behaviour caught on camera. 
Yet, psychologists have often pointed out that the symptoms of mental health conditions are more varied, sometimes subtle but serious for the patient - like decreased motivation, poor appetite and fatigue.
“Many mental health organisations have been working hard to collaborate with the media to raise awareness. It is a setback every time we come across such negative comments,” added Ms Poh. 
If all this sounds familiar, recall the case of a woman in Shunfu Market who refused to wear a mask last year, because she was “a sovereign”. The circulating video captured her in a heated argument, and commenters were quick to assume that she, too, had an underlying mental health condition. 
She was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks with no mental disorder found, and recently sentenced to two weeks jail and a $2,000 fine. 
Judging by similar reactions to that case a year ago, it seems more awareness has not translated to less stigma. 
SO WHEN DOES MENTAL ILLNESS FACTOR IN?
Thankfully, this complex relationship between criminality and mental illness deserving of delicate, careful treatment is one our courts have recognised. 
In fact, the criminal justice system in Singapore has a system for situations where criminals potentially have a mental health condition. It enlists the professional advice of psychiatrists in deciding the extent to which a mental health condition plays a role.
“Doctors will make an initial assessment on several things. One, what type of psychiatric condition this person has. Two, whether the conditions have anything to do with the offence. And three, does the psychiatric condition allow for this person to understand his plea,” Mr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said. 
“There are cases where someone’s condition is so advanced or debilitating that they might not understand the nature of the offence or the consequences of his actions.” On the other hand, some might be fit to plead, but still have some form of psychosis, he added. 
The law takes into account nuances in judgment and sentencing. In less straightforward cases, two people might have the same condition but behave differently, while another two might have a different psychosis yet behave the same way.
“Everyone is an individual, so how psychosis affects them is also individualistic. The psychiatrist will make an assessment whether the psychosis affected the ability to make judgement, whether he fully understands the consequences of his act, and whether he’s unable to control his behaviour,” Mr Nathan said.  
“As a defence lawyer, we’re relying on someone’s psychosis to mitigate a sentence or explain someone’s actions, so we have to show the court that there is a causal link between the condition and the offence,” he added.
For example, a shoplifter with a history of kleptomania would have their condition taken into consideration during sentencing, because kleptomania affects decision-making and has a “direct causal link” to shoplifting, he shared. 
EVERYDAY ACTIONS MATTER
Our laws recognise how anyone living with a mental health condition deserves a closer look based on their unique circumstances and health.

Yet our mindsets continue to assume some level of uniformity of people living with mental health conditions - as a group of unpredictable individuals who cause harm, are prone to law-breaking and should be isolated far away from society.
For people who struggle with mental health or live with mental illnesses, these comments are a sobering reminder that just because they have found the courage to seek help and speak about their condition does not mean the stigma no longer exists. 
For all those who think words have little consequences, think again. One in eight in the Singapore resident population have experienced a mental disorder, according to the Singapore Mental Health study 2010. 
The same study initiated in 2016 saw an increase to one in seven. 
Your friends or family who are secretly fighting difficult, personal battles might see such comments including yours - and in worst case scenarios, conclude that they have one less person in their corner who they can share their struggles with.  
Ultimately, no amount of mental health awareness campaigns or policies can override our daily words and actions. 
Campaigns and policies might enact widespread shifts within systems, but everyday action is how we ensure the change needed in our mindsets is deep-rooted and authentic that go beyond lip service.
And perhaps, we can start by refraining from calling people “crazy” or “confirm mental illness”.
Otherwise, this COVID-19 silver lining can very quickly turn grey.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-covid-cases-phase-2-gyms-closed-reopen-outdoor-fitness-14762146,Commentary: Three weeks of gym closure shouldn’t be a big deal but it is for many - CNA,08/05/2021,"SINGAPORE: I hated going to the gym, until it became my safe space over the last six months of the pandemic.
Up till my late-twenties, I equated exercise with toxic gym culture, no thanks to the slew of gym bros and fitness influencers who humble-bragged about their physique any chance they could. No way could anyone look like Adonis reincarnate so effortlessly, as they seemingly could, which intimidated regular plebeians like myself. 
Even when I finally convinced myself to give it a shot and got a gym membership, working out felt performative and obnoxious, as though a lean and fit physical appearance was a reflection that I could indeed be the proverbial woman who had it all.
Not to mention, standing out as one of the few women in a testosterone-filled space in most gyms, made it an unbearably self-conscious hour. 
Then COVID-19 hit and my relationship with gyms changed. 
With all routine and structure thrown out the window during the circuit breaker, I didn’t have anything more to lose. I needed to reintegrate those elements of order into my life through the quickest way I knew  — exercise. 
After several outdoor exercise sessions, like running along the park connectors and playing sports with friends, I realised I preferred individual workouts. I could zone out without interacting.

When gyms resumed operations in Phase 2 last year, I decided to set aside my reservations about gym culture, while I used physical activity to get my mental health back on track. And so the gym became a regular haunt. 
I figured I also needed the strength and conditioning training I could do in a gym with the equipment, and could make better use out of my hour-long exercise sessions. 
I’d been to a couple of gyms in the past where I felt safe and comfortable, so finding another similar space that met my location and budget criteria, and had a culture I appreciated, wasn't impossible.

I developed a routine of four gym visits a week — a habit I was really getting fond of until the Government announced tightened COVID-19 measures on Tuesday (May 4).  
Under the tightened measures, indoor gyms like mine will be closed from May 8 to May 30, as they have a “tendency to be hotspots for COVID-19 transmission”, said the Health Ministry. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
It might be just for three weeks and it’s a reasonable restriction as we hunker down to curb the rise in infections. But understanding why gyms need to close didn’t stop me from feeling like I’d been walloped by a new wave of uncertainty after I’d just found my footing.   
A SEMBLANCE OF CERTAINTY 
Admittedly I’m painfully slower than the average person at adapting to change. 
For at least half a year after the pandemic began, I spent most days languishing at home. Adam Grant, best-selling author and organisational psychologist, described languishing as an experience that’s neither burnout nor depression, but nonetheless feels “somewhat joyless and aimless”. 
“Languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness. It feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield,” he wrote in a New York Times article. 
But after more than a year of not knowing when we could return to the office regularly, stop wearing masks, or travel again without the fear of disease, I rediscovered a semblance of certainty within the confines of an indoor gym. 
At the gym, I knew which weights I wanted to lift and machines I wanted to use. I could plan for a certain number of reps in a fixed amount of sets. I even figured out the timings when the gym was emptier, so I could take my time with every equipment. 
Since the pandemic began, our linear concept of time has been warped. Living in limbo, between the “Old Normal” and the “New Normal”, a month sometimes felt like a week, and other times, like a decade. 
But in the gym, time was measured in sets. An hour meant a 20-minute run, followed by six sets of 10 to 15 reps, while half an hour meant cutting out my treadmill run. 
There was a sense of rhythm and autonomy in my life again. A toned body was just a bonus. 
Looking after my physical health also saved my mental health. 
WORKING OUT AT HOME NOT THE SAME
Naysayers might wonder why not save the money and workout at home. It’s also probably more hygienic than sharing gym equipment with many other sweaty bodies. 
Just before the circuit breaker kicked in last year, there were photos on social media of long queues and empty shelves at Decathlon. This sparked memes mocking people who seemed to build their personality around going to the gym, a comparatively superficial concern in a pandemic.

At the risk of sounding excessively fussy, working out at home isn’t the same — even if you have a Peloton, yoga mat, a set of weights, a pair of overpriced tights, and Chloe Ting’s abs challenge on loop. 
Working out in the gym isn’t just about having the right equipment. Having a different, dedicated space matters as much. Humans are probably not meant to work, eat, sleep, exercise and live in one space.
There is also an unspoken comfort in seeing familiar faces in the gym, even if we never speak. For someone who doesn’t want to interact when I’m working out, I appreciate not being isolated at home or exercising alone in public.
I’ve found this quiet camaraderie in a gym to be a pleasant compromise.
Having the presence of a like-minded community also surprisingly motivated me and held me accountable on days I was tempted to slack off. 
The next three weeks won’t be enough time to carve out a new routine lest we can’t return to the gym in June. But a year of living under the pandemic has taught me that even the best laid plans can be upended by a pesky virus.
If I could learn to love the gym, maybe I can learn to embrace uncertainty, adapt to change and even workout to a chirpy Blogilates YouTube video at home. 
It will just take a lot more than three weeks.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/grief-mental-health-covid-19-pandemic-workers-wellness-13897940,Commentary: Grief from losing loved ones to COVID-19 will spill into workplaces  - CNA,07/05/2021,"DENVER, Colorado: The death, human suffering, and loss stemming from COVID-19 is unprecedented in living memory and may have caused unresolved grief.
For those who have lost loved ones, there may be no ceremonies to say final goodbyes and no grieving together.
When the scale of the devastation reaches heights that make mass burials a logistical necessity, like in India, the pain can be profound.
The pandemic is also fuelling personal losses of all kinds—postponed weddings, missed graduations, painful separations from family and friends, laid-off or furloughed colleagues, shuttered offices. In Singapore, the return to Phase 2 has been welcomed in tackling fears of another new wave, but the announcement has been accompanied by disquiet. Didn’t we conquer COVID-19 last year?
These developments can create a lingering sense of grief that seeps into the workplace. If unaddressed, it can harm a leader’s effectiveness and may become debilitating if unaddressed.
In our work over two decades with the International Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) High Performance Leadership programme, we have been surprised by how pervasive unresolved grief can be - affecting fully one-third of the 7,000 plus executives we’ve worked with - how likely it is that the symptoms go unnoticed or undiscussed, and how ill-equipped organisations are to handle it.
At work, a missed promotion, losing a key customer or client, the end of a project or the disbanding of a team, the retirement of a beloved colleague or boss can all spark feelings of grief that include shock, anger, sadness, and fear. Some of these trigger events have been exacerbated during the pandemic.
Our research shows that the pre-pandemic financial cost of grief to organisations appears high: US$75 billion a year for US companies, according to one study.
Yet, the loss of leadership capability and potential that results from unresolved grief, as well as the human suffering and pain, is beyond measure.
(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem"" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)
 
THE COST OF GRIEF
In the case of Sam, a business-unit leader in a large global company, the guilt and pain associated with his mother’s death from COVID-19 and the fact that Sam missed his chance to say goodbye, as he lived in another country and could not get permission to travel in time, morphed into a dull, generalised anger that he directed against his company and its people.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
He subconsciously blamed work for stopping his relationship with his mother in her final months. Sam had been a star, but after his mother’s death he failed to step up even when he was handpicked to lead an initiative by the company’s global leadership.
Sam’s own leadership suffered - he was less inspiring and more withdrawn, while under the surface, he burned with resentment.
Even more common during the pandemic have been “ceremonial losses” – the inability to attend landmark life events like births, graduations, weddings and funerals. It is not simply the loss of the events themselves, but the lost opportunities to create memories individuals and families would honour for life. These losses have compounded social isolation during this period.
Leaders often fail to recognise that they carry these burdens. Their organisations are ill-equipped to manage the challenge. It looks like we still expect people to leave their emotions at the door when they enter the workplace.









The focus of support for workplace grief has generally been helping colleagues after the death of an employee. Yet many sources of loss and grief are different.
A recent study of former Lehman Brothers bankers found that after the company collapsed in 2008, many employees went through all the feelings we associate with grief. As one employee described: “I felt I lost one of my beloved . . . even though it might sound [dramatic], still, when I think about those days, I feel I was in a sort of funeral.”
A CEO we know revealed the depth of his shock and feelings of loss just hours after the news that his beloved organisation had been acquired, when he asked plaintively, “What do I tell my family?” as he had lost his sense of attachment, territory, structure, and control—central aspects of his very identity.
Similarly, during COVID-19 there has been great disruption to industries, jobs and the way we work. How many organisations recognise the grief this may have caused their employees, including leaders, and are taking steps to resolve them?
BECOME AWARE AND ACCEPTING REALITY
Leaders who want to overcome grief must pass through a three-stage process: Becoming consciously aware of the problem, accepting the pain of the loss and, finally, taking actions that help them let go of the past and find new meaning from the experience.
Awareness is the first step to resolving any problem, but our subconscious minds are great at keeping us safely unaware of things that might harm us emotionally.
We have found that executives with unresolved grief are seldom able to connect the dots between their past trauma and present behaviour.
In Sam’s case, the grief associated with his mother’s death was fresh and top of mind. It wrecked his emotional state. What Sam hadn’t seen was the toll on his behaviour and how much it was diminishing his ability—and indeed his willingness—to lead.
For Sam, as with many executives we’ve worked with, it was this combination of connecting the dots and counting the cost of his unresolved grief that proved a breakthrough.







                                    

""Meaning comes through finding a way to sustain your love for the person after their death while you’re moving forward with your life,"" wrote a grief expert. (Photo: Unsplash/Milada Vigerova)



Awareness reflects knowledge of reality, but acceptance requires an act of will.
We have been surprised to see how otherwise rational human beings persist in irrational denial. However, confronting such raw emotions can be especially challenging for senior executives.
Expressing emotion means making yourself vulnerable. Leaders often resist this as they worry it could undercut their status within their teams. In fact, the opposite is true: Leaders who demonstrate vulnerability perform better and have more loyal and engaged teams.
RECONSTRUCT YOUR MEMORY
Scientific research shows that acceptance alone doesn’t bring an end to grieving. To truly move on, an individual must find a way to create personal meaning from the loss.
Grief expert David Kessler’s work in repositioning grief describes this process.
It begins by raising the loss - and the narrative embedded in it - to one’s conscious emotional experience.
We then juxtapose that narrative with a new one that directly confronts the memory with a new possibility - the “mismatch,” in this case - and repeat this multiple times to help the brain reorganise the old memory and experience it in a new way.
Organisations can help turn grief around. Leadership teams can start by setting the right tone. Leaders who open themselves to those around them inspire openness and signal an availability and warmth that draws others out.
Senior executives should also prompt difficult conversations about grief at times when the source of grief is obvious - and even when it’s not so obvious, such as during a strategic restructuring or an abrupt leadership transition.
Organisational cultures should also have their own rituals, which can send powerful signals of recovery and transformation.

Japanese organisations are known for their rituals when there are senior-leadership transitions, and help staffers get over failed experiments by celebrating their boldness with food, drinks and reflections on what was learned.
Unresolved grief is a quietly destructive force that derails leaders and hurts organisations during the best of times. And these aren’t the best of times.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-silver-ribbon-employers-award-14741218,12 companies recognised for ‘exemplary efforts’ to promote mental health at work - CNA,04/05/2021,"SINGAPORE: Twelve employers were given awards for creating mentally friendly and healthy working environments by mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore), on Tuesday (May 4).
The employers are Bizlink Centre Singapore Ltd, FedEx Express, Jardines MINDSET, Jebsen & Jessen Group, Johnson & Johnson Singapore, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Pocari Sweat Singapore, Project X, PSA Corporation Limited, Rio Tinto, Singapore Civil Defence Force and Twitter Asia Pacific.
They were commended for promoting positive mental health awareness in their workplace, offering job opportunities to persons with mental health issues, commemorating World Mental Health Day, equipping their staff with knowledge on identifying mental health issues, and providing accommodation for staff with mental health issues.  
“(The award winners have made) exemplary efforts in championing mental wellbeing in their workplaces ... This is especially timely, given the rising awareness of mental wellbeing at workplaces,” said Zaqy Mohamad, Senior Minister of State for Manpower and guest-of-honour at the event.
“Mental health is just as important as physical health and it can have a significant impact on workers' productivity.”
WORKPLACE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE PANDEMIC 
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 264 million people suffer from depression globally, with many of these people also experiencing symptoms of anxiety, said Ellen Lee, president of Silver Ribbon.
She added that a negative working environment can worsen these mental health problems, leading to physical health issues, harmful use of substances or alcohol, absenteeism, and lost productivity.  
Working arrangements under the COVID-19 pandemic have resurfaced the importance of looking after employees’ mental wellbeing.
In an online survey conducted by Silver Ribbon in April last year, one in four experienced “low mood, anxiety and loneliness more than usual”, said Ms Lee.
Clients who attended Silver Ribbon’s complimentary online emotional support shared that they felt “stressed out while working from home, handling household chores and taking care of their loved ones”, she added.
Employers also said that their employees requested Silver Ribbon’s assistance to handle crises and conduct talks for them.
WALKING THE TALK 
Beyond seeking help from Silver Ribbon, employers who received the award have their own mental wellbeing initiatives.

At Rio Tinto, a global mining company, leaders and employees get mental health training to recognise “psychosocial hazards”, so they can notice a problem and extend help before it develops, said Karina Gistelinck, vice president for minerals sales and marketing.
The company also has peer support programmes with “specially-trained” employees playing a pivotal role to support fellow colleagues, as those who are in distress are “more likely to reach out to friends and colleagues than to use more formal support programmes”, she added.
In the company’s Singapore office, Rio Tinto has an Employee Assistance Programme that makes it easier for colleagues and their families to access professional psychologists for help.

Similarly at Jardines MINDSET, employees are encouraged to use their 24-hour anonymous counselling service.
Managers and HR personnel are also trained in “mental health first-aid”, while managers are encouraged to “exercise discretion” in giving team members time off due to mental health related issues, said Jeffery Tan, CEO of Jardines MINDSET.
“During these scenarios, it might be difficult for employees to produce an MC (medical certificate), but this shouldn’t stop them from getting a day off. We want to build a safe environment for our employees to speak openly about their troubles and ask for help when necessary,” added Mr Tan.
GOOD MENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD BUSINESS SENSE 
Aside from boosting morale, mental health initiatives in the workplace can help the company’s bottom line.  
“According to WHO, every $1 put into scaled up treatment for common mental disorders, there is a return-on-investment of $4 in improved health and productivity,” said Mr Tan.
“An inclusive and safe workplace culture boosts employee morale, and creates a workplace employees are happy with and thus more inclined to remain at.”
While there is “no magic bullet” for workplace mental health, Mr Tan said a large part of mental wellbeing comes down to “creating more human-centered work cultures that put employees first”.
Hiring people with mental health conditions is even part of business strategy at companies like Bizlink Centre.
“Once (these employees) adapt and perform, they bring stability to the workforce. They tend to be committed to delivering the requirements in their job role and could bring a positive mindset and resilience to the workforce,” said Ang Li May, CEO of Bizlink Centre.
“What is typically required is bringing them through a structured process, which also helps the organisation put in place better SOPs and have more structure to their processes.”

But to promote better mental health at work, companies like the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) recognise that stigma against mental health issues in the workplace is a societal issue.
“For too long, mental health issues were seen as character flaws that derailed careers. It’s not just companies that held these views; societies did too, and sadly some still do. But mental health issues don’t define anyone any more than a broken leg does,” said Mr Victor Mills, Chief Executive of SICC, which hopes to encourage more companies to promote mental wellness.
To treat mental illness in the workforce, Mr Mills added that companies should begin with “eliminating possible stress triggers”.
“Toxic managers should be held accountable and sent for help. Root out purposeless meetings. Don’t call your colleagues after office hours, and certainly not on weekends, unless it’s an emergency. Don’t expect colleagues to respond to an email at some ungodly hour. And don’t treat mental health issues as weaknesses.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/body-dysmorphia-vanity-obsession-mental-health-treatment-14664166,Commentary: It is not vanity when you are obsessed about how you look - CNA,04/05/2021,"SINGAPORE: With the ceaseless bombardment of what is beauty – from skin, hair, clothes and weight – it is no wonder that the global beauty industry is worth US$532 billion (S$706 billion). 
But what is an acceptable quest to look and feel good and when does it spill over into something that becomes a serious mental health challenge?
This can be illustrated with the type of clients I see.
I first met with Joseph*, a soft-spoken young man with handsome features just like a Korean celebrity, when he was brought to our hospital’s emergency services after an attempt to end his life.
He had undergone multiple cosmetic surgery procedures overseas but yet would be stuck in front of a mirror for several hours watching the “monster” in the reflection.
Joseph believed that his appearance was so marred by his ugliness that he was unable to interact with other people, and would put his hands over his face to hide. “Unless my parents allow me to go for the cosmetic surgery, there is no meaning to my life,” he had said. 
MORE THAN JUST LOOKING GOOD
Body Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a disabling mental health condition characterised by obsessive ideas that one’s own appearance is severely flawed. People with BDD are often perceived by others as being infatuated with vanity or discontented with their physical appearance.
It causes individuals to engage in repetitive or time-consuming behaviours to check, hide, or fix their appearance so as to alleviate distress.
In short, like Joseph, nothing is ever good enough and there are constant feelings of inadequacies.

It is unfortunate that individuals with this condition are believed to be desperately trying to impress others - they seek validation and hope for flattering comments about their own physical appeal. This lack of understanding of the condition may create feelings of shame on the part of BDD sufferers about disclosing their symptoms to other people or seeking help.
BDD is estimated to affect about 2 per cent of adolescents and adults worldwide, and this figure may be underreported. At present, there has been no full-scale study of the disorder in Singapore, but a preliminary study by the National University of Singapore suggests a similar proportion here.
It should be noted, however, that not everyone who seeks cosmetic surgery suffers from BDD.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Although the exact causes of BDD are debatable, studies suggest a combination of different factors, including environmental and biological reasons.
The condition seems to develop in people who are extremely self-conscious and self-focused, who may have been teased or bullied in their childhood or adolescent years and who were unable to overcome it then.
Sociocultural factors such as the emphasis on looking attractive and possibly certain personality traits – for example,  perfectionism - may also play a role, with neuroscience research pointing to differences in brain function relating to the processing of visual and perceptual information in them.
To put it simply, people with BDD tend to over-focus on details, but are not able to process visual information in a holistic manner or to see the big picture. 
CHARACTERISTICS AND CONSEQUENCES
Typically, the onset of the disorder starts in adolescence, before the age of 18. BDD can affect both men and women, although about 40 per cent of sufferers are men and 60 per cent women.
Women tend to report more severe symptoms, and usually have more areas of concern, such as skin imperfections and hair or facial features. Men are often more preoccupied with their build or muscle tone. 
However, few people with BDD in Singapore seek help because many are unaware of the disorder and most sufferers tend to have limited insight into their condition, and think of it as a physical problem.
Because of the belief that their issues are physical in nature, it is unfortunate that most people tend to consult aesthetic practitioners rather than mental health professionals.
Without treatment, BDD can cause substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning, and its impact can leave those who have the condition in severe emotional distress. Evidence from global studies has found that 70 per cent of people with BDD suffer from co-morbid depression.
Turning frequently to cosmetic surgery to find a quick fix solution to their problem, BDD sufferers either camouflage a perceived defect or try to achieve an unrealistic ideal. Many still feel dissatisfied after multiple cosmetic interventions and this can lead to their social isolation.
All these factors may accentuate anxieties, exacerbating the symptoms of their BDD, along with feelings of anger, despair and hopelessness. Many end up loathing themselves for being so vain and self-obsessed.
More than 60 per cent have reported having suicidal thoughts, and around 24 per cent to 28 per cent of cases have attempted suicide.

In the case of Tammie*, she hated how her eyebrows looked and would spend hours on her eyebrows each day - drawing, then wiping them off and redrawing them again. When they did not look symmetrical or the right shape, she would burst into tears of frustration and continue her attempt to “perfect” the shape of her eyebrows. 
As she felt ugly, hideous and alienated, she did not want to leave her room or be seen by anyone, even her own family. As a result of this, she had trouble going to classes and stopped hanging out with her friends. She became socially isolated and depressed.
BDD affects not just the person, but their family or friends as well. Families who have loved ones with BDD may find themselves burdened financially and psychologically when caring for them.
They may end up paying for their cosmetic procedures, feel paralysed to help as their loved ones refuse psychological treatment, or even change their family’s way of doing things so as to accommodate the person’s worries.  
It can be excruciating for family members to witness their loved ones suffering from this condition. Family members may experience emotions ranging from fear, to anger, to sadness and profound frustration.
Some families may also have to deal with their loved ones’ frequently aggressive behaviour, fuelled by an inability to fix their perceived defects or, as they imagine, the sense of rejection by their friends or other people.IT WILL NOT GO AWAY BUT CAN BE MANAGED
The support and understanding of family members and friends, and the willingness of the person to seek help as early as possible, are both critical for better outcomes.
One of the evidence-based treatments for BDD is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) – a form of therapy that challenges patients to reframe their unhelpful, negative thoughts about their appearance. 
It also teaches them to refrain from repetitive compulsive behaviours, and encourages them to face their feared situations in a gradual manner.
Through the use of mirrors, patients are also trained to see their entire body rather than just focusing on the disliked details, and to describe themselves in non-judgemental ways.
Family education and involvement is highly beneficial, not only for the patient’s recovery but also for the family’s functioning as a whole.
Tammie’s family was able to express their concerns to her and give her their support in encouraging her to seek help, after they saw a negative change in behaviour at home and in school.
Besides receiving support and encouragement in the recovery process, the person's motivation to change is equally important too. BDD is unlikely to go away by itself. However, with treatment and the right support, the condition can be managed and even improve.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hybrid-working-remote-work-from-home-laws-policies-mom-safety-14635054,Commentary: Hybrid working may change contractual terms and conditions for employees - CNA,19/04/2021,"SINGAPORE: Certain countries, such as the Netherlands, have had a head start in putting in place hybrid working legislation, well before COVID-19 brought homeworking to the forefront, to protect the interests of both the employer and its employees. 
Such legislation typically regulates flexible working arrangements including working hours, working times and places of work. 
Employers may deny requests for flexible working for compelling business interests such as security issues, work schedules or financial and organisational problems.
Such legislation is also intended to ensure that there is no discrimination against those who opt to work from home to overcome the traditional social stigma surrounding those who work from home. 
This is critical to ensure that equal rights and opportunities are afforded to those opt to work from home.
In Singapore, employers are seriously considering such a hybrid model of working as the way forward. For many, this could mean working from home for part of the week and working in the office the rest of the time.
Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah's exhortation to employers to consider offering staff a hybrid work arrangement beyond COVID-19 to allow them to attend to elderly parents or young children, has also been met with broad support and approval.
Banks like DBS Group, Citigroup Inc and Mizuho Financial Holdings News, for example, are paring down office space as they transition to hybrid work - showing that the decentralisation is here to stay, especially given the trend of rapid digitalisation.
Can employers keep up with these changes from a legal perspective however and how will that impact employees?
PHYSICAL WELL-BEING AND SAFETY
According to Singapore’s labour laws, employers bear the burden of ensuring a safe workplace. But how are employers meant to protect the health and safety of employees who are not working out of a physical workplace within their control?
Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad confirmed in Parliament in June 2020 that work from home arrangements do not change an employer's responsibility for work injury compensation.

It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
The firm will have to ascertain that the injury arose while the employee was performing work activities at home.
This is easier said than done and can have serious ramifications for employers, who find themselves facing a novel situation of potentially being held responsible for injuries that occur in employees' homes, to which employers have no access, and over which employers typically exert no control.
An extreme yet entirely plausible example of this is as follows: During office hours, an executive, seated at his desk at home, takes a work-related call on his mobile. He gets up and walks across the room to retrieve a document needed for the call, trips over his toddler’s toys and fractures his foot. It almost seems absurd to even suggest any liability on the part of the employer, but could it be argued that the executive was injured ""on the job""? 
Since the Workplace Safety and Health Act's application to remote working is untested, responding to complaints and actions for work-related injuries and illnesses will be challenging. 
When employees are working outside the office, it may be less clear when an act is performed in the course of employment.
To limit their liability for such accidents, some companies have started to carry out occupational safety assessments in employees' homes to identify risks and measures to mitigate these risks, whether by way of physical inspections, via Zoom or over an app. 
This must be balanced against employee's rights to privacy and should be subject to prior notification and agreement. Employers are thus modifying their policies to contractually provide for such potential intrusions.
Employers may also follow the example of France, which has rolled out self-assessment forms to be completed by employees in respect of occupational risks related to working from home.
In Belgium, legislation has been enacted to ensure that teleworkers are covered by occupational accident insurance if the accident occurs at home, during working hours and in a place listed as a workplace in the contract.







                                    

According to a global survey by Deloitte, millennials see climate change and protecting the environment as a top concern – overtaking anxieties over health, jobs and personal safety. (Photo: AFP/Roslan Rahman)



In Singapore, companies such as Salesforce and Autodesk are adopting a variety of measures to mitigate their liability, including providing employees with a technology budget to ensure they have proper and ergonomic equipment at home.
Employers are also clearly stipulating working hours, rest days, overtime and other terms that remote-working employees must abide by in order to avoid claims of breaches of the Employment Act by employees, given that working times are less defined in a homeworking environment.
EMPLOYEES’ MENTAL WELL-BEING
Employers are potentially facing the reverse challenge of ring-fencing employees' personal and home lives from the increasing encroachment of work – which have led to complaints of depression, anxiety and burnout.
A survey by National University Health System's (NUHS) Mind Science Centre on mental health resilience revealed that 61 per cent of those working from home reported feeling stressed, more than the 53 per cent of front liners in the pandemic feeling likewise.
This could also be due to the higher incidence of domestic issues employees may face while working from home. AWARE saw a drastic 116 per cent increase in domestic violence helpline calls by April 2020 from a year ago while the police reported a 22 per cent jump in monthly average cases of family violence during the circuit breaker.
Remote working poses a significant and unique challenge to employers seeking to support and promote mental health in their workforce given that it is much harder to assess how their employees are coping from a distance.

It has been suggested that companies consider investing in wearable tech to collect data on the mental health of their workforce and measure stress responses, subject to data protection of sensitive health data.
The Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces, introduced in November 2020, educates employers on progressive ways in which they can support employees’ mental health, such as providing access to external counselling services. While laudable, the advisory lacks bite and doesn't compel employers to adopt the suggestions.
A more concrete commitment would be to expand the list of Occupational Diseases under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), to include mental health illnesses related to work stress, which would have the effect of holding employers accountable. 
It would also be a positive step forward to recognise certain mental health issues as being a form of disability, which should be a protected characteristic when it comes to discrimination.
Countries such as Italy, Ireland, and the Philippines, have promulgated ""right to disconnect"" laws on answering work calls and emails outside of office hours to prevent employee exhaustion and burnout.
Member of Parliament Melvin Yong also mooted this in Parliament in October 2020, given that employee burnout complaints have heightened during the pandemic. However, would it be practical across different industries, or be seen as overly prescriptive?
In the interim, it is crucial that companies put in place measures, benefits, and policies to safeguard their employees' long-term mental health, taking into account the unique stressors posed by hybrid working.
Companies such as LinkedIn, Cisco, Google and Thomson Reuters offer firm-wide mental health holidays for staff to unplug and recharge in the face of soaring burnout rates. Companies have also offered resilience training, guided meditation and well-being sessions, including for remote employees.
INFORMATION SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY
Besides the people challenges, there’s also the technology-related issues. Remote working questions how employers can protect their data and confidential information as the ingress and egress of third parties to such remote locations isn't secure and tightly controlled by the company.
When the circuit breaker hit, companies scrambled to provide employees with the necessary technology and equipment to facilitate remote work with little time to deep dive into the security implications of remote working.

So, companies may have allowed employees access to customer and other data, heightening the risk of leakage of such sensitive information, whether by shoulder surfing or eavesdropping of spouses or visitors to the house, employees leaving physical copies of documents lying around and viewed by unauthorised parties.
Allowing remote workers to access company networks through homeworking environments also introduces vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.
In a paper released by the MAS and the Association of Banks in March, risks in areas such operations, technology and information security, fraud and staff misconduct and legal and regulatory risks were flagged for attention and recommended preventive and detective measures, including staff surveillance for high-risk activities.
Companies may thus introduce new policies to safeguard their data privacy and cyber-security by regulating staff remote working behaviour, including prescribing locations where staff are not permitted to work remotely such as in shared public working spaces like cafes and hotel lobbies.
Otherwise, they risk facing complaints and actions for breaches of confidential information, under the Personal Data Protection Act, and other requirements on the use, disclosure, retention and processing of personal data.
Given that our working landscape is changing, companies will need to put in place the necessary policies and procedures to mitigate new risks. Workers need to be ready for that.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/high-suicide-rate-region-thailand-grapples-mental-health-covid-14430142,"With Southeast Asia's highest suicide rate, Thailand grapples with mental health challenge amid pandemic - CNA",18/03/2021,"BANGKOK: As the COVID-19 pandemic took its toll on millions of jobs in Thailand last year, Unyakarn Booprasert found herself penniless and with no friends or relatives who could help.
The 59-year-old was splitting one packet of instant noodles between three meals. She was desperate for the 15,000 baht (S$655) promised by the government, to be paid over three months, under its No One Left Behind cash relief scheme.
When she learnt she was among the 15 million applicants who did not qualify for aid, Unyakarn decided to plead her case to Thailand’s authorities last April.
“When I got to the Ministry of Finance, sure enough, they didn’t listen,” said the cleaner. “From their actions, a poor person was similar to a pig or a dog, an animal with scabies.”







                                    

Unyakarn Booprasert was not given a reason for being left out of the cash relief scheme.



Unyakarn tried to kill herself with rat poison in front of the ministry’s building. “I wanted to protest. It didn’t happen only to me. It happened to many people,” she told the programme Undercover Asia.
I thought that the government wanted to get rid of the poor in the country. So I made their wish come true by getting rid of one person, one life.
After her suicide attempt, the authorities looked into her case again and decided she qualified for the relief.
Suicides in Thailand have gone up amid the COVID-19 pandemic. A total of 2,551 people killed themselves in the first half of last year, up 22 per cent from the same period in 2019. Health officials attributed the increase to pandemic-related stress.
Groups particularly impacted by the pandemic’s fallout include tourism employees, sex workers and migrants. Foreign tourism, which makes up 12 per cent of Thailand’s gross domestic product, has collapsed as nations curb international travel to fight the spread of COVID-19.







                                    

Estimates put the number of sex workers in Thailand at anywhere between 800,000 to over two million.



Sex workers, meanwhile, may not be registered in the social security system and have limited access to government support, said economist Thanaporn Sriyakul.
Rural-to-urban migrants have also faced difficulty getting aid under the No One Left Behind scheme, as they may be classified in government records as farmers, who come under a different financial scheme.
A PROBLEM EVEN BEFORE COVID-19
A similar spike in suicides occurred during the 1997 Asian financial crisis, when the numbers increased by about 20 to 25 per cent, said Varoth Chotpitayasunondh, spokesperson for the Ministry of Public Health’s Department of Mental Health.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
But even before the coronavirus created economic hardship, Thailand had the highest suicide rate in Southeast Asia — which has seen mental health experts and advocates pushing for more resources to tackle the problem.
WATCH: Thailand’s mental health crisis: Why is its suicide rate so high? (4:12)

According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) in 2019, Thailand’s annual suicide rate was 14.4 per 100,000 of the population, while the global age-standardised average is 10.5 per 100,000. Age-standardised means variations arising from countries’ different age structures have been removed.
By comparison, the suicide rates in the other Association of Southeast Asian Nations member states on the WHO list varied from 3.2 (the Philippines) to 11.2 (Singapore) per 100,000 population.
There is a suicide attempt every 10 minutes in Thailand.
Deep-seated cultural and economic reasons contribute to Thailand’s relatively high suicide rate, according to the Singapore University of Social Sciences’ associate professor Antonio L Rappa, who has studied Thai culture, history and politics for over 20 years.
Apart from economic factors, he said the Thai people’s “long history of being warriors” has imbued their psyche with the “idea of death”.







                                    

Assoc Prof Antonio L Rappa is the author of The King And The Making Of Modern Thailand.



The country’s protest culture means people may be willing to die “as a means to mark their cause”, while Theravada Buddhism, which is widely practised, teaches acceptance, he added.
During the pandemic, suicide helplines such as the one operated by the Samaritans of Thailand were swamped. Stories surfaced on social media of hotline calls going unanswered.
Varoth acknowledged that even after doubling the number of lines to 20 for the Department of Mental Health, it takes 10 to 12 minutes before someone can answer a call.
“Some people don’t want to wait until that time. They want it to be within five minutes, and it’s still very difficult,” he said. “The drop rate of the hotline now is still around 40 to 45 per cent.”







                                    

The Samaritans of Thailand runs a suicide helpline.




But he added that the government offers “very good” support for people with mental health issues — such as through universal health coverage that provides mental health treatment in public hospitals for around 30 baht.
Suicide survivor and mental health advocate Amornthep “Sanju” Sachamuneewongse, however, flagged gaps such as a shortage of mental health workers, the long wait at government hospitals and the much higher cost of treatment in private hospitals.
The 30-year-old developed hallucinations and other symptoms of depression and schizophrenia five years ago, and needed almost a year to be properly diagnosed.
He initially underwent a magnetic resonance imaging scan, which came out clear, and was taken by his parents to a spiritual doctor before he finally saw a psychiatrist.







                                    

 Amornthep “Sanju” Sachamuneewongse said the spiritual doctor suggested a cleansing ritual.



He had harboured suicidal thoughts, but multiple calls to suicide hotlines went unanswered. “If my call was unanswered, how many other calls were unanswered as well?” he wondered.
HIP-HOP AND ONLINE CHATS
Varoth acknowledged the need to increase mental health awareness and resources. In a bid to do so, Thai authorities are partnering non-profit groups, technology firms and even the entertainment industry.
Amid movement curbs when COVID-19 first began spreading, officials initially planned to round up homeless people — a group that has a higher prevalence of psychiatric disorders and suicide risk — and house them in shelters.
But social worker Adchara Saravari of the Issarachon Foundation, which helps the homeless in Bangkok, said: “We told them, ‘Let the homeless stay put. Don’t enforce the curfew on them. Let them sleep where they are. It’d be enough to reduce the spread.”
WATCH: The full episode — What’s behind Thailand’s alarming suicide rate? (46:07)

This resulted in a collaboration between the people sector and the government to oversee homeless people within an area, she said.
But barriers remain. The homeless may not carry identity cards, making it difficult to verify information and for them to qualify for treatment, noted Adchara. They should not be blamed, she added, and the government should “take charge” and “support them”.
To reach out to members of the public, the Thai government has set up a special operations team called the Hope Task Force, which uses social media platforms such as Facebook, TikTok and the Line app to communicate with sufferers.
These platforms provide more channels of help and allow volunteers and mental health specialists to allocate resources more efficiently. For instance, they may chat with more than one person at a time online.
The Department of Mental Health also developed the app, Mental Health Check Up. Users may answer a series of questions on their chosen topics, which include burnout, stress levels and depression.







                                    

The app is now part of a mental health campaign dubbed Check In.



Sanju, too, created a mobile app after his experience with the manpower crunch in mental health care: Sati is a digital hotline for users with mental health issues to chat with people who have been trained to listen.
To reach out to youths in particular, the authorities collaborated with Unicef and music platform Joox Thailand last year on a campaign called The Sound of Happiness, which featured podcasts, songs and celebrities talking about mental health.
One of the songs, Nai Lao (Let’s Talk) by record label YUPP!’s hip-hop artists Autta, Blacksheep and Milli, became a favourite among young listeners.
“When we were discussing (the track), we thought of the line, ‘Some people choose ‘lao’ (to drink) over ‘lao’ (to tell),” said music producer and YUPP! founder Sakkapit Makun, explaining the pun in the title.
“The words have the same pronunciation but different meanings. It sounds simple. The lyrics are casual so that we can use it among friends. So it became the song Nai Lao.”







                                    

Sakkapit Makun said ""it helps people not to be afraid to share their stories"".



Suicide and mental health should be “the problem of everyone”, said Varoth.
“Right now, yes, we lack the resources to help with the mental health issue in Thailand because of COVID-19,” he noted.
“But we can solve this problem by inviting many parties, talking to many people, doing collaborations between organisations who are interested in mental health and letting Thai people decide to come together, help each other.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-elderly-seniors-dementia-14271078,"Better mental health awareness among seniors, but more can be done, say experts - CNA",12/03/2021,"SINGAPORE: When Mr Ng Kok Sing’s mother started showing signs of poor memory and became bad-tempered six years ago, the eldest of four sons noticed the changes. 
His mother, Madam Lee Lye Kuen, ran a hawker stall and could remember her customers’ orders, but she was misplacing things, and forgetting to brush her teeth. 
She had a group of friends at the local community centre, but her bad temper drove them away, he told CNA in a phone interview. 
Mr Ng’s daughter took Madam Lee to the doctor, and the elderly woman was diagnosed with dementia at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). 
“I didn’t know much about dementia. After getting the report from SGH, I just could not understand. I was a bit shocked,” Mr Ng said.
Mr Ng said his knowledge of dementia was initially minimal, but he made an effort to find out more so he would be equipped to take care of his mother. He did not understand why his mother had the condition as there was no history of it in his family, he said. 
“After I found some articles and attended some talks, slowly I understood what dementia is. I had to face it,” he said.
On the other hand, Madam Lee is aware of what dementia is from media articles and talks at the Fei Yue Retirees Centre where she goes, Mr Ng said. But she does not know that she has the condition. 
MORE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AMONG SENIORS AND FAMILIES
A spokesperson for Fei Yue Community Services said that in recent years there has been more mental healthcare screening at polyclinics.
“We do see more diagnosed with dementia,” she said, noting that seniors are more aware of dementia and depression because of communications though various media channels. 
“Their family members, friends, peers and neighbours who may be diagnosed with similar mental health conditions have also made them more aware,” she said. She added that the elderly are also more open to finding about mental health issues by attending talks and workshops on mental health.  
The COVID-19 pandemic has also “surfaced many mental health cases within the community”, she said.
“There is now more prominence and light given to mental health wellness,” she said.
“Together with some of the Government initiatives, the community has become more aware and embraces (the fact) that mental health issues and mental well-being are important to one’s health. The younger generations like the baby boomers help to detect early symptoms and signs amongst the elderly, to seek intervention and treatment.”
The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), which provides emotional support to those in crisis or are thinking about suicide or affected by suicide, also said that awareness of mental health has “generally increased in the past few years”.
The organisation has observed an increasing number of community initiatives to support the elderly and their caregivers as well as to increase awareness around mental health conditions, said its chief executive Gasper Tan.
“Specifically, we have seen a greater understanding of dementia,” he said.
SOS noted that agencies such as Lien Foundation, Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have been fronting educational campaigns.
“(They) had played a vital role in equipping and training more with the necessary knowledge and skills to identify symptoms of dementia as well as how to support affected people in the community,” he said.
Mental health among seniors came into the spotlight in Parliament last month, after MP Mohd Fahmi Aliman (PAP-Marine Parade) asked about the effectiveness of Government initiatives in reducing elderly suicide and the support mechanisms for old people who are socially isolated.
Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said that there were 400 reported cases of suicide in 2019. Of these, 122 cases, or 30.5 per cent, involved persons 60 years and above.  
“The causes of suicide are complex and multi-faceted, often involving family, social and mental health issues,” he said.
“Therefore, the Government works closely with Ministry of Social and Family Development and community partners on multi-pronged approaches, comprising promoting mental health and well-being, raising awareness on suicide prevention, and providing professional support and crisis interventions to at-risk groups, including targeted support for older adults.”
MORE WORK NEEDED 
While awareness among seniors is improving, more can still be done so they and their families are more familiar with mental health issues, eldercare groups said.
“In our counselling experience, a lot of times older people don’t feel comfortable sharing and talking about their mental health issues,” said Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation. Even when they do share openly, their families sometimes might not understand their challenges, she said.
People may come to the wrong conclusions that seniors who are depressed or anxious “think too much or simply forgetful or careless” and that their mental state is a normal aspect of ageing, she said.
“Mental health issues can be invisible and be misunderstood,” she said.
She added that the behaviour of older people that can hint at a sense of anxiety or distress can be seen by others as being unreasonable or insecure.  
“More can be done to promote awareness and understanding that these are not necessarily part of ageing but a mental health issue which we can all solve together,” she said.
Fei Yue Community Services also said that there is still much work that can be done. 
“The stigma and misconception, and lack of knowledge still exists. Many prefer to not talk about it or dismiss the idea if they should share with someone their emotional state of being,” a spokesperson said. 
She added that family members and friends are “critical” to getting seniors to attend workshops or talks to get themselves more acquainted with managing their mental health. 
Given that dementia and depression are common mental health issues among seniors, the AIC said that families should look out for signs of these conditions. A spokesperson said that signs of dementia include difficulty performing daily activities like cooking and dressing, changes in behaviour like becoming socially withdrawn and more easily upset, and issues with cognition such as difficulty remembering things and having problems with language and calculations.
For depression, signs include thoughts of suicide, a change in sleeping patterns, and irritability and outbursts of anger, she said. 
SUICIDE PREVENTION
Mr Tan said that among those who called the 24-hour SOS hotline and disclosed their age, about 20 per cent of calls between April 2019 and March last year were from people aged 60 and above.
While some call to reach out for a listening ear or vent their daily frustrations, “others may call SOS when they are in crisis, and in need of emotional support to cope with their negative thoughts and suicidal ideations”, said Mr Tan.
“In such calls, our priority is to ensure the safety of the caller. In general, we strive to give clients a safe space where they can share their thoughts and feelings openly as we may be their only resource for support, he said.
He said that suicide is an “inherently complex issue”, with no single cause.
“It is often due to culmination of a variety of factors. When one experience feelings of hopelessness for a prolonged period of time, one may contemplate and even attempt suicide,” he said. 
Loneliness, physical illness, loss of independence and loss of loved ones can contribute to seniors’ sense of despair, he said.
“The process of growing old is inevitably accompanied with physical and social changes. It can be difficult to cope and adapt to these transitions, there may be fear and feelings of loss with their physical deterioration, and even concern that they are putting on burden to the people around them,” he said.
He added that guilt is another emotion that they may encounter. 
“When one is in such a situation, especially with a weak social support and no one to turn to, feelings of loneliness and alienation may be amplified,” he said. 
SOS views education as key for suicide prevention, he said.
“The community must take an proactive commitment to destigmatise suicide and create more open and constructive conversations on how we can empower the elderly, such that they can sustain meaning especially in their late age,” he said.
“Furthermore, we believe that the onus should not lie only on the elderly, but the community at large to empathize and support these individuals.”
HOW FAMILIES CAN HELP
AIC echoed the view that it is important for the community to continue to come together, be aware of the various mental health conditions as well as their signs and symptoms, in order to be supportive of those living with such challenges. 
They suggested that families supporting elderly loved ones at-risk of, or living with, mental health conditions should be aware of signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and know who to turn to for information, treatment or support. 
The families should also learn about the condition and what to expect of those living with it, treatment options and how to manage their medication, and take time out from caregiving to practise self-care. 
“This is important for caregivers so as to manage their own mental wellness and prevent burnout,” a spokesperson for AIC said. 
Fei Yue Community Services said that families can support their elderly by being more patient and showing empathy when they display symptoms. 
“The family’s willingness to adjust their own living lifestyle to fit the elderly’s needs and not the other way round will help and goes a long way too,” its spokesperson said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-curriculum-polytechnics-ite-schools-moe-14322204,Mental wellness curriculum launched at polytechnics and ITE colleges - CNA,03/03/2021,"SINGAPORE: Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges have launched a new mental wellness curriculum for all Year 1 students to raise awareness of mental health and encourage people to seek help early. 
Making the announcement at the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate in Parliament, Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling said the institutes of higher learning are enhancing mental health support by strengthening programmes on mental wellness literacy and awareness. 
The polytechnics and ITE worked with the Health Promotion Board to launch the new curriculum for all Year 1 students from 2020 and 2021 respectively, she added. 
“The (autonomous universities) are also promoting mental wellness through briefings during freshmen orientation and university-wide programmes,” said Ms Sun. 
NEW CENTRE FOR CCE
A new centre for character and citizenship education (CCE) will be established in the National Institute of Education, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong in his speech on Wednesday. 
“This centre will work with schools to strengthen CCE learning, conduct relevant research and provide thought leadership. Our goal is for every teacher to be a CCE teacher, and we will provide them full support to achieve this,” he added. 
The centre for CCE will be launched by the end of 2022, Ms Sun said in her speech. 
MOE will also launch a second Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence to allow teachers to train on site, “strengthening the nexus between research, theory and practice”, said Mr Wong. 
The first centre is currently located at Yusof Ishak Secondary School, and the new one will be established at New Town Primary School from this year, he added. 
ROLLOUT OF NEW CCE CURRICULUM
Building on Mr Wong’s announcements, Ms Sun noted that the refreshed CCE curriculum has been implemented from this year, starting with secondary schools. 
The new curriculum, also announced at the 2020 Committee of Supply debate, has a stronger emphasis on mental health and cyber wellness education, she added. 
“Students will learn about topics like differentiating signs of stress and distress, and healthy habits for positive well-being,” said Ms Sun. 
“We recognise the nexus between increasing digital usage and mental health concerns, even more so amongst our young who may not know how to regulate their use of social media.”

The “evidence-based” programme, also known as Triple P, was first piloted in 2014 and has since been rolled out at schools and social service agencies islandwide.
It is currently available via an e-learning platform or over Zoom, amid the COVID-19 pandemic.
“Triple P has been proven to be effective, with parents reporting sustained reduction of around 20 per cent in both their children’s problematic behaviour scores and parenting stress scores three months after completing the programme,” said Mr Chua.
The parenting programme is one of the ways in which the ministry is working to promote youth mental health awareness, and better equip parents to support these youth, said Mr Chua, in response to a parliamentary question by MP Carrie Tan (PAP-Nee Soon).
These efforts come especially as the COVID-19 pandemic has “posed new challenges and highlighted the importance of strengthening the mental health and well-being of our youths”, he said.
Mr Chua also noted that additional digital resources were developed amid the pandemic to support parents. This includes a dedicated website that provides resources and tools for caregivers.
For families who need more assistance, an online counselling service was set up in April last year by the ministry and the Community Psychology Hub.
This service helped more than 1,200 clients last year, Mr Chua noted.
“We will continue to work together with other agencies and community partners to help parents better support their children’s mental health and well-being,” he said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/japan-suicide-end-10-year-decline-covid-19-pandemic-job-stress-14017762,Suicides rise in Japan as COVID-19 pandemic stress hits women harder - CNA,22/01/2021,"TOKYO: Suicides increased in Japan during 2020 after a decade of declines, with the number of women committing suicide surging amid the emotional and financial stress caused by the COVID-19 pandemic even as fewer men took their own lives.
Suicide has a long history in Japan as a way of avoiding shame or dishonour, and its suicide rate has long topped the Group of Seven nations, but a concerted national effort brought numbers down by roughly 40 per cent over 15 years that included 10 straight years of decline from 2009.
But, preliminary police data published on Friday (Jan 22) showed suicides totalled 20,919 last year, 750 more than in 2019.
The suicide rate had been trending lower in the first half of 2020, but from July onward the numbers began to rise as the impact of the coronavirus outbreak hit home, activists and researchers say.
By gender, 13,943 men and 6,976 women took their lives - a 1 per cent decline on the previous year for men but a 14.5 per cent increase for women, who tend to work in service and retail sectors that suffered more job losses during the pandemic.
""The painful trend of rising suicides by women has continued,"" a Health Ministry official told a news briefing.
""Suicides are the result of many different things, but I think one thing we can definitely say is that there was an impact from the coronavirus on economic and lifestyle factors,"" he added.
The worst month was October, when suicides totalled 2,153 for the highest monthly total in more than five years. The number of suicides by women, at 851, rose 82.6 per cent on the same month in 2019.
For many years in Japan, getting psychological help has been stigmatised, but when suicides hit a peak of 34,427 in 2003, alarmed policymakers drew up a comprehensive prevention programme launched in 2007.
Through a combination of government and corporate efforts that included identifying at-risk groups, capping overtime and making it easier to get counselling, suicides had decreased to just over 20,000 in 2019, before the coronavirus struck.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-wellness-programmes-mindfulness-courses-covid-19-stress-13904826,"More turn to mindfulness, mental wellness programmes to cope with stress from COVID-19 - CNA",09/01/2021,"SINGAPORE: Minutes into a mindfulness workshop, a participant tears up as she tells the people gathered in the room that she hopes to get help as she feels she is “not doing well” in life. 
She apologises for the mild outburst but moderator Associate Professor Angie Chew tells her it’s okay, and an assistant offers a hug. 
Of the more than 30 participants at the workshop, a fair number shared that they have experienced sudden changes in their lives, either due to the COVID-19 pandemic or a family member falling ill.
They were hoping to learn techniques to better manage their stress or anxiety at the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) workshop organised by non-profit organisation Brahm Centre, which started on Jan 5.
MBSR workshops, created by Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979, helps people cope with stress, depression or anxiety. A secular practice, it is now offered in many settings around the world, including hospitals, schools and prisons.
“I suppose (this is) because people have no idea where to go. So this is not just a physical getaway but it's a mental vacation,” said Assoc Prof Chew. “Because it's overthinking that causes burnout.”
She told CNA that there have been more inquiries about the centre’s mindfulness courses since the “circuit breaker” period in April, and there is a waitlist for their classes and workshops. 
The centre trained more than 23,000 people last year, a three-fold increase from 2019. A large number of these were from corporate workshops, and also from a mindfulness conference in August that saw 5,000 people sign up.
MORE CORPORATE WORKSHOPS
Yoga and meditation studios told CNA that they have seen a similar situation - mindfulness classes, which tend to be in small groups, are oversubscribed.
The Singing Bowl Gallery, which focuses on sound meditation, now holds daily classes due to restrictions on class sizes and increased demand. The number of people who attend its classes each month has increased from 15 before the pandemic to about 40 people.

Ms War War Lwin Tun of Ohmsantih Yoga said that she used to get more requests to run physical yoga workshops, but last year, the number of meditation and mindfulness workshops for companies went up significantly. She now runs at least four such events a month.
“I think companies also have that awareness now that my employees may be more stressed than before,” she said.
Ms Dawn Sim, director at The Open Centre, which runs mindfulness and mental resilience programmes, said that more people have come forward to take their courses. In addition, the corporate workshops they run have switched from focussing on leadership to being about managing stress and anxiety.
Health Can Be Fun, a health consultancy that helps organise wellness workshops, has also seen the number of mental wellness programmes they run increase about three times in 2020, from one or two a quarter to one a two a month.

Companies from a range of industries have shown interest in training for stress management, mindfulness and resilience building, and workshops that teach breathing techniques and art-based therapy have proven to be popular, a company spokeswoman said.
""In Asia and Singapore, there has often been a stigma surrounding mental health and seeking help. However, COVID-19 has certainly changed the landscape. Since the start of COVID-19, many companies and individuals experience the impact of poor mental wellness and health,"" she said.
WHY THE INCREASE? 
The emergence of a new disease and the effects it has had on society and the economy may have something to do with this phenomenon.
The fear and anxiety triggered by COVID-19 and its consequences can be overwhelming for some, said Ms Sara-Ann Lee, a senior clinical psychologist from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
“The pandemic has emphasised the importance of mental wellness given that many countries had to enforce policies that required physical distancing among individuals in order to control the spread of the virus.”
She added that many reported feeling lonely, isolated and depressed due to “lockdown” measures in many countries. 
In Singapore, the circuit breaker lasted for two months and many employees lost their jobs or had their pay cut, while some businesses struggled to survive despite substantial subsidies from the Government.

Most people have had to adapt to safe distancing measures and new rhythms as schools and offices shifted to their homes.
Travel restrictions which have stopped people from going overseas for leisure may also have led to the increase in demand for mental wellness programmes, as people have more time in Singapore, some studios said.
MORE HELP AVAILABLE
In October, the Government set up a COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce to tackle the pandemic’s impact on mental health.
Announcing the formation of the task force on Oct 10, which was World Mental Health Day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that with COVID-19, more people are facing stresses, pressures and disruptions to their lives and livelihoods.
“Health authorities around the world must not only fight COVID-19, but also manage its impact on the mental health of their populations,"" he said then.

The Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), along with other public service agencies, has also launched the mindline.sg website, which helps people assess their mental well-being and consolidates resources that they can tap to cope with stress. In mid-October, an AI penguin chatbot named Wysa was added to the site.
As of Dec 28, more than 100,000 have used the site, MOHT said.
Ms Wong Yin Li, who heads the youth division of Fei Yue Community Services, said that resources such as mindline can be useful because people can seek help anonymously and in their own time.
“It is very good for clients who need to understand more and feel safer before they can do the next step of going for face-to-face services,” she said.
Practitioners CNA spoke to also suggested that those who want to start practising mindfulness can have a taste of it by turning to mobile apps, before deciding if they want to commit to classes or workshops.
Ms Sim said: “They can start anywhere, anytime ... there are lots of good apps around, and if they want more support, then they can sign up with one of the centres. It’s a way of life and they don’t have to wait until they finish that project, or when they resign.”
WAYS TO RECOGNISE AND RESPOND TO STRESS
IMH’s Ms Lee said that in the new year, an increased focus on mental wellbeing is likely to continue as people start to become more aware about these issues and take steps to look after their own mental wellbeing.
“Stress is a normal part of our day to day lives, even more so that the fight against COVID-19 continues. We all need to be able to recognise and respond by developing healthy ways to cope with stress,” she said.
Ms Lee recommends that people control the amount of information they read regarding the pandemic and trust only reputable sources of information.
They should also try to maintain work-life balance despite working from home by setting appropriate boundaries and sticking to a regular work schedule if possible.
“Take care of your body by ensuring adequate nutrition and sleep, coupled with exercise. Make time for self-care activities to relax and unwind,” she added.
Assoc Prof Chew said there are times when it can be hard to manage one’s repetitive thoughts and worries, despite resolving to do so - which is when mindfulness techniques can be useful.
Very often, it’s the inability to let go of what has happened that leads to suffering and negative emotions perpetuating, and having the right “foundational attitudes” can help, she said.
“The foundational attitudes of mindfulness is to be curious so that you are less judgmental; to accept what you can't change in that moment in time … to be able to be grateful for what we already have instead of letting the mind focus on what is lacking,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/eating-disorders-festive-season-youth-mental-health-13836172,"For those with eating disorders, stressful festive season caps pandemic-struck year - CNA",02/01/2021,"SINGAPORE: The year-end period, with invites to gatherings and festive feasts, is a stressful one for 31-year-old Jas, who wanted to be known only by her first name.  
That is because she has grappled with an eating disorder for the past seven years – one that involves chewing food and spitting it out, to avoid ingesting it. 
The string of get-togethers for meals, especially during Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year, can be a mental torment, she explained. 
“Even before you reach the person’s house, you’d be planning days ahead: ‘If I eat turkey, I’ll just take the breast meat. Or if we’re ordering pizza, I’ll check how many calories are in that slice. Am I just going to eat the tomato on the pizza and leave the crust behind?'” she said.
“Eating out with people was also stressful because then I needed to plan how to (chew and spit),” she said, adding that it took a lot of practice to keep her behaviour as discreet as possible. 
“I would try my best to avoid outings … When people had gatherings, then I’d say I wasn’t free,” said Jas, who works in education.
These days, she is on the road to recovery but the festive season is still stressful. In the face of so many opportunities to have a meal, she said she has to “undo a habit that has been with (her) for so many years"".
Her experiences of the holiday season are not uncommon.
Dr Ng Kah Wee, director of the Eating Disorders Unit at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), noted that patients struggle more during the festive period for many reasons.
For one, people with binge urges may cave in when they see an abundance of food, while those who restrict their food intake may struggle with turning down social events or communal meals, Dr Ng added.
Having more family reunions may also exacerbate depression and anxiety among some patients, especially those who already battle issues of low self-esteem and body image distortion, she told CNA.
COVID-19 AND ITS EFFECT ON PEOPLE WITH EATING DISORDERS
The holiday season caps a pandemic-struck year that has put even more stress on those with such disorders.
Jas cited how the ""circuit breaker"" period that started in April caused her disorder to go unchecked, as she was able to engage in unhealthy eating behaviour in the privacy of her own home.
“I would also have the urge to chew and spit because food was so nearby, I could just go to the fridge and do it. It was difficult for me,” Jas said.
On the other hand, she also had to eat with her family more often than before – a dicey situation given that they did not know about her eating disorder.
Experts pointed out that COVID-19 has affected patients in other ways.
Closer supervision at home brought about more anxiety and tension for patients, while the pandemic “abruptly halted” usual routines such as going to school or work, said SGH’s Dr Ng. 
“Some more unfortunate had lost their jobs, or perhaps this misfortune had befallen their parents. Correspondingly, when anxiety and depression became worse, their eating became more erratic and purging behaviours increased,” she explained.
She added that the pandemic and safe distancing restrictions prevented many patients from turning to their previous ways of coping, such as going out with friends or watching movies.
“We saw patients who adopted maladaptive measures such as turning to alcohol, drugs and self-harm. Some patients even contemplated suicide when they were at the peak of their distress,” Dr Ng told CNA.
Dr Courtney Davis of KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) added that COVID-19 led to increased health worries as well, which triggered a worsening of eating disorder symptoms among some.
“Examples of aggravated symptoms include increased amounts of exercise and increased preoccupation with dietary restrictions,” she said.
However, both doctors also noted that some patients’ conditions improved amid the pandemic.
Dr Ng said a “small proportion” of them became better during the circuit breaker period because of closer parental supervision.
Parents were able to notice early changes in moods and abnormal eating behaviour, and got their child medical attention “in a timely manner”, she explained.
MORE CASES AMONG YOUNGER PATIENTS 
At SGH’s Eating Disorder Unit, there were about 150 new cases in 2020. The average age of patients presenting for the first time was about 17 to 22 years. An overwhelming majority were female patients.
These numbers are similar to previous years’ figures, SGH said. 
However, KKH – which attends to younger patients – has seen cases growing.
Its Adolescent Medicine Service saw 96 new cases of patients with eating disorders in 2020, compared to 80 in 2019.
In previous years, the service saw 50 to 70 new cases per year on average.
Dr Davis said the hospital is unable to establish the exact reason why cases have continued to rise, adding that research is ongoing in this area.
She noted though that “better awareness on eating disorders has likely played a part in the increase in numbers"".
There has also been an “increased complexity in a subset of cases”, said Dr Davis.
“We are seeing more patients who require medical admission at presentation compared to before. This trend suggests an increased severity of symptoms at presentation,” she told CNA.
“We are also seeing younger patients. About 20 per cent of the patients are younger than 13 years old on presentation.""
To bring down the number of patients with eating disorders, SGH’s Dr Ng cited several possible solutions.
Apart from helping the young build their self-confidence and identity “in a healthy manner”, teachers can be trained to identify those who may be at risk of developing such disorders.
Psychiatric disorders must also be de-stigmatised, Dr Ng said.
She added: “Encourage the general public to pay attention to the mental health of themselves and their loved ones, especially in this unprecedented trying period of a pandemic.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/how-to-cope-with-holiday-blues-pandemic-mental-health-13526064,Mental wellness: How to cope with holiday blues during a pandemic - CNA,18/12/2020,"Let’s face it, this is not how we want the year to end: Travel is basically non-existent (maybe next time, ski slopes?), you’re still working from home (bye bye patience and sanity), and financial stability for some could be as firm as a soggy log cake (let's hold that phone upgrade). 
While we do have a silver lining to look forward to in the form of Singapore’s post-Christmas Phase 3 and its promise of eight-people gatherings, this is truly an unusual December where the typical holiday blues that makes its way around this time of the year is compounded by a pandemic.
DOUBLE-WHAMMY STRESS
Whether you were naughty or nice this year, it feels like you’re getting a lump of coal in your stocking anyway. But maybe it’s time to examine the current situation further: How are the stresses created by the COVID-19 pandemic hitting us?
According to John Lim, the chief wellbeing officer of Singapore Counselling Centre (SCC), the prospects of death and major illness, as well as the isolation brought about by the pandemic, have added strain to individuals’ mental wellbeing.

There’s also the volatility of the situation that “prevents people from making plans and being hopeful for fear of disappointment”, he said. “The implications of the pandemic on the economy has also yet to fully set in, and this further increases anxiety levels as people are unable to look forward to things going back to pre-pandemic functioning any time soon.”
While the usual triggers of holiday blues – uncomfortable family gatherings, inadequate gifts, fatigue and stress from cooking and planning a Christmas dinner party – are probably slightly different this year because of social distancing measures, there are still some mood dampeners to watch out for.
The volatility of the situation prevents people from making plans and being hopeful for fear of disappointment.
For instance, “the absence of close connections may be especially difficult to cope with during the season of gatherings. People may feel a sense of loss and end up becoming withdrawn or isolated”, noted the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
If you tend to be highly self-critical, the season of evaluation may just increase your blues, according to the IMH. You may feel bad if you rate yourself lower in your accomplishments than others would, or blame yourself for not meeting your own or others' expectations.
You may also ruminate over the past and loved ones who have died. “Consciously or unconsciously, you have a mental record of previous holidays. Your mood may be contaminated by the spectre of sad holidays past,” said psychotherapist Maud Purcell on PsychCentral. 
“All too often, your thoughts turn to beloved family members and friends who have passed away. The subsequent sense of loss you feel can spoil even the happiest of celebrations.”
PRACTISE GRATITUDE AND MINDFULNESS
There are many other triggers of holiday blues that can bring on feelings of anxiety, sadness and disappointment. 
And as diverse as these grievances are, practising a little gratitude for what you have rather than what you may be missing out on could be the key to a Merrier Christmas and Happier New Year, said Dr Bobby Cheon, the principal investigator at the Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences, a research institute of the Agency for Science, Technology and Research.

“People may not be able to go on holiday, gather in large family groups, or have as many nice things as previous holidays. But one way to deal with the holiday blues they cause is to exercise more mindfulness about the important needs in our lives that are still fulfilled,” he said. 
Here’s how you can incorporate gratitude and mindfulness into these common year-end scenarios below:
YOU CAN’T AFFORD EXPENSIVE PRESENTS AND TREATS THIS YEAR
Purse strings are tighter this year, so it is a very real worry when it comes to gift exchanges. If you’re planning such an event, be mindful of participants’ financial concerns, and set comfortable budgets or opt-in systems, suggested Lim. “That way, people who are unable to afford the gifts do not feel singled out and stressed by having to give out of their means.”
One way to deal with the holiday blues they cause is to exercise more mindfulness about the important needs in our lives that are still fulfilled.
Conversely, there may be instances when you can’t avoid giving presents. In such situations, showing your gratitude doesn’t have to be done through luxury items or expensive meals like in previous years, said Lim. It can be homemade baked treats such as brownies or cookies, or even a handmade “thank you” card.
YOU'RE NOT IN THE MOOD TO CELEBRATE BECAUSE YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT YOUR FUTURE
It is okay not to feel celebratory. Acknowledging your disappointment and giving yourself time and space to grieve the loss of your job are important steps to moving forward, said Lim. “Take some time to accept your feelings towards what happened, be it anger, disappointment or frustration.”
He advised: “Despite the discouragement and negativity you feel, don’t isolate yourself. Instead, seek out trusted people in your life and have heartfelt conversations about what you are going through. Social support and comfort can do wonders in lifting your spirit, and helping you feel more hopeful about the future”.

YOU CAN'T ATTEND OR ORGANISE BIG GATHERINGS
Keeping expectations realistic can help stave off the blues this season, said Dr Gary Small, the director of UCLA Longevity Center and a specialist in geriatric psychiatry. “It’s not about having the perfect Christmas dinner. It’s about connecting with the people you care about, and you can do that with video conferencing or smaller get-togethers outdoors.”
And while Zooming with the cousins isn’t the same as the usual big gathering over a spread of festive treats, spending time together – even virtually – is important for avoiding or diminishing a bout of the blues, said Dr Small.
It’s not about having the perfect Christmas dinner. It’s about connecting with the people you care about, and you can do that with video conferencing or smaller get-togethers outdoors.
On your part, it might help to reframe your perspective, said Lim. For instance, let go of situations you can’t control (such as not being able to have large gatherings) and instead, work within the confines of what you have and can do (such as helping the seniors in the family to get familiar with video calls).
YOU FEEL LIKE A FAILURE
You had big plans for 2020. It could be getting married, having a baby, moving house, changing jobs, or getting a Masters degree. But the pandemic happened and your plans had to be shelved or compromised. Now you’re left feeling like you haven’t accomplished anything.
“We are naturally programmed to be fixated on the negative things that happen to us since many of these goals are personally significant to us,” said Lim. However, he cautioned that this is not helpful to our mental wellbeing. “It makes us disgruntled with the things beyond our control, causing us to feel a lack of control over our lives and situations.”

To manage your feelings and stay positive, Lim recommended reframing your thoughts. Think about how you adapted to the situation. Or consider the option to continue to achieve those goals in the coming year instead.
YOU'RE FEARFUL OF WHAT 2021 MAY BRING
Lim said that you can manage the uncertainty ahead by anticipating change and making contingency plans. Having plans in place, even if it’s just mental preparation, is helpful in letting you adjust to the new normal, he said.
Building a strong social support network is also helpful in reducing your fear of uncertainty. “Authentic sharing and self-disclosure” with trusted friends and/or family members “are helpful in allowing us to feel supported and less alone in what we are going through”, said Lim.
“Our friends and family members can also be key people in checking our realities and reframing self-defeating thoughts, helping us perceive our situations more accurately.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-enough-is-enough-just-what-does-it-take-to-break-13659308,The Big Read: Enough is enough. Just what does it take to break mental health stigma at the workplace? - CNA,30/11/2020,"SINGAPORE: For more than two years since she started working at a bank, Mavis (not her real name) has been keeping a secret from her bosses: She suffers from depression and anxiety.
While her company has hired counsellors, Mavis has never used their services, and seeks external counselling instead. 
She has kept her mental health condition under wraps due to the “toxic” work culture, said the 25-year-old associate, and she fears that her chances of a promotion will be stymied if her condition is out in the open.
“Some have told me that (the company counsellors) will report back to the bank, though my boss said that this doesn’t happen - but you never know,” she said. 
""In my industry, you are expected to work very hard and expected to have endurance … Those  who can work a lot and handle a lot are seen as better.""
A former trainee at a law firm, who wanted to be known only as Chloe, had a similar experience. 
The 26-year-old, who began working at the firm early last year, developed anxiety attacks throughout her six-month traineeship. Things worsened to the point where she broke down during several lunch breaks, after feeling like she was manipulating her clients by withholding information. 
“I felt like I had to lie to my client ... and I was under so much anxiety. During lunch, I would go down to cry, because I felt like I just couldn’t cope.” 
Like Mavis, Chloe did not tell her bosses about her deteriorating mental health, but put on a poker face when she returned to the office after each breakdown.
“I have friends in the legal practice, and the advice given to me was that I could not speak to anybody about (my emotional issues). The concern was really stigma, so I had to go for private counselling,” said Chloe, who is no longer with the firm but is furthering her studies.  
This is what some employees here have to face. But what about the employers? What do they have to say?
Those interviewed stressed that they are open to listening to their staff about whatever problems they may have, including mental health issues. However, they admit that a line has to be drawn, especially when it comes to business-critical roles. 
If the employees continue to fall short of expectations or are unable to work for long periods of time due to their mental health conditions, the employers said they may have no choice but to refer the workers to other roles within the company or fire them. 
Still, having to support staff who have reached their breaking point may not be the biggest challenge when it comes to mental health issues at the workplace in Singapore. 
It is actually tackling the stigma surrounding mental illness and encouraging employees to speak up about their problems, based on interviews with workers, employers, human resource (HR) experts, general practitioners (GPs) and psychologists. 
While calls to improve mental health awareness in the workplace are not new, the issue has taken on an added urgency this year with COVID-19 creating new stresses and pressures for everyone. 
And with more people forced to work from home as the pandemic rages on, the boundaries between work and rest have been blurred, taking a further toll on the mental health of many employees. 
But even before the coronavirus struck, the mental health situation here has been a growing concern: The Singapore Mental Health Study conducted between 2016 and 2018 found that one in seven people experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime, compared with one in eight people in 2010’s Mental Health Study.
Just earlier this week, TODAY reported that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is investigating allegations made against a firm here where a former employee has committed suicide allegedly due to harsh working conditions.
Against this backdrop, a tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces was issued last week by the MOM, Singapore National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress. 
In introducing the advisory, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said “protecting workers’ mental health has become even more important” during the pandemic. 
Among its guidelines are:
While these guidelines are a step in the right direction, more can be done in ensuring that these initiatives are not treated as a paper exercise, and that cultural changes are enacted at the workplace, HR experts and mental wellness advocates said. 
Ms Anthea Ong, founder of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, a community of leaders from various companies and national agencies which champion workplace mental well-being, said that the guidelines are “solid building blocks” but it will be up to the bosses to take the lead in eradicating stigma at the workplace.
“If the leaders do not catch on and only leave it to the HR department to go and fulfil the requirements on the advisory, then I don’t think we have actually made a dent,” she said.
“Until it is actually embraced, acknowledged and acted upon by the leaders ... only then do we start seeing these programmes, policies and practices making an impact on the ground,” said Ms Ong, a former Nominated Member of Parliament. 
CHALLENGES FACED BY EMPLOYERS
While larger firms may have more resources to implement the tripartite advisory guidelines, this is not always the case for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), many of which are feeling the crunch from the current economic slowdown. 
Mr Adam Esoof Piperdy, chief executive officer and founder of events company Unearthed Productions, said that SMEs like his are in a “very precarious position” during the pandemic and it may not be practical for them to tick every box in the advisory. 
“Such measures would (require) quite a high investment. I think what we would rather do is to have more informal practices of checking in with each other,” he added.

Even for larger firms with comprehensive mental health initiatives, the issue of employees not speaking up about their conditions remains a problem - one that has been exacerbated by remote working. 
Ms Anuradha Purbey, people director at insurer Aviva Europe and Asia, said that a consequence of remote working is that managers are not able to meet their employees on a frequent basis.
“Hence, it becomes harder to ‘visibly’ identify any mental health and other challenges that employees are facing,” she said.  
“So, we have to rely, primarily, on the online catch-ups and frequent surveys.” 
And like what Mavis and Chloe faced, Ms Anuradha acknowledged that the stigma surrounding mental illness is what prevents many firms from detecting mental health issues in the first place, since employees are reluctant to reach out for help. 
“While mental health awareness has been gaining traction in Singapore, for many it is still considered taboo to acknowledge their struggles,” she said. 
“At Aviva, we want to make talking about mental health as normal as talking about physical health and continue to do what we can do to remove this stigma.""
While there are firms which are willing to cut some slack for employees with mental health issues, they also said that there is a limit to how much employers can do. 
Mr Piperdy, for example, said that he will try his best to get any colleagues struggling with mental health to seek professional help or give them days off if they are unable to cope. However, since the event industry is a client-facing role, he cannot continually make concessions at the risk of letting his clients down.
“At the end of the day, the job scope doesn’t change … if they’re not able to manage the workload that comes in, which is something we actively do, then I think we will help this person to transition to another job, maybe we will look for opportunities for this person.
""We have successfully redesignated some of them, to find suitable jobs in more fixed, permanent (roles) such as working in a venue instead of working for an events company,” Mr Piperdy added. 
“But we are actively trying to avoid that by having early intervention, coaching and mentorships.”
TAKING THE FIRST STEP: BOSSES SAYING ‘IT’S OK TO NOT BE OK’ 
In recent years, some companies in Singapore have come up with a slew of measures to promote mental wellness at the workplace, many of which are in line with the tripartite advisory’s guidelines.
For instance, national media network Mediacorp introduced earlier this month an emotional and mental well-being support initiative that consists of emotional and mental wellness training and a one-on-one confidential counselling service, among other things. 
Mediacorp Chief Human Resources Officer Yvonne Ee said: “As part of our corporate wellness initiative, we continue to support our people with resources they need to adapt positively and perform well, during these unprecedented times.” 
She added: “Through (the initiative), we look to create an environment where staff can build strong mental and emotional resilience, and feel secure as they continue to contribute to the organisation.” 
Biopharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca Singapore said that among its mental wellness initiatives is an internal online platform for employees to discuss mental health issues and queries within chat groups. It also has in place the employee assistance programmes which provide confidential counselling. 
President of AstraZeneca Singapore Vinod Narayanan said: “While we continue to build our open and inclusive culture at the workplace, we also recognise the impact COVID-19 has on mental well-being of our employees and will continue to build that space where it is safe for employees to speak openly about mental health issues.”

In response to queries, business consultancy PwC Singapore said it provides several avenues to support mental health including an employee assistance programme, workshops, support groups and online resources to drive awareness of the subject. 
Online marketplace Carousell said it has a dedicated wellness programme where employees “come together as a team to focus on our well-being”, at least once a month. It is also looking into establishing an employee assistance programme to offer support to employees struggling with personal and work-related problems. 
While companies ramping up their mental wellness initiatives is a positive sign, HR experts said that this has to be coupled with bosses who lead by example in creating a more open company culture. 
Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Economic Development Board managing director Chng Kai Fong had opened up about his mental health struggle during the pandemic at a technology conference on Nov 22. 
Mr Chng - who was formerly the principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong -  said that family matters that occurred in April had affected his emotional and mental state, leading to feelings of “heat and anger” and depressive bouts.
According to Bloomberg, Mr Chng said he wanted to openly share his experience with others who might be facing mounting pressure to lead during times of fear and uncertainty.
“We can do a lot more as leaders to acknowledge that (it’s OK not to be OK) and to share a little bit more about ourselves,” Mr Chng said. “And that builds trust.” 
Otis Asia Pacific president Stephane de Montlivault, who is a member of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, said that being more open about his struggles with mental health meant that employees of the elevator company were more willing to share their problems as well. 
“I shared my personal situation as I happened to also have a number of difficulties (amid COVID-19). I lost a colleague and very close friend who died in a car accident … and shortly after that my father-in-law had a heart attack and was in the ICU,” he isaid. “I was facing a lot of stress, and had sleeping issues, anxieties.""
When he shared these issues at a forum with his employees, many of them started opening up, and subsequently many were willing to go to their bosses directly with their problems, he said.
“(We) made it very open and clear that it is not only okay, but normal and encouraged to talk about our difficulties and to work on them as a team,” said Mr de Montlivault. 
“This actually caused us to take some actions in some cases when we found that people had difficulties when we were constrained by not being able to come to the office.”
Agreeing, Ms Ong said that bosses who are willing to reveal their vulnerable side send a clear signal to employees that having mental health issues does not mean that they will not be able to succeed at work.
“That’s a very big part of stigma in the workplace, (which) stems a lot from concerns with career progression and advancement,” she said. “When leaders are the ones sharing, then it says that it does not affect your promotion options, your career progress, and your potential.” 
Veteran HR practitioner Carmen Wee said that the employer-employee relationship should be one that is centred on the well-being of the employee. “If employees are fearful in asking for help, there’s something wrong with the culture or leadership approach,” she said. 
“If you work in a company where the company respects you, wants to look after their well-being, which employee will not flourish and perform?
”There would not be such a fear if employees “feel supported and don’t feel like their psychological safety is threatened”, she added. 
Ms Wee noted that for cases where an employee’s mental health condition becomes too severe to continue working at a company, firing the employee should be a last resort. 
Other alternatives such as no-pay leave, counselling and job coaching should first be considered. 
“If at the end of the day, the person still can’t cope and the job is still contributing to the stress, there needs to be a heart-to-heart talk, and if everything cannot be worked out, they might have to part ways,” she said.
Even when making such a decision, the company must also be sensitive given the pandemic situation, where it may be difficult to find employment. Employers can introduce the affected workers to new jobs that may be more suitable, or link them up with job courses. 
“Each person’s circumstance is different, so the company needs to examine and come up with an individualised plan,” Ms Wee said.
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD BE SEEN ON PAR 
Although awareness of mental health here has grown, there remains a common misconception that physical health takes precedence over it, when both in fact should be viewed on par, said psychologists and GPs whom TODAY spoke to.

Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist of The Therapy Room, said that whether it is a physical or mental illness, patients can be “struck down” by it for a prolonged period. 
“When they have their diagnosis of anxiety and depression, they cannot go into the office, and someone else has to take over, so it is as bad as having surgery, or breaking your leg,” she said.  
Agreeing, GPs said that they would give medical certificates (MCs) regardless of whether it is a physical or mental ailment. 
Dr Sunil Kumar Joseph, a GP who runs Tayka Medical Family Clinic in Jurong, reiterated: “Mental illness is treated the same as physical illness from a medical point of view, so there is no issue.” 
The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”.
According to the American Psychological Association (APA), physical and mental health are interconnected and cannot be viewed in isolation. 
“Stress can take a toll on our physical health, while physical challenges can also bring new stress into our lives,” the APA said on its website.
Regardless of the literature, Dr Sunil said the main obstacle is the stigma that prevents patients from visiting him in the first place. And one policy that propagates the stigma is company-paid insurance, he noted. 
“Indirectly, (the company) is able to access all your medical history because you signed a waiver to your rights of confidentiality,” he said. “So very few people who are using corporate insurance are willing to disclose mental health conditions, so that’s one stumbling block.” 
He added that a lot of insurers do not pay for mental health treatment. 
One guideline in the tripartite advisory says that companies with flexible employee benefits, such as medical benefits, should consider extending the scope of coverage to include mental well-being programmes, mental health consultations and treatments.
Companies such as Aviva Singapore, consultancy firm PwC Singapore and investment holding company Jardine Cycle & Carriage have health coverage plans that include mental health treatment. 
Otis’ Mr de Montlivault said that as per the guidelines, his firm will be looking to include mental health as part of its health coverage as well. In the meantime, Otis employees can tap internal company self-funded insurance which has been expanded to include coverage for psychological support services.
If employees are hesitant to get MCs for their mental ailments, some companies have a policy where a limited number of sick days can be taken without having to produce an MC.Some employers also provide medical leave based on trust, rather than having to always provide MCs.

Mr Jeffery Tan, chief executive officer of charity organisation Jardines Mindset Singapore and group general counsel of Jardine Cycle & Carriage, said that if employees report that they have mental health issues without an MC, it will come down to “managerial discretion and empowerment by the supervisors”. 
“Even for physical ailments, we don’t always need to be able to produce an MC before we can go off; we can see someone is struggling with an ailment, they can take an afternoon off,” said Mr Tan, who is also part of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup. 
“This is coupled with an element of trust in a safe environment, as opposed to starting off by saying ‘if I have this, are people going to game the system and be less than truthful?’,” he added. “I think those are all the wrong dynamics.” 
Agreeing, Ms Audrey Ng, global head of HR for mining firm Anglo-American Marketing, said that trust is “central to the relationship with our teams”. 
“We know that the overwhelming majority of them are highly dedicated and committed to achieving great results for the entire organisation, so if we see that someone needs a break, we try to ensure that he or she feels empowered to take some time off with line manager approval,” said Ms Ng. 
Still, some employees said taking medical leave as and when they need to is not feasible, as they are on project-based jobs. 
A junior art director at an advertising firm, who wanted to be known only as Isabel, said that the number of projects she had to do during the circuit breaker period increased by about 40 per cent as more clients were looking to advertise online. 
The longer working hours and higher workload resulted in the 24-year-old feeling stressed and anxious to the point where she would vomit regularly and lose her memory while at work. 
She could not take a break as she had to meet the clients’ deadlines, and no one could take over her projects as they would not be familiar with the clients’ requests. 
“In advertising, the mindset is always clients first, and that’s very detrimental on the employees,” she said. 
WHAT EMPLOYEES CAN DO THEMSELVES 
Dr Douglas Kong, a mental health expert and performance coach, said that those who are stressed at work may not be able to identify the signs until it is too late. 
“Those who are under stress, or have some issues in their life that they aren’t handling well … they can’t see it, and they do their best to cope and handle it,” he said.  
He has seen several cases of employees who would not admit to their stress and anxiety, only for their mental health conditions to worsen and affect their productivity. 
“So people think that mental illness is terrible, that you must not have it … But the point is that if you can deal with it earlier... it can allow the person to overcome it and get on with their lives and work,” said Dr Kong. 
Mr Adrian Choo, founder of career strategy consulting firm Career Agility International, said that employees must know “when to back off” when caught in a stressful situation. 
“Employees themselves need to know when they are being stretched and are hitting the limit… (They) need to ask themselves what is more important, your health or your career?” he said. “Because if you are burnt out, you are of no use to your company anyway.” 
For Mavis, the bank employee who is hiding her mental health condition from her bosses, only a significant cultural shift in her company will prompt her to open up about her struggles to her superiors. 
“If I see a culture where you’re talking openly about mental health, and it’s very clear that if I say something about it, not just my bosses but my colleagues will not think differently of me,” she said. “(Instead) it will be something that can actually help me, with people being more caring and it is not something that will be looked down on.
”She added: “But right now, it is a far cry from that.”

Many are feeling the claustrophobia of the situation resulting from necessary measures that limit social activities. Those who are looking forward to holidays abroad have had their hopes dashed with worldwide travel restrictions. Some may be tired of or even angry with the seemingly never-ending spate of bad news related to the pandemic. Some may be frustrated that plans have to be postponed indefinitely while others may feel anxious about coping with the disruptions. Worse still, some face uncertainty in employment and find themselves lost for a direction in life.  
A NEW TREND IN HEALTHCARE
The challenges brought on by the pandemic have given rise to a demand for telemedicine – remote consultations with healthcare professionals by connecting with them through smart devices. One provider of telemedical services, Doctor Anywhere (DA), now has more than one million users across Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam.







                                    

Doctor Anywhere allows users to speak to a licensed healthcare provider online within minutes, with medication delivered within three hours. 



While telemedicine is relatively new in the region, Doctor Anywhere’s CEO Lim Wai Mun said the company’s app has been well-received over the past year largely due to COVID-19. “The pandemic has accelerated a fundamental shift in user behaviour towards telemedicine adoption by at least five years. Since the crisis started, usage of our app has increased by three to four times,” he said.
While most users use the DA app to see a general practitioner (GP) for physical ailments, more are using it to seek advice from psychologists and counsellors to cope with emotional problems.
LIKE PERSONAL TRAINING FOR THE MIND
Mental health counselling does not only benefit people with serious mental health conditions. Psychologist Michael Thong, one of the licensed practitioners on the DA app, said: “Counselling and psychotherapy are useful even for people without severe psychological problems. Counselling can be likened to visits to the gym as part of one’s lifestyle to maintain your health and well-being.”
He added that speaking to trained mental health professionals can help with developing coping strategies, overcoming procrastination, gaining confidence, improving communication and defining one’s identify to discern purpose and plot life directions.
“Counselling can be useful for processing emotions that arise from work situations and responsibilities at home. It offers one a safe space to vent frustrations he feels in his daily life in a healthy manner,” Mr Thong said. A trained psychologist can introduce ways to assess your situation objectively, taking you through your priorities, resources, strengths and weaknesses.
THE RIGHT PERSON TO SPEAK TO
So who should you speak to – a psychologist, counsellor or psychiatrist?
“Psychiatrists, psychologists, psychotherapists and counsellors  all  work towards  the enhancement of the psychological, mental and emotional well-being of the community and are different primarily in the training that they receive,” Mr Thong explained.
“Psychiatrists are physicians; therefore, they specialise in the medical treatment of mental health illnesses that require advanced medical intervention in the use of psychotropic medications,” Mr Thong elaborated. “On the other hand, psychologists, therapists and counsellors rely on psycho-therapeutic interventions and counselling methods.”







                                    

Through the Doctor Anywhere app, users can select a mental wellness expert relevant to their needs and schedule virtual consultations at their convenience.



Mr Thong recommends that those who experience psychological disorders such as anxiety disorders and depressive episodes to seek out the former. For issues such as relationship challenges and career stress, one can work with psychologists and counsellors to find support and help in navigating their thoughts and emotions. 
Users can download the DA app, select a mental wellness expert based on their relevant background and experience and schedule a video consultation at their preferred time.
MENTAL WELLNESS COACHING AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
The DA app eliminates the need to travel and queue, which can be especially off-putting when one is experiencing discomfort. Ideal for those who want a higher degree of privacy when seeking help, the app enables users to consult a mental health expert from home. Users can also choose to have the consultation over a voice call instead of a video call.
Users can select from a panel of qualified mental health professionals available and book 60-minute consultation slots, which are available up to 10pm every day. For the quality and convenience DA affords, one may expect to pay more, but according to DA, its fees are lower than in-clinic fees by about 40 per cent on average.







                                    

Psychologist Michael Thong is one of the licensed mental health professionals on DA’s panel available for counselling.




Mr Thong said he has encountered a diverse range of mental health issues among the clients he has spoken to and advises one not to neglect signs that they need professional support. “Some people tend to ignore issues they perceive as small or not serious, like stress from work or family, toxic relationships, relationship conflicts, feelings of burnout and anger problems. Without addressing them constructively, the negative emotions may build up to unhealthy levels and affect other areas of their lives,” he said.
He advised: “When you notice that your life has been disrupted by mood-related challenges, or you feel overwhelmed, anxious, ‘out of character’ and have no motivation, it would be prudent to have a quick ‘check-in’ with a psychologist or counsellor to find out how you are coping with your daily life and obligations.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/employee-workplace-mental-health-insurance-tripartite-advisory-13586244,'A necessary investment': Why firms choose to cover employees for mental health services - CNA,19/11/2020,"SINGAPORE: Companies that have expanded employee benefits to cover mental health services said the move sends a crucial signal to workers that they take the issue seriously, adding that it makes business sense as well.
Such benefits are among the recommendations issued by a tripartite advisory on Tuesday (Nov 17) promoting mental wellness in the workforce. It comes amid growing attention on the added stress workers may face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. 
“For companies with flexible employee benefits (e.g. medical benefits), consider extending the scope of coverage to include mental well-being programmes, mental health consultations and treatments,” the advisory said.
""This signals the company’s desire to support its employees in overcoming their mental health challenges.""
It is a sentiment shared by companies who have implemented measures to support their employees' mental well-being.
Calling employee benefits the “most visible” part of a company’s stance, Accenture’s head of human resources for Southeast Asia Grace Yip said: “When a company does make a change in their benefits, it’s a firm and clear signal to the workforce that we take it very seriously.
""It is seen as skin in the game.""
The consulting firm incorporated mental health coverage into its employee health benefits in 2018, when it allowed claims for related treatments to be made under its specialist outpatient insurance, but only with a referral letter.
In 2019, it did away with the need for referrals. 
The move was a part of larger efforts to promote inclusion within the company, with other initiatives targeting awareness and education about mental health, for example.
“You can put in benefits, but if you’re not changing the other stuff, you’re not moving the needle,"" Ms Yip told CNA on Wednesday.
“We need to create, in a holistic way, an environment that is safe and encourage people to think about mental well-being and care about others.""
The efforts have paid off, according to Accenture. Internal surveys have shown a 75.4 per cent increase in employees who feel safe expressing mental health challenges to their supervisors.
There has also been a “positive response” on assessments of how supported these employees feel, said Ms Yip.
There is also a business case for investing in mental health, said the executive director of the Singapore Human Resources Institute Alvin Aloysius Goh.
“If a staff’s mental well-being is not taken care of, he or she may become less productive or may even result in leaving an organisation and these will impact the company greatly,"" he said.
“When an organisation looks after its employees, it will reflect positively in their business, hence it is not just if this is a good investment, it is a necessary investment.""
COVERING MENTAL ILLNESS LIKE A PHYSICAL ILLNESS
At Otis Elevator Company, while its medical insurance provider does not cover mental health services, employees can tap internal “company self-funded insurance” which was expanded to cover some specialist treatments, including psychological support services.
This is an “intermediary solution” because the goal ultimately is to have external insurance cover mental health services, said Ms Karine Scelles, the firm's executive HR director of Asia-Pacific.
While the company is in talks with its insurer to see what this plan could look like, the main challenge is nailing down a cost.
“The (insurers) will tell you that they are okay to cover mental health, but they’ll have to increase your premium by ‘XYZ’. I understand they also have to look at economics, but it’s creating the wrong discussion,” said Ms Scelles.
“I really think there is something to be done in terms of having this industry consider mental illness like any other physical illness.""
She added: “People spend most of their time working and so as an employer, we have a responsibility for people to be in their best condition, perform and feel well.”
BANDING TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO HIGH COSTS
Accenture and Otis Elevator Company are part of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, a circle that includes top executives from the private and public sector who meet quarterly to discuss inclusive practices.
A subgroup was also set up to deal with the prohibitive costs of improving corporate mental health coverage.
They are working together in the hope of strategising and negotiating with insurers.
“Once you have a certain level of risk-pooling, then the risk management part of it makes it more affordable, like a critical mass kind of thing,” said mental health advocate Anthea Ong, who founded the workgroup.
“The fewer employers who come on board, the more expensive it continues to be, and it’s a chicken and egg situation. There needs to be a collective coordinated effort.”
The former Nominated Member of Parliament added that out of the recommendations by the tripartite advisory, which include organising workshops or training managers to spot distress, insuring mental health is the “biggest and hardest” to do.
“Therefore, I wouldn’t say it should be the first thing on the list firms should do. But it still absolutely deserves our immediate attention to work on it because it will take time, justification, resources and negotiation,” she told CNA.
Ms Ong added that when employers create a safe space for workers to seek help, people will come forward earlier.
“The earlier you seek help, just like any condition, the better your recovery. That helps the company,” she said.

Named Project Dawn, the 10-member task force involves representatives from the MOM, government psychologists, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), as well as the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) and HealthServe - two non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that help migrant workers.

Some mental health support initiatives have been put into place, and HealthServe has been providing tele-counselling services, conducted via Zoom or on the phone with the workers in their native languages.
HealthServe said that it had noticed a gap in this area before the COVID-19 pandemic and was able to quickly extend its nascent mental health programme during the circuit breaker, when coronavirus cases surged among migrant workers and many were quarantined in their dormitories.

MOM has also started training Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) officers, who are stationed at dormitories to help migrant workers, in psychological first aid, and will extend such training to all new and existing FAST officers.
Psychological first aid is often used to support people in the aftermath of a crisis and involves giving both emotional support and practical help to them.
More initiatives will be rolled out and the task force aims to implement them by end-2022, said Dr Lam Meng Chon, director (medical) of MOM's Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group as he outlined the task force's implementation plan at a media briefing on Friday.
""We see the implementation of Project Dawn as building blocks - we are first looking at raising awareness in good mental health practices as the base layer ... (then) strengthening primary care to improve access to mental health services,"" he said.
A third layer of prevention would be to ensure that those who need specialist care get help and continued support for recovery. 
For a start, NGOs such as MWC will include mental health education in its programme to help new migrant workers settle in from next year, while more frontline officers, dormitory operators and employers will be trained to better detect at-risk workers and refer them for care, if necessary.
Social well-being activities such as excursions with managed itineraries will also be organised in the dormitories, MOM added.
""We are working with our frontline teams and NGOs to ... establish peer support networks that can (be) the first line of defence within the dormitories and offer para-counselling,"" said Dr Lam.
The task force will work with MWC's ambassador network to identify ""peer support leaders"", as well as recruit recovered workers who are willing to act as intermediaries for their peers.
Mr Bava Sahib, an MWC ambassador for five years and deputy property officer at The Leo dormitory, said that the ambassadors have been helping migrant workers with their issues, such as disputes with employers. During the pandemic, they monitored workers for depression and helped them seek help.
Mr Bava and a fellow MWC ambassador told CNA that the workers faced various stressful challenges during the pandemic.
Besides not being able to go out and meet their friends, some have lost their jobs, some have not been paid their salaries and some have faced difficulty going home despite having urgent family issues. 
""We have a large number of ambassadors in the dormitories of different nationalities ... If any workers have any mental pressure or depression, anything ... immediately our ambassadors refer them to us,"" he said.

Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng told reporters that moving forward, such mental health support for migrant workers will not just be a permanent feature, but also a ""work in progress"".
""We're committed to making sure that we're not focused on just the physical wellness but also the mental well-being of the migrant workers. I think that's most important.
""Obviously, this is an ecosystem that is evolving rapidly,"" said Dr Tan, who added that many organisations, in particular NGOs, have come forward to make this possible, and he hopes more will come forward.
He also said that he hopes people will become more accepting of mental health issues, such as depression, which can happen to anyone due to stressful situations.

There are solutions, but hurdles too - CNA",22/10/2020,"SINGAPORE: He was a playful youngster who loved films and bowling. But in February 2018, after a difficult year that left him feeling overwhelmed, Josh Isaac Ng tried to kill himself.
Doctors managed to save the depressed 20-year-old. That was when he confessed to his mother that he had been googling for ways to end his life — and he had found instructions online on how to do it.
From then on, Jenny Teo monitored her only child round the clock. “I literally practised surveillance, diligence, watching him very closely, physically day and night, to make sure that he was physically safe,” recounted the 60-year-old.
She was also angry that there were online guides to suicide. “This information shouldn’t be available to our young people. It can really influence the mind of a suicidal person to make a decision,” she said.
“(With) what he did on social media and all that, it was very, very difficult for me. Because there’s no way to physically monitor 24/7. It’s impossible.”

Four months after Josh’s first suicide attempt, she found him dead in their home.
Last year, Singapore lost three times more youths to suicide than to transport accidents. There were 94 suicide deaths among those aged 10 to 29, the same tally in 2018 for this age group.
And research has shown that individuals use the Internet to search for suicide-related information. While the causal link between such Internet use and suicidal behaviours is unclear, Teo thinks technology companies “probably can do more” to mitigate the risk.
She cited an example last year: A 16-year-old girl in Sarawak asked on Instagram whether she should choose life or death — and 69 per cent voted for death. Hours after the teenager had posted the poll, she was found dead.









“The response literally made her do it. I wish that the tech companies would’ve alerted the parents of this girl,” said Teo, one of four mothers who started the PleaseStay Movement to prevent youth suicide.
Can technology help to save these youngsters? Taking up the question, the programme Talking Point goes in search of solutions, and identifies obstacles in the way.

WHAT BIG TECH IS DOING
Worldwide, a life is lost to suicide every 40 seconds, reports the World Health Organisation.
It is a statistic Facebook has highlighted too, which is why its users can report any post or video that may indicate suicidal intent. According to protocol, the company will push support options to the person at risk.
Besides alerts from its community of users, Facebook depends on its artificial intelligence algorithm to pick out words or images that may signal self-harm.









In reply to queries, the company said it would alert the Singapore Police Force when it has “a good-faith belief that sharing the information is necessary to prevent death or imminent bodily harm”.
Posts are also removed. Between last July and this June, Facebook took down almost 10 million posts, including content that violated the platform’s policies on suicide and self-injury, before users even alerted the company.
On Instagram, which is owned by Facebook, suicide and self-injury content has been made “harder to find”.
“We’re applying sensitivity screens to all suicide, self-harm and eating disorder content that’s been reported to us and doesn’t violate our guidelines,” the company also stated. And it is “directing more people” to organisational support.







                                    

Reporting tools are offered on both Facebook and Instagram.



Search engines can also play a part in averting suicides, more than they are currently doing, thinks Lucas Chae, a user experience designer in South Korea.
One time at university, “stressed out from all the workload” on a day that was “just a little too demanding”, he made a suicide-related search online on the spur of the moment.
The message he got at the top of the search results page was: “You’re not alone. Confidential help is available for free”, along with a crisis management helpline number. He felt the response was impersonal.
“I can’t even begin to imagine how it would feel to people who are actually on the verge of committing suicide,” he said. “It’s going to be a very ineffective way to change their minds.”







                                    

Lucas Chae had ""never thought about anything suicidal"" before his experience that day.



He found out that the click rate for the top suicide prevention link presented in search results was about 6 per cent, which spurred him to come up with an alternative interface in response to searches suggesting suicidal intent.
His design asks users what is bothering them, and they can choose between relationships, achievements, society, body and mind, and feelings. “Any user can relate to at least one of the five categories,” he said.
Users would finally be prompted to click on a page with a “motivational or helpful” quote and a “lived experience of someone who went through something similar”.
“And then a resource or support system that they can directly reach out to,” Chae added.
With suicide the leading cause of death among those aged 10 to 29, this is why he thinks user engagement is important. “These are the people who have grown up (with) the Internet,” he said.
“When they have problems, they go online to find answers … Having a display that shows there are people who care out there online (would) be the most accessible way to reach out to people who need the help.”

AN APP TO FORGE CONNECTIONS
Chae’s interface still relies on youngsters reaching out for help when their suicidal thoughts are detected. There are apps, however, that have the potential to be early prevention tools for people in distress.
CARA Unmask, for example, is targeted at individuals who struggle with mental health and is a platform that connects them to peer and counselling support as a first step towards mental wellness.
Users can select a trained volunteer with whom they feel comfortable having a text chat. They can also turn to a list of therapists for professional help.
“Most of our volunteers, or CARA Friends, are people who’ve been through mental health issues before. So they can share lived experiences,” said co-founder Orapan Hongchintakul.







                                    

CARA Unmask.



Mental health advocate Sabrina Ooi, who helped Talking Point to assess the locally developed app, thought it would be useful for when an individual wants “someone to talk to”, for example.
“There are also other features, like the journal and the community. So it helps to be an outlet for my own thoughts,” said the 29-year-old, who had experienced bouts of major depression from 2013 and attempted suicide in 2016.
Although the app is not designed to be a crisis management platform, its algorithm can detect keywords that suggest a suicide risk when the user is chatting.
CARA Unmask then triggers an alert that enables the user to call the Samaritans of Singapore. The volunteers can also intervene if they feel that they cannot “de-escalate the situation”.
“We can retrieve the user’s IP address and notify the authority. And for users who registered their details, we do ask for emergency contacts whom we can reach out to,” said Orapan.







                                    

Orapan Hongchintakul.



One of the things the app needs, however, is to pick up the new vocabulary youths are using to “communicate that they’re going through negative thoughts”, pointed out Ooi.
“For example, on TikTok … youths are sharing their favourite pasta recipe and even talking about shampoo and conditioner. They’ve actually been saying all these things to communicate how they themselves feel suicidal,” she said.
For the keyword crawler and algorithm to keep up with these trends, the app needs “a bit more users and a lot more conversations to happen”, acknowledged Orapan, so that its team of creators can “learn more”.
The app was launched about two months ago and does not have many users yet, she added. This may also be why the team has not yet had to notify the authorities of any imminent emergency.
WATCH: Can technology save our children from self-harm? (22:55)

There are other limitations too: CARA Unmask works only if those at risk download it and share their feelings on the app; and users must be 17 years old and above.
PARENTAL TOOLS, AND THE NEED FOR BUY-IN
For Talking Point host Diana Ser, whose children are younger, she “certainly would like to know” if they display any suicidal behaviour online. “That’s why it’s crucial that a parental monitoring tool is available in Singapore,” she said.
With help from Lester Law, the founder of app developer Sleek Digital, she found out that there are many parental monitoring apps. But only one, called Bark, can send automatic alerts to parents when its algorithms detect suicidal thoughts.









It tracks interactions, including text messaging and email, on more than 30 apps and social media platforms, and has detected 75,000 “severe self-harm situations”. But it is available only in the United States.
Law was able to code a “simple app” similar to Bark, however, to demonstrate how parental notifications can be sent if children use suicidal search terms on their phones with the app installed. Detecting these keywords was “the easy part”.
“The biggest challenge is to reach out to multinational companies — like Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat — and get their data on our third-party app,” he said.
It would take “probably six to 12 months” to develop an app like Bark. “But at the same time, I can’t guarantee that we can build it unless we have the approval from all these different platforms,” he added.







                                    

Lester Law.



When it comes to getting buy-in in the mental health landscape, big tech companies are not the only challenge, as Orapan found out.
While she managed to update CARA Unmask over a two-week period with the help of Ooi, who had suggested improvements to its navigation and emergency pop-up, she had difficulty ramping up downloads because organisations were not that forthcoming.
“We emailed a few potential partners, for example an organisation that provides peer listening services and therapists for youths. It hasn’t progressed very far,” she said.
“We’re quite new in the market, and we need to get more understanding in terms of how the app could supplement their services. So we’re keeping the conversation open.”
Ooi, a co-founder of Calm Collective Asia, a community for good mental health, thinks organisations are also “wary” of giving focus to youth suicide “because it’s still a very thorny issue in our society”.







                                    

Sabrina Ooi.



But this is precisely where Orapan thinks technology comes in.
“We believe in our hearts that if more people use apps like ours and other mental health apps, the more data we can gather, the more we learn about our users and the more we can do to prevent suicide,” she said.
Ooi agreed that “it’ll be able to help youth manage their mental health”. But at the same time, “when you talk about youth suicide, it’s really about being able to normalise the conversation around suicide and mental health”, she added.
Having previously googled “many times” about committing suicide, her message to struggling youths is this: “Don’t be afraid to ask for help, whether it’s from your family, from your friends or online. There are a lot of support groups out there that can help you.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/talking-about-mental-health-dating-sites-relationship-lovenn-13272542,Commentary: There is rarely a right time to talk about your mental health when you’re dating – but do it anyway - CNA,16/10/2020,"SINGAPORE: To gauge the temperature of a body of water, dip your toes in or run your fingers over the surface before you take the plunge.
Just like you would usually look before you leap, it is generally ill-advised to reveal more personal details about one’s life before you get to know someone better. 
Such details, unfortunately, include the condition of one’s mental health.
It’s important to normalise talk about mental health, but discussing yours so early in the dating process seems akin to throwing the other party overboard into the sea without warning – then expecting them to swim.
Not only might you face a range of unwanted reactions, from pity to uneasiness, ironically you might even end up having to comfort the person you’re disclosing yourself to.  
WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY
But if the last half a year of unprecedented uncertainty revealed anything, it’s the urgent need to start talking about our mental health, from daily anxieties to more severe diagnoses.   
In Singapore, national helplines were set up for anyone needing assistance with mental wellness during the COVID-19 pandemic and its ensuing economic recession, so they could speak to trained personnel.
In addition, Beyond the Label’s mental health awareness month from Sep 19 to Oct 30 has ignited an increase in social media conversations. Some public figures discussed their own mental health, while others participated in the 25-day #pushupchallenge to raise awareness about mental illness.
On Oct 10, we celebrated World Mental Health Day – a day that felt extra significant amidst unparalleled anxiety about our future.  
But our discourse around mental health progresses when we can move beyond discussing it at a policy level, and begin talking about it casually and candidly in our everyday interactions and relationships.

                ​​​​​​​
In the dating scene, however, this can feel particularly nerve wracking.
MIND GAMES WORSEN MENTAL HEALTH
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Those of us who’ve had the fortune, or misfortune, of using a dating app understand the dating industry is propped up by a cycle of approval and rejection, only fuelling our insecurities and, in some cases, affecting our mental health.
Figuring out when to touch on vulnerable issues, like a complicated family background or a previous abusive relationship, remains one of the most crucial milestones in any relationship. 
But faced with potential commitment to a shared future that requires intimate conversations, some might choose to bail.
That is the reason a new local dating app that’s launching later in the year, Lovenn, aims to foster an “honest” dating culture through a premise that encourages users to “share their criteria, deal-breakers and imperfections right at the start before matching”.
I have my doubts, but as many say, a cynic is just a disappointed romantic.

Speaking with founder and CEO Vernice Yap, she shares that the app allows users to “appreciate mutual fundamental compatibility beyond just physical attraction” and normalises sharing imperfections, resulting in “an environment that’s safer for everyone’s mental health”.
This might seem ideal to weed out the ones who would take issue with the state of your mental health eventually. But being more vulnerable than usual before you even know the other person requires radical courage and faith. 
It’s like diving into the deep end not knowing if you’d sink or swim.
BUILDING TRUST 
The average person probably doesn’t discuss mental health upfront because they don’t want to be pitied, patronised, dismissed or discriminated against, thanks to the stigma attached even to more “common” conditions like depression.
Yet, if we foresee a future with the other party, we must risk diving deep before it’s catastrophically too late.
The trick is having the tools to navigate the choppy seas, lest it doesn’t pay off.
Basic trust is the most essential tool, but it requires time and shared experiences. 
The danger of discussing vulnerable topics from the start is that some might use these issues as a way to create that trust, inadvertently conflating emotional intimacy with emotional intensity. The latter forces a connection that is “too fast, too soon”, potentially making others feel extra uncomfortable.
Violet Lim, co-founder of Lunch Actually, likens building trust to filling an emotional bank account. 
“When we first meet someone, the emotional bank account is at zero. As you share positive things, you build up the account. When the account is full enough, you can start drawing from it,” she explains.
“You don’t want to empty it at the start. You need to build a strong foundation – let someone know your other personality traits. Eventually, when you start sharing about your mental health, there’s a higher chance they’d say, ‘It’s okay, I already know you.’”

In this case, mutual trust is necessary to ensure you’re seen as a multidimensional human being, who won’t be reduced to your mental health condition if you decide to open up. 
TESTING THE WATERS
Once basic trust is established, and you sense that you and your partner might be ready to get more serious, the first step is to test the waters.
“The bottom five per cent of our lives are things you’d reveal only to those closest to you. Share the bottom 20 per cent, see how they react, then go deeper if their reaction is okay,” says Lim.
Alternatively, try disclosing mental conditions by sharing how specific symptoms manifest, such as having a depressed mood makes it hard to feel enthusiastic about activities sometimes, rather than using the label or diagnosis to begin the conversation. 
This can be even more important if your symptoms might not present themselves explicitly. 
“For example, people with Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) might find it less helpful to use the label because people tend to have a certain negative impression of BPD,” says Andrea Chong, a senior clinical psychologist from the Institute of Mental Health.
Instead, reveal your condition by sharing the things that you might struggle with in relationships, such as fear of abandonment or heightened insecurity in certain situations, she suggests.  
If all else fails, my personal favourite is opting for self-deprecating humour. 
A viral tweet goes: “I love when guys on dating apps ask, ‘How is a gorgeous girl like you single?’ I’m mentally ill, Brandon.” I, for one, have saved a screenshot for future purposes. 
GO SLOW, BE PATIENT
Once you’ve laid your cards on the table, however, the other party might call it quits. While rejection might sting, it’s a better outcome than keeping significant information under wraps, especially if your condition tends to reveal itself over time.

For example, explains Chong, someone with social anxiety would have difficulty in social settings and someone on long-term medication might show visible side effects.
If the other party doesn’t know how to respond initially, it shouldn’t be an indication of how much they value you. 
“Many people aren’t equipped to handle these situations. Just because they can’t offer the emotional support we want at first, doesn’t mean they don’t love us,” says Lim.
If they appear to be overwhelmed, Chong recommends checking in with them, asking if it’s too much information, letting them know you’re ready to answer any questions or that you can revisit the issue at a later date. 
It’s also helpful to let them know they’re not expected to ‘fix’ you or be their pseudo-therapist. 
The most important thing isn’t that they offer unconditional acceptance and understanding from the start, but that they’re willing to try getting there. 
This effort doesn’t just indicate support, but reflects open-mindedness – a trait that’s crucial in building a long-term relationship regardless of mental health.  
Even though the deep end might be occasionally frightening, having someone tread water with you keeps you from drowning. One day, you might even learn to swim.

They touched on a range of issues, from improving job security to supporting vulnerable groups and the challenges faced by residents working from home.
Here is what some members of the House said about how the country can better respond to the COVID-19 crisis: 
How to improve job security: 
“It is heartening that amidst depressing news of mass retrenchments and job losses, there are still many job openings to be filled … but perhaps MOM (Ministry of Manpower) could share more about … what are the targets set for successful job matches and how will the various agencies measure the effectiveness of outreach efforts.” 
- Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC MP Saktiandi Supaat, who talked about how a resident told him that a career consultant said some employers are putting up job listings as a way to “test waters” but not actually hiring. This practice distorts job vacancy numbers, Mr Saktiandi said.
“Why are Singaporeans losing out in the job market in our own country? Employers repeatedly cite the lack of creativity and risk-taking, not to mention poor communication skills as reasons for this. Our grade-centric education system was also cited as a contributory factor. In addition to facing competition for jobs from foreigners, we are increasingly facing competition from machines as well … with digitalisation accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic, there is even greater urgency to hasten the pace of education reform as old methods of teaching and learning become obsolete.” 
- Non-Constituency MP Hazel Poa
Make mental health a priority: 
“An effort to improve mental health is not only good for the self but good for our country. Psychological defence is an underlying key pillar of our total defence and it will serve Singapore well when any Singaporean - even at their most mentally vulnerable - can trust that society at large will also have their back.” 
- Sengkang GRC MP Raeesah Khan on how Singapore can build on the new mental wellness task force created to address mental health needs amid COVID-19 
“In recent parliamentary sittings, I have repeatedly highlighted the challenges faced by our workers who telecommute. They must juggle multiple responsibilities, such as looking after children, taking care of elderly parents, and trying to remain productive at work. To make matters worse, because they work from home, their bosses think that it is easier for them to answer work-related calls and emails, at any time of the day, even after office hours. Workplace burnout has become an issue, as many employees are not well-rested.” 
- Radin Mas SMC MP Melvin Yong on why the authorities should look into a law on the ""right to disconnect""
Don’t leave the vulnerable behind: 
“The S$500 to S$1000 top-up in SkillsFuture credit is useful to enable Singaporeans to take up new courses and for them to pick up new skills. However, there always remains groups of individuals like the low-wage workers and special needs communities who, even before COVID-19, have been unable to take up courses for personal upgrade. Their reasons for not doing so are varied. Some because they have to balance multiple jobs, others - caregiving duties, lack of funds, or lack of suitable courses catered to them in language or academic qualifications. They are left out from being able to upgrade not due to lack of will, but more a lack of time and the need to first survive.” 
- East Coast GRC MP Cheryl Chan on the people who lack the opportunity to upgrade their skills 







                                    

East Coast GRC MP Cheryl Chan speaking in Parliament on Oct 14, 2020.


​​​​​​​
“I appeal to the Government and its agencies to make an additional effort to provide a better living and learning environment for the underprivileged children. In a knowledge-intensive future, these children will not stand a chance if they live in overcrowded flats with access to borrowed equipment, limited or slow connectivity, and minimal adult supervision and guidance. We may need to tighten our collaboration with the volunteer groups and private companies which are willing to sponsor and mentor these children as well.” 
- Chua Chu Kang GRC MP Don Wee on the need to help children from disadvantaged households during COVID-19 
Help those who fall through the cracks:
“They are often left on their own to deal with their unemployment and its many associated adverse effects. This is unlike those in lower-paying jobs who have benefited from the many government schemes. Specifically, many in this age group have high mortgages to pay, schooling children and elderly to look after. The challenge for them is not just to get any job, but one that gives them a minimal sustenance income.
""It is well and good to say: 'Go for training, upgrade your skills.' But realistically when you are in your 50s, 60s, with mounting bills and financial commitments, you don’t have the luxury of time and resources to pursue a new career. To them, such exhortations are meaningless slogans.” 
- Yio Chu Kang SMC MP Yip Hon Weng on how the pandemic has created new vulnerable groups, such as middle-income retrenched workers with heavy financial commitments 
“We want to make sure that Singaporeans and businesses who need help would not need to jump through hoops or wade through red tape to qualify for funding. For example, many staying in property with an annual value of more than S$21,000 but do not own the property and yet need some help, could not qualify for many of the COVID-19 support grants. Could MOF consider relaxing the criteria?” 
- West Coast GRC MP Ang Wei Neng also suggested that the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS) could be extended for another six months - the last S$3,000 quarterly payout is in October - but be calibrated so that those who are currently ineligible for the scheme could get a smaller amount of money. 
Keep living cost affordable: 
“Here I would like to be very clear that I am not for their own during of resources built up by the blood, sweat and tears of the generations who came before us. In fact just as DPM has mentioned, I believe in the need to exercise prudence when planning for the future. However, we need to acknowledge that the current weak economic environment requires sufficiently accommodative fiscal policy instead of contractionary fiscal policies such as raising taxes on consumption, which might in turn lower consumer spending. We should be focusing on policies that aim to stimulate and boost domestic demand and keep our economy growing.” 
- Sengkang GRC MP Louis Chua on why Singapore should hold off on a planned Goods and Services Tax hike 
Let’s not forget about the environment: 
“Sustainability at the forefront of economic recovery should not be underestimated. The World Economic Forum has in fact called on all countries to pursue, and I quote, 'a great reset. A great commitment to build a fairer, more sustainable and more resilient future following the COVID crisis.' I can’t agree more - may I take the opportunity to ask the Government for an update on our efforts in the past seven to eight months since unity budget and for an assurance that Singapore is on track to meet our goals and timelines for the Paris Agreement (to cut emissions intensity by 36 per cent by 2030 from 2005 levels).”

Some of these patients face adjustment disorders due to the pandemic, presenting anxiety and depressive symptoms, said Adjunct Associate Professor Lee Cheng, senior consultant and vice-chairman (clinical) of the IMH Medical Board.
“Some can’t get used to being retrenched from work; some (have) monetary problems,” said Lee, who also heads the Emergency Services department.
The “circuit breaker” had also affected people in different ways, he added. One patient, for example, had a phobia about getting the coronavirus and refused to leave home; another could not tolerate being cooped up in the house.
The latter, fed up with the social restrictions, would take a “bus to nowhere” and travel round the island.
“Sometimes people get irritated or frustrated. It may not be a psychiatric disorder,” said Lee. “But (for some), these symptoms are too distressing, so they end up coming to the emergency room.”
For those with mild symptoms, his team would approach the patients’ loved ones or even family service centres (FSCs) and counsellors for help.
“We don’t want to over-medicate them … (We) try to draw on their strengths and their coping skills,” he said, adding that those with financial problems would be linked up with social workers.

But there are also suicidal cases — and a lot more that goes on in the IMH Emergency Services department that little is known about, CNA Insider finds out ahead of World Mental Health Day today.
50 TO 60 PATIENTS A DAY
Situated near the entrance of the IMH, the department sees 50 to 60 patients a day, compared with a daily turnover of a few hundred patients at the accident and emergency departments in public hospitals.
The cases are mainly those facing acute stress, said Lee. There are also cases of relapse among those suffering from schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or recurrent depression.
“We don’t call it A & E because the ‘A’ stands for accidents. We don’t have accident cases here,” he said. “We definitely have overdose (patients). But we call it ‘services ’… rather than a department.”
The waiting time to see a doctor is typically under an hour for patients who are given high priority, and about two hours or less for other patients.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
It is as such because the clinical staff must screen for patients at high risk, and must also link up with community partners and the family members to ascertain the patient’s medical and personal history, said Lee.
“The easy way out is to admit (the patient), but we need to be patient-centric, (find out) what the patient requires (clinically), and we fulfil their requirements,” he added.
Patients with no mental illness or acute stress would be discharged without an outpatient appointment, depending on the doctor’s assessment. Sometimes they would be referred to an FSC if they encounter relationship problems.
Patients found to have a psychiatric condition, however, are usually warded or given an outpatient appointment at a later date. On average, 30 to 40 per cent of walk-ins at the Emergency Services — about 20 patients a day — are warded.
The department, manned by a team of consultants, junior doctors, nurses, social workers and pharmacists, saw a five per cent increase in cases last year compared with 2018, partly due to increased awareness of mental health, said Lee.
There has been another increase this year, although the figure will be known only once the year is over, according to the IMH.

OBSERVATION CAN LAST 23 HOURS
Emergency Services staff typically attend to acute cases first, who are divided into two groups: Those who require admission and those who do not.
Those suffering from schizophrenia or assessed as “very psychotic or very unwell”, said Lee, are admitted straight to the ward. The other group of patients are placed in an observation ward, an open area with six beds.
“The staff will take care of the patient and … observe the patient’s behaviour because sometimes the patient may not tell us the truth or they’re very guarded,” he added.
Patients can be kept in the observation ward for up to 23 hours, and the clinical team assessing them would contact the family members to ascertain the patient’s background, situation and medical history.
“After 23 hours, if we still feel that their condition isn’t well … then they’d be admitted,” said Lee. “If we assess that the acute risk is over, we’d discharge them.”
Most patients under observation are “adjustment cases”. This means they face some form of acute pressure, such as a child who refuses to go to school, a couple quarrelling or a conscript unable to cope with military life.
“We also don’t want to put them in a psychiatric ward,” said Lee. “We don't know what the … psychiatric diagnosis is either. We have to be fair … (as) these are mainly acute stresses.”
Where patients are warded immediately, some of them may have been brought in by the police and “assessed by the attending doctor (as) an acute danger to himself or even to others”.
“(If) the patient refuses to be admitted, then we’d use what we call a formalised admission … whereby the patient is admitted against (his or her) wish,” added Lee.
Usually, patients escorted by the police or sent by the courts — for example to determine if they have any psychiatric condition — must enter Emergency Services via a separate entrance and are housed in a different area.
This is necessary as other patients “may be traumatised by those in handcuffs”, Lee said. “We don’t want patients who are coming for treatment (to) get worried, seeing this patient … screaming away or intoxicated.”
ACTING AS GATEKEEPERS
The staff also work with the police in regard to patients who had been suicidal and were brought to Emergency Services.
In these cases, the clinical staff must determine the suicide risk by, for example, ascertaining whether it is the first suicide attempt or there have been other attempts.
Those with a pre-existing psychiatric condition, such as depression and schizophrenia, would be taken more seriously, cited Lee, as with those who have written a suicide note or made a will, or perhaps those with poor family support.

Where the suicide risk is high, the patient is typically kept for observation or warded immediately. “We take it in a holistic manner. A lot depends on the clinical judgement,” said Lee.
His team act as gatekeepers, determining the relevant cases for admission. Patients who do not require tertiary psychiatric care can be channelled back into the community, where they can find support at various FSCs.
The misconception many people have, he said, is that those who suffer from a severe mental disorder must be admitted.
“The diagnosis may be severe, but currently (the condition) may be mild,” he pointed out. “A lot of patients with schizophrenia are functioning in the community, contributing to the workforce. They aren’t a danger to others or to themselves.”
He advised patients with minor psychiatric conditions to seek help from general practitioners with psychiatric knowledge, instead of waiting at the IMH’s Emergency Services.
The department also has a Mobile Crisis Team, who can be despatched to an existing IMH patient’s home to provide support when needed.
Moving forward, telemedicine may play a bigger role in reducing travel among both existing and new patients, especially during this pandemic, said Lee.
This has already started for some IMH patients from nursing homes — they can be screened in situ, which saves on the travel time too.
“Tele-psychiatry is the best way to prevent unnecessary movement of staff in the community and reduce exposure to the virus,” said Lee. “It can also reduce the stigma (attached to patients visiting the IMH).”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/push-up-challenge-for-mental-health-singapore-suicides-covid-19-13238174,Commentary: What good is doing push-ups for mental health? - CNA,10/10/2020,"SINGAPORE: Remember the Ice Bucket Challenge which soaked the world in 2014? It was specific, accessible and fun, but also empathetic.
The act of pouring ice over oneself simulates the experience of muscle stiffness that people diagnosed with ALS - amyotrophic lateral sclerosis - feel. If you could not meet the challenge, you were asked to donate US$100 to the ALS Association.  
Beyond awareness, the viral challenge also helped create a scientific breakthrough. It raised US$115 million - five times more funds than the previous year - allowing the Association to speed up research. 
This in turn identified a new gene, NEK1, which contributes to the rare neurodegenerative disease.
This opportunity for real impact may be what is missing from the well-intentioned 25-day #pushupchallenge currently making its rounds in Singapore. 
Aiming to “build awareness for anyone who is suffering through mental illness”, the challenge asks the participant to record doing 25 push-ups everyday for 25 days, and to nominate a different person each day. 
DO PUSH-UPS COUNT? 
Unfortunately, the very people that it attempts to support are not clear about how exactly it will help them or the larger mental health community. 
A colleague from Hush TeaBar who lives with anxiety and depression told me she “cannot see the link at all.” 
“So what if people can do push-ups? Does that make me feel less alone? No, it doesn't. Does it reduce suicide numbers? No, it doesn't. It just shows me that they're capable of toning their arms”, she said.

Another colleague from A Good Space, who attempted suicide a few years ago, was concerned that the challenge could trivialise the real work needed to create a more inclusive society for mental health. 
He said: “What if people think, ‘oh after I do my push-ups, I have done my part’?""   
In other words, the push-up challenge might be, as a friend who had an episode last year with depression put it pointedly, “well-meaning but tone deaf”. 
This is especially since COVID-19 has illuminated long-existing mental health issues that demand urgent attention and concrete actions.

REAL ISSUES: HIGH TREATMENT COSTS AND SUICIDE NUMBERS 
The affordability of mental healthcare is now further challenged in light of the economic crisis, with more affected, and for longer. 
A single mother I know who has to care for her young boy and elderly mother has had her salary first cut by 50 per cent and another recent reduction that left her with only 25 per cent of her original salary. 
Her anxiety is protracted and intensifying yet she cannot afford to seek help. 
Affordability also stood out as a predominant concern for two-thirds of the respondents to a public consultation my team of volunteers and I did in preparation for my Budget 2020 debates. 
But the issues long predate the pandemic. 
In 2016, a survey of 6,126 Singaporeans with mental health conditions by the Institute of Mental Health revealed 78.6 per cent had not sought treatment in the past 12 months, with 74.6 per cent of such respondents citing high costs as a reason.

Suicides are another alarming mental health issue that may be exacerbated by COVID-19. 
Last year, Singapore recorded 400 suicides - more than one a day. According to the World Health Organisation, there are as many as 20 suicide attempts for every suicide and many times more suicide ideation per attempt. 
A mother in her mid-40s jumped to her death from the top of the block next to mine two months ago. The tragedy happened fifty days after her only son died by suicide from the same spot on the first day of school re-opening in June. 
I understand from an informal suicide support group that there were four deaths by suicide of young people within the first week of June alone. 
VIRAL CHALLENGES CAN WORK
These problems are only too real, affecting people with mental health conditions. A viral challenge should be an excellent opportunity to - quite literally - “push up” actions that directly support such individuals, and make a real impact on the mental health community.
This is especially the case when the challenge counts people of influence, including Members of Parliament and celebrities, among its participants. 
For example, we might mimic the success of the Ice Bucket Challenge and ask participants to push up or donate directly to community mental healthcare agencies, so they can expand their capacity as well as provide subsidised or free treatment and support for those who are unwell. 
For those keen to see structural changes, they could use the challenge as a platform to call for an upward adjustment of Medisave and MediShield to be used for psychiatric treatments, to be on par with other medical treatments.

We could also take a leaf from other push-up challenges around the world to break the silence on suicides here in Singapore. 
In 2013, a viral challenge called #22KILL saw celebrities like Dwayne Johnson, Chris Pratt and Chris Evans posting videos of themselves doing 22 push-ups every day for 22 consecutive days.
It highlighted an alarming statistic of 22 veteran suicides everyday and was a call to honour the sacrifices of those who have served and yet returned mentally broken.  
In fact, I believe this was the first-ever viral push-up challenge for mental health which might assure my colleague from Hush that push-ups were appropriate and intuitive for this specific challenge, given the symbol for health and the military context. 
Unfortunately, this link between push-ups and mental health certainly got lost along the way. 
Similarly, Australia launched a #pushforbetter national challenge for 21 days from May 11-31 this year. 
The aim was for individuals and teams to complete 3,046 push ups to highlight the devastating number of Australian lives lost to suicide in 2018. The challenge also raised over A$5 million for headspace, a National Youth Mental Health Foundation. 
Apart from highlighting the alarming number of suicides, many suicide-related groups, such as Caring for Life and Samaritans of Singapore, do important work and could benefit from direct support from participants of the challenge. 
Or the Please Stay Movement, an advocacy group of suicide-bereaved parents, who recently urged the Government to establish a national suicide prevention office. 
This follows a similar call I made in Parliament for a national strategy towards zero suicides, so as to give the cause a national profile and adequate resourcing. 
COMMIT TO PERSONAL CHANGE AND REACH OUT
Beyond calling for changes to the affordability of mental healthcare or advocating for suicide prevention, one of the most important things one can do is to start with oneself. 
After all, we must be the change that we want to see in the world, as Mahatma Gandhi so wisely put it.   
I had my own brush with depression 14 years ago from a broken heart, a broken marriage and a broken business leaving me with only S$16. 
That night, awash with shame and despair, I even contemplated the distance between the windows of my 18th floor apartment and the ground below. 
It seemed impossible then to get out of that deep dark place. I only managed to emerge because of the strong support system and inner resources I had, and still have.

Everybody deserves them but not everyone has them.  
We are responsible for each other’s mental well-being. Studies have found that social support plays an important role in mental health or substance use problems. 
For example, people who are clinically depressed report lower levels of social support than people who are not currently depressed. And the opposite is true: People who feel more connected to others have lower levels of anxiety and depression.
What personal change or action can we also commit to in order to make a difference? 
How can we nudge each other through this viral challenge to reach out, to listen and to hold space for difficult conversations to support those who are struggling with mental health challenges? 
What concrete steps can we take to provide the social support that could save someone we know from that downward slippery slope? Can we relate to how it feels to have mental health difficulties, without pouring ice over ourselves? 
Like all viral challenges, this 25-day #pushupchallenge will pass one day. Sadly, the same cannot be said with certainty of the challenges of those who have to live with mental health conditions - and these numbers are increasing. 
But we can make use of its current popularity far more effectively and intentionally, to ease the difficulties faced by the latter. 
These specific calls to action improve affordability of mental healthcare, supporting suicide prevention as well as making that personal change for a more mental health-friendly and inclusive society. 
With these aims, perhaps the person doing it would then make each push-up count, and truly uplift those who are actually struggling.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-moh-reviewing-community-support-13210776,MOH reviewing community support for people with mental health conditions - CNA,06/10/2020,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Health (MOH) is reviewing the community support available for people with mental health conditions or suspected of having them, including “current legislative levers”.
It has been working with the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) to develop such services but noted the need for better support.
“MOH recognises that there is a need to better support persons with or suspected with mental health needs and displaying challenging behaviours in the community,” Parliamentary Secretary at the ministry, Rahayu Mahzam, said in Parliament on Tuesday (Oct 6).
“MOH is currently reviewing the enablers for the community support required, which include the current legislative levers,” she added.
Currently, the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act (MHCTA) allows the state to intervene for persons with or suspected to have mental health illnesses, and who may be a risk to themselves or others.
The police can apprehend the person and take him or her to a doctor for an assessment or to a psychiatric institution for treatment.
The processes empowered under MHCTA apply even if treatment is declined by the person or the person’s relatives, said Mdm Rahayu.
MOH’s approach, however, is to “intervene early” before the need to enforce mandatory psychiatric evaluation and treatment, by reaching out to persons facing mental health issues and their families to encourage them to seek help voluntarily.
She said the ministry has worked with AIC to develop support services under the Community Mental Health Masterplan.
The agency has set up 43 community outreach teams as of end-2019. These teams have reached out to more than 300,000 persons and provided assistance to over 23,000 people at risk of developing mental health conditions or dementia, Mdm Rahayu told the House.
The AIC has also trained over 24,000 frontline staff from government agencies and community partners across Singapore, she added.
Mdm Rahayu was responding to a parliamentary question from People's Action Party (PAP) Member of Parliament Murali Pillai on whether the powers of MHCTA can be expanded to allow intervention when a mentally disordered person being cared for by relatives is not allowed psychiatric treatment even when there is no ill treatment or neglect.
Mr Murali, MP for Bukit Batok SMC, said he had filed the parliamentary question based on a case in his constituency.
“The case involved a mentally disordered young man whose parents refuse to allow him to be treated by IMH (Institute of Mental Health) as they believe in religious and spiritual intervention.
""The final report from AIC was that if the family refuses to cooperate, there cannot be any intervention under the current legislative landscape because he is physically well taken care of and he doesn't pose a safety risk,” said Mr Murali.
“I was advised to tell the neighbors to file a complaint with the Community Disputes Resolution Tribunal, as the young man screams very loudly in the middle of the night from time to time,” he added. “Respectfully, I don't think this advice … is useful.”
While he is glad to hear of a review, Mr Murali asked if MOH would be prepared to direct agencies to engage and work collaboratively with spiritual and religious healers in the meantime.
He cited previous researches done by the IMH, which noted “a significant treatment gap” in Singapore with more than three-quarter of mentally disordered people not seeking professional help. Among those who seek some form of help, 24 per cent turned to religious and spiritual healers.
Mdm Rahayu replied that MOH is aware of the case raised by Mr Murali.
She noted that improving support for people with mental health conditions in the community remains “a work in progress”, even though much has been done over the years.
The Community Mental Health Masterplan was launched in 2012. The Government also said in 2017 that it would further enhance and expand mental health services over the next few years.
Among the initiatives, mental health and dementia services have been made available in more than half of the polyclinics here. More than 210 General Practitioner partners have also been trained to diagnose and support persons with mental health conditions.
“A lot has been done and a lot will continue to have to be done, and it is indeed important to enhance these efforts,” said Mdm Rahayu, adding that MOH is also working closely with healthcare institutions, community health partners, other agencies like the Police, and grassroots organisations to build up community networks.
“So the suggestion that the member has raised – working with religious partners – is something that we can definitely look into.”
“As mentioned, MOH is already reviewing the enablers for the community support. We will take members’ feedback and input in consideration during this review and assess the appropriate approaches and recourse that we can take to address such cases in the community,” she added.
MENTAL WELL-BEING AT WORK
A separate parliamentary question from Radin Mas SMC PAP MP Melvin Yong wanted to know when the Tripartite Advisory on Mental Health will be published and whether it could be expedited to better support workers suffering from mental health related issues arising from the workplace.
The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) had said earlier this year during its Committee of Supply that an advisory will be issued to help employers improve mental well-being in the workplace.
The advisory will highlight initiatives companies should emulate, and that could include access to anonymised external counselling service, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early.
Senior Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said on Tuesday that the ministry is “on track” to publish the advisory in the fourth quarter, with consultation ongoing with employers, unions, mental health professionals and civil society groups.
In the meantime, an inter-agency advisory published in April on how to support mental health well-being of workers under COVID-19 work arrangements can serve as a useful reference, he said.
The advisory has a list of external resources that employers can consider engaging to provide support for their workers’ mental health.
Employers can also initiate support to help their workers, said Mr Zaqy.
For instance, supervisors can check in regularly with their workers, talk to them to find out if they are facing any problems and refer them to external help if needed.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-work-from-home-leave-rest-sleep-burnout-mental-health-13203450,Commentary: Cure to burnout requires a pervasive culture of rest - CNA,06/10/2020,"SINGAPORE: Like an anecdote straight from an Alanis Morissette hit, I took leave to catch up on my sleep debt, only to begin writing this commentary. 
The irony would be amusing if my inability to switch off wasn't so problematic that it has resulted in a permanent imprint of burnout on my psyche. 
It’s easy to blame the COVID-19 pandemic and its engulfing sense of malaise for burnout, but burnout has existed since time immemorial. We simply have a term to describe the phenomenon, allowing ourselves to talk about it more openly now.
The first step to solving burnout is to recognise that you’re charred to a crisp, that you’ve reached your limit, and that your constant inability to function isn’t just “stress”.
Some signs of burnout include irritability towards things that didn’t use to irritate, avoidance of tasks you need to complete, and a lack of ability to keep up simple routines, such as checking one’s email every morning, according to senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) Shivasangarey Kanthasamy whom I spoke to. 
Not being able to maintain simple routines has been coined “errand paralysis” in Buzzfeed reporter Anne Helen Peterson’s seminal piece on millennials as the burnout generation.
The majority of these so-called simple tasks would benefit the procrastinator, but “not in a way that would actually drastically improve (their) life”. 
“They are seemingly high-effort, low-reward tasks, and they paralyse me,” she writes, citing examples like scheduling a doctor’s appointment or returning library books.

What’s interesting is, this paralysis doesn’t make you stop doing things altogether. It just makes you stop doing the right – or productive – things. 
CAN’T STOP, WON’T STOP  
While burnout results in physical and psychological exhaustion, we don’t put our entire life on pause once we’re debilitated, even though we should.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Ironically, we develop counterintuitive means to cope with the tiredness, unwittingly trapping us in never-ending fatigue.
Take doomscrolling, a term coined by Canadian journalist Karen Ho. 
It is, according to NPR, to “incessantly scroll though bottomless doom-and-gloom news for hours as you sink into a pool of despair”.
Even though the behaviour stems from a need to regain some semblance of control amidst uncertainty, American clinical psychologist Dr Amelia Aldao warns doomscrolling creates a “vicious cycle of negativity” and fuels our anxiety.
The phenomenon may be more widespread than we know. 
A recent comic from the New Yorker shows a man in bed, with his laptop propped atop his covers. The caption reads, “Wow, it’s only 11 – that still leaves time for me to ruin tomorrow by staying up doing nothing on the Internet.” 
Then there was a semi-viral tweet by journalist Daphne Lee, who wrote about a Mandarin term she learnt that loosely translated to “revenge bedtime procrastination” – a phenomenon in which people who don’t have much control over their daytime life refuse to sleep early in order to regain some sense of freedom during late night hours.

Might it be that the act of obsessively doing, doing, doing is so deeply ingrained in burnout that we’ve come to equate productivity to meaningful work?
Indeed, IMH psychologist Ms Kanthasamy shares with me. She recalls a case where her adolescent client’s mother felt irritated seeing her at home during the circuit breaker and not doing anything productive. In her own parenting experience, she has also felt like she wasn’t “doing enough” if she let her daughter watch Peppa Pig.  
Complementing societal and cultural factors, Ms Kanthasamy says a huge internal motivating factor for chasing productivity is the thought of getting a rewarding end result, like an achievement or better self-worth, for attaining a concrete outcome. 
Naturally, even in our downtime, our tendency is to do something, rather than to just be.
WORK HARD, REST HARDER 
Perhaps the most effective solution to combat the culture of overwork is to turn rest into another goal we actively pursue, another item on the to-do list, another intentionally scheduled activity. 
Enter a German university offering grants to people who want to do absolutely nothing. According to British news site, The Independent, the University of Fine Arts in Hamburg is searching for people to take part in a project “examining laziness and lack of ambition”. 
To win one of three €1,600 (S$2,600) Euro scholarships, applicants have to convince the panel that they will be “inactive in a particularly interesting way”. 
It might seem like a tongue-in-cheek solution, but adopting its philosophy in our workplaces could be the start of solving burnout.
After all, we don’t have long-term solutions to burnout that don’t involve quitting one’s job or the rat race entirely – consequences that suggest we’ve already passed our breaking point.









Cursory solutions, such as taking a few days off work, going on a staycation or building fancy nap pods in workplaces, also generally don’t address the root cause of burnout, says Ms Kanthasamy.
But she reminds me that an individual who’s more mindful and self-aware would usually know when to take a break before even reaching burnout. 
In that case, staycations or nap pods act as preventive measures, not solutions.
Making sure employees rest could include having “rest KPIs”, where the measure of success is how well you can unplug, do anything else but work, and be as unproductive as possible for the period of rest. 
Better yet, adopt a system of punishment, which Singaporeans seem naturally attuned to. If someone were remotely contactable during their leave, they should get penalised rather than commended. 
All this is easier said than done. Many of us still feel guilty for taking leave, even though it’s our entitlement. This mindset is what leads us to clear emails or check in with our colleagues while we’re on holiday to remain “on the ball”, often resulting in the need for another holiday to recuperate from said holiday. 
But when teams are sometimes staffed to the leanest degree possible to maximise profit, perhaps organisations too should also review how they treat human capital.

According to Microsoft’s Work Trend Index Report, 37 per cent of respondents in Singapore cite increased rates of burnout over the past six months. 
“There is a need for greater flexibility and empathy, where companies can help employees create a distraction-free environment and be more flexible and empathetic in their delivery of work,” shares Rosalind Quek, the general manager of Modern Workplace at Microsoft Asia. 
For instance, she says Microsoft has partnered with Headspace to bring a curated set of mindfulness and meditation experiences, which will offer workers the ability to schedule ad-hoc or recurring time for mindfulness breaks anytime. 
But incorporating rest as a systemic solution ultimately involves more than change in policy or processes to shape culture. It also requires a fundamental change in mindset about how we view rest.
REST FOR THE SAKE OF REST
Quite evidently, the cure to burnout is an equally systemic culture of rest. 
Surveys tell us the obvious: Singaporeans lack sleep. In 2018, a YouGov survey showed that only 48 per cent of Singaporeans get seven to eight hours of sleep daily.  
Still, we continue to make sleep a secondary priority because staying awake to slog feels more intuitive.
To rest, we must first believe we deserve to rest – not because we’ve worked hard, nor because we want to gather energy for the road ahead, but simply because rest is necessary for a fulfilling life.

Hustle culture teaches us that we need to earn our rest. If we haven’t been working for 12 hours every day for a week, haven’t produced a remarkable piece of work, or haven’t finished that one task on our to-do list, then we don’t deserve to take a breather. 
We also see rest as a means to increase our productivity, so we can churn out more work in the long run. For instance, Shopee encourages its employees to rest in its nap pods to up their productivity. And sometimes the more persuasive argument for rest is ironically whether getting more sleep might land us a promotion.
While the long term benefits are clear, rest is important for its own sake, even if we don’t do anything productive with a well-rested body and mind. 
The pressure to be more productive after a period of rest ironically negates the point of letting your body and mind take a break. It only keeps the wheels whirring in the back of your mind, withholding you from a true state of rest. 
Importantly, the ability to rest shouldn’t be seen as a privilege only accorded to those who can afford to hit pause on work. 
“Rest is not a luxury. It’s a need, not a want. It’s a need for you to function,” reminds Ms Kanthasamy.
When society is able to embrace rest for its own sake by understanding its value on our bodies and minds, and even our relationships, rather than how it can make us productive, then perhaps we might finally make significant progress in eradicating the culture of burnout. 
We can only hope the fight to rest doesn’t exhaust us any further.

Aside from being a global health crisis that has infected more than 29.7 million people and caused at least 937,000 fatalities to date, the coronavirus also has had a devastating effect on economies worldwide and Ms Tan’s company was not spared.
The writing was on the wall, with her company’s five international branches being shut one after another. In August, Ms Tan was told she was being laid off from the company’s Singapore headquarters.
Ms Tan took the retrenchment in her stride; bolstered by her overseas experience, she felt assured that she would quickly land a new job.
What she was not counting on was competing against thousands of other Singaporeans who had been similarly laid off as the Republic’s COVID-19-battered economy entered its worst recession since independence.
According to the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) latest labour market report, a total of 11,350 workers were laid off for the first half of 2020. This is higher than that seen during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, when there were 10,120 job cuts in the first half of 2003, but lower than other past recessionary peaks, MOM said.
Ms Tan said her confidence took a hit as it shattered the image she had of herself. “Friends will be supportive and say ‘Your CV (curriculum vitae) is fine, you are wonderful’.”
But the reality is, headhunters she spoke to rarely got back to her despite saying how interesting her profile is.
With little savings, she also found herself in the unusual position of basing all her decisions around her finances — something she did not do previously.
“There were days where I woke up just worried about what’s going to happen,” said Ms Tan, who started working when she was 20 with few breaks in between. “The stress of not having a job was very new to me.”
Since she lost her job, she has been going through an emotional rollercoaster. There are days when she is kind to herself, but far more days when she wallows in self-doubt.
“There is always a lot of self-doubt going on in my head,” she said. “I might think that I'm trying my best, but is that the actual best or just what I think is best?”
Ms Tan is not alone in feeling that the loss of a livelihood has taken a toll on her mental health.
Psychologists and social workers spoken to said they are seeing more distressed individuals seeking help due to retrenchment or imminent job loss.
SITUATION WORSENED BY COVID-19 UNCERTAINTY
Mr Praveen Nair, a psychologist at Raven Counselling and Consultancy, said there is a psychological theory that the Covid-19 pandemic has worsened the mental health of the retrenched.
“Anything that reminds people of their mortality or death will cause anxiety,” he said.
“Imagine if a person is retrenched, they're already feeling anxiety. At the same time, you're surrounded by a global pandemic that reinforces that economies are crashing, jobs are less, and that you could even die.
“So you can imagine how that would heighten any existing levels of anxiety.”
Dr Joel Yang, a clinical psychologist at Mind What Matters, noted that social distancing restrictions to curb the spread of COVID-19 — especially those in place during the circuit breaker — have inadvertently impaired the social support that one would normally receive.
""While online alternatives to seeking professional and social support exist, many do not feel as comfortable with such tools and by default would remain isolated,"" he said.
TODAY reported earlier this week that calls to Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), a non-profit suicide prevention centre, went up by 36 per cent during the circuit breaker period compared to the same period last year.
A total of 10,671 calls were made between April and June, compared with 7,844 calls made in that period in 2019. That was the circuit breaker period when Singapore imposed stay-home curbs and shut down most activities to arrest the spread of the coronavirus, with restrictions lifted at the start of June.
Separately, SOS chief executive Gasper Tan said from March to August, it has received an average of 144 calls per month with issues pertaining to job loss or unemployment — a slight increase from the average of 141 over the same period last year.
Meanwhile, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) said the National Care Hotline had managed over 27,900 calls as of Aug 21. Most of the callers were adults above 21, and their top concerns pertained to mental health, marital and family disputes.
“Many needed emotional support,” said an MSF spokesperson.
The hotline was set up in April to provide psychological and emotional support to people amid the coronavirus pandemic.
Ms Audrey Chin, a volunteer duty care officer with the hotline, said most callers do not articulate their emotions when they call. Instead, they enquire about financial schemes available.
“In Asian culture, generally people are not as articulate about their emotions as compared to Western culture,” said Ms Chin, who is also an associate psychologist with MSF.
She said that when the volunteers delve deeper during their conversations, they discover that the callers have been retrenched and are concerned about being able to provide for their families.
She added that it is quite common for these callers to reveal that being put in such a situation has caused a lot of anxiety. “Sometimes (they say), ‘I feel very depressed and I feel like a failure’,” she said.
Ms Lydia Tan, the principal social worker for voluntary welfare organisation Care Corner, said regardless of circumstances, retrenchment can have a negative psychological impact on any person.
However, with the national and global economies depressed by COVID-19, she said it makes it harder for retrenched people to predict when or how they can get employment.
“The challenges of being retrenched during COVID-19 are amplified due to the uncertainties, limitations and restrictions which directly or indirectly perpetuate isolation and feelings of helplessness and hopelessness,” she added.
To get through this difficult phase, a different type of resilience is needed, she pointed out.
Many of her clients who have struggled with financial situations for a long time are very familiar with the resources available for them, she noted.
“It is this new poor, who are not familiar with the resources that are available,” she said, referring to those who have just lost their jobs.
THE ANGUISH AND ANXIETY OF LOSING ONE’S JOB
For a 50-year-old permanent resident, he never expected to be retrenched as he was the only employee in the purchasing department of an aviation repair and overhaul company where he had worked for over five years.
The Filipino, who declined to be named, said despite having his pay reduced, he was eventually let go in early-August.
Among his co-workers who were retrenched was a man who had been with the company for 15 years.
“It puts you in a perspective that loyalty is nothing. You're just part of a statistical number within the company,” he said. He admitted to being “a bit bitter” with the situation as it was his second time being retrenched in his career.
He added: “The situation really sucks and while there is no point in dwelling on the past, it is a bit disheartening.”
He described his financial situation as “good for now”, but said that if he were to remain jobless for another two or three months, it would be a problem for his family of five — three sons aged 12, 20 and 24, and his 45-year-old wife.
Adding that he has been having trouble sleeping, he said: “I think I might be depressed ... Without the support of my family (my mental health is) not going to be good … I would be drinking (to cope).”
Mr Wee Toon Hee, 59, has been similarly losing sleep over worries about his livelihood.
As a busker who does juggling acts and freelances as a tour guide on the side, he has been without income since March when tighter social-distancing measures were imposed by the authorities to limit the spread of the coronavirus. His 50-year-old wife, who also worked as a tour guide, is not bringing home the bacon either.

Together, the husband and wife had applied for the Self-Employed Person Income Relief Scheme (SIRS), which provides eligible freelancers with three quarterly cash payouts of S$3,000 each to tide over the COVID-19 crisis.
But Mr Wee said that their applications have been in vain, despite appealing twice. This has been a point of stress and frustration for him as he worries about how to cope with the overheads for his family, which includes two boys, aged 14 and 17.
Mr Wee said being able to receive the SIRS payout would not help him totally, but it would be a great relief and he would not feel “so distressed”.
“We’ve saved for the rainy days, but little did we know that the rainy days would be (so) long,” said Mr Wee, adding that he is panicking over his family's finances. “My savings are actually at a very dangerous level now. As a matter of fact, I took a loan from my insurance policy just two weeks ago.”
Mr Wee did not look for an alternative source of income earlier, as he was still harbouring hope that the pandemic would end soon.
“Never in anybody's imagination that something could happen and bring the whole world down to its knees,” said Mr Wee, who is currently helping his wife with her home-based baking business.
He is now resigned to the fact that he will have to give up his passion for busking to look for another source of income.
“My chips are all down and I don’t have a choice,” said Mr Wee, though he concedes that it will not be easy for someone his age to find another job.
For former aerospace engineer Tang Meng Kit, the hunt for a new job has left him feeling anxious and aimless because “you’re just searching for something”.
“When you’re waiting, hoping for something … the application you sent a week ago, can feel like two months (ago),” he said.
The 33-year-old has a 17-month-old toddler and a 33-year-old wife who does casual work. He said that he is feeling scared as he is getting the keys to his matrimonial home next week, and is concerned about paying off the mortgage.
He added it has been frustrating when he gets told by potential employers that he is overqualified for a job. “How can someone way overqualified don’t qualify for the work?” he said.

As for Ms Sook Tan, she has taken on two temporary jobs in a bid to ensure that she can still provide her mother with the same level of care and comfort as before.
In the day, she does marketing support for an events production company under a two-month contract role that ends in mid-October. At night, she works as a waitress at a Spanish restaurant.
As she has been working every day for three weeks, she feels that she may be close to a burnout. Still, she tries to maintain a strong front for her mother, who has been asking her to take a break.
She has avoided sharing her problems with her friends since they may be going through their own set of challenges. “Sometimes it does eat me up inside,” she said.
Some social workers said job losses have also resulted in strained familial relationships and even thoughts of suicide.
Care Corner’s Ms Lydia Tan said she encountered a young client who had lost her job in the tourism industry.
As the client could not find a related job, she accepted a call centre job working from home.
“However, it was challenging as she needed a quiet home environment but she lived with many family members,” Ms Tan said.  “It created a lot of conflict in the family and it was stressful for her. She was depressed over her lower take-home pay and strained relationships with family.”
Ms Joyz Tan, a senior social worker at the Fei Yue Family Service Centre, said she and her colleagues have come across cases where thoughts of suicide were triggered by the loss of a job.
“Emotional health can be affected when we strongly associate our self-worth to our job or job security,” she said.
Ms Lydia Tan added that when an individual’s sense of self-worth is challenged, they may feel aggrieved at their inability to provide for the family, especially if they are the sole breadwinner.
She said: “This could result in feelings of high pressure and stress which may affect the marital and parental relationships. In the extreme case, it may result in family violence.”
Dr Yang said there is a high take-up rate for the counselling support under Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that his clinic provides for outgoing staff at some organisations.
“COVID-19 has impacted individuals psychologically at work and we need to recognise that these effects will continue to linger and it is essential to be watchful over our colleagues and ourselves,” he added.
Dr Cherie Chan, president of Singapore Psychological Society (SPS), said that some telltale signs that someone’s mental health may be affected include increased anxiety, social withdrawal and isolation, and increased use of substances such as alcohol and drugs.
She said that individuals might also show increased expressions of anger and worry about providing for their family or themselves.
“This may lead to increased suicide risk should unemployment continue… unemployment and job loss often bring a great sense of hopelessness, uncertainty and perceived threats which studies have shown lead to greater risks of developing mental health problems,” she added.
HELPING ONESELF, OTHERS COPE WITH JOB LOSS
As many workers — especially older ones — tie their identity to their jobs, Mr Tony Leong, who also volunteers at the National Care Hotline, said that the loved ones or friends of individuals who have been retrenched should give them time to grief.
“The loss of a job is still a loss,” said Mr Leong, who is also the director of youth work at a charity organisation CampusImpact. “It is important to empathise and acknowledge this loss and recognise it is a difficult time for them and that their functioning and activities could be affected.”
Mr Nair, the psychologist, agreed that it is possible for people who have been retrenched to go through stages that are similar to bereavement.
“In essence, it may be as follows: Shock, anger, depression, guilt and acceptance. This trajectory, and its impact, needs to perhaps be understood first,” he said.
Mr Nair said there are two forms of coping strategies that could be used by individuals: emotion-focused coping (focusing on one’s own internal state) or problem-focused coping (finding a solution for an external issue).
An example of being emotion-focused, he said, can be giving a pep talk to oneself or carrying out meditation or breathing exercises.
As for being problem-focused, it could just be asking for support or even creating a to-do list.
For those who have been retrenched, Mr Nair suggested:
- Taking time to find out what their real passion is, and preparing themselves for a new working life
-Volunteering in the community
- Taking on any job until something better arrives
- Looking out for opportunities to try things such as starting on a fitness regime, or a new business
- Setting aside time to actively look for a job
- Gaining knowledge in a topic of interest, or an area relevant to building a career
- Being mindful of one’s diet, as foods affect mood
Dr Yang said affected individuals should also try to recognise that what they are going through is “merely a moment of time in (their) life”, and they should try to shift focus on what they can do moving forward.
“In any crisis, there is opportunity, and you want to make a list of all the possibilities ahead of you,” he said.
“For many, they may have been in a job or career that was comfortable but not exciting or fulfilling. If not for our current situation, they may never have spent time to think of what truly matters for them.”
He added that affected individuals should use this time to refocus their priorities too.
“For many, it would be family and loved ones, and also oneself. Practise mindful living and use this time to reset and live by design, rather than default,” he said.
Just as important is being able to talk to someone about their emotions, said SOS’ Mr Tan.
“The fear of being a disappointment and embarrassment may lead individuals to hide their struggles and put on a facade that they may be coping well,” he added. “However, when we are able to openly talk about our emotions and thoughts, it helps to put things into perspective and manage the anxiety one may be feeling (before) it gets too overwhelming.”
For friends or loved ones of those who have been retrenched, Mr Nair cautioned them from treating the subject as taboo, as it could make the affected individual feel worse.
Similarly, he said they should avoid dishing out meaningless platitudes such as “don’t worry, I’m sure you will find a new job soon” or “it is what it is”.
Instead, friends and family should be empathetic and try to understand the retrenched worker as he goes through the grieving process of losing his or her job.
Dr Chan said having friends and loved ones checking in on the affected individuals regularly could help prevent their social isolation and withdrawal as well.
She noted that having conversations with or engaging the unemployed in activities could help increase their “life pie chart” to help them see that their lives are made up of more than just work.
Dr Yang said that many retrenched workers are able to cope with support from family and friends. However, “if their challenges are acute, encourage them to seek professional help”, he advised.
BROADER SUPPORT
On a national level, Mr Nair believes that Singapore could afford to streamline its processes for granting financial assistance to those who need it.
“The feedback from my clients is … that they don't get assistance not because there isn't any, but because they (the processes) are over-bureaucratised,” he said.
An example which he cited is the household income criteria, which could mean a couple being ineligible for financial assistance even though one of them lost his or her job.
In response to queries, MSF reiterated that it provides ComCare assistance to low-income households to meet their basic living expenses, and household income is one qualifying criterion because it is a proxy for family support and wealth.
“However, it is not the sole criterion. When low-income households apply to our Social Service Offices (SSOs) for ComCare assistance, their needs are assessed holistically,” said the MSF spokesperson.
The spokesperson added that ComCare beneficiaries receive comprehensive support, which may include monthly cash assistance for living expenses, assistance with household bills, and assistance with medical bills. In addition, they may receive employment assistance and referrals to other government agencies and community partners for case work and counselling.
If their circumstances have changed, existing ComCare clients can approach their SSOs to request a review of their current support, said the spokesperson.
“SSOs will increase their current level of ComCare support if needed. If the individual or family comes forward with urgent needs, our SSOs will also provide them with ComCare Interim Assistance (cash), while reviewing their assistance package,” said the spokesperson.
Mr Nair noted that apart from being unemployed, another situation that can severely impact mental health is under-employment, where people work at jobs that do not recognise their trained or existing competencies. However, this is an issue which cannot be easily resolved amid an economic slump.
Dr Yang believes that EAPs should be mandated for firms in Singapore. This will mean that organisations have to ensure adequate psychological or emotional support for outgoing and existing staff, he said.
Within the community, he suggested having counselling support — similar to peer support groups in organisations or schools — made more readily available for the public, such as at the community centres.
Apart from seeking assistance at the various family service centres, the National Care Hotline or SOS, MSF said individuals can also find out about available government support at https://www.supportgowhere.gov.sg/
On its part, the SPS has started the “One Psych Community” initiative which puts together a list of psychologists who have stepped forward to help specifically with the COVID-19 situation, by offering their services either pro bono or at reduced rates.
“Mental health should not be considered a good-to-have or a bonus. Taking care of ourselves and being open to addressing our mental health issues is fundamental to our ability as humans to connect, engage and live meaningfully,” said SPS’ Dr Chan.
Amid the pandemic, “prioritising our mental health should be at the forefront together with physical health, given its insidious and invisible nature”, she reiterated.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/suicide-rates-singapore-young-adults-risk-factors-sos-13035710,Authorities keep ‘close watch’ on suicide rates as experts lay out risk factors for young adults - CNA,21/08/2020,"SINGAPORE: People in their 20s are in a transitional phase of their lives – whether it is completing their education, starting their careers or dealing with relationships – and this could result in more stress factors that increase the risk of suicidal thoughts, said authorities and mental health experts.
A recent report by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) found that the number of suicides for those in their 20s remained the highest last year among all age groups.
In 2019, 71 people aged between 20 and 29 killed themselves, and suicide accounted for about one-third of all reported deaths in this age group.
Authorities said they keep a close watch on suicide rates in Singapore, noting the reasons why young adults may be a greater risk.
“During the period of youth adulthood from 20 to 29 years, individuals are completing their education, establishing their careers, or starting a family on their own. These transitions through different stages of life can be a time of great stress and flux in a person’s life,” said the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the Ministry of Health (MOH) and the Ministry of Education (MOE) in a joint statement in response to CNA's queries.
“Without the necessary coping skills and support to navigate crises, failures and setbacks, some may develop feelings of hopelessness and pessimism that can culminate in suicidal attempts.”
The SOS statistics are in line with what psychologists have seen.
“Individuals in this age group tend to be undergoing multiple life transitions that can bring about associated psychosocial stressors,” said Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist from Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic.
“This can lead to an increased risk of developing depression and anxiety, especially within a culture where help-seeking for mental health issues is not common practice.”
In response to CNA’s queries, SOS said that common problems cited by people in their 20s were relationship issues, including family, friendships and romantic relationships, as well as difficulties coping with one’s mental health.
As those in their 20s are in the midst of developing their sense of identity, their social relationships play “a significant role as a protective factor to how one copes with life’s challenges”, said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan. As such, disputes in these “significant relationships” can be “unsettling”, he added.
PEER PRESSURE AND IMPULSE
This is also the period where people are starting to become “more independent”, said Mr Tan.
“The societal expectations of what success looks like often shapes how an individual measures achievements in various aspects of life such as career progression, educational achievements and romantic relationships,” he said.
The belief that they need to be “readily adaptable” and “capable in different areas of responsibility” may instil anxiety or fear in them, he added.
“Furthermore, as youths may tie their self-worth according to what may be most prevalent in the life stage they are currently in, failing to attain their desired outcome may aggravate feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness in times of crisis,” said Mr Tan.
Young adults might also compare themselves to peers as an “indicator of how well they are doing”, said Dr Lazaroo.
“In the last decade, social media has had an influence on how young adults perceive themselves in relation to others. This creates an environment that invites constant comparison with others that may not be necessary or healthy,” she said.
Associate Professor Swapna Verma, senior consultant and chief of the department of psychosis at the Institute of Mental Health, added that impulsivity could play a role in suicide attempts.
“In young persons, the brain is still developing, and the centres that regulate decision-making and self-control are not fully developed until the age of about 25. Thus, people in this age group tend to be more impulsive compared to other stages of their life,” Assoc Prof Verma said.
“The impulsivity, when coupled with the stressors they already face, may make them more likely to act on their suicidal thoughts and contribute to suicidal attempts.”
SUPPORTING YOUNG PEOPLE
MSF, MOH and MOE said they keep a “close watch” on suicide rates in Singapore, and implement various programmes to address mental well-being among young people. 
Noting that the underlying causes of suicide are complex, the ministries said they take a “multi-pronged approach” which includes building resilience, reducing stigma, as well as identifying and supporting those at risk of suicide.
In mainstream schools, the Character and Citizenship Education lessons will be revised next year to spotlight mental health education. Students will be taught how to recognise common mental health issues and symptoms and know when and how to seek help.
“Similarly, the IHLs (institutes of higher learning) have curricular and co-curricular mental wellness programmes and activities for students, which incorporate mental wellness literacy or awareness talks and workshops,” said the ministries.
“Most mainstream schools and IHLs also have peer support efforts to encourage students to look out for one another, and encourage a peer in distress to seek help from trusted adults, parents, teachers or counsellors. We are on track to have a peer support structure and culture in place in all schools by 2022.”
The ministries added that they also work with various government agencies and community partners.
One initiative is the Youth Mental Well-being Network formed in February, supported by MOH, MOE and MSF, to build on the work of agencies and ground-up community groups to “strengthen our ecosystem of support”, said the ministries.
This is on top of efforts by social service agencies like the Singapore Association for Mental Health, TOUCH Community Services and Fei Yue Community Services which offer helplines and counselling to support those in need.
The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) has other initiatives including the Beyond the Label Movement in 2018 to address stigma towards those with mental health conditions, as well as the Youth Alliance in September 2019 to support young people and encourage them to seek help.
NCSS also launched an interactive helpbot called Belle through Facebook messenger and iMessage, which provides 24/7 access to information about helplines and mental health services for users of all ages.
“Raising awareness and reducing the stigma of mental health issues are critical to encourage and normalise help-seeking behaviour,” said the ministries. “Early detection and intervention are key, and people struggling with emotional problems, mental health issues or suicidal thoughts should be encouraged to seek help.”
Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg. If someone you know is at immediate risk, call 24-hour emergency medical services.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-workplace-staff-support-counselling-12970064,"Rise in firms offering mental health support for staff but more can be done, say experts - CNA",08/08/2020,"SINGAPORE: After graduating from university in 2015, Ann (not her real name) joined a non-governmental organisation (NGO) as an events executive.  
Her supervisor, she claimed, was prone to mood swings.  
“One moment she can be very upbeat and jolly with you, and the next moment she will scold you and be very moody - once or twice she shouted at me in front of everybody. So you have to adapt to her mood, which is very stressful and toxic,” said Ann, who is now 27.
“When I first joined I thought it was because I had done something wrong that's why she was treating me like that.”
Towards the end of her four-month stint, Ann started to see a counsellor. 
""When you’re in your job from nine to six, it's the biggest part of your life, so whoever you interact with most would definitely affect you,” said Ann, who left the company because she was beginning to feel depressed.
Communications executive Mary, 27, who has depression, generalised anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, is somewhat in a better position as she can be open about her conditions at her workplace.
But she feels this is only because her condition does not affect her work output and she is able to look after herself.
Even then, Mary sometimes faces what she calls “colour-blind” comments - words that are hurtful, considering that her colleagues know about her illnesses. Once, during a review, her boss told her “you need to learn to relax”.
“And I have to tell them, ‘well, it’s because I have an anxiety disorder’,” Mary said. “They make such remarks often so you have to remind them constantly.”
Both Ann and Mary declined to reveal their identities for fear of reprisal.
In recent years, awareness about mental health at the workplace has grown, both in the public and private sector.
Mental health advocate Anthea Ong said she has seen more large organisations taking workplace mental wellbeing seriously in the last two years.
Citing the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup which she is part of, Ms Ong said that the group has grown from having 25 C-suite professionals to more than 40 today. The circle, which includes executives from DBS, Aviva and the public service, meets quarterly to discuss inclusive practices and the need for mental health insurance. 
The group published an e-guide in May that offers companies and workers tips on adjusting to work-from-home arrangements that could take a toll on some people due to the change and social isolation. 
COUNSELLING INCLUDED IN WELFARE BENEFITS
More companies have also adopted an Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) as part of their welfare benefits. This typically involves access to individual counselling sessions that employees can claim for, as well as other services such as mental health workshops.
Two EAP providers said there has been an uptick in the number of companies signing up to offer counselling to their employees. 
Counselling and Care Centre, for instance, has seen the number of client organisations double from 10 in 2017 to 20 in 2019, said the centre's partnerships manager Anu Cherian.
Meanwhile the Singapore Anglican Community Services (SACS) has seen a tenfold increase in the number of client organisations since it launched the EAP in late 2017, a spokesperson said. 
Sometimes an individual has family and grief issues to talk through. Very often, employees want to deal with what is happening in the workplace such as the long hours, stress or when the company undergoes restructuring, said Ms Cherian.
Companies which have adopted EAP know that social and psychological wellbeing affects productivity, said the service providers. 
A National Council of Social Service (NCSS) study in 2017 found that for every S$1 invested in a ""workplace adjustment"" like flexi-work arrangements and means to get counselling, a company is able to generate an average of S$5.60 in returns as workers were more productive and made fewer medical claims. 
In the public service, some of the latest efforts to address mental health include iWorkHealth, an online tool that allows employers and workers to identify factors of workplace stress. It was piloted last October and the aim is to launch the programme later this year. 
In January, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices announced that people with mental health conditions no longer need to declare this information in job application forms. 
And in March, the Ministry of Manpower said it will be issuing an advisory to help employers take steps to improve mental wellbeing in the workplace by the end of 2020. 
The advisory will lay out what companies can do, which could include access to anonymised external counselling services, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early.
CHANGING MINDSETS, MENTAL HEALTH-FRIENDLY CULTURE NEEDED
While observers in this field lauded the progress made, they said there is still room for improvement in changing mindsets.
“Mental healthcare in Singapore is not culturally supported and integrated into communities as with other developed nations,” said Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist at Inner Light. “Our main goal should be to develop a more open and accepting culture.”
She noted that despite the initiatives, most of her clients who struggle with work-related burnout said that their firms do not prioritise mental health. 
The stigma against mental health issues creates a belief that they will be judged as weak if they were to voice their distress openly, Dr Lazaroo added.
What needs to be done, she said, is to create a “mental health-friendly culture”, where employers go for mental health awareness training, conduct workshops to manage burnout, provide avenues for workers to seek help, as well as create non-discriminatory policies. 
They could also look at improving the office environment, for instance, by having a well-stocked pantry and rooms where employees can use for work discussions or for time-outs, said Yvonne Low, the head of Singapore Association for Mental Health’s MINDSET Learning Hub. 
Companies stand to lose much from neglecting employee mental healthcare, Dr Lazaroo added, as it could result in negative behaviour in the office like resentment between colleagues, shouting matches and unnecessary tension. These could lead to early resignations.  
Similarly, Ms Ong listed other actions employers can take, such as allaying fears that career progression and performance are linked to one’s mental health, or have managers share their struggles so that it normalises mental distress.
Ann, for one, wished she had access to mental health services like the EAP at her previous company.
“I think it's a top thing,” she said. “If the person on top actually understands what mental wellbeing at work is, makes it known and introduces official policies as evidence, then I actually feel like it is a safe place.
“Rather than say, harping on the fact that you are so mental health-oriented when you don’t have procedures in place for people to talk about workplace mental health issues in confidence.”
One company that has put in place measures to deal with mental health is social enterprise The Social Space, which operates two lifestyle stores at Chinatown and Marina One. It decided to make flexible work hours a given when it started in 2018. 
“We knew the individuals we hired came with their own unique set of challenges that would require flexibility,” said co-owner Daniel Yeow. The cafe it runs has 15 employees, five of whom have mental health illnesses.

The medication they take to manage their conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder, depression and bipolar disorder makes them tired easily and impossible to work regular working hours, he said. 
Workplace policies aside, Mr Yeow said he has had to spend time reaching out to his employee’s support network - family members, doctors and social workers - to make sure they are taken care of. 
Once, they closed for half a day on a Saturday - their busiest day of the week - to let employees resolve disputes they had among themselves. 
These measures have affected productivity and consequently profits, he said. But Mr Yeow believes that “by doing the right thing, we will attract customers that appreciate what we stand for and … continue to support us"".
POLICIES TO NORMALISE NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH CARE
More policies that normalise mental wellness should be legislated, said observers. 
Ms Ong pointed to laws in other countries that Singapore could follow. In Germany, employers are legally required to carry out workplace risk assessments - with countermeasures in place - that account for psychosocial hazards, not just physical ones. 
In Australia, workers can make claims for psychological injuries or mental disorders that are work-related.
In Singapore, mental illnesses are covered under the Work Injury Compensation Act if they are linked to a work accident, according to Mr Zaqy Mohamad in Parliament last year during the debate on the Work Injury Compensation Bill.
The Government could also provide grants for companies to carry out mental health programmes and present awards to those who promote mental wellness at the workplace, said Porsche Poh, the executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore).
The COVID-19 crisis has made the need to address mental health struggles all the more pertinent, added Ms Ong. 
She referenced a study done by Qualtrics between end-March and early-April across Australia, France, Germany, New Zealand, Singapore, the UK and the US, which found that 41.6 per cent of more than 2,000 respondents said that their mental health has declined since the outbreak.
In Singapore, EAP providers also said they saw interest in their programme go up at the start of the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"". SACS saw a 67 per cent rise in enquires on the EAP service in April, it said.
“Presumably (with) the work-from-home situation and the changes a lot of employees had to get adapted to … more employers might be looking at taking care of their employees,” said Ms Cherian.
Ms Ong said it is urgent for employers and government leaders to prioritise mental health, especially during the time of pandemic.
The United Nations had warned in May of a global mental health crisis due to COVID-19, as millions of people face death, disease, isolation, poverty and anxiety, and urged governments to put the issue front and centre as they tackle the pandemic. 
“Social isolation, employment uncertainty, and the virus itself have combined to shock the health and wellbeing of employees around the world,” she said. 
“In a time of COVID-19, mental health is (what) contributes to our social and psychological resilience as a people.”
Editor's note: This story has been updated to reflect the number of  staff members with mental health conditions employed by The Social Space, which has clarified that as of August, they have five such employees, not 12.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-workers-mental-health-suicides-covid-19-mom-12989854,"COVID-19: No spike in number of migrant worker suicides, says MOM - CNA",06/08/2020,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said it has not observed a spike in the number of migrant worker suicides compared to previous years, although it is aware of recent incidents involving workers living in dormitories.
“The Ministry of Manpower is aware of the recent spate of suicides and attempted suicides involving migrant workers living at the dormitories,” said MOM late on Wednesday (Aug 5) in response to CNA’s queries.
“While we have not observed a spike in the number of migrant worker suicides compared to previous years, we are monitoring the situation and are working closely with our partners and NGOs to enhance our mental health support programmes for the workers.”
More than 300,000 migrant workers living in dormitories had been placed in lockdown in April as part of the Government’s strategy to curb the spread of COVID-19.
In recent weeks, there have been questions about the state of workers’ mental health following reports of unnatural deaths.
On Jul 24, a 37-year-old Indian worker was found dead at 512 Old Choa Chu Kang Road. According to the police, this is a case of an “unnatural death” and investigations are ongoing.
In May, a 27-year-old migrant worker from Bangladesh was found motionless at a factory converted dormitory in Kranji.
A few weeks before that, a 46-year-old Indian national died from his injuries after being found motionless at a staircase landing at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital.
Videos have also circulated online, with some showing workers standing precariously on rooftops and high ledges.
One of these videos, posted sometime around Jul 22, shows a worker standing on a ledge at PPT Lodge 1B dormitory in Seletar.
The worker, who was staying in a block that was cleared of COVID-19, had bought a flight ticket home on his own and became agitated when his employer “was not facilitative of his return”, MOM had said in a Facebook post. 
A dispute occurred as the worker did not discuss with his employer his intention to return home, MOM had said. He was allowed to leave Singapore the next day.







                                    

A screenshot of a video that circulated online showing a man standing on top of a dormitory railing. MOM said a dispute had occured between the worker and his employer. 



On Aug 2, another worker had appeared to harm himself at his dormitory in Sungei Kadut. Photos circulating online show a man lying bloodied on a stairwell.
MOM told CNA in an earlier statement that said the man is in stable condition. 
""Checks by MOM found that the worker had no salary arrears, and his food and accommodation were provided for. There was also no indication that he was in distress prior to the incident,"" the ministry said.
Given the recent incidents, MOM said its Forward Assurance and Support Teams - public officers stationed at the dormitories – have stepped up efforts to “proactively look out for residents whom they assess may benefit from speaking to a mental health counsellor”.
“We have also worked with IMH to train and better equip frontline staff with the knowledge and skills to help workers who may require support,” it added.
MENTAL HEALTH HIT BY CONFINEMENT, UNCERTAINTY OVER JOBS: HELP GROUPS
Uncertainties over their health, jobs and prolonged confinement have affected the mental state of many migrant workers during the COVID-19 pandemic, migrant worker advocacy groups said.
According to Mr Justin Paul, non-profit organisation HealthServe’s mental health programme manager, there have been more cases of workers trying to harm themselves or who have expressed a desire to do so because of the stressful situation.
His organisation has seen an increase in the number of workers tapping their mental health services. 
In April, 71 workers reached out to them through their virtual advisory sessions, counselling services and online group therapy sessions. It saw 244 workers in June and 207 in July. In total, HealthServe received queries from about 750 workers so far.

“Broadly-speaking they are stressed by various uncertainties,"" said Dr Chan Lai Gwen, a psychiatrist based at Tan Tock Seng Hospital who volunteers with HealthServe.
Listing their concerns, Dr Chan said: ""Whether they will eventually contract COVID-19, whether they may get reinfected after recovery and returning to the dormitory, how long more their quarantine (or) isolation will last, whether they will be able to return home and see their families, whether they will be physically fit to go back to work, whether they still have a job to return to (and) whether their work permits will be renewed.""

The situation reached a breaking point right after the “circuit breaker” ended, said Mr Paul. Workers who had been cooped up for two months thought they would finally be able to return to their jobs, but that did not happen.
“When Jun 2 came and went, a lot of the workers who were holding back and had accumulated stress from April started to break in different ways,” he said, adding that HealthServe’s counselling team started to see an increase in workers expressing self-harm and suicidal thoughts. 
For Chinese national workers, the stress was compounded by news of people in China returning to work. Family members back home began to pressure them for money, he added.

In cases of attempted suicides, MOM said that based on its records and engagements with the NGOs, such incidents stem from problems workers face back home, such as marital or familial issues, or unforeseen mishaps in their home countries. 
“Due to the current COVID-19 situation, migrant workers may face delays in returning home, thereby causing distress as they are unable to be with their families,” said MOM on Wednesday.
“MOM has been facilitating workers’ return to their home countries. But as there are various factors involved, such as ensuring that these workers have recovered and have taken a swab test as required by some home countries, we seek employers’ and workers’ understanding that it may take some time for workers to be able to return home.”
Rights groups CNA spoke to said another factor affecting migrant workers during this period is their living environment.
Conflicts are inevitable when several workers of different cultural and religious backgrounds stay in a room 24/7, said Mr Samuel Gift Stephen, founder of the Alliance of Guest Workers Outreach.
“Imagine if one guy is praying and another is playing music in the background … You know how important their religion is. If they can’t practise it properly, it’s definitely going to affect their mental state,” said Mr Stephen, whose organisation reaches out to South Asian workers living in dormitories.
Then there are recovered workers staying in hotels and cruise ships. With strict measures limiting movement and rooms without windows, many workers felt disoriented, said Mr Cai Yinzhou, co-founder of the COVID-19 Migrant Support Coalition. 
The same goes for workers at community care facilities, added Mr Paul, who cited an example of once seeing a large group of men at the Singapore Expo crowding around a tiny hole where sunlight was seeping through near a makeshift toilet. 
“One worker asked if it was Thursday when it was a Saturday,” said Mr Cai who had visited the workers. “Some of them can’t sleep. Or when they do, (they) have nightmares.”
Comments on social media platforms claiming that the workers are having a good time in the hotels and cruise ships have been particularly demeaning, said Mr Cai.

Lately, more workers have expressed a desire to return home to recuperate, said Dr Chan, who has also seen cases of workers who have thoughts of harming themselves. 
“Everyone involved with migrant workers needs to be aware of the stress they are facing and the real risk of suicide and self-harm when the sense of desperation escalates,” Dr Chan said. “Suicide is preventable.”
HELP AVAILABLE
Mental health resources are available to workers, MOM said on Wednesday.
“We have made considerable effort to keep workers up to date on COVID-related efforts, through daily messages and also materials in their languages to promote the mental health and well-being of workers. These materials encourage workers to identify symptoms of distress, look out for one another, be a buddy to a friend, and know where to seek help,” said the ministry.
It added that to reduce the effect of isolation, time has been scheduled for workers to leave their rooms and access common areas. The ministry said it has also worked with NGOs to run activities such as exercise sessions.
“Moving forward, when community and dormitory cases have been sustained at low levels for a period of time, we are planning for migrant workers to be able to leave their dormitories for the Recreational Centres in a measured and safe manner,” said MOM.

The NGOs have been also trying to help the workers in other ways.
For instance, Mr Cai’s group has been delivering goods like coffee, tea and shavers to the workers since the circuit breaker. More than a million of these items have been given out, he said. 
The volunteers have also been running engagement programmes to befriend workers and cut their hair.
“Some of their hair are so long, and it’s so uncomfortable for them,” he said. “Just snipping it off gives them quite a bit of respite.” 
Recently, a virtual town hall was held for about 60 workers where a doctor and some migrant workers explained the current situation and policies and took questions.
Mr Stephen’s group is working with 300 factory-converted dormitories to deliver meals and befriend the workers who pick up the food. 
His organisation is also in the midst of setting up an e-counselling service that matches workers with professional counsellors from their home country.
SOME EMPLOYERS DO THEIR PART
Employers have also been trying to do their part.
Ms Calsia Lee, director of interior design firm Collective Designs, said she and her colleagues call their workers at least once a week and send them cakes occasionally. There is a WhatsApp chat group for them to reach out anytime.
The company has reassured them that they will still have a job when they are allowed to leave, Ms Lee added.
“The whole company feels sorry for them, and heartbroken, looking at their living conditions. They haven't had the autonomy to simply go for a walk, to stretch or pick up a hobby at home, like the rest of us did,” she said. 
“We empathise with their fears of contracting COVID-19, the uncertainty of their future, their being away from family.”
Mr Xu Xu Ping, managing director of Chian Teck construction firm, echoed the sentiments.  
Since the beginning of the dormitory isolation, Mr Xu and other members of the upper management team began planning activities for workers to boost their morale.

Mr Xu's workers receive small gifts like milk powder from the company occasionally. (Photo: Xu Xu Ping). 



“We treat ourselves like we are the workers inside,” said Mr Xu. ""All these little efforts we try to do is to show them that we care.” 
Such activities include weekly games with small prizes to be won, sending Chinese herbs to “boost their immune systems” and even getting their company engineers to double up as English teachers over virtual classes.
Sometimes he sends his workers encouraging video messages and notes. 
“We really need the morale from the workers,” Mr Xu said.




                        

A worker leads his colleagues through some exercises while inside the dormitory. They filmed it to show Mr Xu. 



Short-term anxieties aside, Mr Xu and his team is trying to focus on the possible long-term effects of the workers’ strained mental health.
“Some of them (workers) are calling us to say, ‘please let me go back, I don’t want to stay here anymore’
""If let’s say there’s a chance for the workers to go home, we expect 30 per cent to just leave without second thoughts,” he said.
“I think this this period of lockdown is like a wound for the workers,” he added. “It’s not going to heal so fast and if the workers (are) not with Singapore then we are going to have a massive shortage of skilled workers when we restart construction.” 
One worker who is planning to head home to China is Mr Siang Chonglin (not his real name).
A sole breadwinner, the 51-year-old construction worker has not been able to go back to work. For almost three months, he has been at Seletar East Camp, which is among the temporary accommodations arranged for migrant workers who are well.
When CNA spoke to Mr Siang on Jul 25, the Chinese national’s hopes of returning to his dormitory had been dashed because some workers in the camp tested positive during a round of swabbing on Jul 20. 
“It’ll be a lie to say that I’m not disappointed now,” said Mr Siang, who asked that his name be changed in this report given fears that it would affect his plans to return to China.
“HAVE TO PLAY OUR PART TO CURB THE VIRUS”
Four months since the lockdown was imposed, nearly 90 per cent of these workers have either recovered or been tested to be free from COVID-19. Even then, they are allowed to leave the dormitories only for work and must return immediately after that.
Although workers struggled through the lockdown, there are many who understand the need for such measures.
“I understand the lockdown. We cannot leave because otherwise we are a security risk to the rest of Singapore,” said Hasan Najmul who has mostly been confined in his room at a Choa Chu Kang dormitory since April.
The only time he felt down was during his quarantine in July, said the 24-year-old Bangladeshi. He was afraid he had contracted COVID-19.
“My bosses called me, tell me 'don’t worry',” said Mr Hasan, who has been in Singapore for six years. “They are very good. Send food, give us our pay.”







                                    

Hasan Najmul, a 24-year-old Bangladeshi, said that he understands the need to keep workers like him isolated in order to stop the virus from spreading. (Photo: Hasan Najmal)




Mr Paul said while he has seen workers in distress, others have told him they feel well-supported by employers. Some have written to the authorities to express their gratitude over the care they received. 
“The Government is doing the best to give us what we need. They are spending money on us,” added Fan Bing, a 48-year-old Chinese national who has been in Singapore for 17 years. “I’m satisfied.”
Mr Bing has been spending his time on movies, social media app Douyin, reading the news and chatting with his bunkmates. 
“We are anxious to start work. But I wouldn’t dare to go back to work if the virus was still out there.
“There’s no choice. We just have to play our part to curb the virus … and be open-minded about the situation,” he said. “I’m hoping it’ll end soon too.” 
Where to get help: Various migrant worker charities operate hotlines, including HealthServe (+65 3138 4443), Migrant Workers' Centre (+65 6536 2692), Humanitarian Organization for Migration Economics (6341 5535) and Transient Workers Count Too (6297 7564). Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg. If someone you know is at immediate risk, call 24-hour emergency medical services.

SINGAPORE: If losing one’s sense of taste is a symptom of having COVID-19, then judging by my slew of recent interests, some might say I have the virus. 
Being a reporter, I tend to be drawn to serious hobbies that overlap with my work, from diving into 10,000-word non-fiction articles to spending days going down rabbit holes after watching a gripping documentary. Even outside of work, I genuinely enjoy keeping abreast with local current affairs and frequently seek out different perspectives on policies. 
But since the pandemic set in, my pastimes have turned comparatively asinine. 
I binge-watched Netflix reality TV show Love Is Blind and Korean drama Crash Landing On You over several days, even before the circuit breaker kicked in. 
At the height of my obsession, I spent hours scrolling through the actors’ Instagram accounts. Each curated square satiated my curiosity about their homes, their relationships and their lives, and gave me more fodder for overly invested analyses about their social media personas. 
While I previously turned up my nose at mainstream food trends, I now relished every video documenting another deranged attempt at whipping up Dalgona coffee.
I developed an unhealthy obsession with ASMR mukbang. One moment I’d be watching someone eat fried chicken dipped in cheese; the next, I’d be thinking about KFC at 2am. 
I might not have picked up baking because I wasn’t too keen to burn down my house, but I readily jumped onboard the burnt cheesecake bandwagon. Suddenly, I wanted nothing more than to hunt down every bakery that sold these sweet and salty desserts. 
I also began to devour far more lifestyle blogs, pinning several pop culture sites to the top of my Facebook feed as a way to counter the perpetually gloomy COVID-19 news cycle. 
And as far as work went, I ditched news sites and turned to Instagram meme accounts and Tik Tok videos to understand everything going on in the world, including local politics during our General Election.
These banal pursuits were the main sources of comfort getting me through this hell of a year. Yet not too long ago, I would’ve classified them as “guilty pleasures” and be less inclined to embrace them, lest I appeared hopelessly mainstream, shallow and plebeian. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Not to be dramatic, but the pandemic made me confront my subconscious cultural snobbery.

THE GUILT IN GUILTY PLEASURES 
With COVID-19 as a backdrop to our everyday lives for the foreseeable future, we’ve inevitably begun to carry around collective dread and uncertainty, adding a sense of heaviness to the new normal. Because we can’t travel like we used to, the desire to escape is even stronger. 
Prior to 2020, embracing guilty pleasures was an encouraged indulgence at best. 
But the news cycle fatigue from being increasingly bombarded with heavy topics, like politics, social issues and the latest COVID-19 deaths, almost makes it necessary to pursue hobbies and interests that are deemed peak frivolity. 
That said, exacerbated by current circumstances, my newfound appreciation for the lighter aspects of life, such as watching Tik Tok dances over reading the news, isn’t exactly escapism. Choosing mindless pursuits doesn’t mean I wilfully turn a blind eye to the state of the world. 
After all, humans contain multitudes. We should be able to debate issues on race in the same breath that we discuss celebrity breakups during quarantine. 
Even then, these relatively trivial pursuits started to feel self-indulgent over time. 
In my case, I felt like I was disappointing the proverbial cultural elite whenever I chose to tune out current affairs to pursue interests with zero intellectual value, as though I accorded myself a luxury we can’t afford in this climate. 
Once upon a time, I used to entertain online debates with friends and strangers about social issues, enthusiastically dishing out hot takes on the topic of the day. I’d feel accomplished whenever I managed to sway someone’s opinion, and similarly, when I absorbed new perspectives. 
Now, I wanted nothing more than to discuss the relationship dynamic of the couples in Love Is Blind or watch another video of a micro-influencer trying to bake bread or make Dalgona coffee — and I felt guilty for this preference.

IT’S NOT ABOUT ESCAPISM, IT’S ABOUT JOY 
I suspect part of the guilt stems from an elitist mindset that dictates certain TV shows, films, books or songs are too lowbrow to be taken seriously. That is, anyone who openly professes a liking for these forms of popular culture or mainstream trends should feel embarrassed for appearing uncultured. 
Part of the concept of guilty pleasures lies in the value that society places on suffering or pain. 
In a New Yorker interview with Laura Frost, an American professor of literary studies, she addresses the “troubled relationship between pleasure and modernism”. 
Frost suggests that modernists “distinguished between pleasure that was too easy and the difficulties of real art”, yet they were “so invested in dismissing easy pleasure that they could feel righteous in their preferences”. 
Essentially, pure enjoyment without educational value is frowned upon. 
But this school of thought inadvertently turns personal enjoyment into another person’s responsibility, when their judgments about the quality of what brings you enjoyment should have little to no effect on your experience.

Likewise, The Atlantic contributor Noah Berlatsky writes about the pointlessness of being ashamed of personal taste: “Society imposes guilt and denies pleasure. To be true to yourself, to resist social control, you need to own your authentic loves.” 
But being unabashed about what you love doesn’t immediately render all forms of guilt unproductive, as guilt can sometimes signal “real and valuable individual uncertainty” about one’s tastes, argues American essayist Mark Dery. 
In such instances, Dery states that guilt is okay if it’s a sign of intellectual honesty and genuine ambivalence, rather than due to a fear of mockery from other people who only act as repressive killjoys. 
In the end, the fads that came and went with the circuit breaker reminded me that it was necessary to continue doing comparatively mundane things when the world was falling apart. 
From ordering surprise meals for friends to reposting Instagram bingo templates, not only do these activities keep us sane, they also bring genuine enjoyment. 
Appreciating these basic and mainstream trends without shame, especially since they made me happy, wasn’t about burying my head in the sand and choosing to remain oblivious about the world. 
Quite simply, it was a conscious decision to make space in my life to cultivate unadulterated joy — arguably, the most effective form of rebellion in a world that is progressively depressing.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-mental-health-platform-launched-mindline-sg-12909640,COVID-19: One-stop mental health platform launched to match users with resources and helplines - CNA,07/07/2020,"SINGAPORE: A website with various resources on mental health was launched on Tuesday (Jul 7) to help users assess their wellbeing and match them with forms of assistance if needed. 
The website, called mindline.sg, was developed by teams from the MOH Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) and the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).
In a press release, they said the platform consolidates access to many resources and tools to help people ""access and navigate care, with an emphasis on stress and coping”.
It comes at a time when COVID-19 has brought about more sources of stress for many, said experts. 
“In the early days, it was just anxiety over what the disease meant,” said Dr Loke Wai Chiong, clinical director (programmes) and head of integrated health promotion at MOHT.
He noted that when Singapore entered the “circuit breaker”, stress factors like isolation, working from home or home-based learning, as well as domestic abuse surfaced.  
“We want to enable everyone in Singapore to get the help that they really need easily and conveniently,” Dr Loke said. 
Resources available on the platform include helplines and counselling by phone, employment support, financial assistance, family and caregiving support, volunteer opportunities, as well as health and fitness tips. 
Users can also learn more about their emotional wellbeing through self-assessment based on a “clinically validated” tool. 
A series of questions are put to users, for instance, whether they felt nervous, anxious or on edge over the last two weeks. Depending on the answers, users will be guided to the appropriate channels of intervention and support. 
Stressing that the platform allows users to remain anonymous, Dr Loke said: “We want to … empower individuals to take care of their holistic wellbeing in a safe way … they don’t have to feel embarrassed or shame that they are seeking help.”
NO PHYSICAL HEALTH WITHOUT MENTAL HEALTH
There is a need to shift towards self-care and self-management of stress and coping issues, in the same way that physical health is promoted through being active and having a healthy lifestyle, said Dr Loke. 
“In MOHT, we think about chronic diseases and for many years we talk about diabetes and hypertension,” he added. “There’s no health or physical health without mental health … without mental health, seriously, your physical health will also suffer.”
In future iterations of the platform, the team is thinking of adding more personalised features to direct users to the help they need, emotionally intelligent chat bots, as well as phone therapy services linked to counselling networks in Singapore. 
The user experience could also be customised to different segments of users such as youth, elderly and healthcare workers, Dr Loke said.
“We hope more people will use this. We will over time be able to analyse how the needs change in the community,"" he said.
""That could help us as a whole as providers, as government, as non-profit sectors to support the needs and resource these services accurately and correctly over time.”

In the last few weeks, psychotherapy had to be carried out over phone or video calls.
There were many keenly felt concerns. Is it safe to conduct our therapy sessions virtually?
What about the human connection between psychologist and client, which makes therapy work?
Will it become cold and business-like? Will therapy via phone or video-conferencing meet the needs of clients?
Despite harbouring these concerns, I came away learning much from the experiences of my clients, and have been humbled greatly as a clinician.
CHANGES IN THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN CLINICIAN AND PATIENT
Going online or calling in for therapy has equalised the relationship between psychologist and client.
Some of my clients never thought to simply leave the therapy room when they wished to avoid speaking about something.
But now, they can simply “walk out” of a psychotherapy session, with the click of a button. Although my clients laugh when I point this out, this ability makes clients feel less obligated to their therapist.

Such a dynamic has been empowering to children, adolescents, and adults I work with, leading them to take greater ownership over their progress.
Some told me remote therapy has allowed them to open up more easily. They fear less about being judged when they aren’t in the same room as me.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
For one young person, I offered to cover my camera so she couldn’t see me. She was surprised at how it was easier than she had thought to voice difficult feelings.
OVERCOMING FEAR AND STIGMA
Over the years, many clients shared they could not commit to therapy because of work, school and other priorities – not to mention fears of how they could be perceived by others if they said: “I need time for therapy.”
Some were afraid to be recognised even when they decided to attend.
Others were so afraid, they shuttered their windows and pretended they weren’t home when I came over, back when I worked in a community mental health team.
According to a 2016 study by the Institute of Mental Health, more than three-quarters of respondents with a mental health condition did not seek any professional help.
Be it from stigma or a learned fear, this unwillingness to get counselling can be changed with remote psychotherapy.

A young client of mine found it so distressing to come into the clinic, she never made it to therapy for a year.
With video-conferencing, she was able to cope by using the virtual background to “hide” herself through the distorted onscreen image. She could also type instead of speaking aloud.
This medium allowed her to access care she couldn’t get face-to-face and gave her enough distance to feel safe.
She even said that she may try therapy again.
EMPOWERMENT: ONE VIDEO CALL A TIME
During sessions, the therapy room is a protected, welcoming space for both therapist and client.
A place where all can speak in confidence is needed to conduct psychotherapy safely.
Yet during the circuit breaker, things got tricky. Video-conferencing may have allowed us to press on with sessions but not everyone has a large home where they can speak without being overheard.
Some of my clients shared that they speak leaning out the kitchen window because they share a 1-room flat with the entire family.
Some just had no safe space at home, as their family members could eavesdrop on the session, and use what they overhear against them in quarrels and fights.
I encouraged such clients to text us via the hospital’s secure messaging platform. They could also attend therapy via video-conferencing and type their responses in the chat box.
But if it’s unsafe for clients to do that, we can revert to face-to-face sessions.
Even those lucky enough to have privacy for an hour have hurdles to clear. They need to secure a safe space for therapy (commonly the office or bedroom), get an earpiece, and ensure their device is fully charged and updated.
Ironically, while these might present a higher barrier to remote therapy, they also prod clients to take charge and invest in their sessions to their benefit.

After I asked clients to brainstorm on how they could maximise their sessions, whether face-to-face or remote, they tell me these brainstorming exercises gave them a sense of emotional validation and greater autonomy.
Remote psychotherapy has helped clients engage with sessions, improving their chances of progress. As opposed to being passive guests in a curated clinic room, clients are less inclined to see themselves as helpless, passive pawns in their treatment.
KEEPING IT REALISTIC AND ORGANIC
As much as therapists do their best to understand our clients’ backgrounds and living circumstances, we can only imagine how they live from description, unless we made home visits.
However, thanks to video-conferencing, we now have a glimpse of our clients’ homes and can tailor our advice accordingly.
One of my clients had difficulty identifying situations that distress him, giving us little to work with in sessions.
During our video call, he immediately expressed embarrassment about the stacks of papers and books strewn across his room. This clutter had been distressing him for days.
Just like that, we immediately had a situation that was raw and relevant to him. I prompted him to apply his learnt skills to this situation, rather than have him search for another less visceral scenario.
If not for the use of video-conferencing and phone, I would not have gained these  insights into their lives. Home visits are typically expensive – but technology circumvents the high cost.
Regardless of what medium we use to communicate, the most essential part of therapy is still the human connection and ability to share freely.
One of my client has a protective dog. As she’s usually distressed and tense, he’s constantly on guard to support her.
But, as the session progressed, he might have realised she became calmer and more relaxed, because he settled comfortably on the floor to rest his head on her lap and promptly fell asleep. It made me feel like I passed his test in that instance.
If therapists hold on to the core of our work and remain open-minded to leveraging technology for therapy, these online sessions can make a significant difference in helping our clients achieve emotional breakthrough and complement face-to-face meetings, no matter which stage of combating this pandemic Singapore is in, or even after.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-takes-toll-on-sleep-physical-mental-health-well-being-12822806,"Commentary: Immobility during COVID-19 and its effects on our sleep, physical activity and well-being - CNA",12/06/2020,"SINGAPORE: Adequate sleep, exercise and a good diet are the trio of lifestyle factors critical for optimal health and well-being. Mobility restrictions arising from COVID-19 upset routines related to all three.
How are different people affected, what are the consequences of this imbalance and what can we do to restore balance?
Anna had been in her job for three years as a consultant when COVID-19 struck. Kept busy by a steady stream of deadlines, she was taken aback by the announcement of DORSCON Orange, but her steady nature kept her rooted.
When the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the pandemic, business continuity plans began to kick in at her office, but she still went to work. She started sleeping later, close to 1am and waking up later as well.
This trend jumped a gear when the circuit breaker was announced. Face-to-face meetings were replaced by Zoom calls that started after 9am and ploughed on into the evening. While she saved about an hour on the morning commute to work and another going home, the time saved seemed to disappear into online meetings.
Unlike her married colleagues with young children, who had to handle home schooling, Anna had fewer reasons not to be available for work calls. Her colleagues expected her to carry a relatively higher workload and she obliged.
CHANGE IN PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
Although Anna slept about 15 minutes more each night, and the difference in weekday and weekend sleep duration lessened, her physical activity took a big hit.
Her gym routine evaporated after the lockdown. Together with not having to walk to and from the MRT station her physical activity was reduced by 50 per cent compared to before the lockdown.
Bereft of her Friday night socialising, her Saturday morning retail therapy and having to field additional “crisis management calls”, Anna’s weekdays and weekends melded into one long, undifferentiated string of days.
A person like Anna made up about 50 per cent of about 1,000 participants in an ongoing population health study operated by the Singapore Health Promotion Board. 
Aged between 21 to 40 years, these predominantly office workers have been wearing Fitbit sleep or activity trackers consistently for two years, yielding objective data about their rest-activity patterns.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Is the change in Anna’s life healthy?
Most people are sleeping later but also getting up later. Young singles like Anna innately tend to sleep later than older adults. This is accentuated by an East Asian work culture that makes for longer hours at work and shorter nocturnal sleep compared to Nordic countries or in Australia.

A third cause of later sleeping and rising was unmasked during the lockdown. According to its longitude, Singapore belongs in the “+7 GMT” time zone. This was the case from 1905 to 1932. In 1941, we shifted to the “+7:30” time zone and to stay with Malaysia’s time zone we shifted to “+8 GMT” in 1982. This results in later sunrise and sunset.
The consequence of persistent exposure to later evening light is a delay in sleep times. Evening light tends to delay the circadian clock. Under normal conditions, with work and school start times relatively earlier in body clock terms, this results in shortened nocturnal sleep.
With the circuit breaker, the hour recovered from not having to commute to work has resulted in persons being able to follow their body clock and to wake up significantly later.
This modest sleep extension on weekdays may help offset the ill effects of sleeping later - increased risk of obesity, diabetes mellitus and cardiac events. Alongside this, reduction in the accumulated sleep debt over the workweek may be evidenced in the smaller difference in weekday-weekend sleep duration under lockdown conditions.
Interestingly, office workers also showed a 2 beat per minute reduction in resting heart rate. Commonly associated with better cardiovascular fitness, this favourable shift may indicate reduced exposure to stress, improved sleep or both.
While sleep in persons like Anna has gained from mobility restrictions, the decline in physical activity is worrisome.
It may not appear so, given the increased numbers of people walking and jogging. However, for many working adults and school children, physical activity associated with commuting and moving around the office contributes a substantial number of total steps. These have not been fully replaced by recreational walking.
Does a 30-minute High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) make up for a 10-hour Zoom marathon?  For the most part, no.
Workplace sedentariness is a major health risk factor and increases all-cause mortality, cardiometabolic disorders in addition to impairing musculoskeletal and bone health. Sitting through online meetings for extended periods is unhealthy and a brief burst of exercise does not make up for it.







                                    

Does a 30-minute High Intensity Interval Training (HIIT) make up for a 10-hour Zoom marathon? (Model: Marvin Soh)



Further, just as it is impossible to sustain properly performed HIIT beyond 30 minutes, for most people sustained attention declines within minutes of concentrated effort. 
A long string of online meetings is not productive because most people tune out after a while and may fail to take heed of important points. Breaks between online meetings help recharge attention, but they have to be taken, not simply wished for. 
Leaders would do well to take note. Persons working from home must be given the opportunity periodically get up, move around and mentally recharge. 
ALIGNING MULTIPLE BODY CLOCKS
The new normal is an opportunity to recalibrate how we work. Time saved from commuting should be channelled to improving productivity, freeing time for creative thought, recreation as well as building community and family ties.
Minimally, a person working from home should stand up and walk around a few minutes every half an hour, get exposure to outdoor light, preferably in the morning for at least 30 minutes and not have to field evening or late-night calls except on occasion.
Meetings should be kept efficient or terminated. Time saved should not be frittered on cyber-loafing and constant news-checking. A different routine should be in place for weekends, allowing for downtime, time with family and non-work activity.
In contrast to Anna’s fairly regular routine, Thomas, an undergraduate, found the move from traditional classroom learning to e-learning liberating. 
Ever pushing boundaries, he’s discovered a way to supplement his educational experience by joining online classes and conferences held in different time zones, opportunities unique to this period of lockdown. 
However, while Anna’s routine shifted later it is regular. Thomas’ timetable, if that term could be used, is totally chaotic. Post circuit-breaker, his sleep patterns were constantly changing. 
He experimented with sleeping four hours starting from 6am one day, two hours at noon and then changed to another schedule a few days later. His meals were irregular, and he snacked more than usual. He put on weight but figured he’d burn it off later.
Beyond sleep duration, its regularity also matters as does the timing of feeding and physical activity.
Besides the master clock deep in the brain, there are cellular clocks in the liver, digestive system, heart and even skin. Desynchronisation between different body clocks occurs when meal times and sleep times are misaligned and poses significant risks to health and well-being.
It is possible to keep to an alternative sleep or activity schedule, but it should be stable and have a main sleep period together with appropriately aligned eating and exercise times. 
Speaking of messed up lives, Shankari’s - another case I know of - took a real tumble during the COVID-19 lockdown. Already unsure if her job would remain in the coming months, she has neighbours who smoke, litter and make noise at odd times of the day and night.
Her brother does not get along with her parents, yet everyone has to stay under the same roof at this time. To find relief, Shankari checks her social media account frequently and watches online movies. However, she feels increasingly isolated despite being on multiple chat groups.
RESILIENCE DURING COVID-19
Inability to sleep, nocturnal awakening, early morning rising or some combination of these, suggest a significant breakdown in mental well-being. The early recognition of such is important.

Some have the resilience within them to ride out crises. Such individuals have the ability to take on one problem at a time, fixing things that can be remedied, while letting go of issues that cannot be changed.
Additional personal actions one can take to reduce emotional stress include staying away from toxic individuals and limiting one’s exposure to upsetting news. Others will benefit from early intervention and professional help. Hiding under a rock will not make difficult problems disappear.
Finally, as in any crisis, there are some who will take to challenge like a duck to water. Mark, a network specialist, experienced initial anxieties about COVID-19 but soon, literally hit his stride. 
He thrived on the flexibility of operating from home and working for a boss who understood creative individuals respond better to coaxing than key performance indicators enforcement.
His work on dynamic bandwidth allocation algorithms makes it possible for persons who have to work from home to have fuss-free connectivity. 
In between coding, he kept up with friends and found time for athletic pursuits. By the end of the circuit breaker, he was clocking personal bests in his runs and cycles.
Not everyone may be as fortunate as Mark, but we can collectively take a leaf out of suggestions made on each of the four life stories portrayed here. Mobility restrictions from COVID-19 are a huge challenge but we can emerge stronger with the right approach.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/cyber-bullying-getting-worse-even-covid-19-thivya-suicide-12788682,Commentary: Cyberbullying just keeps getting worse. Even COVID-19 hasn't dampened its spread - CNA,03/06/2020,"SINGAPORE: Cyberbullying has claimed yet another innocent victim. R Thivya Nayagi was just 20 when she took her own life on May 20 in Bukit Tengah, Malaysia, allegedly due to relentless cyberbullying. 
The video Thivya posted of herself and her male colleague - a migrant worker - on TikTok had sparked criticism, and went viral after being shared on other social media sites, particularly by fake Facebook accounts. She was inundated by hateful messages. 
""The post had been widely shared by netizens who continue to make derogatory remarks, suggesting that she was an easy character,"" her elder sister, R Logeswari, told media afterwards. 
""Although we know the truth of her relationship with the boy in the video, yet she was feeling down over the things being said about her.""
Let’s pause for a moment to think about how excruciatingly painful Thivya’s life must have been prior to taking the extreme step. To be judged, harassed, humiliated, and threatened in a repetitive and continuous manner causes extreme anguish.
On social media, where most of our lives are lived out, there is often no place to retreat, which can take a huge toll on victims, including social isolation, depression, substance abuse, suicidal thoughts and self-harm.
Tragically, bullycide, or death by suicide due to bullying, has been on the rise for the past decade among young people worldwide, fuelled by online bullying that accompanies traditional bullying.
ADULT CYBERBULLYING IS ALSO ON THE RISE 
Cyberbullying has taken on epidemic-level proportions worldwide, especially among the youth.
While we often associate cyberbullying with teenagers and young adults, even younger children aren’t exempt.
The inaugural 2020 Child Online Safety Index  report found that almost 60 per cent of children in the age group of 8 to 12years old in 30 countries were exposed to one or more forms of cyber risks, of which 45 per cent were affected by cyberbullying, either as bullies themselves or as victims.
Cyberbullying takes various shapes and forms, but at its core comprises repeated vicious and highly personalised attacks with the intent to demean and harass.
Victims are targeted in a variety of ways – from name-calling to more severe tactics such as being insulted based on their race, body size, gender or sexual orientation.
Increasingly, there is the realisation that cyberbullying isn’t just a phenomenon associated with impressionable young minds.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Adult cyberbullying is real, it’s vicious and is on the rise.
Workplace cyberbullying is growing. Here, power and gender disparities are exploited by repeated uncivil, aggressive, and inappropriate interactions via technology.
Outside such formal institutional spaces, social media platforms provide perfect opportunities for cyberbullying and other types of online harassment, such as trolling, stalking, and image-based sexual abuse.
EXAMINING THE ROLE OF SOCIAL MEDIA 
What is it about social media that tricks us into thinking that it is acceptable to demean and hurt others publicly? A lot actually.

Social media platforms and apps have certain design features that allow for, and in some cases encourage, uncivil behaviour. 
This includes anonymity - it’s easy to create fake profiles or post under a pseudonym - which allows people to post nasty things that they wouldn’t ordinarily say in face-to-face or real life situations. 
Further, the lack of physical and social cues - we can’t actually see how people respond to our comments - means that there is a tendency to feel less empathy in online interactions.
In fact, many studies show a co-relation between increased social media use and negative impacts on social and communicative skills. 
This is particularly the case with children and young adults, who are spending more time communicating online, which can inhibit their emotional and social development. 
In his 2018 book, psychology professor at California State University, Dr Mark Carrier, highlights how the shift to personal digital technologies has eroded empathy among children and young adults. 
In the absence of face-to-face interactions and the physical cues that accompany them, such as eye gaze, important social skills such as conversations and empathy are on the decline.
Low empathy is as a characteristic commonly found in cyberbullies. Studies, such as the one by media psychologist Julia Barlińska and colleagues, have also pointed to the crucial role of empathy in increasing online bystanders’ intervention in cyberbullying cases.
Lack of parental oversight or communication regarding children’s online activities and behaviour is another factor that exacerbates this problem. 
On their part, although social media companies have taken steps to tackle bullying on their platforms, these have been belated, inconsistent and inadequate.
A UK report found that young people wanted social media companies to domore to tackle cyberbullying. The report argued that the duty to protect children online is relevant to both large and small social media companies, including start-ups.
This is an important detail, as newer social media platforms, such as TikTok, have gained great popularity among young people, but continue to remain cyberbullying hot spots. 
Social media giants YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Snapchat and Instagram have tools like flagging, blocking and reporting abusive content, as well as safety and help centre features, to protect users. 
These, and Instagram’s introduction of artificial intelligence (AI) in 2019 to detect and remove abusive content in photos, videos and captions have been steps in the right direction.
But there is still a long way to go to make social media spaces safer and kinder. 
BE AWARE OF YOUR SOCIAL MEDIA IMPRINT
In  Asian societies as well,  adult cyberbullying has become common and worryingly normalised. 
For instance, cyberbullying has become a huge problem in conservative South Korea. This issue was thrust into the spotlight with K-pop star Sulli’s bullycide last year, which also shone light on the country’s toxic celebrity culture, and precipitated collective soul-searching and a law change campaign.

With workplace bullying exceedingly high in Singapore - Kantar’s Inclusion Index 2019 found that 24 per cent of workers were bullied in Singapore, the highest among 14 countries surveyed - cyberbullying has also crept into the workplace.  
The study also highlights gender and ethnic discrimination in the workplace and there is anecdotal evidence suggesting that, unsurprisingly, women are the likelier target of cyberbullying and cyber-harassment in the workplace.
Generally, cyberbullying happens because, increasingly, people do not stop to think before shaming, hurting, or insulting others online.
There is a general lack of consideration or self-reflection about our online behaviour and its harmful impacts – whether on ourselves or others.
Sue Schueff, author of Shame Nation: The Global Epidemic of Online Hate, notes that social media envy and poor judgement compel many users to post and publish things that reflect poorly on them or get them into trouble.
This boils down to a lack of critical digital literacy or the ability to discern how to use new technologies in ways that are empowering and productive.
Instead, social media has allowed users to indulge in behaviours, such as naming and shaming, which would have been unthinkable earlier. 
This is not to suggest that cyberbullies are victims. Rather they are engaging either knowingly or unwittingly in such deviant behaviour with full or limited understanding of its harmful effects.
But studies have consistently shown that there is a high co-relation between cyberbullying victims engaging in bullying themselves later, as they develop problematic behaviour.
A 2018 survey on cyberbullying commissioned by Talking Point found that in Singapore,  about 63 percent of the 353 youths surveyed – largely in the age group of 13 to 19 - have been both a victim and a bully in the social media space.
The temptation to whip out one’s mobile phone, take a picture of “offensive” behaviour, and share it online along with a rant has become a common impulse. During this circuit breaker period in Singapore there has been a proliferation of such behaviour.
We have seen this happen to people who are violating social distancing norms and government directives. Social media vigilantes have deemed it their mission to trail, harass, and post about people not wearing masks, for instance.
This type of harassment is not cyberbullying per se, since the individual is not tagged on social media posts nor aware of this harassment. 
In theory, cyberbullying and stalking are different types of online harassment, along with doxing and sexual harassment such as image-based sexual abuse. 
But it can lead to cyberbullying, especially when other people jump on the bandwagon, and target individuals by tagging them in posts, for example. 
Once their social media pages are filled with hate, this is clearly cyberbullying.
THE MISSING LINK
There are legal remedies for cyberbullying in Singapore. Under the Protection from Harassment Act (POHA), which was enacted in 2014, cyberbullying and other types of online harassment are offences.
Although legislation on its own may not be an adequate deterrent, these are indeed positive steps.
However, legal recourse is just one part of the solution. Like other complex social issues, tackling cyberbullying effectively will require a whole-of-society approach, involving efforts at the individual, community, and national level.
In Singapore, there have been greater efforts at all levels to address this growing social malaise.
In schools and educational institutions, digital literacy efforts have included a focus on digital citizenship, which includes public awareness and education on cyberbullying and other cyber-wellness issues.

The Media Literacy Council, which comprises members from the people, private, and public sectors, has done a great deal of work to push the idea and knowledge about digital and media literacy to the wider community, as well as advise the government on appropriate policy responses.
Technology companies, too, are taking more initiative  to curb cyberbullying on their platforms.
However, there is still a weak link — in the form of adults and parents in their late 30s and above.
They may have never received the kind of digital and media literacy training and sensitisation that children and young adults regularly receive today. 
Since a great deal of research has shown that most people are ignorant of their social media behaviour and hence unaware of how to deal with it, knowledge can bean effective way to deal with this issue - just like with fake news or cyber-crime – until laws, policies, technologies and other deterrent mechanisms fall into place. 
This includes how to communicate ethically and responsibly online, the dangers of oversharing, how to ensure privacy and personal safety in cyberspace, and the legal repercussions of deviant online behaviour.
Hence, they may be ill-equipped to handle being cyberbullied or recognise that they are, or to advise their children or wards, and worse, may be unknowingly engaging in cyberbullying and other forms of harassment themselves.
This group forms a substantial chunk of netizens, and critical digital literacy for such groups must also be addressed, to shore up the long fight against cyberbullying.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/youth-engagement-mental-health-jobs-sg-youth-action-plan-12779532,"Mental health, job opportunities among issues raised by youths in engagement sessions  - CNA",29/05/2020,"SINGAPORE: Mental health, future job opportunities and environmental sustainability were among the issues in focus among youths who participated in engagement sessions as part of the SG Youth Action Plan.
The initiative, started by the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth (MCCY) in May 2019, involves a panel of 14 youth leaders, plus the co-chairs Senior Minister of State for Culture, Community and Youth Sim Ann and Mr Edward Chia, CEO of Timbre Group.
The aim is to engage young Singaporeans in shaping their vision for the country, and developing plans for youth, community organisations and businesses.
“We reached out to more than 400,000 youths and we've engaged more than 70,000 youths,” said Ms Sim. “We're very excited because we've had very good participation and ideas from our young people.”
Speaking to the media on Wednesday (May 27), Ms Sim outlined the progress that the SG Youth Action plan has made in the past year.
This will culminate in a Youth Action Challenge digital summit that will be held from Jul 13 to 19.
Twelve teams will present their ground-up initiatives, which are guided by the key themes that have emerged from the engagement sessions.
While the summit was supposed to be held in April – it was postponed due to COVID-19 circuit breaker measures - Ms Sim said this gave the youths the chance to update their projects in light of coronavirus situation. 
“Much of the themes are evergreen - like sustainability, helping the vulnerable in society and the economy. But in terms of the execution, there's bound to be some aspects which they need to update because of our ongoing fight against a pandemic,” she explained.
“The pandemic is really a test of preparedness … (the SG Youth Action Plan) helps to get them ready to play a very proactive role.”
MENTAL HEALTH AND YOUTH EMPLOYMENT 
On the topic of mental health, Mr Chia said that the panel managed to make “good headway” in championing support for the issue, for instance, by working on providing peer support training.
“When youths have issues, they tend to want to talk to their friends first, rather than knock on the doors of the school counsellor. (But) sometimes their friends might not also know how to react effectively and know what is the quick first response,” he added.
Ms Sim noted that mental health ranked second in terms of participants’ concerns amid the COVID-19 pandemic, with the top concern being interaction with friends.
“We are glad that we started keeping tabs on this issue early,” she said. 
The SG Youth Action Plan will have a new dedicated website, which includes a special COVID-19 subpage, said Mr Chia.
“We have come up with a depository - how youths can take action for themselves and if they require additional help, there are also links that we have provided for.”
“It's important firstly to let the youths know that they are not alone in this situation.”

Another area that SG Youth Action Plan is focusing on is promoting mentorship as a way to empower youths to fulfil their potential. This is done through matching youths to mentors, industry professional and job opportunities.
It’s an area that has come to the fore given that “traditional methods” of job search have changed with the coronavirus outbreak, said Ms Sim.
“You're not going to have in-person job fairs and networking sessions, so it's all the more important to provide that assurance to young people,” she explained.
For example, SG Youth Action Plan panelist Ms Swedha Rajaram, who is also part of Advisory Singapore, started the Advisory Mentorship Programme Online to match students with industry mentors amidst concerns due to COVID-19.
Mr Chia added that there would be a heightened level of “urgency” faced by the youths who are graduating and entering the workforce this year.
“We hope to resource more of such organisations that will provide such mentorship,” he told reporters.
MORE SUPPORT FOR YOUTHS TO TAKE ACTION 
To empower youths to do more in this time of crisis, the National Youth Council (NYC) has introduced a COVID-19 edition of the Young ChangeMakers Grant, to provide seed funding for ground-up initiatives related to the coronavirus situation.
Singaporeans and permanent residents aged between 15 and 35 can apply, and their projects should benefit the Singapore community in line with national objectives around COVID-19.
There are three priority areas for projects – jobs, supporting vulnerable groups and mental wellbeing.
The funding criteria has been relaxed, said Ms Sim to make it easier for young people to implement plans and help the vulnerable.
For instance, applicants can now tap the grant for fundraising projects for local beneficiaries.
“In the past, we’ve been focusing the funding on the operational aspect (of projects), but we also recognise that we are in a very different time right now and the needs are acute,” said Ms Sim.
Approvals and disbursements will be faster, she added.
Upon approval, up to 50 per cent of the approved grant will be disbursed within seven working days, compared to two to three weeks previously.
Additionally, S$30 million from the National Youth Fund has been set aside over the next five years for partnerships with youths to champion ground-up initiatives that are in line with the SG Youth Action Plan.
“This serves as an encouragement,” said Ms Sim. “As long as there are good ideas, we are very prepared to listen and we're very prepared to support.”
One project that received funding from the National Youth Fund last year is the Happiness Initiative, a social enterprise that takes a preventive approach towards mental health by equipping youth with “the science of happiness”.
Based on positive psychology, the Happiness Initiative works with schools and corporations to promote practical ways in which one can “flourish” and “find their purpose”, said its co-founder Sherman Ho.
""We try to run activities that are engaging and interesting rather than just throwing out jargon.""
One example is the Happiness Film Festival held last year, with the support of the National Youth Fund. “People relate very much to stories, so we use all these films to facilitate conversations,” the 31-year-old added.

Since they can no longer hold physical events, the social enterprise has moved online and is now compiling a four-week webinar series that discusses “resilience and resolve”.
Despite the ongoing pandemic, Ms Sim remains positive about the various ideas, adding that youths can be “pathfinders”.
“We hope that many of them will feel equipped and empowered to put their ideas into action, help themselves, and also help others and help us navigate this post COVID-19 world,” she said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/kids-return-to-school-covid-19-coronavirus-circuit-breaker-12731702,Commentary: Don’t expect your kids to return to school seamlessly - CNA,25/05/2020,"SINGAPORE: The start of a new school term is a popular parenting meme.
Amidst a giddy mix of sweat and sun-drenched holiday memories, children say “goodbye” to freedom, stay-at-home mums say “hello” to peace and quiet, and everyone generally braces themselves for pre-dawn alarms and homework. We all know the drill.
The upcoming new school term, however, feels like nothing before it. Set to begin on Jun 2, it will be displacing the June holidays – a cherished fixture for many generations.
It also follows on the heels of one of the longest school breaks in Singapore’s education history. As part of the COVID-19 circuit breaker measures, schools across the island would have been closed for nearly two months by Jun 2.
If that wasn’t complicated enough for students and their families, the month preceding the school reopening has been the most un-holiday-like school-break ever, with a nation of children stuck at home and literally bouncing off the walls.
Even short jaunts outdoors have been somewhat unsettling, as children emerge into eerily quiet streets, armed with hand sanitisers and a listicle of rules.
Old haunts such as playgrounds, open fields and garden benches suddenly scream danger with a barricade of red barrier tape. Familiar neighbourhood faces are now to be warily avoided. And a sea of masks hides our children’s smiles and muffles their carefree laughter.
Indeed, the May holidays was a disorientating time of inactivity and de-socialisation.







                                    

As of Apr 26, 189 countries across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America have implemented school and university closures. Singapore is one of them. 




And while we look forward to school reopening, it may be good to note that we cannot expect life to instantly snap back to normal. Some children will understandably find it more difficult to assimilate to school life.
HOW Social Distancing AFFECTS OUR CHILDREN
In fact, as schools gradually gear up to reopen around the world, one of the things that educators have been forced to reconsider is the socialisation of children during this great pandemic.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Last month, a primary school in Zhejiang, China, came up with the idea of asking their pupils to wear self-designed social distancing hats. 
Made with wooden sticks and colourful cardboard, these hats measure out the one-metre safe distance recommended. This multi-hued dystopian image reminds us of how COVID-19 has invaded and reshaped our children’s world. 
While this headgear will not be sported in Singapore, on May 19, the Ministry of Education (MOE) announced new measures for the reopening of schools in Singapore.
In primary and secondary schools across the nation, only graduating cohorts in Primary 6 and Secondary 4 and 5 will attend school on weekdays. Other cohorts will rotate weekly between classroom-based and home-based learning.
Students from Assumption Pathway School (APS) and North Light School (NLS), as well as preschools will have their return staggered over a period of approximately a week.
Students and staff will also be required to wear masks or face shields, and be vigilant about hand-washing and social distancing.
On a deeper psychological and social level, the new school term and these new rules may cause general anxiety associated with social relationships and physical contact.

For very young children who are learning the basics of socialising, this experience can be disruptive, alienating and stressful.
As a mother of a toddler, I find myself struggling to explain to my daughter why it is now bad to stand close to people she likes or spend time chatting with them when we cross paths.
This is gradually affecting my daughter’s social experience. When she bumps into her favourite classmate in the park, she seems uncertain about how to spontaneously interact with her friend.
Shy and introverted children of all ages will find it even more difficult to adjust to school reopening. Separated from their peer groups and having socialisation replaced by screens for an extended period, they may find their social anxiety exacerbated.  
With parents spending more time with their children during this period, returning to school breaks the comforting routine and will be stressful for kids who may suffer from separation anxiety, according to Stony Brook University’s child and adolescent psychologists Jennifer Keluskar and Debra Reicher and psychiatrist Judith Crowell.
Parents of younger children may expect some crying, screaming or feet-dragging – in many ways, a replay of the first day of school in the middle of the year.
Helping Our Children With Anxiety
Social and separation anxiety are not the only feelings our young ones struggle with.

Having lost vital contact with important attachment figures such as grandparents, relatives and friends for a period of time, they may also feel a heightened sense of fear, instability and loneliness.
While adults may be able to rationalise this as a temporary change, albeit without a clear end in sight, children may find it harder to understand or process.
For some, it can feel like the world as they knew it and their entire social support system has been threatened or razed to ground overnight.
Glimpses of news coverage, snippets of adult conversation and the shift in their parents’ mood and behaviour may also affect them on a subconscious level.
These stressors will be magnified for families facing job insecurity, financial difficulties or increased domestic conflict and abuse.
In fact, studies by humanitarian organisation Save the Children suggest that close to one in four children living under lockdowns, social restrictions and school closures are dealing with feelings of anxiety.
Another study conducted in Hubei province, China, where the virus was first reported, found that close to one in five students reported depressive or anxiety symptoms.
Some of this stress and anxiety may manifest or become more apparent when children return to school. Psychologists suggest that some may be more sensitive or clingy, throw tantrums or cry for no clear reason, appear more withdrawn, or suffer from poor concentration.
After the two-month break in routine, sleep-ins and extended screen-time, they may also take a longer time to adjust to the pace and structure of school.
Having said that, parents may celebrate the reopening of school as the return to normalcy but instead of rushing to catch up on lost time, perhaps it will help if they instead focused on the emotional needs of their children during this period of transition.
In fact, experts from the National Association of School Psychologists (NASP) in the United States recommend talking to children about their fears, empowering them by answering their questions honestly, and showing them lots of love and affection to help them cope with anxiety throughout the pandemic.
It also helps to give children time to ease back into the routine of school, and break unwanted habits acquired during the circuit breaker such as extended screen time.
Accept that some regression such as separation anxiety, social anxiety or discipline issues is understandable. After all, like us, our children have been thrown into the deep end of one of the most surreal and scary global disruptions of our time.
Over the past few months, many of them have subconsciously carried more worries and anxiety than they may have words for. Armoured with their little masks, they continue to confront a new school term in a socially-distanced world with rules they may not fully understand.
They are little heroes in their own right.
If we validate their feelings, commend their courage, trust in their resilience and support them through this confusing period of transition, our children, and our bond with them, may yet be strengthened by this trial.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/woman-shunfu-market-sovereign-mental-health-illness-stigma-covid-12723756,Commentary: We declare a goal of ending mental health stigma yet viciously mock the woman at Shunfu Market - CNA,12/05/2020,"SINGAPORE: At 8pm on Thursday (May 7), 33 key Singapore landmarks across the island lit up in blue as part of the global campaign #SeeItBlue.
It was a heartening sight to see action taken to highlight the importance of mental well-being during this difficult period of COVID-19 and raise awareness for mental health.
The nationwide light show will run every Thursday at 8pm until the end of the circuit breaker on Jun 1, as a display of solidarity.
Yet, just the day before, a musical video on YouTube made by a local artist went viral, mocking the unmasked woman in Shunfu who uttered the word “sovereign” when asked why she wasn’t wearing one.
No one would disagree the woman should be taken to task for posing a threat to public health and breaching coronavirus restrictions. Swift action was taken. She was charged just two days after the incident on one count of being a nuisance and three counts of violating the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) rules.

But where the court had decided she should be remanded at the Institute of Mental Health to assess if she is fit to plea, the video made by the artist and the praises heaped by scores of people who shared it widely on social media now sit awkwardly.
If anything, it speaks volume of the prejudice and ignorance of mental health we still have as a society.
SINGAPORE WANTS TO END THE STIGMA OF MENTAL ILLNESS
“End the stigma of mental illness” is a phrase we have heard numerous times in recent years as Singapore awakens to the discrimination and disadvantages people with mental health conditions face.
Underlying problematic public attitudes have been exposed by surveys conducted by the National Council of Social Services (NCSS).
We have made big strides to tackle mental health at the national level. An anti-mental health stigma campaign Beyond the Label was launched by NCSS in 2018 to combat these sentiments.
Prominent figures have come forward to lend their voice. Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan Jin addressed this issue at the Beyond the Label Fest in September last year.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Singapore was also the first country in Asia to host the Together Against Stigma Global Conference in October 2019 where President Halimah Yacob stressed more must be done to support those with mental health issues.
Negative attitudes towards mental health conditions are ""sad"" and reflect a ""gross ignorance about what this illness is all about"", she had said.
BUT IS SINGAPORE WALKING THE TALK?
The word stigma means a mark of shame. In the mental health sector, this typically refers to the unfair mark of shame others assigned to those who live with different mental health conditions.
There’s also self-stigma, the shame people with such conditions assign to themselves when they feel there’s something “wrong” with how their brains work.
This goal of “ending the stigma” may only be scratching the surface of the real shame, acts of discrimination and microaggressions people who live with mental conditions still face on a daily basis.

Yet circle back to the YouTube video, which ridiculed the woman with words like “lunatic”, “thick in the head” and “crazy”, and you cannot help but go away with the sense that this is the type of bigotry that perpetuates misguided perceptions and peddles the narrative that those with poor mental health are ""crazy people"" who act out.
This is sadly turning the other way from our national vision of going beyond the label endorsed by our leaders and Singaporeans.
THE FEAR AND ANXIETY
Those who live with mental health conditions have expressed their fear and anxiety regarding this insensitive act of public shaming, made many times worse by the complicit chorus of compliments to the talent and entertainment value of this public shaming.
One of them shared with me: “If I ever had a public breakdown, I would be absolutely mortified if my episode was plastered all over social media, and turned into fodder for further public amusement by an artist.”
Another also shared with me in anguish: “This perpetuates a false association between mental health and social irresponsibility/deviancy ... It has justified public shaming of mental health as fair game, and even as a kind of moral righteousness.”
COVID-19 IS ALSO A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS
The COVID-19 crisis has turned every aspect of normal life upside down with strict safe distancing and circuit breaker measures to protect life.
With no end in sight, the mental health consequences of COVID-19 are starting to manifest – fuelled by the devastating mix of uncertainty, isolation, grief and economic despair.
We cannot pretend to know how these consequences will manifest in each individual, including those with no pre-existing mental health conditions.
Spending time in isolation and following safe distancing measures may slow the spread of the disease, but it may also be linked to an increase in depression, anxiety, drug and alcohol abuse, domestic violence and child abuse, according to many recent studies including the highly-regarded journal The Lancet Report.
We think of the coronavirus as a physical health threat but forget this is also a mental health crisis needing attention, a concern I have raised repeatedly in Parliament recently, given that one in seven of Singaporeans already live with a mental health condition before COVID-19. 
THE STORIES WE DON’T HEAR
We have underestimated the silent toll on our mental health COVID-19 is taking on us because such stories have remained behind closed doors for fear of stigma.
A senior business leader recently shared her mounting mental and emotional struggles with having to support her young children with their home-based learning (and now on holiday) as well as her employees with their own challenges remotely.
An acquaintance almost killed himself after losing all gigs as an event emcee some weeks back, while he could not have his weekly sessions with his therapist until recently.
A 20-year-old man hung himself in his room in mid-April due to challenging family circumstances.
A 15-year-old marriage is now on the brink of a complete breakdown just five weeks into the circuit breaker.

These are just but a small sample of stories of mental struggles I have come to know of personally. 
WALK THE TALK
Even before the pandemic, two-thirds of adults with mental health conditions did not seek treatment in Singapore, according to the NCSS Public Attitudes Survey in 2017. Public shaming will exacerbate poor mental health for those already struggling.
Experts have long cautioned against public shaming, warning that it can have a lasting and negative psychological impact on those who are singled out.
At first glance, we might fall into the trap of thinking being shamed on social media is an experience anyone can easily shrug off and recover from. However, many who have been the target of Internet shaming face lasting and damaging consequences.
The mental health curve from COVID-19 is going to have a very long tail. So leave errant individuals to the authorities, that’s the rule of law order that we are proud of.
Let’s channel our influence, talents and energies during this trying time towards looking out for each other, and our mental well-being - and not perpetuate the stigmatisation of mental health. 
We must go beyond merely a display of solidarity to truly walk the talk of empathy and inclusion when the next sea of blue light shines from our gleaming skyscrapers.

Titled #SeeItBlue, this inaugural campaign seeks to highlight the importance of mental wellbeing during this trying time and raise awareness for mental health, as well as serve as an opportunity to thank all key workers on the frontline.
The nationwide light show will run every Thursday at 8pm until the end of the “circuit breaker” on Jun 1.
Venues that will light up blue as part of the display include ArtScience Museum, Cavanagh Bridge, Esplanade, Fullerton Hotel, Gardens by the Bay, Helix Bridge, ION Orchard, Marina Bay Sands, National Gallery Singapore, Raffles Hotel Singapore, Sentosa, The Arts House, Victoria Theatre and Victoria Concert Hall. 
The #MakeItBlue campaign started in the UK and is currently in 17 countries, including USA, Canada, Mexico, Spain, France, Italy, Denmark, Australia, Japan, South Korea, Malaysia and now Singapore. It has inspired several initiatives working with celebrities and organisations across the globe to help with the pandemic.
The Singapore campaign is spearheaded by local communication agencies Hill + Knowlton Strategies, Lumina Live, Mercury Live and Mercury PR, and is supported by Keppel Group, Land Transport Authority, Marina Bay Alliance, Millenia Singapore, Pan Pacific Hotels Group, Singapore Tourism Board and Urban Redevelopment Authority.
“Apart from staying at home, we wanted to say thank you for all those who are at the frontline. These are medical staff who are risking their lives daily, but also stores, restaurants, cleaners, bus and train drivers, food delivery services – all who are risking their own health to care for others during the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Gary White, who co-started the campaign in the UK. ""But more importantly we wanted to remind people to self-care. Mental health is a priority for everyone, and we want to encourage people to seek help and not suffer in silence.”
The #SeeItBlue initiative intends to add more buildings and prominent areas over the next few weeks. The movement also seeks to encourage people to “see” and acknowledge the importance of mental well-being during these unprecedented times.

COVID-19 will force us to - CNA,06/05/2020,"SINGAPORE: Suicide rates in Singapore were reported to be 8.36 deaths per 100,000 Singapore residents last year.
According to the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), this is the leading cause of death for those aged between 10 to 29.  This is a 10 per cent increase from 2017.
There is a high chance that the figures will continue to rise.
While the effects of COVID-19 on the collective mental health have yet to be studied systematically, psychosocial repercussions of the pandemic are already felt worldwide.
The US saw a 338 per cent increase in call volume to the Disaster Distress Helpline, a sub-network of America’s National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, in March compared to the previous month.
Researchers Lu Dong and Jennifer Bouey from the RAND Corporation found that China has reported “a heightened public mental health crisis” sparked by the outbreak despite emergency psychological crisis interventions proposed by the National Health Commission of China.
In Singapore, organisations such as SOS, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) and Fei Yue Community Services have seen spikes in the number of people calling in the last month seeking assistance for distress.  
The SOS reported that it received 3,826 calls in March, 23 per cent more than it received during the same month last year.
GAPS IN OUR MENTAL HEALTHCARE SYSTEM
And yet our response to mental health remains inadequate.

Gaps in our mental healthcare system were brought up even before COVID-19 led to the circuit breaker period. Accessibility, affordability and inclusiveness of professional services were particularly highlighted during the Parliamentary debate on the Ministry of Health’s budget in March.
We also face a lack of trained professionals. The national average of 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists for every 100,000 people in Singapore is lower than the 15 psychiatrists per 100,000 recorded by most OECD countries.
Mental health support offered at the national level did not seem to keep up in tandem with the increasing numbers of those seeking help.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Singapore’s total expenditure on mental health made up only 3 per cent of the Ministry of Health’s operating expenditure for 2017, according to latest data shared by the Health Minister in Parliament in 2019.
The insufficient level of resources ploughed into mental health in the past could come back to haunt us. 
Neither the Resilience Budget nor the Solidarity Budget allocated any resources towards mental healthcare support or research.
It also took three full weeks after the circuit breaker first started to declare allied health services - including private counselling and social work - as essential services, thus allowing them to remain open.
Even if slightly late, this move shows that the Government recognises the impact this pandemic could have on mental health, as does its establishment of the National Care Hotline. More than 6,600 people have already called the hotline within two weeks of its launch on Apr 10.
According to media reports, there were also a few callers with suicidal tendencies, with police dispatched to tend to two cases.
But the same shortage of resources can be seen with how the 24-hour hotline is currently run, with about 500 volunteers from government agencies, registered mental health professionals, Social Service Agency-nominated psychologists, counsellors/social workers or personnel who are trained in psychological first aid. 
From the 500, about 20 to 25 of them are rostered daily to provide emotional and psychological support to callers.
This small group of trained professionals daily may not be able to keep up with an increasing volume of people seeking mental health assistance.
NEED FOR A COLLECTIVE RESPONSE 
Perhaps, rather than point out the shortcomings of our system, we need to develop an approach where all of us can play a part in protecting the mental health of our society.
As an editor of a book consolidating perspectives from across the ground - from academics, organisational leaders and practising professionals, to individuals with lived experiences and supporting figures - I have found strong commonality in the belief that addressing mental health should go beyond the confines of the social services and government.
We have to take steps to give mental health as much priority as physical health for ourselves and those around us.
This can help shift mental healthcare into a more preventive approach, thus alleviating some of the burden on the thin level of resources we can access.
Rethinking the role of mental health in our lives will enable us to work hand-in-hand with those on the policy front to forge ways to create and maintain mental health support - similar to a community-based care for medical treatment recommended by medical journal The Lancet, with “psychosocial treatments such as talking therapies being offered not just by medical professionals but also by community health workers, peers, teachers and the clergy”.
Everyone has a stake in the state of our collective mental health.
NORMALISING MENTAL HEALTH CONVERSATIONS
For this to happen, mental health issues have to first be more normalised. For starters, we need to openly talk about the challenges we may be currently facing.

It is a traumatic period with a protracted disruption to life for every individual. Social isolation offers no relief from uncertainty, fear and anxiety, and can in fact be a contributing factor. For some, it is a strain on family ties and relationships. 
For those in abusive domestic conditions, it can be a matter of life and death. For those susceptible to mental health issues, COVID-19 can have serious effects on their health and recovery.
It is not the time to downplay feelings of fear and anxiety. It is the time to ensure you have a support system and find coping mechanisms. It is the time to reach out to others without shame when you find yourself unable to cope.
It is also not the time to call out on anyone who is experiencing mental distress or conditions in any form. Be careful about your language when speaking to others. It is easy to project personal distress upon others unconsciously, even if it is not your intention.
That is easier said than done. Despite national campaigns to create awareness, the stigma against mental health is still a large hindrance to tackling the issue. 
Various studies conducted in Singapore capture a pervasive negative attitude towards mental health conditions. 
One such survey by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2018 found that six in 10 people believe such conditions are caused by a lack of self-discipline and will-power, while up to 50 per cent of respondents would not give people with mental health conditions any responsibility.
There is also evidence of the impact stigma has on seeking treatment and recovery. 
Statistics show a treatment gap of up to nine years for those experiencing mood disorders while 78.4 per cent choose not to even seek help for what they experience.
Reasons vary from the fear of being judged and being seen as weak, to losing autonomy and control over their lives.
Unlike physical ailments, mental health conditions are not visible. What is visible - the behavioural manifestations of disorders leaning towards severity - tend to break established social norms. 
Those who do not know what is happening may then internalise the behaviour as threats.
Mental health conditions are complex, individualistic and heterogeneous in nature.
They also don’t have to be permanent.
There are actions we can take to support others. We can proactively question labels. We can have more discourse around mental health issues. We can learn to listen without putting forth our own judgements or offer solutions.
We can also remember that we are all susceptible to it, if we do not take steps towards mental resilience.
There is an urgency to start. We may not feel the strain on our already thinning mental health resources until it’s too late.
While the mental toll of COVID-19 has yet to be recorded or tracked, there is enough evidence of the profound and pervasive impact all around the world.
That includes us. If we do not step up now to take mental health seriously, we will be looking at another health crisis sooner than we expect.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-staying-home-improving-ourselves-12673114,Commentary: Four things to help bring the best out of us this circuit breaker period - CNA,25/04/2020,"SINGAPORE: We are in the second week of the circuit breaker period in Singapore.
We have been banished from the outside and ordered to go inside. Our lives, which had been marked by so much movement has suddenly been brought to an abrupt standstill. Our offices and streets have never been emptier. Our homes have never been more occupied.
Some of us may be surprised at how much we are struggling with being isolated at home. Some of us may also be surprised by the number of people who are challenging fate (and the authorities) by wandering outside.
Why is it so hard for us to stay at home?
For many of us, our hearts have not known how to be at home for a long time. This isolation time gives us time and space to reflect and rethink that for ourselves.
While I was under quarantine orders, I had much time alone to reflect on how to gain the most meaning out of isolation during this extraordinary time.
I offer four simple things we can do to help ourselves come back home again.
PAUSE TO REFLECT AND ACCEPT
First, allow yourself time and space to just pause and notice what’s really going on - to you and around you.
Our addiction to busyness and being outside can desensitise us to the multiple realities happening within our own selves as well as our homes.
You might have gone through more upheaval than you realised these past few weeks. You might have been more short-tempered, withdrawn, depressed and anxious than before. Notice and accept it. Consider that you might not have realised how much you have lost in these few weeks that meant so much to you and how much you wish to have them back.
In a Harvard Business Review interview, grief expert David Kessler named the discomfort many of us are feeling right now as “anticipatory grief” over an unprecedented loss of safety and certainty at the micro and macro level.
He encouraged us to name, accept and feel our losses as grief. Because only when we acknowledge it, then can we begin the healing and empowering process of getting through to the other side.

It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
We grieve only for things that we love. Give yourself permission to dwell quietly and notice with quiet compassion all our thoughts and emotions - especially the ugly ones. Even for those things, grieve so you can get through it and make a new choice for yourself.
It’s a global crisis. It’s okay to not be okay. It’s okay to realise some things are not okay.
CREATE A ROUTINE WITH RITUALS
Second, as you grieve, design a routine around a range of rituals that you need to find sanity, stability and agency again and again.
In crisis, events will keep happening to us, forcing us to adjust. Over time, this increases our sense of helplessness and anxiety as we feel the locus of control moves from us to our environment. That is why one of the most repeated pieces of advice given on how to survive - even thrive - in isolation is to establish a daily routine.
Claudia W Allen, Director of the Family Stress Clinic and the director of behavioural science at the University of Virginia, explains that routine is part an evidence-based treatment for depression called “behavioural activation”.
She advised: “Be proactive and lay out an intentional structure for your day ... If you’re not working, create a schedule ... Write it down.”
Create an intentional routine that empowers you.
An empowering routine keeps your focus on the things that bring you meaning, strength and satisfaction. You learn to focus on doing what is within your control. That helps you focus less on what is beyond your control.
Balance your routine with a range of simple practices of who you most want and need to be in this crisis. Carve out a time for work and for play. A time for exercise and for stillness. A time to talk and to listen. A time to be alone and to be together.

Most of all, don’t make your routine about pursuing perfection. It’s for practising purpose and intention.
EMPATHISE WITH THE TRAGEDY OF OTHERS
Third, acknowledge and empathise with the human tragedies happening around you. You’ll notice it’s easier to do this if you practice acknowledging and accepting your own private losses. 
You may know or even live with an emergency or essential worker going with very little sleep and unimaginable fears. 
Or a public servant planning for unthinkable scenarios, working under intense scrutiny. Or an employee who is newly jobless and facing a devastating drop in income. Or an employer challenged to pivot or shutter their business.
They need you to notice and hold space for their pain too.
If you are one of the ""luckier ones” where you and your whole family has the financial heft, job security and large home that affords you peace of mind, the potential risk you face is that this crisis may still be an intellectual curiosity rather than an emotional experience for you.
You may be privileged to emerge from the crisis unscathed but you must not leave it unchanged. That would be a terrible waste for yourself as a human being and for your community as well.
Psychologists and community engagement experts Mark Brennan, Dana Winters and Pat Dolan recently wrote, when it comes to the coronavirus, each one of us in a first respondent. 
“In times of emergency, providing empathy, kindness and compassion to our fellow citizens is the single most important factor in surviving the initial stages of disaster, limiting suffering, protecting the vulnerable, and quickly recovering in the aftermath of the crisis.”
Many people are quietly navigating a stack of intersecting tragedies. We can all take time to ask how friends, family and strangers are doing and truly listen.
Acknowledge and grieve with them for their losses. Honour their attempts to keep moving forward with dignity and determination.
ACT WITH URGENCY
Fourth, we must move and act with urgency for the pain-points, purposes and people we most care about.
But we cannot move forward on this crucial stage if we are still stuck in denial of our realities, confused about our priorities and hypercritical in our relationships.
The stakes are too high. Remember, even if we do leave isolation 30 days later, there is no “normal” to go back to.

We will be stepping into a different world from the one before COVID-19. Borders may stay closed. Money may be tighter. Jobs may be fewer. The way we work, live and play will never be the same.
This is our generation’s World War. If you look at the speed at which COVID-19 is devastating every country, you will see that there actually isn’t much time for excessive grumbling, complaining or sniping at each other.
If we were truly in the middle of a war, priorities would be starkly clear. Should we spend time and energy complaining about our child’s PSLE prospects or sitting down to explain to him about what’s going on, who’s hurting and what really matters now?
Your child should study for his PSLE - it is what’s within his control. But you help him study with a different spirit when you help him also see how the world is changing, how businesses are changing or even just how his parents’ jobs and family budget are changing too.
You also want to tell your child that COVID-19 is not just damaging human lives, it is also forcing out the best in us and among us.
Some are ripping up plans overnight to help thousands of us keep jobs. Some are rallying us to save lives, families, businesses and industries. Some are rousing us to take better care of the invisible and forgotten.
Our social, emotional, psychological and spiritual reserves as a people will be even more crucial in our fight against COVID-19 than our financial reserves as a nation.
There has never been a more crucial time for us to each reflect on our pains, realign our priorities and rediscover how to relate with our people - friends, family, team members, communities, citizens, leaders.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid19-manpower-ministry-advisory-mental-health-12673892,"Employers, workers can take steps to support mental well-being during COVID-19 pandemic: MOM - CNA",24/04/2020,"SINGAPORE: Uncertainties in work arrangements caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can have detrimental effects on mental health and authorities here have outlined a range of suggestions to help both employees and employers cope.
An inter-agency grouping comprising the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the Ministry of Social and Family Development, the Agency for Integrated Care, the Institute of Mental Health and the National Council of Social Service issued an advisory on Friday (Apr 24) addressing the issue.
The advisory highlighted job security and worries about revenue sources as some of the potential stress points for employees and self-employed persons.
The dangers of social isolation as a result of work from home arrangements, as well as the balancing act faced by working parents with children undergoing home-based learning, were two other mental health stressors the agencies spoke about.  
""During this period of uncertainty, employers and workers could consider taking practical steps, and tapping on counselling resources, to support one’s mental well-being,"" the agencies said.
HOW EMPLOYERS CAN HELP THEIR WORKERS
The agencies pointed to an MOM advisory, issued earlier this month regarding arrangements during the ""circuit breaker"" period, with a particular focus on the clear and timely communication of salary and leave policies. 
Supervisors could also check in with their staff at least once a week to find out how they are coping with working from home, the agencies said.
Non-work related matters can also be discussed, in specially arranged short sessions before or after work hours.
Addressing the needs of parents with young children, Friday's advisory suggested that supervisors help provide flexible work schedules and regular breaks for such employees.
The agencies noted that there are online resources for parent support available for both employees and self-employed people. They also suggested that employers consider providing access to external counselling as part of staff benefits. 
HOW EMPLOYEES CAN SUPPORT THEMSELVES WHILE WORKING FROM HOME
For employees and the self-employed, the advisory recommended that workers maintain a strong circle of social support by reaching out their friends and family members. 
They should also look after their physical well-being by staying active and healthy. Having adequate sleep, eating a balanced diet and doing moderate exercises can help with this. 
The agencies also suggested learning a few simple relaxation techniques to cope with stress.
Those concerned about their financial situation and income loss can tap on Government grants and assistance.
For those seeking work, the advisory pointed to the SGUnited Jobs initiative that can match jobseekers and workers affected by the COVID-19 outbreak to employers.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-covid-19-remote-work-from-home-burnout-stress-tips-12662278,"Commentary: Putting in 50 hours while WFH, it’s a struggle to draw the line between work and home - CNA",23/04/2020,"SINGAPORE: Since circuit breaker measures were implemented in Singapore on Apr 7, many more people have been working from home. Despite the time savings, some have found this arrangement a bane rather than a boon.
Telecommuting, or working from home, can lead to working longer hours remotely with little breaks and social isolation, especially when there is lack of support from bosses and organisations.
As a psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health, I’ve seen first-hand how some struggle to draw the line between work and home.
Some of my clients find themselves working more than 50 hours a week, which exceeds the 48 hour cap of the Ministry of Manpower’s Employment Act. They also work with little to no interaction with other people.
Overworking and isolation cause increased stress, which could fuel physical problems such as musculoskeletal and metabolic issues, as well as mental health problems such as loneliness and depression.
One of my clients felt compelled to work longer hours as she had many meetings and calls to attend to until the evening. The fear of having things accumulate, letting her supervisor and herself down and failing to meet deadlines made it difficult for her to stop, causing her to be exhausted and depressed.
When she reached breaking point, she turned to me for help.
That episode made me realise that while we have focused on taking care of our physical health this coronavirus outbreak, we may have neglected our mental well-being.
1. STAY CONNECTED
Many of my clients have shared how distraught they are at the loss of face-to-face interactions in their lives, since all social activities have grounded to a halt.

I cannot emphasise how critical it is to stay connected during this period. Don’t just use technology for work – use it to keep in touch with friends and family, whether through voice calls, video conferencing, instant messaging or emails.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
After all, we are social creatures who benefit from love, attention, support and comfort. A reduction in social connections can be disorienting, even destabilising. 
Seeking your loved ones out and maintaining your relationships with them through virtual activities are some ways you can continue to bond. How about throwing an online karaoke video party?
In fact, my colleagues and I try to organise weekly lunch meetings via video calls while working from home.
If you live alone, you can join local online groups through Facebook or Instagram to interact with your neighbours. Who knows what new joys you might discover? Some people have learnt of new deals and tried new restaurants based on their neighbours’ recommendations.
This is a great way to make new friends and to support local businesses.
2. MANAGE CHANGES WITH KINDNESS
During this period of change, try to also be kind to one another.
One of my clients shared that she was required to report to her manager several times a day via video calls to give updates on her work progress. She found that immensely stressful and anxiety-inducing.

Together, we worked on communicating her needs to her manager. Thankfully, her manager understood the struggles of working remotely, had an open mind and was more flexible on deliverables, thus building mutual trust.
Understanding what your real challenges are and communicating clearly can help you and your co-workers get through work and foster a stronger relationship despite the physical distance.
For all you know, many in your team face the same challenges yet do not speak up. Do not be afraid to voice what works for you and establish boundaries that enable you to function well from home.
For supervisors, you will inevitably be concerned about staff performance but try to nurture a concern first for their well-being. Understanding where your subordinates are coming from, what constraints they face and how they can work more effectively, might inform new win-win arrangements.
Some of the happiest, most engaged teams are also the most productive.
3. FOCUS ON WHAT’S WITHIN YOUR CONTROL
The uncertainty of the situation has hit a number of my clients.
“How long it will last? Should I join everyone else in panic buying? Will I have enough food? Will I get the virus? Will I even have my job? Will I have enough money to survive? What will happen to my family?”
It is common to have these worries. But instead of dwelling on them, learn to accept things that aren’t within your control, and focus on the things that are: Reading news from official outlets, buying what you need, adapting to new work conditions, saving wisely and finding out what resources are available for support.
While the uncertainty may seem unsettling initially, if you learn to live with the anxiety while continuing with practices and habits that bring you meaning, these feelings will reduce with time.
4.PRACTISE SELF-CARE
Some of my clients unwilling to avoid work feel guilty for increasing the load on their colleagues or neglecting their tasks.

An unhelpful thought that we often have is that caring for yourself and unplugging from work means you will definitely work less and leave others to pick up the slack. But life is rarely that binary.
Just think about all those airline videos that instruct people to wear their own oxygen masks before attending to others. You must take care of yourself first before helping others. 
If you are unwell and overextend yourself, you will also slow down the whole team.
Instead, take this chance to care for yourself and practise social responsibility by taking a break. Once you have recuperated, you can return to action.
Having a healthy lifestyle – eating well, sleeping enough, exercising and engaging in leisure activities – is also part of self-care. Use this opportunity to focus on looking within yourself through reading or meditating.
5. BE GRATEFUL
Finding reasons to be grateful can contribute to our mental health during this period.
I am grateful for the way Singapore has handled the outbreak – with its dissemination of clear information on accessible channels, contact tracing, the efficient restocking of supermarket goods and economic measures to support households and businesses.
On a personal level, I am also thankful for the opportunity to work from home. Even though my husband and I have been together for more than a decade, I have never seen him at work.

Through this experience, I have seen a different side of him – his ability to strategise, command and be assertive. This has made me appreciate and understand him more.
Finding new ways to appreciate the people you live with will deepen your relationship and reduce conflict.
A FINAL WORD OF ADVICE
If things get tough, you can reach out and seek help. You do not need to face these concerns alone.
The recently launched National Care Hotline offers emotional support to those worried about COVID-19. It is manned by over 300 trained workers from over 50 agencies and organisations.
As telecommuting becomes the new normal, remember to care of yourself and look out for your colleagues so that you can navigate these changes with compassion and empathy.
Prioritising our mental well-being will help us make the most out of working from home.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/covid19-recovering-addicts-circuit-breaker-we-care-12657754,"‘Not the same on Zoom’: For recovering addicts, why safe distancing could spell a relapse - CNA",20/04/2020,"SINGAPORE: On the first day of the “circuit breaker”, Eugene was triggered by a flashback of being sexually abused by his mother for three years when he was in school.
Usually, his flashbacks resemble a polaroid-like snapshot, like an image of his mother’s dress, and hit him like major gut punch.
But for the first time in his life, the 40-year-old’s memories served up the “most graphic flashback of them all” – a playback of the abuse happening to him.
“That moment tore down all my belief that I am worthy of everything good, everything I’ve been trying to build all these years. Instead, I felt shame and guilt,” he shared over the phone three days after the incident.
Eugene is one of the eight recovering addicts who spoke with CNA Insider, on condition of anonymity, about how the “circuit breaker” period amid the COVID-19 outbreak has affected their recovery.
“When the flashback happened, my mind froze,” said Eugene. “I just cried and cried. I had major anxiety. 
I couldn’t talk. I couldn’t even breathe. It’s almost paralysing.
In normal times, he’d be able to turn easily to his counsellor, Tham Yuen Han – or Han, as her clients call her. For nine years, Eugene has been attending recovery support group sessions and individual counselling sessions at We Care Community Services, ever since he first sought help for his methamphetamine addiction.
But under Singapore’s stringent safe distancing measures rolled out on Apr 7, We Care has had to move sessions online at least until May 4, possibly longer if the measures are extended. The recovery centre deals with a range of addictions, such as alcohol, drug, sex and love, gambling and binge eating.

MORE IN DISTRESS
Eugene isn’t the only recovering addict who has been triggered under the stress and isolation of the past fortnight.
According to Yuen Han, the managing director of We Care, the centre usually gets two walk-in crisis situations in a week. But within the first week of the “circuit breaker”, it attended to six crisis calls – five from current clients, and one from a newcomer.
These calls related, for instance, to trauma flashbacks, anxiety attacks, paranoia and financial distress.
Charles, 58, a recovering alcoholic, empathises with those struggling with having to stay home for weeks on end. “For those younger in their sobriety journey, it is very difficult to be confined in one place,” he said.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
“I remember the first time I was on a plane for six hours (without alcohol) – I wanted to jump out of the plane after four hours.”

This period would also be “highly distressing” to newly recovering addicts who must live under the same roof with family members they have strained ties with. Said Yuen Han: “Their addiction would have damaged their family relationship over the years, and they wouldn’t have had enough recovery time to mend it yet.”
Structure is paramount to maintaining sobriety, even if one has been sober for years – it’s even more crucial for addicts who are less than six months into recovery. The latter, said Yuen Han, are “just learning to regulate their emotions and to deal with urges, triggers and cravings”.
“They’re also in the early stages of establishing structure and routine. Previously that would entail coming into the centre daily, getting up at a certain time, turning up for a specific meeting, checking in with the counsellor, or group therapy on a certain day at a certain time,” she added.
The “circuit breaker” would have disrupted those routines.

ISOLATION THE ENEMY
But it’s the isolation that can most take its toll.
Take Hafiz, 33, a newly recovering methamphetamine addict who has been clean for three months. When his wife – who’s in an essential service job – leaves for work every day, he’s left alone with his thoughts at home, and vulnerable to a relapse.
The toilet in his master bedroom, where he would get high the past, can be particularly triggering. That’s where technology has been a lifesaver for him. “I can just go on YouTube, Spotify, go for my mindfulness talk, motivation talk (online)… In one day, I can attend two Zoom meetings,” he said.
He has also been learning to develop a routine. “When I was young, nobody taught me how to plan a timetable, how to manage my life. Now, I even share my Google calendar with my wife, so she can see what I update there,” he said.

He even took up work as a McDelivery rider, to keep his mind busy. But after just eight days on the job, McDonald’s suspended all operations.
Similarly, Eugene maintains a fixed schedule to keep his mind from “going haywire” during this time at home. “I wake up and do my meditation... Then I call my sponsor and I go to as many online meetings as possible. Right now, we have lunch meetings, evening meetings – so basically, I just stay connected.”
He added: “My daily check-in (with Han) is important right now. We’ve increased counselling by phone and video to twice a week. Just to see her and hear her voice is comforting.”
We Care has moved its programmes and group plus counselling sessions to Zoom, while counsellors and recovery guides also regularly call or text their clients to check in.

CAN’T REPLACE A HUG
But useful as technology has been in helping them stay in touch, it is not the same as being physically in the same room as a fellow recovering addict sharing about their experiences.
Oliver, 29, who is recovering from an addiction to prescription substances, said: “It’s the little tics, like the way they tell a story. The tone and everything. Not that online meetings mean less, but they’re just not the same.”
Stuart, 63, a member of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Singapore, says there’s an intimacy in physical presence that heightens empathy.
Describing for example how members would giggle at each other’s “terrible stories of imprisonment and violence”, he said: “We simply recognise the madness that drives otherwise nice people to do excessive things.”
Hugs are one of Eugene’s favourite things at group sessions.  “I really, really like to get hugged by people. At the end of the meeting, it’s like, ‘oh my god, cannot wait to hug you guys’,” he said.
Added Oliver: “As sympathetic and supportive as your family members can be, no one can give you that empathy other than another addict. And that itself is very empowering.”

Andrew da Roza, chairman of We Care and an addictions psychotherapist, understands that technology can mute the sense of being in a compassionate, non-judgmental environment. 
“For addicts, that validation is extraordinarily important... That’s a little bit lost on Zoom because you don’t feel the same energy,” he explained.
“Besides, your brain has already associated that particular (meeting) room, all those chairs, the smell, and the light setting with feeling safe.”
In case a client does have a severe relapse, We Care has gotten an exemption from the Ministry of Trade and Industry that allows its counsellors to attend to onsite crisis cases with risk of self-harm, violence, and suicide.
WAYS TO COPE
But for the most part, the recovering addicts that CNA Insider spoke to have found ways to cope with this safe distancing period.
Belle, 45, does so by helping others. Once plagued by loneliness at the height of her drug addiction, and the fear of not being accepted for being transgender, she has since gone for a peer support specialist course to learn to reach out to others.
“Apr 24 will mark my 18th month of being clean. I believe my base is already solid, so I work with newcomers (during this “circuit breaker”). I text them and ask how they are,” she said, adding that she also encourages them to join the Zoom meetings.
Not everyone is so tech savvy. Older folks make up a significant portion of drop-ins at We Care.
Said Ben, 38, who is five months into his recovery: “Most of them didn’t know how to use the computer initially. But the turnout for Zoom meetings has been quite good – a lot of the seniors are learning how to use Zoom, so it’s very comforting.”
Elizabeth, 53, is one of them. “All this while, I didn’t know about computers. But when I came to We Care, they gave me a chance to learn to use computers, use a smartphone. All of my life, I just knew only how to use drugs.”
Charles, now 16 years sober, is confident that the “circuit breaker” won’t make him pick up a drink again. In fact, he sees it as an enforced one-month break from work.
“For many of us with addiction, we’re also workaholics. We do things either zero or everything. So, thank you to the virus for allowing me time to take care of myself,” he said.
As for Eugene, boredom – more so than nasty flashbacks – is the biggest enemy to his sobriety. While others might turn to Netflix to kill time, he loathes sitting around; he needs to move.
“I have two dogs. So I walk them twice a day,” he said.
“I also plan to clean out my closet, throw away stuff I don’t need. Next thing I’m doing is clean up my pantry. Probably run 10km a day. I’m going to be the healthiest I’ve ever been, when this is all over,” he quipped.

While she does not usually have anxiety, she has been experiencing a faster heart rate and shallow breathing more often these days. 
Ms Lim, who was previously diagnosed with type one bipolar disorder and bulimia nervosa, said: “You keep seeing a lot of news and you hear people around you always talking about it, so it does make you feel anxious. 
“And there are a lot of fears in people. I feel like this virus has triggered a sense of uncertainty and insecurity, and made people panic more. I'm more sensitive in nature so I feel that it increases my anxiety level.” 
Ms Lim is just one of the Singaporeans whose mental health has been affected by the COVID-19 situation, feeling anxious and uncertain about the future. 
Calls from new clients to mental health hotlines have gone up, while existing clients have expressed fresh worries about their health and the economic fallout, according to mental health organisations and counsellors CNA spoke to. 
Worldwide, the number of calls made to mental health hotlines has jumped as well, according to news reports. Calls to US federal crisis hotline Disaster Distress Helpline spiked 891 per cent in March year-on-year, CNN reported. In China, hotlines that sprung up in response to the COVID-19 outbreak were inundated by callers, Reuters said. 
For digital marketing freelancer Vivien Yap, 24, who experiences depressive symptoms, she did not feel as anxious about the situation as much as she thought she would at first. 
“When it happened, I felt slightly better because it felt like the whole world was on my level … And it really just felt like the whole world was depressed as well, everyone was going through the same uncertainty.”
However, she started feeling more anxious when she received a notice from her employer informing her that her pay would be cut by 25 to 30 per cent, shortly after the circuit breaker measures were announced on Apr 3. 
Ms Yap, who is also a local musician, is in the middle of producing her next music release, and was worried about her expenses. 
“My pay is being cut by 25 to 30 per cent, that’s quite a lot of money, but I still need to support and pay the people who are helping me (with my music). 
“And I don’t want to tell them, ‘hey we’re in tough times can we slow down the payment?’ because I know (for the arts freelancers) it’s really far worse. So that’s when the anxiety kicked in for me.” 
MORE DIALING IN
Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore’s (SOS) chief executive Gasper Tan said that they received an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019.
The Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) observed an increase in phone calls to several services as well. The SAMH Insight Centre, which provides counselling services, saw an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020, it said. 
Sessions on Fei Yue Community Services’ online counselling portal eC2.sg surged last month, a spokesperson said. The number of chats more than doubled in March this year to 85, after averaging about 40 chats a month in 2018 and 2019. 
According to the various organisations, callers have brought up a range of issues, from their employment prospects - some have lost their jobs, while others will graduate to a potentially bleak employment market - to their increasing fear of catching the invisible pathogen, especially if they were to pass it to their loved ones unknowingly. 
With schools and workplaces shutting down, and restrictions on movements in play, individuals may start to feel a lack of control over their situation as well, leading to more stress that gets harder to manage, said the Fei Yue spokesperson.

“The fear, anxiety and the loss of a sense of control over a prolonged period of time can be detrimental to one’s mental health,” added Mr Tan. 
“Being exposed to prolonged stress may be overwhelming to an individual with intense feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness.”
CONTENTS OF DISCUSSION HAVE “SHIFTED DRASTICALLY”
Attendance at some counselling services has been consistent, but some existing clients have been raising issues related to the virus, they say. 
Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist from Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic, said that the nature of the content within the appointments has “shifted drastically”. 
“The pandemic has affected people in different ways: For some it has given increased anxiety, for others it has created a hyper-vigilance over health-related issues.”
Individuals that are accustomed to a routine and a specific level of socialisation may find it hard to shift their lifestyle patterns, she said, adding that pressure levels among those with mental health conditions may compound as they struggle to adapt to the crisis while dealing with already-present stressors.
Given that the virus is invisible to the human eye, some people have become paranoid about their safety, she added, producing “an attitude of hypervigilance and overthinking where prolonged fear can negatively impact their mental well-being”.
Youth mental health non-profit Limitless has similarly not seen an uptick in people asking for help, its founder Asher Low said, but their beneficiaries have been expressing unease over factors stemming from COVID-19. 
“Some are genuinely concerned about not being able to get jobs, some are concerned about money, some are concerned about losing family members, quite a few are just very affected by the isolation,” he said.

COPING WITH CORONAVIRUS FEARS 
To be mentally healthy during this period, be committed about staying connected with friends and family members, the mental health advocates said. 
“Maintaining a strong social connection, either through social media, texts or calls, is as important as prioritising a healthy diet and sleep pattern,” SOS’ Mr Tan said. “This period is also an opportunity to catch up and engage in meaningful conversations with family members.”
And for those who need someone to confide in - there is no shame in reaching out, the counsellors said. There are hotlines to call - including a national one rolled out on Friday - and mental well-being webinars to join.

For example, Brahm Centre has launched daily workout sessions and mindfulness workshops that participants can join either via Facebook Live or Zoom. 
Instead of harping on the constraints, view the ‘circuit breaker’ as a chance to do something meaningful as well, they said, like signing up for a course online, gardening or learning a new recipe.
“Focus on things that are within your control,” Dr Lazaroo said. “It is important to acknowledge your own limits, and do small activities that can improve your self-care and strengthen your resilience.” 
“Practise mindfulness, gratitude, self-compassion and living in the moment.”

To protect seniors – a vulnerable group at a higher risk of getting a severe infection – activities for them were already suspended earlier in March. 
With further distancing measures in place, the lack of social interaction and physical activity could have a negative impact on the mental and physical health of vulnerable elderly populations, said Dr Chris Tsoi a senior consultant from the department of psychological medicine at the National University Hospital (NUH).
Madam Koh lives alone and has already seen reduced social interactions over the past few weeks.

She has been living alone for more than a decade. 
Speaking in Parliament on Monday (Apr 6), Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee highlighted how the Silver Generation Office reaches out to vulnerable seniors such as those living alone or those who are frail.
""Since last month, Silver Generation Ambassadors have started visiting these seniors in their homes to communicate COVID-19 precautionary measures, such as hygiene tips and social distancing,"" Mr Lee said in response to a question on how vulnerable people are being helped during the pandemic. 
""They also identify seniors who require additional assistance during this period, and link them up with the appropriate social service agencies and service providers to ensure that their needs are met,"" he said.
Home visits by non-governmental organisations (NGOs) or healthcare teams are also useful, Dr Tsoi suggested.
Organisations like Lions Befrienders, whose aim is to provide care and friendship for seniors like Madam Koh, have stepped in.
Lions Befrienders took measures to suspend social activities at its centres in February, affecting more than 6,000 seniors from their network.







                                    

Madam Koh, 82, is one of the many seniors in Singapore who live alone.




Before the outbreak, Madam Koh used to visit the Lions Befrienders’ branch near her home, where she would meet fellow seniors.
“Five days, sometimes six. I stay there between 9am and 5pm before I go home. Now that the centre is closed I sit at home, lah,” she exclaimed.
But these safe distancing measures are necessary.
“Even though it may impact the seniors’ social interaction, it is a necessary move to protect them,” Lions Befrienders said.
With social interactions minimised, staff and volunteers at Lions Befrienders have adapted by calling to check in on seniors at risk of social isolation. Sometimes, these conversations go on longer than usual just to keep the elderly company.
Short home visits are now mainly done for medium or high-risk seniors, meaning those who are home-bound, senior caregivers and potential suicide or abuse cases.

The Singapore Red Cross will also be providing customised care packages and psycho-social support calls for seniors living alone.
“Volunteers are pressing on with fortnightly home visits and weekly befriending calls to the seniors, the Red Cross said in a news release, noting that safety measures for those helping out are in place too.
“These are extraordinarily trying times. It is critical that we intensify our efforts to uplift the most vulnerable in our community, who are amongst the hardest hit,” said Mr Benjamin William, secretary general and CEO of the Singapore Red Cross.
A SOCIAL RECESSION
There have been calls by Members of Parliament (MPs) to resume activities for seniors, but this will likely not take place any time soon.
“I am afraid it will be a while longer before we do that, to protect the seniors. Seniors are of particular concern to us,” Health Minister Mr Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament in March.
Dr Tsoi also cautioned that it is important to take steps now before the potential consequences from isolation develop.
“Researchers have found that chronic loneliness is associated with a greater risk of heart disease, dementia, depression, and anxiety. It’s also associated with a shorter life span. Being lonely raises mortality more than obesity or sedentary living does.”

In the end, humans are social beings, Dr Tsoi pointed out.
“We should continue to let (isolated seniors) know they are loved and cared, so that they do not necessarily feel lonely even when they are staying alone.”
He added new technologies like teleconferencing can help – a solution that Lions Befrienders agrees with.
Equipping the elderly at risk with basic tools like mobile phones and WiFi can help them be digitally-savvy and lead a more independent and empowered life, Lions Befrienders said.
“WHERE CAN I GO?”
Some elderly are also being roped in - with their safety in mind - to help with national efforts to tackle the coronavirus.
RSVP Singapore, a volunteer group comprising of seniors, said their volunteers were involved in a nationwide initiative to distribute hand sanitisers to the public and to pack essentials like masks for frontline transport workers.
“We have received much positive feedback from our volunteers, who have enjoyed their volunteering sessions,” the chairman of RSVP Singapore, Mr Koh Juay Meng, PBM said.
Madam Koh too has learned other ways to cope with the heightened isolation by talking to her friends over the phone, singing and watching television.
“I watch the Chinese channel, the (Tamil) channel, the Malay channel. I watch them all now,” she laughed.




                        

Madam Koh has found new ways to keep herself occupied.



When asked if she wanted to meet her friends, Madam Koh immediately exclaimed: “Tak mau, tak mau,” a Malay phrase to express reluctance.
“Whether I like it or not, where can I go? If I go out, I might fall sick,” she said. “Cannot. Tak mau.”
It is not all bleak, however. Most seniors are understanding, Dr Tsoi said.
“For them, avoiding infection by the virus would be more important. They are usually more considerate and don’t want to be burdening others.
“For the majority of the healthy group, their resilience in character has been well-built as they age.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/working-towards-a-zero-suicide-rate-in-singapore-12606260,Commentary: Working together towards a zero-suicide Singapore - CNA,05/04/2020,"SINGAPORE: Not trying hard enough. Weak. Crazy. Seeking attention. Selfish. Beyond help.
These are common accusations rooted in myths that people with suicidal behaviour have to contend with.
For Lucy (not her real name), having witnessed and lost a friend to suicide, she finds herself struggling with suicide ideation on a daily basis.
It cost me my university education, landed me in tens of thousands of debt, and left me with little means to earn enough to pay back my study loan and survive on my own. I will likely never be able to earn more than S$1000 a month, and will likely take my life than die of other causes in the near future. 
Unfortunately, Lucy is not alone in her hopelessness and despair. Alongside 46 other respondents in a public consultation on mental health conducted by my team, their struggles were compounded by stigma and the lack of understanding surrounding suicides in our society.
DISPELLING MYTHS AROUND SUICIDE
In Singapore, it is a common fear that talking about suicide could encourage suicidal behaviour. 
Rather than avoiding conversation, it is important that we learn how to talk about suicides responsibly. The expert consensus is to promote resources and reasons for optimism in our conversations, rather than engaging in stigmatising language. 
Therefore, if we suspect that a family member or friend may be suicidal, there is no need to give solutions to their problems immediately. Without any judgement, just listen and be with them until the despair and desperation fades, before gently encouraging them to speak with a counsellor or doctor.
Secondly, suicides do not arise from mental illnesses alone. 
According to the WHO, there are social and environmental factors embedded within our society and structures that contribute to an individual’s intention to self-harm or suicide. 
In Singapore, intense feelings of hopelessness can also arise from sudden and adverse life events including unemployment, trauma and the loss of loved ones.
I understand this all too well. 13 years ago, I contemplated the possibility of ending it all in the despair caused by a messy divorce, a failed business, and only S$16 in my bank account. Thankfully, I neither attempted nor self-harmed. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
It is, therefore, important to understand that suicidal thoughts can be experienced by anyone, not just certain segments of our society.

Thirdly, portrayals of suicides as a selfish decision is inaccurate. 
My cousin, who has attempted suicide several times, often shares that he feels that he’s a burden to his family, even as he acknowledged that he knows how much we love him. 
While reading a research study on suicide notes in Singapore, a note that brought me to tears was left by a father for his family. 
“Father is reluctant to leave all of you. I have failed so badly that I have no choice.” 
We need to understand that people who attempt suicide commonly feel that their lives hamper others, viewing their decisions as relieving their loved ones.
Most importantly, it is a myth that those intent on suicide are beyond help.
Suicides are preventable. Studies have shown that suicides occurs after much thought and deliberation, which suggests that timely interventions do matter. Moreover, 50 to 60 per cent of suicide victims give some warning of their intentions to a friend or family member.
Struggling with depression, Mark (not his real name) shared with me that unlike his previous counsellors who were dismissive, his current psychologist took the effort to pick up his calls at any hour of the day, especially during the worst of his episodes. He is incredibly grateful to her support. 
“She was the one who worked with me until I was able to hold a job, and until I no longer needed sessions with her. She is the one who saved my life.”
THE REALITY OF SUICIDES IN SINGAPORE
Although it is important to dispel myths surrounding suicide, what is more fundamental is for our Government to lead and coordinate efforts in suicide prevention.
I was dismayed to find out that Singapore was one of the few ""high income"" countries listed without a national suicide prevention strategy by the World Health Organization (WHO). Given the current situation of suicides in our country, I worry that a lack of strategy is costing us dearly.
From 2017 to 2019, there were 1,204 attempted suicides yearly. 
Last year, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) reported that there were 8.36 suicides per 100,000 Singapore residents in 2018, up from 7.74 in 2017. 
Although our numbers are not high by international standards, the number of deaths by suicides in Singapore has not seen a significant fall from 9.5 suicides per 100,000 residents in the 1980s to 8.3 suicides per 100,000 residents today.

In 2018, teenage suicides were the highest since suicide tracking started in 1991. This is the same for the elderly aged 60 and above who took their own lives. Suicide has also entrenched itself as the leading cause of death for those aged 10 to 29. 
""Every life is precious, and each suicide is one too many.""
In Parliament last year, Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee made this commitment towards a national response for suicide prevention.  
If we are to walk the talk, we need to commit to a zero-suicide Singapore. Through a clear commitment of prioritising and tackling suicide, the Government could make accessible resources for necessary interventions throughout our society.
TOWARDS ZERO SUICIDES
To achieve a zero-suicide Singapore, the Government must start with identifying currently available resources, while committing further resources and funding towards suicide prevention.
One example is to expand funding for organisations like Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), not just to operate our de-facto national suicide helpline, but to ensure timely follow-ups with callers who need further support. 
I am heartened by the Government’s recent assurance that hospitals will track admissions arising from suicide attempts. This should feed into a national strategy of data surveillance coordinated across government agencies and community partners, allowing us to develop informed strategies on suicide prevention. 
In schools, many education systems such as the State Government of Victoria in Australia establish step-by-step guidelines on what to do in the event of a suicide attempt. Similarly, the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Singapore should consider laying out their suicide protocols to parents and students clearly and transparently, to help confront increasing suicides amongst our teens.
When developing a national strategy for suicide, it is also important to include the police, the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), hospitals, our teachers and community support groups, including the SOS, Please Stay Movement, Caring for Life and Oogachaga. Such alignment is necessary, to avoid having a fragmented and sub-optimal approach in suicide prevention.
Above all, we need to remember that all of us play a part in achieving zero suicides. Apart from educating ourselves about suicides, we should be compassionate and empathetic towards those experiencing suicide ideation.
We must work together towards a zero-suicide society that cares because every life matters.  And we will not be alone - countries such as the United States, South Korea, Japan and Sweden have already adopted their respective zero-suicide visions.
A zero-suicide Singapore as a goal complements our Vision Zero aspiration for workplace safety, and the Zero Accident movement for our public transportation. This is because when it comes to human lives, such as Lucy’s and Mark’s, nothing short of zero should ever been good enough for us.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/discriminatory-hiring-persons-with-mental-health-12530752,Commentary: Will you hire and retain persons with mental health conditions? - CNA,15/03/2020,"SINGAPORE: The problem of mental health among employees in Singapore is real.
Four in 10 Singaporeans had gross misconceptions and therefore prejudices about persons with mental health conditions.
These were but some of the findings in the Attitudes Study on Persons with Mental Health conditions by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) in 2018. The same study also found that nearly one in two Singaporeans are unwilling to work with colleagues facing mental health issues.
The Singapore Mental Health Survey 2016 revealed that the rate of unemployment among those with at least one mental disorder was 8.3 per cent which was significantly higher than the 4.8 per cent rate of unemployment in those without mental illness.
STEPS IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION
In December 2019, the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices announced (TAFEP) updated its guidelines to employers that asking job applications to declare their mental health conditions without good reason is discriminatory - a move that many had advocated for many years, which I also echoed in my maiden speech in Parliament in November 2018. 
Last week at the Committee of Supply debate, in response to my and other MPs’ questions, the Ministry of Manpower announced that a tripartite advisory on mental well-being will be issued in the second half of this year to educate employers on what could be done.
Despite these steps in the right direction, many have asked me to talk about the elephant in the room: Are these efforts and measures enough to make employers hire and retain persons with mental health issues? Yes, because there are real benefits to doing so.
Today, evidence shows that investing in workplace mental well-being is not only the right thing but also the smart thing to do as it improves productivity and long-term business sustainability.
A 2017 survey of 505 companies by NCSS found that for every S$1 invested in workplace adjustment (like flexible work arrangements, job redesign, peer training) to support persons recovering from mental health conditions, it generated an average return of S$5.60 through a reduction in absenteeism and medical claims as well as an increase in productivity.
In fact, I think the real elephant in the room is this: With one in seven people in Singapore experiencing a mental health condition in their lifetime, employers know they cannot pretend that mental health and well-being is someone else’s problem because part of our workforce will have to grapple with mental health conditions while under employment.

With young adults most at risk of suffering from mental disorders in Singapore as reported in the Singapore Mental Health Study, hiring and talent retention practices must clearly evolve now to support these millennial employees so that businesses can thrive in the future economy.
COMMUNITY INITIATIVES
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
There has been a groundswell of community efforts in recent years to raise and promote awareness of mental health.
Beyond the Label, an anti-stigma campaign launched by NCSS in 2018, helped start a much needed national conversation on mental health.
Recognising that leaders play a key role in integrating well-being in their company because they shape the company’s culture, 25 C-suite leaders from public and private sectors joined me to start the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup (WLW) in May 2018 to share, discuss and co-create fair and inclusive practices to support employee mental health as a strategic priority.
Many wonder how employers would view them if they come forward to share their mental health challenges. I think there is nothing more powerful in creating a safe and destigmatising environment than bosses and leaders taking the first step to share their own mental health journeys.
Accenture, a WLW leader, is a trailblazer in creating such psychological safety in their workplaces. Sharing his own story of coping with anxiety, Senior Partner Pavan Sethi certainly led by example and helped create a space of trust for his team members to understand that should they face mental health difficulties, they aren’t any less valued.
Here are some examples from a handful of our WLW leaders on how they employ and support persons with mental health conditions:
At Johnson & Johnson, “mental health diplomats” are employees with lived experiences of mental conditions and allies who encourage peer-to-peer conversations about mental health and well-being.
At Aviva and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), they have in place necessary coaching, counselling and peer support structures alongside flexible work arrangement policies for employees who live with mental health conditions.
NCSS is a pioneer in Singapore with training 22 wellness warriors in mental health first aid to be “first respondents” for distressed colleagues. It has also produced a Mental Health Toolkit for Employers.
EMPLOYERS NEED A PARADIGM SHIFT
Small and medium-sized enterprises need to be, in my view, even more progressive and adaptive in their attraction and retention strategies, given the local talent war with larger employers and reducing dependence on foreign manpower.
Hush TeaBar was founded to promote mental wellness and empathy with silence and tea in workplaces, out of my own brush with depression when my world collapsed around me 13 years ago. The team is made up entirely of seven differently-abled employees - Deaf persons and persons who live with mental health conditions and learning difficulties.

For almost two years now, the team has been running all projects for large MNCs and schools, even creating our current campaign to distribute our specially designed self-care kits to healthcare workers, completely on their own. Yes, we have had to make many workplace adjustments and job redesign but I see that as precious lessons in adaptability and innovation as Hush continues to thrive with these dedicated and resilient employees who are able to fulfill their true potential. 
Minister of State for Manpower and National Development Zaqy Mohamad mentioned in parliament last week pilots and police officers as professions in which good mental health is important. Some may even say that for jobs like doctors, teachers and bus drivers we must surely insist on good mental health as a prerequisite.
Yet this is the paradigm shift we need to make. Mental health is not just good or bad, nor now or never - it is a continuum because our environment and life events play a significant role in our mental wellbeing. 
We mustn’t forget that “human” comes first when we talk about human resources or human capital.
Former CEO of the HSBC Group John Flint started a very progressive conversation with the bank’s 238,000 employees across 55 countries on how to be the best version of themselves. Among those who have gone through mental health conditions, John learnt that “they are the ones who often possess a resilience, a resourcefulness, an empathy and an EQ that the rest do not possess”.
I cannot agree more. Resilient companies are built from resilient employees, and every employee is a member of our society.

Eligible families will have their student care fees subsidised by up to S$60 more each month under the Student Care Fee Assistance (SCFA) scheme, he said. 
Speaking in Parliament during MSF’s Committee of Supply session, Associate Professor Faishal added that to benefit more families, MSF will also raise the monthly household income cap to qualify for the subsidy from S$4,000 to S$4,500, and the per capita income from S$1,000 to S$1,125. 
Around 9,000 students will benefit from these enhancements this year, Assoc Prof Faishal said. 
Overall, fees for registered Student Care Centres (SCCs), including those in the community, have remained stable, Assoc Prof Faishal said. The current median fee is S$295 per month, close to the median of S$290 per month in 2015, he said.
For school-based SCCs, the Ministry of Education puts in place measures to keep fees affordable, he said.
Operators are selected via a competitive procurement process, where they are required to state any proposed fee increases throughout their six-year contract upfront. This is taken into account as part of the bidding evaluation criteria. Contract specifications also limit the types of fees that operators can charge.
“We want to ensure that student care remains affordable, especially for lower-income families,” said Assoc Prof Faishal. 
YOUTH MENTAL WELL-BEING NETWORK
MSF will be establishing a Youth Mental Well-being Network, minister Desmond Lee also said on Thursday.
The latest Singapore Mental Health Study noted that young people between 18 and 34 years of age had a higher prevalence of mental health conditions, compared to older people, Mr Lee said.
“Mental health issues are complex, but prevention, early detection and intervention can go a long way to help,” he said.
Last month, Mr Lee made an open call for people interested in the topic of youth mental well-being to step forward to contribute ideas and turn these ideas into reality.
In total, more than 700 individuals and organisations have responded, and the number continues to grow, Mr Lee said.
Many are young people who are concerned by this issue and want to do something about it, he added.
“Some have struggled with mental health issues, some are caregivers or therapists of people with mental health issues,” he said.
Everyone who stepped forward during the open call will have an opportunity to be part of this network, he added.
“We will get to know one other, identify areas to collaborate, and work together to deliver programmes and interventions to better support our youths. The work is just beginning. In a way, how we intend to do this is uncharted waters,” he said.
He noted that some early ideas include providing information and raising awareness about available resources, so that people know where to go for help and to do so earlier.
“I hope many Singaporeans will partner us to jointly develop solutions for a happier and healthier Singapore. Our young people deserve the best start in life possible,” he said.
While mental health is not a new area for MSF, “we are keenly aware of the issues and struggles faced by those who have mental health issues”, Mr Lee said.
“A person’s mental well-being affects their families, neighbours, colleagues and friends. It is more than a medical issue faced by an individual.”

Speaking in Parliament during the Committee of Supply debate, Dr Lam noted that recent engagements with youths showed ""mental well-being continues to be a top concern"", indicating that more needs to be done. 
The Integrated Youth Service, jointly developed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), Institute of Mental Health, Agency for Integrated Care and Care Corner, is described in an MOH press release as a ""one-stop service where at-risk youths can access coordinated mental health and support services such as individualised basic emotional support, needs identification and befriending services"". 
It will be launched in the second half of 2020. 
Care Corner will reach out to youths in a series of outreach events, beginning in Woodlands. 
Dr Lam said that MOH will continue to take a ""whole-of-society approach"" and work with other ministries to address youth mental health needs. In addition, the ministry will work with the National Youth Council on the Youth Mental Well-being Network, he added. 
The network aims to ""bring together (the) diverse perspectives and views"" of those who have reached out to the Government with ideas for improving youth mental well-being, said Minister for Social and Family Development Desmond Lee in a Facebook post on Feb 27. 
CAREGIVER SUPPORT NETWORK
MOH will also be piloting a “structured system of support” for caregivers of persons with mental health conditions, announced Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor on Thursday. 
“We must also not forget that the well-being of persons with mental health conditions often rests on the caregivers and the caregivers are at risk of burnout,” she said. 
Hospitals and community partners will provide caregivers with information such as disease progression and expected care needs, and link them up with the necessary health, financial and social support services upon the first diagnosis of their loved ones, said Dr Khor. 
“With this, we hope that caregivers will know upfront that they are not alone, that there is an entire network of support for them.” 
In a separate press release, MOH said that the system will allow caregivers early access to community support, and be equipped with the skills and knowledge to care for their loved ones at home. 
Dr Khor noted that MOH has set up 43 community outreach teams and trained more than 24,000 frontline workers to identify people with mental health needs and refer them to the appropriate support. 
As of December, the ministry has reached out to more than 300,000 people and provided assistance to more than 23,000 who were at risk of developing mental health conditions or dementia, she added. 
“Like a migraine or backache, we should seek help for mental health issues early, so as to avoid problems that are more challenging to address later on.”

“One key challenge our youths face today is mental well-being,” said Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah in Parliament on Wednesday (Mar 4).
As such, mental health will be part of the new CCE curriculum in secondary schools, “to help students to understand common mental health issues and their symptoms, know when and how to seek help for themselves and others, and develop empathy and care towards persons with mental health issues”, said Ms Indranee, during her ministry’s Committee of Supply debate.
Similarly, polytechnics and the Institute for Technical Education (ITE) have also worked with the Health Promotion Board to develop mental health resources for students.
Other than educating students, teachers will also create “a positive school learning environment”.
Teachers are taught to create a “positive classroom culture” as part of their training, and “positive teacher-students relationships are strongly emphasised”, said Ms Indranee. The ministry will develop teachers’ capabilities through SkillsFuture for Educators.
Building on that, schools will have to teach students how to overcome setbacks.
“To help students face challenges confidently, we will help students develop the resilience mindset of ‘I am, I have, I can’,” said Ms Indranee.
This mindset will teach students to appreciate their strengths, harness positive beliefs about themselves, tap on peer and family support and equip them with skills such as emotional regulation, problem-solving and managing relationships and conflicts.
As peer support can contribute to students’ well-being, MOE will also establish peer support structures in every school by 2022.
“Our vision is for every student to be a peer supporter, forming a strong network of support in their class, CCA (co-curricular activity) or peer group, where they can look out for each other and seek guidance from teachers or counsellors where necessary,” said Ms Indranee.
Despite these measures, students who still struggle with mental health issues will require more support, she added.
Teachers in schools and Institute of Higher Learnings’ class advisors will be trained to pick up signs of distress, reach out to these students and refer them to mental health professionals if needed.
MORAL VALUES AND DISCUSSIONS ON CONTEMPORARY ISSUES
As part of the refreshed CCE curriculum, primary schools will emphasise the teaching of moral values, said Education Minister Ong Ye Kung during his Committee of Supply speech on Wednesday.
“As the Chinese saying goes … values before academics,” said Mr Ong.
The bulk of CCE lessons for Primary 1 to 3 students will be devoted to character and values, while CCE and mother tongue lessons for all primary school students will be better aligned, as many character and values lessons are taught during mother tongue lessons, he said.
National education and citizenship, currently part of the CCE curriculum, will be taught during the Form Teacher Guidance Period instead. This will apply to Primary 4 to 6 students.
MOE will also increase efforts to engage secondary school students on contemporary issues through CCE lessons, covering topics such as climate change, government policies and race and religion.
“(Some of these topics) may be sensitive to discuss, but they are important to help our students better understand the complexities of our country and our life,” said Mr Ong.
“Teachers will guide students to listen attentively, converse respectfully and be open to differing perspectives.”
 As specialised skills may be needed to facilitate discussion of complex or sensitive topics, every secondary school will have specialised CCE teachers by 2022.
Outside the classroom, CCE will be integrated into activities such as CCAs, camps, cohort learning journeys and Values-in-Action. 
Three new models of CCA allocation will be piloted at several primary schools in 2020, aimed at eliminating CCA selection trials.
The ministry is also looking into expanding a pilot that allows students to participate in CCAs not offered in their schools, while some schools will trial combined teams for CCAs with small enrolment.
The new CCE curriculum will be progressively implemented in all primary and secondary schools from 2021, said Mr Ong.
KNOWING ASIA
To allow students to engage Southeast Asia better, the humanities curriculum will place more emphasis on studying Asia, said Mr Ong.
“It must provide students with a deeper appreciation of the geographies, histories, cultures, languages and economies of our regional countries,” he said.
More overseas trips will also be organised to Asian countries. Singaporean students should experience Asia, as it is “our own backyard” and where Singaporeans “have a natural competitive advantage”, added Mr Ong.
These measures will go towards the 70-70 goal announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Sweet Keat in his Budget statement.
Under this goal, Institutes of Higher Learning will aim for 70 per cent of their students to have overseas exposure, with a further 70 per cent of these students to have exposure to ASEAN, China or India.
MOE will also teach conversational ASEAN languages starting with Vietnamese and Thai.  This will be offered to students from primary to pre-university levels and it will be a 10-hour language and cultural exposure component.
“Southeast Asia is one of the fastest-growing regions in the world. Together with China, India, Japan, Korea, they all form part of our natural hinterland.
“Singapore-based enterprises need to be able to venture out to the region, and Singaporeans must be able to play a part in it. To do so, we need to be equipped with the relevant knowledge, language and cultural skills,” said Mr Ong.

In his Committee of Supply speech on Tuesday (Mar 3), Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad said that the ministry will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on mental wellbeing to educate employers on what can be done. 
The advisory will highlight initiatives companies should emulate, and that could include access to anonymised external counselling service, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early. 
MOM aims to finalise the advisory in the second half of this year. 
The ministry is also piloting iWorkHealth, a web-based psychosocial assessment tool to help employers and their employees identify workplace stressors, while recommending ways to improve mental well-being. The tool is expected to launch later this year.  
National Trades Union Congress’ (NTUC) assistant secretary-general Melvin Yong separately announced in his speech that the union will work with the Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Council and the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) to promote mental wellbeing at workplaces. 
The group will profile inclusive employers “who have gone the extra mile to put in place robust mental wellness programmes to help employees stay mentally healthy and resilient”, Mr Yong said, with the aim of having them as industry role models.
DISCRIMINATION ON GROUNDS OF MENTAL HEALTH 
In response to Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong’s question whether sick leave entitlements can be used for both physical and mental health conditions, Mr Zaqy said that this is already the case.
When issuing medical certificates, a doctor should not indicate to the employer the nature of the patient’s medical condition unless the patient has consented to it, he said. 
Employers are expected to practise fair employment practices laid out in the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, Mr Zaqy pointed out. Discrimination on grounds of a person’s mental health condition will be penalised.
However, he noted that for certain occupations such as pilots and police officers, some mental health conditions may affect their ability to perform their job roles effectively. 
""In these cases, it is reasonable for employers to ask applicants for more information to make a holistic assessment of their wellbeing,"" he said.
""Otherwise, employers should not be asking for information on the applicant’s mental health.""

This includes the individual's mental health condition, said the Public Service Division (PSD).
Since May 1, 2017, the PSD has removed all declaration questions on medical health from job application forms, Mr Chan said in response to a question from Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong.
She had asked for the public service's response to the latest guidelines by the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) which states that it is discriminatory to ask job applicants to declare their mental health condition without good reason.
The guidelines, which was revised in December, also called for all declarations on mental health condition be removed from job application forms.
Ms Ong also asked for the number of applicants who declared their mental health condition and joined the public service. Mr Chan said that the Government does not track those figures.
Mr Chan said the public service is committed to providing its officers with “an inclusive and mental health-friendly workplace”. This includes access to counselling and alternative work arrangements for those with mental health conditions to better manage their condition or recovery, as well as getting the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to teach managers how to detect early signs of distress.
More than 500 public officers have taken part in HPB’s workshop so far.
Ms Ong also brought up the case of an individual who applied as a relief teacher but was rejected due to a history of depression. In reply, Mr Chan said Ms Ong could follow up with the Ministry of Education or the PSD on this specific case.
She also wanted to know if the Government allows its employees to apply for mental health leave and make medical claims for psychiatric treatment. 
The public service does not have ""mental health"" leave at this point in time, Mr Chan said in reply.
“But I am sure if somebody for medical exigencies needs extra care they can contact their respective supervisors and we can work out the appropriate arrangements,"" he added.

And cancer.
Mr Mathiyan and Mr Luqman were the only two cancer survivors on a trekking trip last December to Northern Mongolia to raise funds for the Singapore Cancer Society. Mr Mathiyan, 60, was diagnosed with both rectal and testicular cancer in March 2011. Because of an operation to remove the tumor from his rectum, he has to wear a stoma bag on his abdomen to collect waste from his body.
Mr Luqman was hit hard at a much younger age. The 30-year-old found out that he had stage two lymphoma when he was 17 after a doctor noticed a lump on his neck.
Both of them have long been in remission. But memories of the physical pain and loneliness they felt during their treatment have not disappeared.







                                    

Cancer survivors Ellil Mathiyan (left) and Amal Luqman (right). (Photo: Rachel Phua).




“Chemotherapy made me nauseous all the time,” said Mr Luqman, now a social studies and literature secondary school teacher. “I was puking to the extent I thought I couldn’t puke any more, but there were still things coming out of my mouth. Black bile.”
It wasn’t just the frequent feeling of wanting to retch. His sore throat was unimaginably bad, he said, and he lost most of his appetite.
Mr Mathiyan, who had to walk around with the skin between his legs raw from the radiotherapy, said the side effects from the cancer treatments are nothing “you would ever wish on your worst enemies”.
Friends and family tried to show their care and concern, said Mr Luqman, but he chose to withdraw instead. It didn’t help that he felt weak the whole time and he often had to skip school.







                                    

Mr Luqman, 30 and now a secondary school teacher, was diagnosed with lymphoma when he was 17. (Photo: Chung Yong Xi).




While his wife and friends were often ready with cups of tea or to accompany him for his chemotherapy session, it was his support groups – an online one from the UK and another at the Singapore General Hospital – that made him feel like his suffering was truly understood, said Mr Mathiyan.
Having gone through the agony of cancer with comfort from friends, family and fellow patients, Mr Luqman and Mr Mathiyan have both felt the need to return in kind by helping other cancer sufferers.
Besides raising funds for the Singapore Cancer Society through the 12-day winter expedition organised by travel agency Beyond Expeditions SG, both men wanted to inspire others like them to not feel battered by the pronouncement of a cancer diagnosis.
“A lot of people when they are diagnosed…they get very depressed. One of the motivations was to tell them there are still lots of things they can do,” said Mr Mathiyan, who is an avid swimmer, dragon-boater and Zumba dancer.







                                    

Mr Mathiyan was diagnosed with rectal and testicular cancer in 2011. The experience made him realise he wanted to use the rest of his life to help others like him. (Photo: Chung Yong Xi).



Apart from his overseas adventures – Mr Mathiyan had previously travelled in 2018 to the Gobi Desert for the same cause – the part-time administrative manager at a metal recycling company has his hands full with volunteer work. He is co-chair of the SingHealth Patient Advocacy Network, a founding member of the Ostomy Association of Singapore that looks into the needs of people with stoma bags, and patient ambassador with several hospitals.
Unlike his older counterpart, this was Mr Luqman’s first time getting behind the cancer cause. It was an opportunity for him to share his journey with cancer and raise funds for patients that need financial assistance at the same time.
“I don’t see myself as an inspirational figure,” he said. “I think my takeaway from have the illness is to just survive. It may not take much but that (little bit of) resilience and perseverance can get you quite far.”
“Just staying alive and surviving is extraordinary in its own way.”
ONCE IN YOUR SHOES
Health advocacy groups CNA spoke to said having current and former clients participate in their advocacy work is invaluable as they are able to offer a personal and empathetic touch to the cause.
“They fully understand the pain, struggles and issues faced by cancer patients,” said a spokesperson from the Singapore Cancer Society, which runs five cancer support groups, among other programmes. “Sometimes, people want to know how other cancer survivor cope, especially after a major operation that would change their normalcy of life.”
Out of the 1,495 support group members, 90 cancer patients and survivors volunteer with the non-profit, where they provide psychosocial support for other cancer survivors, raise awareness about cancer and cancer prevention message, and help with the planning and publicity of events.
These volunteers give assurance to newly diagnosed patients that they are not alone in this battle, said the SCS spokesperson. For example, the oncologist might have the technical expertise to explain the process, outcome and impact of chemotherapy, but what matters to a cancer patient might be something as minor as physical appearance and hair loss.
“Having people to share tips and tricks on how to get around these sort of social challenges are tremendously helpful and often overlooked by doctors.”
A Singapore Heart Foundation (SHF) spokesperson said that clients who step forward to share their stories of cardiovascular diseases and recovery process help “paint a more realistic picture behind the statistics of the disease”, which is the leading cause of death in Singapore.
SHF, which serves 2,125 clients as of March 2019’s figures, has around 15 former and current heart disease patients who sought help from the organisation that now either donate to SHF or participate in their heart health campaigns annually, said the spokesperson.
Some give talks so that the public can better understand people afflicted with cardiovascular diseases. Others have stepped forward to learn how to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and use the automated external defibrillator (AED).
The Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) said that it has observed an increasing trend of beneficiaries in recovery volunteering with the organisation. Volunteers help with peer-led sharing sessions, sports and arts activities. 
Some have also opened up about their journey with a mental health condition at SAMH’s outreach events, which help to reduce misconceptions about mental illness as “the public can see that this person is as normal as others”.
MAKING IT LESS LONELY FOR THOSE WITH MENTAL HEALTH
One of SAMH’s volunteers who has made efforts to pay it forward is 37-year-old Dave Tan, who was showing signs of bipolar and mood disorders in his late-teens, after he was arrested for the second time for his public outbursts of anger and sent to hospital. 
But following his last relapse about seven or eight years ago, Mr Tan has been in steady recovery and hasn’t been warded since. He currently works as a hotel steward, volunteers with Taoist temple Zhen Fu Tang, and took on an additional temporary job as group homes assistant with SAMH from March to June 2018.







                                    

Dave Tan was diagnosed with bipolar mood disorder when he was in his late-teens but is now organising activities for people like him. (Photo: Singapore Association for Mental Health).



For almost two years now, Mr Tan has also been supporting SAMH by donating some of the temple’s funds to the charity, and organising block parties for the homes’ clients at the temple in Bukit Batok. The neighbourhood’s residents, SAMH staff and temple visitors also got to join in the fun.
These activities are his way of helping the homes’ clients feel less lonely during the holidays, he said, and serve as a platform for Singaporeans to interact with people with mental health conditions as his way of fighting the stigma of mental illness.
In his earlier years, having a mental health problem was much more taboo than today, Mr Tan said. And his frequent arrests and subsequent stays in hospital led to him being estranged from his family until his late-20s, he said. 
It was the kindness of fellow patients-turned-friends that helped him to endure his time in the ward. They would offer him treats given to them by their visitors. These modest deeds  - a cup of coffee, a packet of snacks, sometimes a word of advice - were indubitably cherished.
""These small gestures from other people in recovery gave me the urge to give back to the community,"" the normally jovial Mr Tan said, and it helps too, he added, ""I like to spread to spread joy to people.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/60-000-subsidised-outpatients-seek-treatment-mental-disorders-12240990,"60,000 subsidised outpatients seek treatment for mental disorders each year: Gan Kim Yong - CNA",07/01/2020,"SINGAPORE: Public healthcare providers treated an average of about 60,000 subsidised outpatients for mental disorders each year over the last three years, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said on Monday (Jan 6).
In a written answer to a Parliament question from Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Walter Theseira, Mr Gan also said that an average of 6,900 subsidised patients were hospitalised for mental health conditions each year between 2016 and 2018.
Their average length of stay was 21 days per admission.
The five most common mental health conditions seen at public hospitals were schizophrenia, depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder and substance abuse. 
At the polyclinics, depression, anxiety and insomnia were the most common mental health conditions.
Schizophrenia and depression were also common conditions seen by community intervention teams funded under the Ministry of Health, he said. 
Associate Professor Theseira had asked Mr Gan for the demographics of patients receiving psychiatric treatment and mental health support at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), polyclinics, specialist outpatient clinics at restructured hospitals and under government-funded programmes in the last three years.
He had also asked for a break down on the number of patients, duration of inpatient stay or treatment length, types of mental health condition, age, income and time taken between the onset of symptoms and treatment.
For the whole public healthcare system, the average age of subsidised patients for the different mental health conditions seen was between 40 to 50 years old, Mr Gan said. 
MOH does not track data on income or the time between onset of symptoms and treatment.
However, he referred to the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, a self-reported survey, in which respondents cited 11 years as the median time between when they first experienced symptoms and when they sought help for obsessive compulsive disorder. 
The median time was four years for bipolar disorder and alcohol abuse, two years for generalised anxiety disorder and one year for major depressive disorder. 
“Stigma and lack of mental health literacy may be contributory factors to the delay,” said Mr Gan.
“We have community outreach teams to educate the public on mental health conditions and dementia, and refer those with such conditions to the appropriate health and/ or social services,” Mr Gan said.
MEDIAN OF 27 DAYS TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST
In a separate response to NMP Anthea Ong on waiting times for outpatient appointments at IMH, specialist outpatient clinics, polyclinics and government-funded programmes, Mr Gan said that a new subsidised patient would have waited an average median time of 27 days to see a psychiatrist and 28 days to see a psychologist across the public hospitals in 2018. 
Ms Ong had also asked for data on the professional-to-patient ratio and measures taken to reduce waiting times.
On this, Mr Gan said that there are around 248 psychiatrists and 473 psychologists practising in Singapore. This translates into 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.36 psychologists per 100,000 population.
Mr Gan also said that within the public health sector, the number of psychiatrists and psychologists has increased by 8 per cent to 182 and 7 per cent to 171, respectively, over the last three years. 
“MOH does not have specific numbers on counsellors practising in Singapore as many healthcare professionals and social workers provide counselling as part of their work,” he said. 
Mr Gan said that anyone requiring urgent mental health assistance or who wishes to see a psychiatrist, may contact the IMH's 24-hour mental health helpline or visit its 24-hour emergency services. 
For cases requiring community support, patients can be referred to community outreach teams and community intervention teams. These cases are usually contacted within two weeks, he said. 
To reduce waiting time, hospitals have implemented measures such as reviewing work processes to optimise appointment slots and efficiency of clinical operations and tiering services to the appropriate level of care, he said. 
As of March 2019, the Government has 41 community outreach teams and 21 allied health-led community intervention teams providing mental health support, said. 
“MOH will continue to work with public hospitals and service providers in the community, including schools, social service agencies and family service centres, to ensure that we provide holistic and timely support for persons with mental healthcare Needs,” Mr Gan said.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/decriminalise-suicide-singapore-penal-code-reform-crime-prevent-12230298,Commentary: Decriminalising attempted suicide in Singapore does not mean less help for vulnerable people - CNA,04/01/2020,"SINGAPORE: If a loved one told you they wanted to take their own life, would your immediate reaction be to stop them from committing a crime?
That is unlikely to be the case for many of us but for the family of one 72-year-old woman who tried to kill herself in September last year, it must seem like an odd frame of reality they had to wrestle with.
Arrested by police officers for a case of attempted suicide, she was subsequently released with a formal warning.
Hers is not a story that you read about often - but it happened to hundreds here every year.
In 2015, 1,096 cases of attempted suicide were reported to the Singapore Police Force, out of which 837 people were arrested.
The stigma around suicide is etched in archaic societal thinking.
Even the phrase that someone had “committed” suicide is now frowned upon by charities working with survivors.
According to the Penal Code Reform Committee (PCRC), attempted suicide was made a crime in Singapore because it was thought that society should oppose people from taking their own lives.
A ONE-SIZE FITS ALL SOLUTION
For decades, the Penal Code was the medium to try to help people who attempted to kill themselves.
First responders to such incidents include police officers who carry out roles as enforcers of the law.
Survivors who spoke to charities AWARE and Silver Ribbon have shared tales of being handcuffed and put in holding cells.

It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Some were led away in front of their loved ones, or handcuffed to their hospital beds - in view of other patients or medical staff.
And after they were released, they had to go through investigations and other aspects of due process a crime would warrant.
Sometimes, that meant giving police statements, speaking to police officers, and experiencing everything that criminal suspects go through.
The penalties for attempted suicide were severe - a maximum of a year in jail and a fine of S$10,000 or both. But only in a handful of cases (0.6 per cent on average every year) did arrests lead to prosecution. In most cases, they were given formal warnings.
For someone to reach a stage where they think about ending it all, experts have pointed out that being treated as a criminal might only make things worse.
In this context, brandishing incredibly low prosecution numbers to try to reassure them could do little for someone who has thought about taking their own life.
If a person is handcuffed, then put in a holding cell, would telling them that “prosecution is rare” have helped?
Decriminalising attempted suicide now allows survivors to focus on healing and recovery, with help from healthcare and social assistance systems, rather than worry about punitive actions.

As the World Health Organization (WHO) puts it: “Suicide is a complex issue and therefore suicide prevention efforts require coordination and collaboration among multiple sectors of society, including the health sector and other sectors such as education, labour, agriculture, business, justice, law, defense, politics, and the media.
“These efforts must be comprehensive and integrated as no single approach alone can make an impact on an issue as complex as suicide.”
CAN POLICE OFFICERS STILL HELP PEOPLE?
The decriminalisation of suicide does not mean emergency services now have no recourse to stop suicide attempts.
The Penal Code Reform Committee, in its report that helped form the Criminal Law Reform Bill, recommended powers for police officers under the Police Force Act to stop suicide attempts.
In fact, NGOs AWARE and Silver Ribbon also want police officers to be trained to respond to a case of attempted suicide.
Survivors will not have to undergo the criminal investigation process but may still be referred to health and other support networks, rather than go through the criminal investigation process.
Treatment can also be made mandatory. The committee also recommended new legislation under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act to allow courts to make that call, with advice from experts from various sectors – mental health, physical health, social support – before making its judgment.
This move takes that decision away from police officers, who can focus on law enforcement, rather than be bogged down with deciding what should be next for people who tried to take their own lives.

There are, rightly, concerns about mandatory treatment, but it should always be carefully considered.
Senior Parliamentary Secretary for the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Health Amrin Amin told Parliament: “We will have to enforce the need to go for counselling and are likely to do so on the pain of punishment.""
“Again, we are trying to move away in this area - from criminalisation to help. So we should tread carefully in this respect.”
NUMBERS, NUMBERS?
Will discriminalisation lead to lower suicide rates? The jury is out on that.
According to a WHO study of 192 countries and states, suicide rates “tend to decline in countries after decriminalisation”. The organisation adds that no data or case reports indicate that decriminalisation increases suicides.

However, there are studies that show the decriminalisation of suicide has led to an increase in the number of suicides.
Irrespective of whether discriminalisation impacts suicide rates, it is more productive to focus on the causes behind each case and aid each survivor.
Every suicide is a tragedy. Every suicide attempt is a cry for help.
In 2018, nearly 400 people in Singapore killed themselves. Nearly every age group saw an increase in the number of suicides.
Society needs to provide help, not the threat of punishment, to survivors.
Decriminalising attempted suicide also means we are forced to look for a more holistic approach - one that might involve mental health support, physical support, or social help – instead of thinking that deterrence can be effective prevention.

MYTH: SUICIDE IS CAUSED BY DEPRESSION
Suicide is not a mental health disorder, but people diagnosed with a mental health condition are shown to be at higher risk of attempting suicide.
To say that depression is the cause of all suicides is a generalisation that is repeated far too often. Suicide is often due to a combination, sequence or repetition of distressing life events.
Depression is also one of the many stressors a person can struggle with. It is important to keep in mind that a majority of people who have depression do not die by suicide.
NO, SUICIDE DOES NOT HAVE A LOOK
It can happen to anyone, not just someone looking moody or sad. Once someone has made plans to end their life, they may appear uncharacteristically happy or outgoing even.
It is useful to take note of unusual emotional and behavioural changes in those around us. If your instinct tells you something is amiss, you may be right. Reach out to them.

MYTH: SUICIDE IS A RARE OCCURRENCE AND NOT A CONCERN IN SINGAPORE
In 2018, 397 lives were lost to suicide. 
Due to the difficulties in classifying a death as suicide, published statistics are almost always an underestimate of the actual number of people who took their own lives. 
There are also others who attempt suicide and this figure is even harder to accurately capture.
MYTH: SUICIDES HAPPEN ON IMPULSE ALONE
Impulse plays some role in suicide – especially in young people, who may not yet be adept at processing and controlling their emotions. 
At the same time, many who experience suicidal thoughts say they go through the stages such as ideation, gestures, plans and attempts. 
While the act may seem sudden to by-standers, the decision to take one’s life is often developed over time and through deliberation. For a decision that puts that much on the line, suicide is not an outcome the average person rushes in to.
LISTEN TO CRIES FOR HELP
All talks of suicide and suicide attempts should be treated as though the person has the intent to die. 
Though phrases like “my life is meaningless” or “living is so painful” may seem trivial and are often dismissed, these may actually be a sign of distress or be a cry for help. 
A prior suicide attempt should serve as a risk factor. 
It is also a cry for help from someone in profound distress that should not be ignored or treated as a form of attention-seeking. Someone who is at risk of suicide may also display warnings signs which we often overlook.

MYTH: SUICIDAL PEOPLE WANT TO DIE
Individuals thinking about suicide are often ambivalent and fluctuate between wanting to live and wanting to die. 
For a person to contemplate suicide means they are in a situation of helplessness and despair. 
They want to get out of their situation but no longer know how to. Death seems like the only way out of their pain and suffering. Reach out.
There are warning signs of suicide.
Those contemplating suicide would often have communicated their intention. 
These signs may not always be direct or explicit as individuals fear being judged by those around them. 
The fact that we may not spot these warning signs does not mean they do not exist. It is crucial to know some of the common warning signs and risk factors.
Talk
Actions
Mood
Common suicide risk factors
MYTH: TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE ENCOURAGES SUICIDE
Asking someone if they are thinking about suicide does not put the idea in their head; neither does it push them further towards suicide. 
Given the widespread stigma about suicide, having a loved one initiate a conversation about suicide may signal to those in crisis that this is a safe space for them to talk openly about their suicidal ideations. 
For those contemplating suicide, it may be a relief that someone is allowing them to verbalise a struggle they are facing. 
Asking about suicide shows that you care and it gives them the opportunity to reach out to a trusted individual for help and support.

SUICIDE AFFECTS EVERYONE
A common assumption is that those with greater material wealth will have fewer reasons to take their own lives. 
However, with the media coverage of celebrity suicides over the last few years, we know that the factors leading a person to contemplate suicide goes beyond an individual’s socioeconomic status. 
Globally, suicide is a public health concern which cuts across social economic statuses.
MYTH: SUICIDE IS HEREDITARY
Suicide is a behaviour, not a condition.
While multiple suicides can be observed in some families, it is not hereditary. Instead, those in the same family experience similar emotional and social environments. 
Negative coping methods, such as self-harm, may also be imitated and adopted by some family members as a way to cope with emotional pain. 
Social learning is sometimes cited for multiple instances of suicide in the same family.

For 30-year-old Wendy, a volunteer with the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), people expressing suicidal thoughts are common. For three to four hours a week, and at least one overnight session a month, Wendy is picking up distress calls on the SOS hotline - sometimes from people who are thinking about killing themselves.
“I can only imagine the pain that they are facing and how overwhelmed they are to be contemplating suicide,” Wendy explained.
“When I first started volunteering, it worried me to hear that.”
Last year, 397 people in Singapore took their own lives, with suicides among boys aged between 10 and 29 at a record high.
In fact, all age groups - except those 60 and above - recorded an increase in the number of suicides. It is a worrying statistic. For every suicide, at least six suicide survivors are left behind, said SOS.
""It is disconcerting to know that many of our young feel unsupported through their darkest periods and see suicide as the only choice to end their pain and struggles,"" said SOS senior assistant director Wong Lai Chun.

At the SOS' Cantonment Close office, volunteers like Wendy are armed with a listening ear - but it is not an easy role. Every call requires their focused, undivided attention for however long the person wants to talk.
“Over the phone, we listen carefully to what the callers have to share,” Wendy said. 
“When callers say things that hint at being a burden to others, or express having no reasons to live, or experience unbearable emotional pain in life - like ‘people are better off without me’ or ‘I am a burden to my family’ - these are possible indicators that the caller may be thinking of suicide.”

Knowing what to say and how to say it are essential skills.
“We empathise with the caller and acknowledge the struggles that they may be going through,” Wendy explained.
“Callers cite feeling alone and not being able to talk with their friends and family for fear of being judged or seen as weak.
“We give them the time and space - and invite them to share more about what might be troubling them to make them feel this way.
“At the same time, we also check in on the safety of the caller. Together, we explore some alternatives that might improve their current situation.”
It is with repeated conviction that Wendy mentions the next point - it is clearly something she is passionate about.
“Most importantly, it is our role as an SOS volunteer to listen to the caller with an open mind and just being present with them.”
MINUTES TO CREATE A SAFE SPACE
The number of calls varies with the time of the day, Wendy said. According to SOS, people are most likely to reach out to the Samaritans between 10pm and 2am.
Sometimes, festivals that are most associated with warmth - such as Christmas or New Year - can be the most difficult times.
“Typically, we see an increase in the number of incoming calls at night or on special occasions like public holidays or periods leading up to exams,” Wendy said.
“The callers come from all walks of life - ranging from young to old - working in all types of industry. Sometimes, we even have callers of different nationalities.”

It is a safe space that is most difficult to create. For some of the callers, they struggle to voice their innermost thoughts or struggles - sometimes even to their loved ones.
Creating that non-judgmental, quiet and empathetic space within a few minutes of being on the line could save a life.
“When I am able to connect with them about their circumstances and pain, it allows me to better empathise with them and through their despair, I hope that they realise that there is somebody out there that is willing to listen and care about them.”
If callers are deemed to be at a high risk of suicide, SOS professional staff will follow up and invite them to the office for face-to-face counselling, but only if the caller consents.
Empathy, emotional maturity and being able to provide a listening ear without judgment are just some of the common factors among Samaritans staff. 
For Wendy, it is a cause close to her heart after the death of a friend.
“For a period of time, I was struggling to find meaning in my life. I was overwhelmed at work and burnt out. 
“In the midst of everything, I lost a friend who passed away from liver failure. I was too occupied with my work - I could not be there for my friend during her final days, and her passing left me with guilt and regrets.”

WHAT IF I KNOW SOMEONE SUICIDAL? 
In 2018, 94 young people chose to end their own lives. Among boys aged between 10 and 19 years old, there were 19 suicides last year - the highest since records began in 1991 and almost triple the seven cases recorded in 2017.
Young people today have a greater awareness of the moments when they feel alone and helpless, Ms Wong explained. 
They are more likely to reach out and explore the support services available - and sometimes it’s not all about professional help. A lot of them show warning signs or talk to someone about their suicidal thoughts before taking their own lives.
When someone tells you they want to die, it is shocking and disturbing. People react in different ways, said Wendy. 
“It is common for people to comfort a friend by tapping on past personal experiences and giving advice. While there may be good intentions in doing so, it may downplay the severity of the problem and unintentionally disregard their experience and feelings, creating a form of disconnect between your friend and you,” Wendy explained.

Listen and invite them to talk - and do so without judgment. Sometimes, what they need is to know that someone will be there to journey with them through a tough period, she said.
“We have to be mindful and wary of imposing our own values on them. Rather than advising on what they should or should not do, let them know that we can together explore what other options there may be.”
SOS volunteers sometimes get calls from people who are unsure how they can help their friends or loved ones who have suicidal thoughts.
It is important to continuously check in on people who are in crisis and to talk to them in a caring and non-judgmental manner, Wendy said.
Items which might be used to harm themselves should be removed or moved out of reach, and people should ring 995 if their loved one is in immediate danger due to a suicide crisis situation.
“We will also check on the wellbeing of the (third-party) callers themselves as such situations may be overwhelming and stressful. They may face struggles as they may see themselves being responsible for the loved ones’ well-being.”
SAMARITAN - A WILLING STRANGER
Creating a safe space to talk and listen is important to SOS volunteers - that way, the people who need help can be sure everything they tell them remains confidential. That’s why Wendy, who works in an office job in the day, chose to remain anonymous.
“Whenever I feel burnt out or uncomfortable after a call, I cope by speaking to other SOS volunteers. The SOS professional staff are also readily available should I wish to talk to them as well.”

Practising mindfulness and getting enough rest are key parts of Wendy’s arsenal. 
“Too often we forget that we all have one very important skill - and that is to listen, which many of us take for granted. In a fast-paced society like Singapore, we often forget to slow down our steps, to stop and smell the flowers, or even listen to people around us.”
For most of the volunteers, they will never know what comes next after the calls, but they will have given someone the strength to carry on.
“If by some chance of fate, I get to speak to the same caller again - assuming they continue to call in and if I happen to remember their voices or their stories - I can at least know how they are doing currently,” Wendy said.
“It comforts me whenever callers thank me for listening to them. For most of them, they find comfort knowing that a stranger is willing to spend a part of their lives, supporting someone they may never know.”

Just six years later, that number had risen to one in seven.
These statistics have concerned many Singaporeans and forced us to reflect on the reasons behind the reported increase.
Concerns are likely highest among youths. Youth, after all, is the “peak period” where the majority of mental disorders emerge, according to Dr Swapna Verma from the Institute of Mental Health.
Mental health was also a top concern reflected in the 2018 Youth Conversation online poll, carried out by the National Youth Council.
In recent years, youth discourse on mental health has increased significantly, coupled with a greater awareness of World Mental Health Day, observed annually on Oct 10.
According to the World Health Organization, World Mental Health Day is observed with the main objective of raising awareness of mental health issues around the world and shoring up efforts in support of mental health.
However, it is also a timely opportunity for youths like myself to reflect on our own mental health in the broader context of the challenges we face – in a world of disruption.
MENTAL HEALTH IN AN AGE OF DISRUPTION
The relationship between mental health and the notion of a disrupted future is not often explicitly discussed in-depth, but it should be.







                                    

Stress can make you smell. (Photo: Unsplash)



As famed historian Yuval Noah Harari questioned in his bestseller 21 Lessons for the 21st Century: 
Change is always stressful, and the hectic world of the early 21st century has produced a global epidemic of stress. As the volatility of the job market and of individual careers increase, would people be able to cope?
In the context of Singapore’s youth, some recent statistics may clue us in to this relationship.
Youths in Singapore are among the most pessimistic in Southeast Asia about the impact of technology on their employment prospects and earning potential according to a 2018 World Economic Forum, though this can be partially explained by higher education levels and age.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Separately, according to the latest available National Youth Survey (2016), “future uncertainty” ranked as the biggest source of stress among the youth surveyed; they were also not entirely confident about their own ability to respond to challenges.
These nascent statistics suggest that youths may not be coping as well as they should with the pressures of a disrupted future.
MENTAL HEALTH - NECESSITY OR LUXURY?
So what precise mental pressures does disruption bring?
Consider what psychologist Sara-Ann Lee wrote in a CNA commentary earlier this year:  “Employees are encouraged to hustle and work relentlessly to strive for ‘more’, but this is a tantalising fiction; once reached, one inevitably finds that there is ‘even more’ to work towards.”

The pervasiveness of this sense of “never enough” is keenly felt by youths who have yet to enter the workforce.
If the future is so uncertain, you can never know if you’ve done enough to secure that disrupted future.
Indeed, “never enough” is something I see playing out among my peers, as they seek to juggle multiple commitments while keeping their grades up, sacrificing sleep and rest to secure a disrupted future.
While my generation is rightly concerned about mental health as an issue in and of itself, I would argue that there is still an ironic tendency for us to see our own individual mental health as a “good to have”, rather than a “must have”.
As we strive for success, we may still feel that self-care and rest is something which can be put off for some future time, without fully realising the detriment to our mental health.  
And unfortunately, such a myopic view of mental health cannot be sustainable.
MENTAL HEALTH FIRST
Indeed, such a view cannot be sustainable because this is only the beginning of our lifelong dance with disruption, something we may not have fully grasped.
Rather than neglect our mental health so we can come first in a race that never ends, it would be wiser to put our mental health first so we can keep running this marathon.

In this regard, I have three suggestions on how we can all chart a more mentally sustainable path and prioritise our mental wellbeing in an age of disruption.
First, if we have too much on our plate, the most logical response must to be to remove some of what’s on the plate, doing so in a gradual, responsible manner.
But, some may ask, with less to show for ourselves, will this affect future employability? Not quite.
In the future economy, employers look out for the ability to create, not just add, value.
But value-creation needs time and effort to hone specific skills and engage in deep learning for deep mastery. Focusing on a few manageable commitments in greater depth will paradoxically give us the time and space needed to do just that, possibly making us more employable.
Second, we need to shift from the mindset of “never enough” to a mindset of “good enough for now”.
Writing in the New York Times earlier this year, author Avram Alpert talks about the “good-enough life”, and how the desire for greatness can be an obstacle to our own potential.
But if “good enough” seems too much like “settling for less”, consider “good enough for now”.

This mindset suggests it is perfectly okay if we can’t do as much as others at the moment. In an age of disruption, teeming with disruptive openings, the future truly holds more opportunities for us to try again.
Third, individual efforts can only go so far without community support. It is in all our interests to actively participate in de-stigmatising mental disorders and talking about mental health, starting with friends and family.
Of course, there’s a lot more to the issue of mental health, and individual efforts to improve it must be complemented by feasible societal changes, such as re-looking at institutional arrangements which give rise to excessive competition.
But that’s another commentary for another day. For now, it would be sufficient to remember to put our mental health first to give ourselves the best chances to face a disrupted future.
Envisioning the decades ahead, I believe my generation can still make the best of disruption, and chart our own futures. But that’s only if we can put our mental health first.

When Rachel (not her real name), 26, suffered from psychosis, she was told to ""think about children dying in Africa"".
After a suicide attempt, Ms Nawira Baig was told that she did not know how to appreciate life. The 27-year-old has been living with bipolar disorder for the past 10 years, which causes her to experience bouts of depression.
The words uttered might seem innocuous enough to those around them and may be well-intended, but for people with mental health conditions like Clement, Rachel and Ms Baig, hearing them from their family and close friends made them feel worse.
“For people who want to end their life, it’s because it’s very painful. We don’t know how to deal with this and we cannot bear this any longer. It doesn’t help when people don’t understand and there is no support,” said Ms Baig, 27, who is working in the mental health sector.
While hurt, Clement, Rachel and Ms Baig did not blame the people who made those remarks, attributing them to a lack of awareness and understanding. 
But as the global community observed World Mental Health Day on Thursday (Oct 10), those interviewed by TODAY — including mental health professionals and advocates, bereaved parents and youths who have mental illness — believed that there is much scope for Singaporean youths to be taught emotional and mental literacy, in order to bring about greater mental wellness in society.
Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP) Anthea Ong, for example, has been advocating for mental health education to be made mandatory in schools. A more preventive approach to the issue is needed, she said. 
A study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) in December last year found that young adults are most at risk of suffering from mental disorders in Singapore. Those aged between 18 and 34 are more likely to have experienced bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, alcohol abuse, and obsessive compulsive disorder.
For years, mental health awareness campaigns have focused on the social stigma surrounding mental illness, and efforts to change people’s perceptions have borne fruit. According to the experts and observers interviewed, Singaporeans’ attitudes towards mental illness and their knowledge of it have vastly improved compared with a decade ago.
However, mental health professionals say that preventive work needs to be done alongside destigmatisation efforts, and that includes learning the appropriate language to use when speaking to a family or a friend who has a mental health condition, and what actions to take when they are in severe distress.

According to a Forbes article published earlier this week, more and more schools in the United States are adding social-emotional learning to their curriculum. The United Kingdom has also unveiled plans to make wellbeing education universal in schools by 2020.
Several young Singaporeans told TODAY that they simply do not know what to do when they find themselves or their friend emotionally distressed. 
When a friend confided in 20-year-old Dai Zhuxuan that he had depression, the university student said she was not sure what she could say to make him feel better.
“I was scared I might say something wrong… I tried to tell him that it was not as bad as he thought, like everything would be okay. But I don’t think it really helped,” she said.
Part of that preventive approach also includes building up emotional resilience among the young, which teaches them how to manage their emotions, what are the signs and symptoms when they are emotionally distressed, and how to seek help.
“Whenever there is a report on suicide statistics, then everyone starts talking about it… ‘We need a focus group on this or that, start funding for this or that’. But these things have been happening all the time,” said Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of Silver Ribbon, a non-profit organisation focusing on mental health issues.
“Why don’t we focus on the wellness and not the illness? Learn to take care of yourself and manage stress well. Rather than wait until you’re being diagnosed, and then we go ‘okay we have such a programme for you’,” she added.
WHAT THE NUMBERS SHOW
According to IMH, those aged between 19 and 35 make up about 45 per cent of new patients diagnosed with a mental illness each year. The figure, however, does not include those younger than 19 years old, as they would be seen at the child guidance clinic.  The number of 19 to 35-year-olds diagnosed with a mental illness has averaged at about 2,500 annually over the past three years.  IMH’s statistics are not representative of the whole country, as patients may seek help at other hospitals, with psychiatrists at private clinics or with community agencies.  Still, previous news reports have shown that more young people are seeking help for mental health issues. The number of young Singaporeans between the ages of 16 and 30 who sought help from IMH’s Community Health Assessment Team (Chat) from 2015 to 2017 had jumped by 190 per cent.  Meanwhile, over the past five years, the number of 10- to 29-year-olds who died every year due to suicide was between 73 and 106 — making up around 22 per cent of the total number of deaths by suicide in the same period, based on data from the report on registration of births and deaths by the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA).  Suicide still remains the leading cause of death for youths aged between 10 and 29, said Ms Wong Lai Chun, the senior assistant director of Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), the only suicide prevention agency here that offers a 24-hour hotline.  The prevalence of suicide mortality among youths and males is a “significant societal concern”, she said.  Of particular concern is the fact that male teenage suicide in 2018 was at its highest since 1991, a 170 per cent increase from seven deaths in 2017, according to the latest SOS report released in July.  While mental health conditions are risk factors for suicide, not everyone with suicidal ideations have mental health conditions, said Ms Lee Yiping, a youth support worker at Chat, a programme which allows 16 to 30-year-olds to get a free and confidential mental health check.  A person suffering from a mental illness may feel suicidal after a prolonged period of feeling worthless and helpless. But there are some who choose to end their lives after experiencing unforeseen circumstances, such as losing one’s job suddenly, said Ms Lee.
OLD AND NEW STRESSORS
The stressors among youth mainly revolve around family or intimate partner relationships, friendships, concerns about academic or work performance, financial worries and stress resulting from life transitions, said mental health professionals, and these have remained pretty much the same over the years.
When Luke (not his real name) was 17, the pressure of wanting to meet his parents’ expectations led him to switch to a junior college, even though he was very much well-adjusted and enjoying his time at his polytechnic.
Now 32, Luke told TODAY that he was under such stress during the transition period between schools that he started developing hallucinations and almost jumped from his apartment building.

For Clement, not being able to get into his dream school after his O-level examinations was the trigger for his depression, which he was officially diagnosed with when he was 17.
“I believed deeply that I would only be worthy as a person if I had an accomplishment of note and therefore, this 'failure' not only shattered all the confidence I had in my abilities, it left me in a place wondering ‘If I cannot achieve, then what worth do I have?’” he said.
According to Ms Wong, youths may not have yet developed adequate positive coping mechanisms, and may not be aware of the available resources that can help them.
“The combination of different stressors may lead youths to feel overwhelmed and not able to cope positively. Maladaptive coping mechanisms, such as self-harm and suicide ideation, then become a possible alternative for youths as a means of coping with overwhelming psychological and emotional pain,” she added.
Biologically, the part of the brain that deals with emotions is not as developed among the young, and hence they tend to experience more mood swings compared to adults, said Ms Lee.
Due to a lack of life experience, young people may not be able to pick themselves up after facing a failure, believing that it is a reflection that they are not good enough.
Apart from the common stressors faced by youths, Ms Lee also pointed out that previously taboo topics — such as struggles over one’s sexual orientation — are beginning to surface.
“When we do assessment and young people say they have depression, when we try to find out why, young people in the past may not say it’s because of their sexual orientation. But now increasingly they will say they are queer, or they are homosexual, but they don’t want to speak to their family,” she said. 
For 23-year-old Peter (not his real name), a gay individual raised in a Catholic environment, the inability to reconcile his sexual orientation with his religious beliefs was a major factor that added to the mental distress with which he has had to struggle since primary school.
While he experienced other traumatic incidents as well, such as growing up in an abusive family, tensions surrounding his sexuality was his most difficult struggle.
“You cannot be yourself. (It’s) the pain that comes along with this identity,” said the undergraduate. 
THE SOCIAL MEDIA FACTOR
Another form of stressor that has emerged recently, said several mental health professionals, is cyberbullying — the result of increased use of technology and social media, especially among the young.
“The way they express and call for help have changed as well. In the past, you can spot someone with cutting marks on their arms. Now through social media, they may post such photos also,” said Ms Lee.
Mental health professionals generally see social media as a double-edged sword.
With several mental health organisations and also government agencies posting their mental health awareness campaigns and resources online, social media can be an avenue for youths to receive positive messages, or find out how and where they can seek help.
However, the type of content that youths are exposed to on social media is also largely a result of what is trending. The issue then is whether youths are able to navigate through the social media maze and limit exposure to content that may add to their distress, said Ms Wong Ying Li, the head of youth division at Fei Yue Family Service Centre.
Similarly, the debate over whether people should share their mental health struggles on social media drew mixed reactions from the experts interviewed.
Such posts could be their own way of calling for help and mental health professionals agree that even a simple checking in from friends on how they are doing would help. But there is a danger that youths are also opening up themselves to online bullying.
“No matter what you post, you should be keeping an open mind to get both negative and positive comments. You can’t expect everyone to agree with what you share,” said Ms Poh from Silver Ribbon. 
Most youths TODAY spoke to are wary about sharing something as personal as a mental health struggle on social media, well aware of the vitriol that exists in the online space.
Those who post about their mental health struggles may end up being accused of trying to attract attention or playing the victim card, said Ms Erica Tay, a 22-year-old university student.
However, some of them have seen a few of their friends posting cryptic messages that may imply that they are going through some form of mental distress.
Simple messages like “I feel tired” or “I wanna quit school” are things that Ms Tay has seen on her Instagram feed.
Though not clinically diagnosed, Joseph (not his real name), 26, who has been experiencing some symptoms of mental health conditions such as restlessness and severe fatigue for more than five years, uses Instagram as an “emotional outlet” and posts song lyrics that reflect his thoughts on mental health and suicide
“Taxi driver, be my shrink for the hour, leave the meter running” — the first three verses of the song Bad Religion by singer Frank Ocean — is one example.
Jaren Ong, 18, who is currently serving National Service and went through a bout of depression during his junior college days, writes about his experience with depression and anxiety on Instagram. But he does it through an account where he is friends with only 15 people, all of whom are his close associates.
As a mother who lost her son to suicide due to depression, Ms Elaine Lek, 55, is exasperated about the role of social media among youth.
Before her son, Zen Dylan Koh, passed away in October 2018 when he was almost 18 years old, Ms Lek said he posted about his suicidal ideation and photos of the cuts on his hand on Instagram.
“People that follow him, what did they do? They like it. How can they like it? And there was a comment: ‘Oh wait for me, let’s do it together,’” said Ms Lek, who is heading the global brand team at tableware firm Luzerne. 
PROVIDING THE RIGHT SUPPORT 
Mental health professionals generally agree that the stigma attached to people with mental illness has lessened, evidenced by the growing number of recovery stories shared by people with mental illness, greater interest among students in the issues of mental health, and increasing number of young people seeking help.
According to an online poll last year by the National Youth Council, mental health was among the top 10 concerns among youth. It also found that they generally had positive attitudes towards people with mental health issues.
The problem, however, is that youths do not feel equipped to support their friends who are living with a mental health condition.

Through TODAY's interviews with several young people who are still living with or have had a mental illness, there were numerous examples of how they felt dismissed and their pain trivialised due to remarks made by people around them.
When Rachel first started hallucinating four years ago — a symptom of psychosis — the then-university student was feeling very upset and confided in a close friend.
His reaction? “Can you don’t feel like this? You know how many people in Africa are dying?”
“That’s when I realise you can’t tell someone in depression to get up and go,” said Rachel, who is a civil servant.
Another way people usually respond is by making comparisons, said SOS’ Ms Wong.
“Comparisons to the self, or others who may have had it worse may act to invalidate one’s struggles to cope. These comparisons often do not serve as encouragements, but instead reinforces the perception that “you just don’t understand me,’” she added.
For Peter, the hurt also comes when people are being too politically correct around him after learning about his history of mental illness.
“It’s like ‘that guy has mental health issues, must be careful towards him’. It reduces me to the lowest common denominator, it’s like my entire life is whether or not I will kill myself,” he added.
Ms Lee pointed out that people with mental illness should not be made to feel that their identity is defined solely by their mental health.
“If I were to tell someone I have been diagnosed with depression, their immediate reaction is ‘how are you feeling today?’ They immediately think that you must be feeling sad and that you are affected by it,” she added.
So, what do people with mental health conditions like to see more from the people around them?
Just being there, some told TODAY.
For Peter, a simple message asking him to go for coffee is more than enough.
“The ones who are genuine will relate to you. Not those who make proclamations about how strong I am, saying stuff like ‘wah you went through this, you strong man’, when they are just putting my suffering on a pedestal, thereby eliminating any personal obligation to relate further,"" he said.
During the times when Ms Baig was hospitalised, she remembers her friends giving her chocolate cake or painting her nails in the hospital, among other things.
“To them, I am still who I am. That never changes. I really value that they did not treat me differently, they didn’t tread cautiously or treat me as fragile,” she said.
It is the little things that matter, said Cheryl (not her real name), 21, who has been experiencing anxiety since she was 13.
“Trying to regulate my breathing with me while I’m having an anxiety attack, accompanying me to a counselling appointment, or simply sitting with me while I cry to get all the overwhelming emotions out. These things give me strength when I can’t carry on,” she added.
It is human nature to offer quick solutions, said the experts. But what is more important is to just listen and validate the feelings of those with mental health conditions, they added. This is especially so for those who are living with chronic mental health issues which could possibly last for a lifetime. 
“For them it is not about 'I get cured', but 'I learn to cope with it',” said Fei Yue’s Ms Wong.
While these may seem common sense, the experts said these are skill sets that need to be taught.
“When you see an old lady crossing the road, you know what to do. These things we take for granted, but we actually learned it… You will never have a 9-year-old boy who have a toothache and not know what to do about it. But you would have a 9-year-old boy who is feeling distressed and despair, and not know what to do and therefore think jumping is an option,” said Ms Ong, the NMP.
Such skill sets are missing even among adults. Sometimes, parents themselves can unwittingly hurt their children with mental health conditions.  
After seeing his son in a prolonged state of sadness for three months, Clement’s father told him to “get better or get out of the house” in a fit of anger and despair.
While Clement recognises that it was tough for his father as well, that incident was “deeply traumatic” for him, causing him to have trust issues till this day.
Majority of the youths TODAY spoke to shared that they would not choose to share with their parents any struggles they may be going through, or talk about mental health with them.
For some, it is their own parents who were the source of their distress and for others, mental health is an issue that Asian families do not seem to be comfortable talking about.
BUILDING EMOTIONAL RESILIENCE
Mental health advocates believe that there is also a need to teach young people, especially those who are still in school, how to build emotional resilience.
Ms Lee said that one way to teach young people to be resilient is to let them encounter failures and mistakes, but provide a nurturing environment for them to bounce back from the setbacks.
“The support structure, (from parents and friends) is important. Young people need a lot of guidance. Not necessarily teaching them what to do, but to help them process their thoughts,” she added.
Besides learning from failures, young people can also build emotional resilience by learning how to regulate their emotions, and by equipping themselves with the tools they can use to soothe themselves when they sense an anxiety episode coming, said mental health professionals.
Finding healthier coping mechanisms to manage their stress levels is also one way to build resilience.
For some of the young people with mental health conditions interviewed by TODAY, acquiring healthier coping mechanisms is very much a trial-and-error process.
Ms Baig, who was initially not aware of how to process the internal pain from her bipolar disorder, resorted to cutting herself and trying to end her own life.
Through her recovery process, she realised that journaling and dancing helped her release some of her internal tensions.
For Rachel, reading up on mental illness and developing a routine set of activities for the weekend that were focused on herself, such as going to the gym or facial, helped her to overcome the difficult side effects brought about by the cocktail of medication she had to ingest daily.
A perspective shift also has helped some of them overcome the inadequacies they feel about themselves.
Instead of subscribing to society’s conventional definitions of success, Peter said he learned to “lower his expectations” and find joy in the simplest things, such as being able to make someone else smile.
Whenever Cheryl starts to struggle with feelings of guilt and worthlessness, she has learned how to comfort herself by reassuring herself that “it’s okay, because I’m trying my best”.
“I continuously work on building my self-love, because to me, the greatest affirmation is the one that comes from within,” she added.
With a larger emphasis on mental health and higher incidences of people going through mental distress today, there are those who argue that it may be that young Singaporeans — viewed as part of the “strawberry generation” —  are weak.
Mental health professionals disagree, believing it to be an unfair assertion.
Ms Lee said: “It’s easy for the older generation to make statements like that. They are speaking from their age now. If we spoke to them in their younger days, if we catch them when they were feeling stressed at that point in time, I do think they will have suicidal thoughts in their mind.”
The challenges that youths face today are more complex and nuanced, said Ms Lee. While older generations of Singaporeans did face stresses in the past as well, especially relating to survival matters, young Singaporeans have their own set of challenges.
For one, competition is more intense now, with the job market being more globalised.
Ms Wong from Fei Yue also pointed out that younger Singaporeans are living in a more connected world with social media. As a result, they are not comparing themselves with just their peers around them, but also with people overseas.
She reiterated that negative comments about younger generation may end up reinforcing the stigma associated with mental health conditions. In their bid to not be seen as weak, some youths may end up isolating themselves more, she said.
MENTAL HEALTH LITERACY
For individuals to learn emotional resilience and how to provide better support to those with mental illness, the experts and youths interviewed say there should be more structured mental health education in schools.
“We may be given scientific literacy and numeracy in school. But we are never given emotional and mental help literacy,” said Ms Ong, the NMP.
Having experienced the feeling of loss and doubt when his friend had depression, 17-year-old Gabriel Ong said a “more holistic approach” to mental health education would be helpful. His school’s current module on mental health provides just very basic knowledge about remembering to take breaks while studying, for example. 
“It is hard for us to discern what would be the right thing to do for our friend. How do we know what is good for him? There are a lot of doubts in ourselves,” he said.
In response to TODAY’s queries, Madam Choy Wai Yin, director of guidance and student development curriculum at the Ministry of Education (MOE), said that schools and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) adopt an individualised approach given that at-risk students often have to deal with multiple factors and unique circumstances.
She added that MOE provides a “supportive environment in all schools and IHLs”, where students are taught resilience-building and how to reframe perceptions.
All schools have at least one to two school counsellors, while all IHLs have at least two to three. The counsellors provide individualised social and emotional support. “Where necessary, the counsellors will refer students to medical professionals for further help,” said Mdm Wong.
Ms Poh revealed that in 2006 when she started Silver Ribbon, she began talking to the authorities about a more structured mental health education in schools.
But she faced pushback from school principals and teachers. “They had concerns about educating children (about mental health issues) at such a young age, (being) afraid they may have stereotypes and all,” said Ms Poh. To overcome the concerns, a pilot programme can be implemented and assessed later, she suggested.
The need to start a conversation on mental health and suicide in schools is something close to the hearts of Ms Lek and Ms Doreen Kho, who also lost her son to suicide. They are part of a support group of bereaved parents called Please Stay, which will officially launch next month. 
Ms Kho, 44, lost her son Evan in November 2017, when he jumped from the 16th floor of a condominium. He was 11 years old.
The entrepreneur believes that mental health education programmes in school need to teach children how to identify others in pain and how to offer help.
“The curriculum could include social skills as well — how to communicate and how to be sensitive to each other,” she added.
As for Ms Lek, she feels there should be more dialogue on mental health issues and suicide.
“There isn’t enough coverage because they are afraid of copycat suicides, afraid it will trigger something in kids. But let’s be real. All of these are available online, on social media,” she said. “Kids are already exposed, so why can’t we address it in school?”
While mental health has become less of a taboo topic, the experts and youths said it remains a topic that some people dance around, which prevents more open and honest discussions about it. 
To achieve that, mental health advocates said that Singaporeans need to be more comfortable talking about their emotions and simply start asking people around them, “how are you feeling?”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teen-ocd-family-struggle-treatment-11963594,'We even thought of ending our lives': A family’s struggle with their child's OCD and how they came out on top - CNA,05/10/2019,"SINGAPORE: He stood frozen in the toilet for up to five hours at a go, often walked an overhead bridge backwards and found comfort opening and closing the refrigerator door repeatedly for hours.
These are the memories that Evelyn Chng and Tony Kee have of their son’s childhood.
Evelyn and Tony first noticed something was amiss in 2011, when they received a memo from their eldest child, *Bruce’s (not his real name) Mathematics teacher about him not handing in eight weeks of homework.
Tony had wondered if his 14-year-old son – who was exceptionally skilled at Math – was struggling under the stress of his Triple Science course or his experience being bullied a year ago. Concerned, he looked for Bruce’s school bag.
“I discovered the question papers, all crumpled inside. That’s when I realised that something was not right,” the 51-year-old recounted.
For the next two years or so, the Kees watched as their usually happy-go-lucky and active child became increasingly reticent and withdrawn. Bruce, who used to place in the top 10 per cent of his cohort, started to become untidy and fall behind in school. 
Just months before he was due to sit for his O-Level examinations, he was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).
OCD is a mental health condition that makes it “difficult for individuals with the condition to process information”, says Haanu Prithivi Raj, senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health’s (IMH) Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry.
“Having OCD is similar to having a broken filter or sieve in the brain. When the sieve works, the brain is able to ignore intrusive thoughts (that do not make sense) that we all have. However, when we have OCD, the sieve or filter is broken or torn and hence these thoughts fall through and this causes distress to us as we are not able to ignore these intrusive thoughts and fears anymore,” Ms Raj told CNA.
While there is not much data on OCD in Singapore youth, Ms Raj estimates it could affect up to 4 per cent of youths here, which is almost double the global prevalence of 2 to 3 per cent. From 2014 to 2018, the IMH Child Guidance Clinics saw an average of about 130 children and adolescents aged between 6 and 18 years old with OCD.
When Tony and Evelyn received the diagnosis, they didn’t know what to do. 
“We thought that it could be treated,” recalled Evelyn. 
“We thought OCD could be fully recovered from – with everything reset back to normal,” Tony said.
Then, Bruce started to display compulsions during his first semester in polytechnic.
“By 17, his condition was already severe. He would keep going in and out of the classroom doors during class because of anxiety,” said Evelyn.
Both parents recall having to wait hours in the school’s carpark as their teenage son flitted in and out of his empty classroom in a deserted school. Because they had no access to the school’s facilities, they sometimes had to enlist the help of a security guard to escort their son down.
Bruce also began calling his mother from the canteen every day to help him decide what to eat. Once, he called her to ask if he could bring an empty wrapper back.
“He couldn’t seem to make decisions. His decision-making was affected,” said Tony, who works in the financial services sector.
At home, Bruce would spend several hours in the toilet after a shower, standing in one spot as if frozen in time.
When he was ready to exit the toilet, his family was forced to rearrange the house to the state it had been in before he entered hours earlier, or else, he could not bring himself to enter an environment he perceived himself to have no control over.

This daily occurrence meant having to switch off all the lights and gas and wait around, even if the family happened to be preparing dinner at the time. 
These rituals were a way for Bruce to relieve his anxiety, Evelyn, 49, explained.
Whether it is counting or what, he will have to do whatever feels right. If he doesn’t count properly to relieve the anxiety, then he will feel like it is incomplete. Once he does complete it, he releases his anxiety and everything goes back to normal. 
""OCD MANIPULATES THE WHOLE FAMILY”
Even though they were hoping it was just “a passing phase of puberty”, the Kees brought their son to a temple where they were told to perform rituals to rid him of “spiritual possessions” and “bad luck”.
“It’s that thing when you’re hopeless and confused and everything people say, you just believe. You just grab it,” said Tony with a wry smile.
“It was so bizarre that we could not even try to understand. We were trying to see what we could do to help him because … he had just changed into another person,” Evelyn said.
Things soon came to a head in 2014 when Bruce was asked to leave his diploma course after his first year of study due to poor results. Hospitals they had applied to for treatment also rejected him due to the severity of his condition. Evelyn suffered two breakdowns and had to be hospitalised, she said.
“I was under too much stress … I had a panic attack because of his rituals. It affected the whole family because we had to try and manage his anxiety,” Evelyn recounted quietly.
Back then, she was acting as caregiver to her mother with dementia as well.
“I felt like an octopus. I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to handle and what came first. I didn’t know how to manage.”
Bruce also didn’t allow the family to eat in the kitchen or talk at home as it made him anxious and affected the rigid rules and order he expected himself and others to abide by.
He also targeted his younger sister whom he couldn’t stand the sight of, once going so far as to impede her from going to the toilet for several hours when their parents were out.
Soon, Bruce began demanding that his mother help him with some rituals, such as opening and closing the refrigerator door.
“I was being sucked into his rituals. My husband tried to intervene and I got sandwiched in between trying to manage his anxiety and not participate,” said Evelyn.
 “When he got tired, he would ask me to complete the ritual and I had to do exactly as instructed. He would beg me saying ‘Please mummy, last time, last time’ when I refused. He would also shout and yell.”
Evelyn often attempted to remove herself from the situation. In the middle of the night, she would walk out of their home and sit at the staircase landing.







                                    

To remove herself from participating in Bruce's OCD rituals, Evelyn would oftentimes leave the house in the middle of the night to sit at the staircase landing. (Illustration: Kenneth Choy)



“He would try to stop me from leaving – which stopped him (doing his rituals) … and sometimes, I would end up dozing off because I had to sit there for one to two hours while waiting for him to calm down,” she said, grimacing.
“It was painful, but I had no choice.”
Dr Adrian Loh, visiting consultant with the Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry at IMH explained that children and teens suffering from OCD frequently display compulsions such as touching certain objects in a specific pattern, or having to say things in a certain way, without understanding why.
“In some of these cases, all they can explain is that this just ‘feels right’, leading to much parental frustration. In some cases when sufferers are unable to obtain relief from overwhelming anxiety and discomfort, they may even end up with rage attacks which can be misunderstood as misconduct by family members,” added Dr Loh.
“IT WAS HELL. IT WAS HELL”
Dealing with a child who had to perform rituals at the expense of the family’s peace meant several clashes and fights within the family.
“The police have come (to the house) so many times that we can apply to be VIP members,"" joked Tony.
“Sometimes, it was us who called. And sometimes, it was the neighbours from the opposite block who called because … of the serious fights. It was too stressful and my daughter and I would get very scared when they fought as they would throw things here and there,"" Evelyn said.
Tony and Evelyn were also at constant loggerheads due to the mounting stress.
Said Tony: “It’s like … as a man, in the office, you can solve an issue. But you can’t even bring your child from the toilet to the bedroom. It’s just a short distance but you can’t do it, you know? The frustration was just too much,” he said.
At their lowest, the couple who have been married for 25 years, briefly considered ending it all.
“It was hell. It was hell,” said Evelyn.
We even thought of ending our lives that time. We couldn’t take it, because we were actually feeding his OCD. He was also refusing to seek continuous treatment with the psychologist so we were at a loss because we didn’t know how to manage.

Father and son stopped speaking to each other, and Bruce began to regard Tony as an enemy.
Not even extended family were privy to the situation and the Kees suffered in silence as both parents feared the stigma young Bruce would face if people found out he had a mental condition.
Neighbours started giving the family the cold shoulder on account of Bruce’s odd behaviour in public. They had spotted him walking backwards on roads and overhead bridges, or pacing up and down at nearby bus stops for hours.
“Once, we tried dragging him home, but he went back to the place because he had to complete his ritual. (At home), whenever we tried bringing him from the toilet to his room, after we turned off the lights, he would come out and go to the toilet and finish his ritual then go,” said Tony.
Oftentimes, when he was coming home, Bruce would stop just shy of his front door to perform a mental ritual that would have him wait outside for one to two hours while his family waited inside, unable to leave. 
THE TURNING POINT
A turning point came in 2015, three years after Bruce was diagnosed. Tony recalled being in a heated quarrel with Bruce one night when the elder Kee’s cousin – who was called in for help - walked into the house, demanding to know: “What happened again this time? Why again?”
“When I heard her saying it like that, I told myself I need to make some changes, otherwise one day, even your own cousin will not come and help you anymore,” he said.
The realisation drove Tony and Evelyn to begin searching for support groups. They attended an OCD seminar at IMH where they came across Caregivers Alliance (CAL), which helps caregivers of mentally ill people.
“We began attending their classes and from there, it started to change our perception,” Evelyn said. “We got to hear other people’s stories when they shared. We learned about how to journey with them, the symptoms itself and working closely with the medical team. (This) really helped us.”
Around the same time, Bruce was accepted by IMH for treatment and his parents picked up skills on how to reinforce those messages at home.
“I tried to find out how I could actually support him at home – how to not reinforce his behaviour and participate in his rituals at home,” said Evelyn. “They used Exposure Response Therapy (ERT), so at home I used other forms like daily chores or daily routines to build back his confidence and self-esteem.""Because of his OCD, he was very good at cleaning, cutting vegetables – so I would ask him to do that for me. After that, I started to look at his strengths. If he could do (a task), I would tell him, ‘Thank you son, for helping me with this’.”
“After that, he started to change and we could empathise with what he was going through. We were no longer fighting,” she added with a smile.
For Tony, the courses helped his wife and him to develop a “common language” that helped them at home when caring for Bruce.
“In the past, she had her method and I had my own method and we always clashed. So going for the courses helped us a lot,” he said.
JOURNEYING WITH OTHER SILENT SUFFERERS
Motivated by their breakthroughs, Tony and Evelyn began volunteering with CAL, conducting training for other caregivers in Mandarin.
“Along the way, things got better and better,” said Tony.
In class, caregivers marvelled at the pair’s experience dealing with their son’s OCD and Evelyn’s mother’s dementia.
“They asked us: ‘Eh? How come you look healthy?’” laughed Tony.
“That’s how people viewed us,” said Evelyn. “We were a source of inspiration, a source of hope.”
Encouraged by the results, Evelyn left her job in retail pharmacy to join CAL as a caregiver support specialist.
She and her husband also signed up for an 18-month-long graduate diploma course in counselling and psychology, which allowed them to become counsellors with CAL. They now hold three-hour classes for caregivers in Mandarin every week. When this reporter sat in for one of their classes, the pair was engaging and jovial, often joking to keep things lighthearted.
“We wanted to help those walking the same journey as us. Patients themselves may be in denial because they don’t have much insight. The family members might feel that it’s okay la, just cope and live with it. But it’s very difficult - it will get worse, and not only that, it will disintegrate the family,” said Evelyn.
Looking back, Tony admits he wouldn’t have considered volunteering if not for years of struggle with Bruce and his mother-in-law’s situation. “I took it as a lesson that I needed to go through to learn from it.”
Perhaps most surprising is that Bruce himself, now 23, recently joined IMH as a full-time peer support specialist, egged on by his mother.
“I told him: ‘Since you’re recovering to a stage where you are more stable, what do you want to do? What do you want to move on to in life? Work or study?’ So when the National Council of Social Service offered this course, I actually encouraged him to go for it,” Evelyn said.
“On the first day, he was five minutes late, but from the second day onwards, he was half an hour early and even volunteered to leave the house early,” Tony said.
He and Evelyn were soon amazed at the transformation in their once-incapacitated son.
“I encouraged him to view his illness in a different light and he began to realise that there were so many people walking a similar journey. His view and perception of his peers, mental health and people with similar conditions really changed then,” Evelyn said.
She was overjoyed when Bruce told her: “Mummy, I am happy you know”, when he came back home after work.
“Along the way, he told me: ‘All of us have gone through a certain kind of abuse for our mental condition and there are so many people out there who actually need support in health’ and that he wanted to thank his psychologist and psychiatrist for helping him to achieve what he is today. He had never thanked them until that moment, but after the course, he had learned to appreciate them, and I remember thinking ‘Wow’,” Evelyn said proudly.
“Now he is able to advise me on what kind of therapy to give his por por (Mandarin for grandmother) and how to speak to her. There is a drastic change and we can see that he is going back to what he used to be – a very lovely, kind and helpful boy,” she said.
Still, they understand that Bruce’s mental illness is a life-long journey.
“Of course, now he may be coping well, but in the future we don’t know. It’s still a lot of uncertainty, but we can only be hopeful and be positive,” said Evelyn.
“We told him that ‘This is meaningful, and you’re creating value with your life, and that is all that is important – you don’t need to have very high qualifications to live that type of life … you’re actually giving hope to others that recovery is possible and your loved ones can be treated. That is the satisfaction.’”
***************
CNA spoke to Bruce about his experience with OCD and this is what he shared with us:
What is your OCD based on?
Bruce: For me it’s checking and mostly I have to do things right. I have a particular way (of doing things) that is correct that I have to do. It’s based on my own logic.
What kind of rituals are involved?
Bruce: Like there are things that I need to place in certain areas of my house. And when I do things, I sort of plan them out in my head before I do them - there’s a certain order.
What happens when it doesn’t fall in that order?
Bruce: Then I will feel like very stressed out, because I had already planned out everything nicely in my head. I’m very aware of how people view me. Even if people aren’t judging me, I have that feeling that people are judging me. 
What kind of rituals were you doing in the toilet?
Mental rituals. After bathing, I do my mental rituals inside my mind and they mostly involve counting and running through all the steps and all the things in my head. The steps are mostly related to showering. I’m just usually slowly moving through the steps. And I’m also trying to sort out all the things in my life, because in the toilet I feel more comfortable. After bathing I’m very relaxed, so I just sort like staying in there. So I’m done with my shower already when I do the rituals, I just want to stay in the shower. 
Your parents said after you come out of the shower, the surroundings have to be the same.
Yes, because I sort of feel like things are moving around without me - it’s like I didn’t have a feeling of control over the moving things. I need everything to be in the same place because I want to feel a sense of control.
How are you learning to cope with OCD now? How are you living with the anxiety? 
What I do now is mostly keep myself engaged … like do things. Even if I’m at home, I’ll be surfing the Net, or finding something to do to keep my mind occupied to distract myself. Because if I don’t do anything, I tend to think a lot. Because my normal state is picking on all the details where I am very aware, I’m hyper-aware.
So I know that if I don’t do anything, I will go back to that state and nitpick on everything happening around me. I know that that is actually not good for me and it would make me go back to past habits so I try to focus on what the ERP (Exposure Response Prevention) taught me - which is keeping myself occupied. 
Between graduating from therapy and now, have you ever felt the need to perform your rituals creep up on you?
Yes, when I started work, I did. Because working needed me to go back to work the next day. But now it is more controlled - I can sort of resist it even though I still had the urge to do (the rituals). I try to distract myself, mostly. 
It has helped me to be more spontaneous also. Because of doing things that are sort of losing the control already so I’ve gotten used to it and I start to feel more at ease with just suddenly doing things instead of overplanning and making sure that things go a certain way. Now I am more able to just react as things happen.
Your parents took up a lot of courses and studied to walk on this journey with you and today they are helping caregivers. What do you think about what they have done?
I think it’s a good thing because they help others. It’s because of my mum taking part in this caregiver thing that she made me go for the sessions and that made me more aware that I wanted to help people also. After I went for the sessions then I started to want to help out with peer support. I was inspired when I saw my parents teaching others. 
I am grateful that they took those steps to help me. They were my pillars of support as well as my psychologists … they were not ostracising me. 
What has it been like as a peer support specialist for the past three months?
I feel like it’s a good thing, even though it may not seem like a good job in the eyes of the public. I feel like it makes me able to do things. It is meaningful and it’s something that I want to wake up and do. It’s not like some jobs where you have to drag yourself to work because this environment is quite good I feel. The people are nice and I feel very at ease. I work with a multi-disciplinary OCD team where I’m the only PSS.
What is a regular day like for you?
Because they don’t want to rush me through, I only currently have a few patients that I’m working with. I either talk to them over the phone or if I can meet them face-to-face, I’ll meet them face-to-face and just talk to them. It’s quite simple, it’s just befriending and just being yourself. 
Have you met any patients who are in the same place that you once were?
Yes, some bits, but not exactly the same. Certain parts when I hear more about their personality, I can relate. If they are perfectionists, I can sort of relate that I’m also like that in a certain way. I can use my experience to talk about how I would react to and how I apply and handle certain things.
I think doing this helps me in my own recovery because I go back home and reflect on it and it becomes more instilled in myself that I did go through this and I’ll remind myself that I should not (go back to that).
What is one piece of advice you would give a youth who has OCD?
They must be willing to seek help, because for me at that point, I didn’t really accept that I had OCD. I think awareness … being aware of it is quite hard. For me, I didn’t have awareness but my parents sort of forced me to seek help, so I sought help.
If you have a feeling that maybe things are not really right, try to seek help and be willing to receive therapy, treatment and medicine. I think one thing that stops people from recovering is that a lot of the patients with OCD, if they aren’t being forced to receive help, they won’t want to seek help – they think that there is nothing wrong with them.
For me, I also thought that way. I thought: “I’m normal, what. OCD is just some doctor’s label”. Spending 4 hours in the toilet … To me, it was not illogical in my point of view. I just thought that it was my way of doing things. It didn’t occur to me that it was OCD. I just thought it was my personality. 
OCD is highly treatable. You have to be conscious of what OCD is like so that you know if you have some traits that start to affect your life, then you have to be willing to seek help. It’s not the end of the road if you are diagnosed with OCD.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/lifestyle/caring-for-dementia-11868338,The Singaporean connecting dementia patients and caregivers with tech - CNA,05/09/2019,"When Melissa Chan was 18 years old, her father went missing again. It had happened four years earlier, but this time he'd been gone for two days. His dementia had gotten worse.
“We stayed in Woodlands. My mum had dropped him off at his office at Potong Pasir, and when she went to pick him up, she couldn’t find him and started panicking,” Melissa recalled. “There was no Facebook. We had to SMS everyone, and the police followed the missing persons protocol, which meant waiting for 24 hours.”

Her father was eventually found sitting on a sofa a few blocks from their home – he had somehow managed to find his way to the neighbourhood, but not quite home.
“When I think about it, I can imagine how painful and confused he was sitting there. When I saw him at the police station, his shirt was tucked out and he had lost his shoes,” said Melissa. “The sofa he was sitting in was the same colour as the one we used to have.”

That incident, along with many others as she, her siblings and their mother struggled to care for her father, would eventually prompt the 28-year-old Singaporean to start a social enterprise for dementia caregivers and, later, join an even bigger start-up with bigger aspirations.
GIVING SUPPORT FOR CAREGIVERS
Founded shortly after Melissa's father passed away in 2014, the much-lauded Project We Forgot has been actively functioning as a kind of support group for caregivers of persons with dementia, through online forums, workshops and other activities.

It was community that her family didn’t have back then. “As a family, we never spoke about it. My mother was struggling to figure out what was happening to her husband, and care for us,” said Melissa. “I’d cancel appointments with friends because I felt a sense of guilt. I decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.”
One lightbulb moment to start PWF would also come from an unlikely source:  Comedian Seth Rogen.
“He’s seen as someone super funny but I saw him speaking in (US) Congress about dementia – his wife’s mother had it and the two of them had to care for her. I was very impressed because he was using a different way to educate them about the condition, and the struggles of caregivers,"" she said.
""I realised there was nothing like that in Singapore. When you Google, you see Western faces. Any information was very medical, and research papers. But it’s a very human journey.""
Starting PWF entailed a sharp career detour. Melissa had previously worked in the hospitality and tech industries (in marketing and communications for W Hotels and later, a travel tech start-up) – but both experiences proved crucial.
“I realised that at the end of the day, it’s about taking (complicated information) and making it accessible for people to digest.”
She and her PWF team turned to social media after discovering there were caregivers overseas who were using Instagram as a platform. “They were sharing stories, talking about day-to-day experiences, videoing themselves about their struggles.”
And it worked. Today, PWF continues to organise activities in Singapore (most recently a dementia-friendly design-a-thon at the National Design Centre) and they are aiming to grow in Malaysia, where they’re holding a film event in time for World Alzheimer’s Month this September. Alzheimer's contributes a large percentage to cases of dementia, which is an umbrella term, said Melissa.
They have have also gotten support from organisations like the National Youth Council, Alzheimer's Disease Association and Singtel, which had named it one of its Future Makers start-up companies in 2017.
CONNECTING CAREGIVERS AND THE ELDERLY
But PWF was just the start of her advocacy. Early this year, Melissa also joined Homage, another local start-up that is also expanding to Malaysia, which helps connect caregivers with the elderly and their family.
I decided not to go overseas for education because a part of me worried that my father would forget who I was when I came back.
For Melissa, who’s now also head of Homage’s community and outreach, it was a chance to offer something that PWF could not.
“We’ve been doing the emotional well-being support (for caregivers at PWF) and now, Homage has a platform to provide on-demand care (for patients).”
In a nutshell, said Melissa, it's something like Grab – but for elderly care.
The company has a pool of care professionals, or ""Care Pros"", that people can tap into by using an app or going online, whether it’s to send a loved one for a medical check-up or simply to look after them at home.

THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY
It might seem strange to be bringing up technology when talking about an issue where physical, human interaction is what’s most vital, but Melissa says being connected has actually become crucial as the population ages and families become smaller and often busy at work.
“There is a need to shift the way care is delivered, especially if you’re looking at the topic of longterm care for an ageing population,” she said. “If a family needs a caregiver in the next two days, can they get it or do they wait two to three weeks, for example.”
Whenever I think of services at Homage, I think about how my family could’ve used it – just a few hours to ensure that someone was home to watch over my dad.
“On top of that, people who are tech-savvy will want information at their fingertips – it’s no longer just putting a parent in a nursing home or with a caregiver and not knowing what’s happening for a few hours. Just knowing how your parent is doing – there is a big role for technology to play in this space,"" said Melissa.
For example, being connected means one can be updated on how the medical appointment or house visit went without being physically there. And the Care Pros, too, can access previous information about the client-patient through the app so they’re prepared before even entering the home.

The current pool of Care Pros number around 1,000, which is a mix of nurses, therapists and non-nurses who are able to provide support. And they’re in-demand. “Every hour we’re delivering care right now,” Melissa told CNA Lifestyle.
Joining Homage also resonated with Melissa on a very personal level.
While taking care of her father, there were times when the family’s schedules wouldn’t sync and they had to sometimes resort to locking him up at home.
“It was dangerous and we knew it wasn’t the right thing to do, but it was our only option sometimes,” she said, sadly.

“Whenever I think of services at Homage, I think about how my family could’ve used it – just a few hours to ensure that someone was home to watch over my dad. It plays a big role in giving families peace of mind – especially small [families] where all are working full-time.”
""At the end of the day, caregiving and long-term care is a human thing,"" said Melissa, ""but we need to think out of the box.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/asia/malaysian-student-suicide-jerusha-sanjeevi-utah-state-uni-sued-11788540,US university sued over Malaysian student's suicide after reports of bullying - CNA,07/08/2019,"SALT LAKE CITY, Utah: The family of a Malaysian student who died by suicide has filed a lawsuit against Utah State University (USU), accusing the American varsity of failing to address the bullying she had encountered. 
Ms Jerusha Sanjeevi, a 24-year-old PhD student in psychology, took her own life in April 2017. 
The lawsuit, filed on Aug 1, 2019, alleges that there was a pattern of favouritism and racism played out for years within the psychology programme. 
According to the Herald Journal, the lawsuit named the university as a defendant, three professors, as well as two students who allegedly bullied Ms Sanjeevi.
""I'm hoping that USU will take a hard look in the mirror. I'm hoping that it will do what's necessary to make diversity work there,"" said lawyers Richard Kaplan, as quoted in the Herald Journal. 
""I'm also hoping to help the family in Malaysia with their circumstances financially."" 
JOKES ABOUT INDIAN FOOD, BEING BIPOLAR
The Salt Lake Tribune reported that when Ms Sanjeevi applied to USU after graduating from Minnesota State University in 2016, she had been assured she would be comfortable there, even though more than 80 per cent of its students were white. 
However, reports said she was almost immediately singled out by two students in her cohort. 
The lawsuit alleged that they made fun of her ""weird Asian name"", joked that she was bipolar and told classmates she would not have made it into the programme if she had not been ""given a handout"" as an international student from Malaysia. 
One of the students, whom Ms Sanjeevi worked with in a professor's lab and as a teaching assistant, was said to have discredited her while instructing classes, saying she smelled like Indian food and criticising her ""inferior"" dark skin. 
The lawsuit accused the professors and department chairperson of not stepping in to help, even though Ms Sanjeevi had approached them, reported the Tribune. 
Exhibits to the case included email and text conversations between psychology professors that showed they were uncertain about how to respond to Ms Sanjeevi's complaints. 
Ms Sanjeevi's boyfriend Matthew Bick is said to have filed the case on behalf of Ms Sanjeevi's parents, who live in Malaysia. 
""The family in Malaysia can't adequately be compensated for the loss of a life,"" said their lawyer Mr Kaplan, as quoted in the Tribune. ""It's altogether too devastating. But this is the only way we have of helping."" 
USU has disputed the claimed detailed in the lawsuit, reported the Herald Journal. 
""Jerusha Sanjeevi's suicide was a tragic event that had a huge impact on the psychology department and on our entire university. She was a promising student, and her death tremendously affected her fellow students, as well as staff and faculty in the department,"" a USU spokesperson was quoted as saying. 
""We cannot release private and protected student records or comment on the specifics of this case, but we strongly dispute the facts and allegations in the complaint. We believe Utah State took all appropriate action to address interpersonal issues between students in the department.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/moe-msf-very-concerned-about-spike-in-youth-suicides-experts-say-11775260,"MOE, MSF ‘very concerned’ about spike in youth suicides; experts say more support and awareness necessary - CNA",05/08/2019,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) are “very concerned” about the spike in the number of youth suicides this year, said the ministries in a joint statement. 
“It is not yet a trend, but we must monitor this closely and take various measures to address it,” said spokespersons for the ministries in response to email queries from CNA.
The number of suicides in Singapore rose 10 per cent last year, with suicides among boys aged 10 to 19 at a record high, the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) said last week.
A total of 94 people aged between 10 and 29 killed themselves last year, SOS said.
Among boys aged between 10 and 19 years old, there were 19 suicides last year – the highest since it began keeping records in 1991 and almost triple the seven cases recorded in 2017.
There were 397 reported suicides in 2018, compared with 361 the year before. This raised the suicide rate to 8.36 deaths per 100,000 Singapore residents, up from 7.74 in 2017.
Noting that the underlying causes of suicide are complex, the spokespersons said: “The objective is to build psychological resilience in youths, raise awareness on mental health issues, identify and support those at risk of suicide, and intervene in crisis situations where urgent help is needed.”
‘NEW CHALLENGES AND SOCIETAL PRESSURES’
Relationship issues, academic stress, peer pressure and uncertainties about their future are possible causes for suicidal thoughts in teens, said experts, and mental health conditions like anxiety and depression may intensify the problem. 
Dr Ong Say How, senior consultant and chief of the department of developmental psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) said youths may think of suicide after facing severe distress and emotional pain from a major setback. 
Since younger people have “limited problem-solving and self-help skills”, he said they might think of radical solutions for their problems, including suicide. 
“Today’s youths are facing new challenges and societal pressures compared to times when life was simpler.” 
Dr Adrian Wang, a consultant psychiatrist at Gleneagles Medical Centre believes academic and peer pressure play major roles. 
He said: “Social media may unfortunately compound issues in a young person who is already feeling anxious or depressed. I have young patients telling me they feel lonely and marginalised because their friends have excluded them from a Whatsapp chat group, or unfollowed them on Instagram. 
“Teenagers see their social media or digital presence as an extension of their personality. They need to feel accepted not only in real-life situations, but online as well.” 
Education policy expert Professor Jason Tan said recent education reforms, such as not listing the top scorers in national exams, are good efforts to reduce academic pressure on youths. 
But he noted that pressures also come from employers, parents and the wider society. “I think the important thing to emphasise is that the school is just one sphere of influence for young people.”
‘ASKING FOR HELP IS NOT A SIGN OF WEAKNESS’ 
Despite the spike, SOS noted that more young people are reaching out for help. Among those who wrote to them for emotional support last year, more than 78 per cent were between 10 and 29 years old. This was an increase of more than 56 per cent, it said. 
Experts agreed that while this was an encouraging sign, more awareness of mental health issues among teachers, employers and society at large was necessary to eliminate the social stigma surrounding them.
Dr Cheryl Huang, senior clinical psychologist with the clinical and forensic psychology service at MSF, said: “More young people could be reaching out for support due to greater awareness and avenues to do so. They should not have to suffer in silence nor feel ashamed for asking for help.
“As a community, we could contribute by being supportive towards one another, understanding that asking for help is not a sign of weakness.”
Dr Wang highlighted that young adults who have just started work also often feel overwhelmed by job pressure, sleep problems and insecurities about their future, and stressed that employers need to be more supportive.
“I am sometimes contacted by a patient's HR department who sometimes have no idea of the concept of doctor-patient confidentiality, and want to know when their staff can get back to work, instead of asking what they can do to help,” he added. 
But more young people reaching out for professional help could mean they still feel uncomfortable talking about it with their loved ones, said Mr Daniel Koh, a psychologist from Insights Mind Centre. 
Some of them do not want to “be seen as a burden”, he said, and thus reach out to professionals, sometimes even in secret. 
PEER SUPPORT AND BUILDING RESILIENCE 
For youths and teens, experts stressed the importance of having programmes that build resilience and allow them to discuss the challenges they face.
Dr Ong said: “It is important to educate young children that failures and setbacks in life are to be expected and are acceptable. 
Allowing children to face challenges/obstacles, make mistakes and subsequently overcome them, helps them develop a sense of responsibility, mastery, and confidence.”
He added that this would mentally prepare adolescents for challenges they meet when they grow up, that they would otherwise feel are “catastrophic”. 
“Peer support can also be helpful, where youths are taught how to provide a listening ear to their friends who are feeling troubled, and also how to alert and link their friends to receive additional help,” said Dr Huang. 
MSF said it “pays special attention to vulnerable youths”, such as those who have been abused or ill-treated, and screens them to detect mental health concerns and self-harm risks. 
“MSF psychologists also work closely with case managers and caregivers to develop case plans and interventions that take into account the particular circumstances of the individual, including his or her age and gender, as well as risk and protective factors,” it said. 
In schools, an “individualised approach” is adopted for each student at risk, said MOE. 
“At the same time, school personnel look out for risk factors and issues more uniquely associated to each gender to provide specific support. Schools also work closely with parents to encourage a nurturing and supportive home environment,” the spokesman added, noting that every school has a trained counsellor. 
“Our teachers seek to build positive relationships with their students, and look out for those displaying signs of distress.
“Schools also encourage students to look out for and support one another, as well as point peers in distress to seek help from trusted adults, including parents, teachers, and counsellors.”
""To foster a caring school culture"", most schools have rolled out peer support programmes, MOE said.
One such school is Fairfield Methodist Secondary School (FMSS). Ms Clarissa Koh, year head for upper secondary and officer-in-charge for peer support at the school told CNA that student response to peer support has been ""very positive"". 
Efforts to educate students on how to look out for and support friends in distress have been paying off, said Ms Koh, with student peer support leaders alerting teachers whenever they notice those who may be struggling. 
""The peer support leaders have the most direct contact with their peers and are able to listen out and watch out for signs of distress such as sudden mood swings, change in habits and appetite, unusual activities and so on,"" she added. 
FMSS' student peer support group comprises 73 students who have undergone a peer support training camp to learn about different mental wellness issues, what signs to look out for and how to provide support. 
Once a term, the six student leaders in the group share mental wellness tips with the student body, reminding them of what to do and who to look for if they are having difficulties coping with stress. 
The peer support group also organises two major mental wellness events every year. For example, mental wellness week teaches students how to cope with stress and how to de-stress, and the activities have seen strong participation from students from all levels, Ms Koh said. 
PROVIDE A LISTENING EAR
Jeremy Tan, a secondary 4 student in FMSS who also serves as head of the peer support board said classmates are more open to sharing their worries with each other because they feel more comfortable.
Recounting an incident where a friend ""poured his heart out"" about family issues at home and some other problems at school, Jeremy said: ""I listened to his worries and empathised with him. He felt better after that. 
""I felt that all he needed was just a listening ear and to know he had the support of his friends.""
While it can be unsettling to hear that someone you care for is feeling suicidal, experts encouraged they be given support and encouraged to seek help.
Dr Ong said individuals who have experienced episodes of anxiety or depression, a significant loss like a break-up or death, a personal crisis, or a loss of social support are vulnerable. 
The first step should be to provide a listening ear for those affected to talk about their feelings, said Dr Huang. “Help to monitor and keep this person safe.” 
Dr Wang said: “You don't have to give solutions to their problems immediately. Just listen and validate their feelings. Sit and be with them until that feeling of despair fades. Then follow-up the next day, and the following day. Encourage them to speak with a counselor or a doctor. 
“Small steps can help in a big way.”

Sessions with his psychologist soon uncovered that he felt upset with himself because he couldn’t regulate his emotions.
He was not able to control his anger. Small things would trigger intense anger, and provoke him to throw objects he was holding, break items close to him, or yell loudly.
His anger also made it impossible to maintain a romantic relationship for a long time.
In fact, Jonathan shared there were many times when he came very close to getting into trouble with the law, as he had intense urges to hurt people because he felt that they had wronged him.

He realised he needed help when his ex-girlfriend who was pregnant with their child left him because she did not want to bring up a child in such a hostile and unloving environment. 
That event, while it initially triggered a lot of anger in Jonathan, helped him realise that he had to change his ways if he were to have a family in the future.
HURTING HER GRANDMOTHER
Samantha, a 25-year old executive shared that she came very close to hurting her 80-year old grandmother when she did not feel understood.
They would get into constant arguments over simple things such as where washed cups ought to be placed, or when her grandmother forgets to turn off light switches.
Samantha would shout at her grandmother to get her point across. She has also broken numerous plates and cups in an effort to get her grandmother to understand how much her actions was impacting her.
While she still works, Samantha is aware that her anger outbursts have killed off many friendships as her friends were unable to tolerate her harsh words and behaviour, especially in public. 
Her intense outbursts, including the ones that happened in church, prompted one of her church leaders to convince her she needed help. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
While Samantha was not keen on seeing a psychiatrist, her close friends rallied with her church leaders to help make her first visit less daunting.

WHAT IS ANGER?
A spate of events some months back suggest we have some way to go in keeping our anger in check. 
In April, a man was jailed for attacking bus drivers two days in a row over bus fares to Yishun. Another got jail and caning after swinging a plank in a 60-person riot. And five men were arrested after a fight along Orchard Road.
Anger reflects a healthy sense of self. When we feel that our sense of self and worth is threatened, we react in anger. 
The intensity of anger can range from mild annoyance to extreme rage. While it is normal to experience anger from time to time depending on the situation, one may need to get help when they feel that the slightest provocation triggers uncontrollable  rage. 
Some symptoms that anger is a problem would include: Anger affecting social relationships and work performance; constantly feeling impatient, irritated and hostile; frequent arguments with others and often getting angrier in the process; being physically violent when angry; and difficulty or an inability to control anger or being impulsive when angry. 
The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has also classified sudden episodes of unwarranted anger as Intermittent Explosive Disorder (IED). 
Affecting 7.4 per cent of people globally, those with IED essentially “explode” into a rage despite minimal or lack of provocation or reason. They often share that they feel a lack of control over their emotions.

Apart from genetics and neurobiology, environmental factors especially early adverse childhood experiences, harsh parenting, poor social skills and poor empathy can lead to outbursts of anger. 
ABUSIVE PARENTS
At times, the presence of physical or mental illness and addiction to drugs or alcohol can also fuel anger issues.
Both Jonathan and Samantha recalled growing up with harsh parents who were physically punitive. They were also bullied in school. 
When Jonathan developed depressive symptoms because he could not sustain relationships and work, he resorted to alcohol to cope. 
Samantha coped with her past by throwing herself into work, but her angry responses and high expectations caused her close friends and family members to shun her. 
NOT THINKING RATIONALLY
Scientists have highlighted that when we are angry, we bypass our ability to plan, think rationally and respond in a way that benefits common humanity. 
Renowned psychiatry expert Dan Siegel explains in his book Mindsight that when a person has sudden, irrational and emotional eruptions, the lower limbic and brain stem layers can explode out of control resulting in a meltdown. 
Lack of sleep, hunger, and the way we perceive certain events can also fuel episodes of explosive anger.

In such episodes, part of the brain stops regulating the energy being stirred up, disrupting coordination and balance – meaning we become less flexible, less thoughtful and more reactive. Our anger impairs decision-making and judgement.
There are many situations that can trigger one’s anger. Like thermostats, each of us has a different threshold for such triggers. 
Not getting one’s way, or hearing “no” can set someone off. Getting stuck in traffic and being the receiving end of other drivers' actions on the road, or when someone bumps or pushes you, even if it was an accident - all these can cause us to lose our cool. 
Some of us can shrug it off while these same situations can trigger a major outburst in others. 
MANAGING YOUR ANGER
The good news is anger can be tamed. While you cannot control or choose your emotions, you can always control how you express your anger. 
There are three big steps in managing anger, namely identifying triggers, pausing, responding and not reacting.
1. Identifying triggers 
Anger brings about physical changes. Adrenaline rushes through your body and you may experience an increased heart rate, heavier breathing, and your body (particularly your shoulders) becoming tense. In some people, their fists and arms become more fidgety.

Anger is usually a cover-up for other feelings, to mask embarrassment, insecurity, hurt, shame or vulnerability. 
People who grew up in environments where the expression of emotions was discouraged, or in families that placed a high emphasis on “saving face”, may have a harder time acknowledging the emotions underlying their anger. 
Recognising these signs is an important first step to creating some space where we can choose our next course of action. The more we practise noticing ourselves and how we are feeling, the easier it gets to manage our anger. 
2. Pause
Taking time to analyse and understand your reaction to situations that trigger you is an important step in managing your anger. 
Some common negative thoughts including overgeneralising what’s happening. Watch for thoughts like “You always interrupt me! He never listens to me. No one ever respects me”. 
Others might start mind-reading to make assumptions about what others are thinking or feeling. Thoughts like “he did it on purpose because he does not like me” or “they intentionally ignored me” can be unhelpful.
It is important to own our emotions. When you notice that your thoughts and bodily changes reflect anger, take some time to pause and pay attention to yourself.

3. Responding, not reacting 
Awareness of our emotions gives us the power to choose our actions. There are many ways that can help you cool down and keep your anger thermostat in check. 
First, remove yourself away from the physical triggers. If you know that certain situations or people trigger you, reduce your contact accordingly. For example, avoid hanging out with the buddy who often puts you down or avoid that busy expressway. 
Second, focus on your breath. Tuning in to your body actually helps to bring awareness to the pace of your breathing, and doing mindful breathing helps to reduce a racing heart. 
Third, get more exercise. Releasing pent-up energy by exercising (i.e. walking, running, swimming or even kick-boxing) helps to calm a person down.
Fourth, think of the consequences. Try to identify the consequences of your action to help you to choose an alternative action. 
Throwing things in anger will only result in broken items and increased expenses. Hitting someone in rage may feel good for the moment, but will only result in longer-term damage and potentially a fine or a jail term.

Jonathan and Samantha are both actively working on their anger management problems by identifying their triggers and employing different strategies to cope with their emotions. 
Samantha took up kickboxing. She has also been attending family therapy to improve her relationship with her grandmother. The help from her close friends and church members has been very helpful in her recovery. 
Jonathan, on the other hand, has been practicing yoga and mindfulness, and is currently working as a fitness instructor in a gym, doing what he really enjoys.

The son of a coolie and a hawker was arrested and sentenced to three years in a Reformative Training Centre for taking drugs.
He continued to commit crimes after his release from the reformative training centre. For this, Say Tiong was jailed on more than 10 occasions, mostly for drug offences but also for hurting others. He would take drugs, drink alcohol and attack others with weapons when he felt enraged by what they said. 
“I would feel frustrated,” Say Tiong, now 61, told CNA in a mix of Mandarin and Hokkien. “When I’m frustrated, I cannot think (straight).”
The repeated heroin use, revolving door experience with prison and a brother with developmental problems weighed heavily on him. He said he felt sad and depressed.
In 2002, at the age of 44, he was diagnosed with depression by psychiatrists at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) while serving a 10-year prison sentence.
There are others like Say Tiong, whose troubles and mental conditions form a backdrop against which they commit crime.
1 IN 10 PRISONERS HAVE MENTAL DISORDERS, DEPRESSION 'MOST COMMON'
The Singapore Prison Service (SPS) told CNA that about 10 per cent of prisoners here are diagnosed with mental disorders, the most common being insomnia, adjustment disorder and depressive episodes.
Criminal defence lawyers told CNA that depression is perhaps the most common mental illness they have seen among accused persons.
Lawyer Sunil Sudheesan, who has handled about a thousand cases in his 14 years of practice, said about 300 to 400 of his clients had some sort of psychiatric issue, with depression being the most common.
“The core of depression is that it results in a person behaving in a way which they would not normally behave because you can’t deal with your problems and therefore your ability to control your reactions sometimes is affected significantly,” he said. 
While mild depression may not excuse a person from criminal liability, lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said severe or moderate depression can impair a person’s judgment and become a mitigating factor in sentencing.
Mr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said: “Ultimately, there is also the issue of whether the mental illness has any causal link to the offence. For many persons, the mental illness is merely a condition which may not have a determining effect on the criminal act.”
HOW ARE THEY TREATED IN PRISON?
Inmates with mental illnesses receive treatment for their conditions by a team of psychiatrists and medical officers while they are incarcerated. A team of correctional rehabilitation specialists and psychologists also give them counselling and therapy.
According to Dr Christopher Cheok, senior consultant at IMH’s department of forensic psychiatry, the process in prison is no different from hospital clinics.
“Patients are assessed, given medication as needed and provided with psychotherapy and occupational therapy. The only difference is that they are seen in a secure setting,” he said.
He added that the goals of treatment are the same - to reduce psychological suffering and manage the mental illness.
Despite their condition, most will be assessed to be well enough to mingle with the general prison population and can be put through work and rehabilitation programmes.
Only those with severe mental conditions are separated from the general population. They are treated for their condition by a team of IMH psychiatrists, psychologists, and occupational therapists who work closely with SPS’ psychologists. The aim is to help these inmates understand and manage their mental disorders and prepare to reintegrate them into the general inmate population. 
While the law accords the same rights to people with mental illnesses as any other person, there are special provisions for those whom the court finds unfit to plead because they are of unsound mind, said a Ministry of Law (MinLaw) spokesman.
Their plea will not be taken and the court will order the person to be examined by a medical practitioner or remanded for observation in a psychiatric institution for up to a month.
If the medical practitioner certifies that the person is incapable of making his defence, the court may release him if it is certain that he will receive proper care and would not harm himself or others.
The alternative is for the matter to be referred to the Minister for Law, who may order the person to be confined in a psychiatric institution or any place of safe custody for treatment, said the spokesman.
Their mental state will be reviewed by independent experts at least once every six months and they may be discharged on the minister's order following a review, said MinLaw.
Ex-convicts may continue their treatment with IMH after their release from jail. The institute began the Forensic Psychiatry Community Service in 2012 to provide continued treatment and service to ex-convicts with a psychotic, affective or anxiety disorder diagnosis, supported by case managers and medical social workers. More than 460 patients who are ex-convicts have completed this voluntary one-year programme.
After this one year period. they could either be transferred to IMH care teams handling the general patient population for treatment and support or receive care from community partners if their conditions are less complex and have stabilised.
HOW ARE ACCUSED PERSONS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS DEALT WITH IN COURT?

Accused people could be given non-jail sentences that focus on rehabilitation.
Singapore's community court, which has a problem-solving approach and an emphasis on rehabilitation, was set up in 2006 for special cases including offenders with mental conditions.
It can now impose mandatory treatment orders (MTOs) for up to three years, where offenders must undergo psychiatric treatment as an alternative to imprisonment.
Other than MTOs, the community court could impose community service orders; day reporting orders where offenders must present themselves to a reporting centre for monitoring, counselling and rehabilitation programmes; or short detention orders.
Following recent changes to the Criminal Justice Reform Act, MTOs can be imposed on offenders convicted of a prescribed list of more serious offences, which are punishable with up to seven years’ imprisonment, up from offences punishable with up to three years’ jail.
WHEN DOES MENTAL ILLNESS PLAY A PART?
Each case is unique and is dealt with on its own set of circumstances, lawyers and psychiatrists told CNA.
Criminal defence lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam said mental illness can come into play at two other stages in the court process, with the first in considering some defences in certain types of crime. For example, having a mental condition could allow a person accused of murder to argue for the defence of diminished responsibility, he said.
The second is in sentencing, where the courts could give a reduced punishment if an accused person’s mental illness is shown to have played a part in his commission of the offence. 
But just because an accused person has a mental illness does not mean he gets a reduced sentence or a community-based sentence, and not all types of mental illnesses are given weight as a mitigating factor, they said.
For example, an accused person suffering from paedophilic disorder may not succeed in using that in mitigation, said Mr Thuraisingam as “it’s not the type of offence which affects your judgment”. 
“A paedophile is predisposed in a particular way but there’s nothing affecting his judgment as to whether to do something right or wrong. It must in a way affect your ability to resist (committing the crime),” he explained.
“It is different for someone with impulse control (disorders) which affects his judgment on whether to do something or not,” he said. 
“In the event that the suspect is diagnosed with a mental disorder, the psychiatrists will further assess if this has impaired the suspect’s judgement at the point of committing the act,” said IMH’s Dr Cheok.

Private psychiatrist Dr Munidasa Winslow, who was previously with IMH, said beyond making the assessment, he would also make recommendations to prevent the person from reoffending.
The judge will look at the psychiatric reports tendered by the prosecution and defence in coming to a decision on how much mitigating weight to give, if at all, to the offender’s mental condition.
THE JAIL QUESTION, AND HOW LIKELY RECOVERY IS
Jail time may not necessarily be the best option for accused persons with mental conditions, said lawyers.
Lawyer Mr Thuraisingam said: ""(For) a normal person, you jail him once, he will think - I don't want to do this again, because I don't want to go to prison. But a person who has mental illness may not think that way.""
Criminal lawyer Sunil Sudheesan said jail is too ""short-term"". ""Because you come out and there's nothing,"" he said. ""You're left in the wilderness.""
Jail will not work ""all the more"" for recalcitrant offenders with mental conditions, as ""there needs to be a more interventionist sort of MTO"" which could involve a stay in a psychiatric institution, said Mr Sudheesan.
He cited the case of Goh Lee Yin, a woman diagnosed with kleptomania who committed suicide in 2017 after repeatedly being convicted of shoplifting.
""You know the entire stigmatisation of the criminal justice process and the trauma involved there, sometimes it’s clearly too much for people to bear,” he said.
Psychiatrist Dr Winslow who was involved in the case, said he knew she needed ""a lot more help for her mental condition"", adding that the legal criteria for how a condition contributes to a crime and mental health criteria ""are not exactly aligned all the time"".
PROGRESS AND WHAT MORE CAN BE DONE
But Dr Winslow said he sees progress.
“If they have committed a crime, they want to be able to punish them for the crime, but there’s a greater emphasis overall than when I first started in the 1980s towards restorative justice, they want to see that people who have mental health conditions get the help for those mental health conditions and that is something that I see a lot more strongly than before,” he said. 
Mr Nathan said family members can also help by being more open about those with mental illnesses.
""Pretending that a condition doesn't exist or sweeping it under the carpet could ultimately cause more harm to the offender. Ultimately, we all have to remove the stigma attached to mental illnesses,"" he said.
Dr Winslow added that there seems to be a greater awareness of mental health conditions that makes people more willing to talk about them to their lawyers or doctors. 
He said the solution is for people to recognise if they have got issues, to persistently seek help and be aware that, sometimes, it takes time.
“After you restore hope, and tell people you actually have a condition that can be treated, life can change,” he said. “Maybe I’m a little bit more of an optimist, but I think that even judges like to see lives saved rather than just putting people into prison.”
SALVATION A LONG JOURNEY
For Say Tiong, salvation came after a long journey and near-death experiences.

While he was in IMH after a referral there by the court, one of his ward mates asked him to join him in killing himself. His ward mate died, but Say Tiong was saved by a nurse and was later told that his mother had died the night before. 
He had tried committing suicide seven or eight times in various ways over his lifetime - but was not fully cognisant that he suffered from depression until he was admitted to IMH on a court order.
“I would think - I should die. Living has no meaning. I felt very sad,” he said. “I asked myself why did I become like this - I kept taking heroin, why did no one save me? Why was my mother in a wheelchair, and my brother had brain problems. I would drink and drink and drink, before smoking heroin.”
Looking back on his life, Say Tiong said he took drugs as a form of escape each time.
Say Tiong, who still visits IMH from time to time, has managed in recent years to cut down the dosage of the medication he takes for his depression.
He no longer leads a life of crime since his release from prison in 2012, after meeting a fellow inmate who introduced him to Christianity.
“I took drugs because I felt frustrated - why would I take drugs, why did I take this road? I knew it was wrong, but I kept doing it. I couldn't help myself,” he said. ""Now I don't need to escape anymore. Now I am happy.""

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/advertorial/a-flying-start-to-medicine-11450300,A flying start to medicine with Duke-NUS - CNA,27/05/2019,"As a student at Anderson Junior College (now known as Anderson Serangoon Junior College), Dr Edwin Yang developed a passion for military aviation after joining the Singapore Youth Flying Club.
He received his Private Pilot Licence in 2003, the same year he graduated from junior college, and promptly applied to join the Republic of Singapore Air Force. Unfortunately, his dreams of becoming a military pilot fell flat, as he was diagnosed with esotropia during the pilots’ medical examination. The condition causes both eyes to turn inwards.
The 33-year-old can vividly recall the day he received his rejection letter from the Air Force.  “It occurred during my basic military training while I was serving my National Service. It didn’t help that I was also due to collect my A Level results on the same day, after a gruelling field camp. I was devastated that my lifelong dream was shattered.”
A DIFFERENT PATH
Despite his disappointment, Dr Yang refused to give up on his future. In 2006, he enrolled in the National University of Singapore (NUS), eventually graduating with a Bachelor of Science (Honours) in Life Sciences (Biomedical Sciences) in 2010. While pursuing his undergraduate degree, he developed an interest in medicine, as he wanted to use his scientific knowledge to help others.
Following an 18-month stint at the Ministry of Health as an assistant manager in surveillance – where he learnt to appreciate the unique characteristics of the Singapore healthcare eco-system and the challenges faced by frontline healthcare workers – Dr Yang applied for enrolment at Duke-NUS Medical School. This was his second attempt, after he was turned down in 2011.
Thankfully, his determination paid off, and he was successfully enrolled in the school in 2012. 
“I wanted to practise medicine locally, and felt that being in a Singapore medical school that offers clinical postings in public hospitals was the best way to immerse myself in the local healthcare culture. Furthermore, Duke-NUS is the only graduate medical school in Singapore,” said Dr Yang.
STEEP LEARNING CURVE









Studying at Duke-NUS has proven to be a rewarding experience for Dr Yang. While there, he discovered his passion for surgery. “I enjoy the challenge of combining anatomical, physiological and pathological knowledge with surgical skills to treat patients,” he shared.
However, the journey to becoming a surgeon was not easy.
“I entered the General Surgery Residency Programme relatively early in my training, and faced a steep learning curve initially. I had to read up extensively on surgical conditions and how to manage them,” said Dr Yang.
It wasn’t all technical learning at Duke-NUS. Dr Yang also appreciated the other aspects of his education, which included communication skills. “Duke-NUS taught us things like how to break bad news to others. These are very useful to junior doctors as we engage patients and their families and partner them in their care journey,” he said.
The young doctor also got to hone his leadership skills at Duke-NUS. Dr Yang was class president from his first year until he graduated in 2016. Besides being involved in student activities, he also organised teaching sessions and maintained a surgery interest group that was started by his seniors.
One experience that stood out for Dr Yang is a study trip to Duke University’s home campus in Durham, North Carolina during his third year at Duke-NUS. Here, he took a transplant elective that saw him learning from experienced surgeons, attending a conference and participating in organ transplant surgeries.
AN OPEN MIND CAN OPEN DOORS
Today, Dr Yang is a general surgery resident in SingHealth, where his days are filled with patient appointments, surgeries and evening briefings.
While his work has become more challenging, he derives great satisfaction from helping his patients. He certainly does not regret the unexpected direction his life has taken.
“Nothing worth doing is ever easy,” he said. “I have faced many setbacks, including being rejected from the Air Force and not getting accepted into Duke-NUS on my first application.
“But I realised that sometimes, as one door closes, another opens, so keep an open mind always. I would advise those interested in medicine to follow your interest, but be prepared to work very hard for it!”

As a white-collar worker, he habitually spent a lot of time slaving away at his desk, poring over the never-ending items on his to-do list.
He was now a manager after having been promoted twice, yet he was always told to “contribute more”. It reached a point where most of his waking hours were spent on work-related activities, but it never seemed enough – even when he practically lived in the office and was available online 24/7.
He fell sick frequently and noticed that his concentration was no longer the same as before – he was soon dragging his feet to work every day.







                                    

Burnout is usually seen as a consequence of a chronic stressful work environment. (Photo: StockSnap/Pixabay)



Confining himself to his desk from 7am to 10pm did little to improve his work performance. Yet, he still felt an immense pressure to do more after coming to the conclusion that his colleagues were all doing well and he was the odd one out.
He became increasingly worried that he would be laid off due to his poor performance. He went from being wide-eyed and eager to weary and worn. Dave was burnt out.
TIRED, DRAINED AND LOST ENTHUSIASM
University of California Berkeley professor emerita and American social psychologist Christina Maslach’s research on burn-out defines it as a prolonged response to chronic emotional and interpersonal stressors. It manifests in a few key aspects, through physical and emotional exhaustion, socially dysfunctional behaviour and psychological impairment, and fuels organisational inefficiency.
Like Dave, those who are burnt-out typically report feeling perpetually tired, drained and lacking in enthusiasm. Mood difficulties are common within this population, with studies reporting that up to nine in 10 of burnt-out workers meet diagnostic criteria for depression.
Many of them gradually withdraw from social activities and become increasingly isolated. Often, burnt-out workers spend more time on work but yet find that their output and morale are worse than their less-stressed colleagues.
Society has upheld the belief that “doing well in school and work equates to doing well in life”. This drive to excel, or extreme meritocracy, appears to be one of the many factors feeding a burn-out phenomenon in Singapore, but also apparent worldwide.

In 2013, one in four Singaporeans and permanent residents aged 18 to 69 reported high stress levels, an increase from one in five in 2012 based on results from the Health Behaviour Surveillance of Singapore (HBSS) by the Health Promotion Board.
AN INSIDIOUS PRESSURE TO DO MORE
The survey also highlighted a growing concern – younger members of the workforce were significantly more stressed than older workers.
The Willis Towers Watson’s 2016 Benefits Trends Survey showed 56 per cent of employers in Singapore with 70,000 full-time employees on their payroll cited stress as the top health issue for their employees.
In the same survey done in 2017, this figure grew to approximately two in three employees who reported above average to high levels of stress.
The relentless pursuit of excellence in the hope of securing success has led to the blurring of boundaries between work and personal life, such that work is now seen as the centre of many people’s life. Work-life integration is the new work-life balance.
Employees are encouraged to hustle and work relentlessly to strive for “more”, but this is a tantalising fiction; once reached, one inevitably finds that there is “even more” to work towards.
This insidious pressure to achieve is balanced against an employment market that hangs a looming threat over many workers’ heads: Should you not be able to produce results, someone better could always be found to replace you.

New York Times journalist Erin Griffith recently described the artificially glorified state of ambition in our society as having mutated from being a means to an end into a lifestyle. Mantras such as “Don’t stop when you’re tired, stop when you’re done” also bolster assumptions that employees are only valuable insofar as they are productive.
In summary, burn-out operates on a vicious cycle in our society perpetuated by factors including poor organisational culture, unrealistic expectations of workers’ productivity, role ambiguity and lack of recognition and management. This leads to a feeling of a lack of control over one’s situation that, over the long term, drives workers towards burn-out.
RECOGNISING BURN-OUT
We have to start recognising burn-out earlier so that we can take steps to help those who have found themselves in those doldrums.
Physical signs often include exhaustion or fatigue and somatic problems (e.g. neckaches, backpain). Those who suffer from it also have a lack of motivation, experience more negative emotions (e.g. anger, frustration, irritation) and have cognitive difficulties. 
They may also have increased conflict with others and engage in unhealthy habits (e.g. increased smoking, drinking, or binge-eating). These symptoms often cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

Individuals can take action to tackle burn-out.
1. First, acknowledge the warning signs and don’t downplay symptoms. 
Individuals may take it as a sign of personal failure if they are unable to meet the constant demands of work. These lead to negative thoughts that start to get automatically activated (e.g. “I’m lousy, useless”). It is important to acknowledge the signs that it may be time to slow down before one heads into the danger zone.
2. Second, take a step back to return to basics. 
Maslow’s hierarchy of needs posits that basic needs (e.g. food, water, rest, safety) should be fulfilled prior to psychological needs (e.g. relationships, accomplishments) and self-fulfilment (e.g. self-actualisation, fulfilling one’s potential). 
Following on from this, we need to ensure that even when the demands of work are high, we maintain good habits in these areas. Sleep, proper nutrition and hydration are pivotal to helping the body and our nervous system recalibrate.  
3. Third, take control and prioritise. 
The numerous tasks that our jobs necessitate often obscure our vision regarding core values that are important and meaningful to us. 
Prioritising involves making decisions regarding time management and tasks. It may seem that everything on our to-do list needs to be done now and with the highest urgency, leading us to push ourselves ever harder in pursuit of clearing our entire list today. 
A better approach could be to evaluate tasks and prioritise those more pressing, using colour-coding systems to help with visualising this.
4. Fourth, allocate time for self-care. 
We are more resilient and better equipped to handle stressors when we are feeling our best both physically and emotionally. Take short breaks during the day and get involved in activities outside of work that energise you. Recognise the importance of self-care and the need to decompress and unwind.

5. Fifth, communicate and engage. 
Rather than isolating yourself, research has highlighted the importance of feeling supported. Sharing what and how you feel with fellow colleagues or friends is an important step in creating a supportive environment for yourself. 
Developing strong relationships and having people you can rely on is crucial in preventing burn-out.  
WHAT ORGANISATIONS CAN DO TO PREVENT BURN-OUT
Although individuals can make certain habit changes to prevent burn-out, the onus is on organisations to recognise the importance of workplace health and build workplace cultures conducive to their employees’ physical and mental health.
With eight in 10 Singaporeans aged between 25 to 64 forming our workforce, effective workplace health and mental wellness promotion programmes may reduce modifiable risk factors towards this illness. 
The Workplace Mental Health Investment Guide from the Health Promotion Board contains resources on how organisations can implement accessible and effective programmes.
In fact, the National Workplace Safety and Health Research Agenda for Singapore (2018-2020) published by the Workplace Safety and Health Institute revealed that organisational politics, workload and lack of support were the top three factors contributing to workplace stress.
Ultimately, organisations should not lose sight of the largest piece in the puzzle – engagement.  Indeed, organisations should tread cautiously and strive to achieve a balance between increasing productivity and deleteriously endorsing a hustle culture.

Organisations should see their employees as the soul of their company, rather than resources to be expended at their disposal.
For Dave, the good news is he was able to recognise that his behaviours were veering into unhealthy patterns and sought help early. Through his psychotherapy sessions, Dave was able to see how his unhelpful thinking patterns and behaviours perpetuated a vicious cycle.
Dave now sets daily alarms and reminders to leave work at a designated time to begin re-engaging with hobbies he previously enjoyed (e.g. catching a movie, going for a jog) or catching up with his friends outside of work.
He has learnt how to prioritise the tasks that are assigned to him, complete them within the given timeframe and communicate effectively with his superiors if he is unable to do so.
He shared that all these helped him to “feel alive again”.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/advertorial/on-a-mission-for-mental-health-11422336,The Duke-NUS grad who's on a mission for mental health - CNA,18/04/2019,"At the age of 25, Dr Cecilia Kwok was one of the older students at Duke-NUS Medical School. While she initially found it hard to make the adjustment from working as a research assistant to becoming a full-time student, she was able to persevere because, as she says, “being a doctor has always been my dream”.
Now 37, the associate consultant at Singapore General Hospital’s (SGH) psychiatry department studied at Raffles Junior College before heading to Davidson College in the United States in 2001. Two years later, she enrolled at Central Queensland University in Australia, graduating in 2005.
Dr Kwok, a Singaporean, first worked as a lab technician, and then a research assistant, at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine’s Department of Paediatrics.
“I conducted research in childhood leukemia, looking into ways of detecting very low levels of cancer cells in the blood and bone marrow,” she said.
“While I was working as a research assistant, I was offered an opportunity to embark on a PhD in the research I was doing. However, I was determined to pursue my earlier goal of becoming a medical doctor and I rejected the offer and instead applied to Duke-NUS.”
In 2007, after eagerly waiting for the school to open, she enrolled at Duke-NUS as part of its pioneer cohort of medical students. “I think being a mature student, in terms of experience if not in age, is an asset in medicine. It helped me understand patients better,” she reflected, adding that her most memorable experiences of medical school came from her team.
Said Dr Kwok: “We studied together and argued with one another. While we learnt medicine, we also learnt to work together as a team.”
DELVING INTO MENTAL HEALTH
Dr Kwok drew deep from her own experiences when it came to choosing her specialty, psychiatry.
She explained: “I struggled with some problems in university that derailed the path I had envisioned for myself, and it made me realise how important mental health is. This explains my interest in adolescent and young adult psychiatry.”
Dr Kwok conducts research at SGH on subjects such as eating disorders among young adults and the mental health of junior doctors. She also works with the SGH Burns Centre on psychiatric trauma in burn patients.
Dr Kwok is heartened that her juniors at Duke-NUS are now championing mental health awareness through the “I’m STEADY Lah” project. In collaboration with other healthcare organisations, this community service project aims to promote public awareness and tackle social stigma of mental health issues among young adults in Singapore.
As a visiting associate consultant at KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital’s Department of Psychological Medicine, Dr Kwok coaches students in the course of her work, and hopes that her intervention can help them continue successfully on their chosen life paths.
Whether she is treating patients or doing research, she believes that her education at Duke-NUS has taught her to focus on what is most important – people.
“What I remember most about medical school are several inspiring and amazing tutors from various disciplines who taught me to see the person behind the patient,” she said.

ON A MISSION
After graduating from Duke-NUS in 2011, Dr Kwok embarked on charity work in the region. She has been to Cambodia twice with Project Sa’Bai, a student-led medical overseas community involvement project.
Last year, she went to Cox’s Bazar, a town on the south-east coast of Bangladesh, with the Singapore Red Cross. She is also involved in the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Center, which trains healthcare professionals in psychiatric interventions for landmine victims.
Said Dr Kwok: “My charity work started as a way to expose myself to different environments while helping those in need. However, in the process, I found myself – who I am, what my values are. I gained much more than I gave.”
For those who are interested in taking up medicine, Dr Kwok said it is important to be sure of what you want.
“It is an arduous journey, both physically and mentally,” she said. “If it is your dream, do apply. Duke-NUS gave me my dream.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/helicopter-parenting-unhappy-controlled-children-teenagers-uk-11293524,Commentary: Helicopter parenting has caused British teenagers to be unhappy - CNA,05/03/2019,"YORK: Children growing up in the UK are said to be some of the unhappiest in the industrialised world. 
The UK now has the highest rates of self harm in Europe. And the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children's ChildLine Annual Review lists it as one of the top reasons why children contact the charity.
Children’s mental health has becomes one of British society’s most pressing issues. A recent report from the Prince’s Trust highlights how increasing numbers of children and young people are unhappy with their lives, sometimes with tragic consequences.
This is a generation of young people that has been labelled as “snowflakes” – unable to handle stress and more prone to taking offence. 
They are also said to have less psychological resilience than previous generations. And are thought to be too emotionally vulnerable to cope with views that challenge their own.
Social media likely plays a part in all this. Studies show nearly three quarters of 12 to 15-year-olds in the UK have a social media profile and spend an average of 19 hours a week online. 
After all, this is the Facebook generation – and never before have children grown up with such a daily bombardment of images, products and messages.
But there is also another factor at play – a factor much closer to home. 
In the book ""Taming Childhood?"" it put forward the argument that children and young people may indeed have less resilience than previous generations, but argue this is because they have fewer opportunities to develop it. The reason for this is that childhood has become tame.

THE 'DANGERS' OF CHILDHOOD
Childhood these days, is often seen by parents to be fraught with danger. Not only is there issues with where children can play, who they can talk to and what they should and shouldn’t be doing, but the internet has opened up a whole new set of problems that parents must try and police.
Children’s lives are being stifled. No longer are children able to spend time with friends unsupervised, explore their community or hang around in groups without being viewed with suspicion. 
Very little unsupervised play and activity occurs for children in public spaces or even in homes – and a children’s spare time is often eaten up by homework or organised activity.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
This is further impacted by the way children are taught in schools and how pressure to succeed has led to a taming of education. But if children are never challenged, if they don’t ever experience adversity, or face risks then it is not surprising they will lack resilience.
TAKING CONTROL 
This is not the consequence of one particular change or development, nor is it purposeful. In many ways the stifling of children’s experiences is often wrapped up in ideas about what is best for children, or what it means to be a good parent.

This can be seen in approaches to safeguarding which seek to remove all risks from children’s lives. Or in approaches to parenting where adults take over decision making and restrict what children can do. This ultimately means children have fewer opportunities to engage, explore, and challenge their world.
Ideas about good parenting, which emphasise knowing where children are and keeping them safe, combined with contemporary ideas that view children as naturally vulnerable also fails to recognise their ability to cope with situations which we, as adults, deem to be complex.
This all comes against a backdrop of increasing concern for children’s well-being. But what adults see as important for a child’s well-being and what children themselves see as being important may not be the same.
COMPETITIVE PARENTING
Children are very often seen in terms of what they will become, rather than what they are. This has led to a rise in an intensive type of parenting – often referred to as “helicopter parenting”. Studies have reported that well-being is reduced in children who experience helicopter parenting.
It may well be that the competitive nature of contemporary society contributes to parents dominating their children’s lives – for reasons that are rational to them. But in doing so they act against the long-term interests of their children.

The idea that children should not encounter risk and should be protected from everyday adversity means that parents restrict where children can go, and what they can do – especially when unsupervised. This leads to a childhood that for many children, is characterised by supervision, surveillance and a lack of any real challenges.
So rather than this being an issue with young people, this is an issue with society and parenting. 
What is clear then is that parents need to be supported rather than judged so they can feel confident in giving some level of decision making and freedom to their children.
Children also must be also viewed more as valuable to communities – so that a playground of unsupervised children is common place again. Education also needs a rethink, so that children are not under constant pressure but are enabled to be independent and resilient beings once more.

‘TEARING UP A HOLE IN THEIR HEART’
For this group of people, clearing away their things collected over years and decades, is akin to tearing a hole in their heart.
Having to decide whether to toss out items involves opening up long buried, forgotten but unresolved issues. Leaving these items in the bin creates an emotional vacuum in their lives, which was previously spatially filled by their hoard.
From my experience dealing with hoarders, many of them have said it would be easier to cut off their hands than ask them to throw away these seemingly useless items, as the distress, frustrations and anxieties evoked are so much more painful and debilitating. 
In extreme cases, some are paralysed by so much fear and doubt, that even a simple decision of throwing away an item when they already have so many of the same sort of things, can be monumentally difficult, because they fear regretting throwing away the ""wrong"" item.
It’s like asking them to die, patients with some of the worst cases of hoarding I have seen say. Some have described how their minds went blank, rendering them unable to think or decide what to throw away.
Others say that they experience difficulty breathing and feeling as though their hearts will stop beating, as if a crushing sensation is coming over their chest, and a myriad extremely distressing physical symptoms that only go away if they are left alone with their hoard.

And if the hoard was forcibly decluttered, I have found that as a vacuum demands to be filled, so too will the emptiness in the hoarder's heart and home demand to be filled with even more stuff.
To these hoarders, their hoard has become a way to fill the emptiness in their lives, where they tenaciously cling on to past glories, achievements and relationships through their trove.
A NEW LEASE OF LIFE FOR THEMSELVES
I recall an electrical engineer who started hoarding old CRT television sets, claiming that he would repair them and get them working again, and then sell or donate them, so that they would have a new lease of life.
However, he never got around to fixing these TV sets, but remained obsessed with their collection. After spending some time with him, we realised he only started hoarding after he retired. It wasn’t the television sets he was trying to give a new lease of life but himself, in proving that he was still useful.
Other hoarders I know continue to hoard as their clutter becomes the only physical link to a past already lost. To discard the hoarded items would be be the final ""nail in the coffin"" for that relationship.
An auntie I came across resisted vehemently the clearing away of a dining table set, which she had bought from a neighbourhood furniture store.
The store, however, had since closed down many years ago but keeping this dining table kept the furniture store going in her mind, despite her not being particularly close to the people who ran that furniture store.
Another patient I came across was an elderly widow, who would dutifully collect the newspaper every morning and keep them, even though she was illiterate, and could not read the newspapers herself.

She resisted greatly clearing them away, because it was her husband's habit to read the newspapers every morning, and this was her usual routine for the past many years. And in maintaining this routine of hers, she was trying to maintain her relationship with her departed husband.
FUNCTIONAL HOARDERS
However, not all hoarders collect stuff for sentimental reasons. Most hoard items which they feel are still useful, or can be useful if they just put some work into them.
Others say they wish to avoid creating waste, often remarking how wasteful it is to throw such a good item away, even though it may be damaged beyond repair. In fact, many hoarders do not really have a reason why they hoard.
Another hindrance that prevents hoarders from decluttering is this: That over the years, they have gone to extremes to maintain their hoard that they may have caused seemingly irreparable rifts with their family and loved ones. To ask them to give up their hoard would be impossible, as the hoarder had sacrificed ties with family and friends for this hoard.
Hoarding affects not only the person who hoards, but also the relationships of the hoarder as well.
One of my patients was depressed and had a low sense of self-esteem and self-worth. It was only after therapy and treatment that I found out her mother was a hoarder, and that she had been punished by her mother when she was young for throwing away plastic bags. So my patient felt that her value in her mother’s eyes was worse than a few dirty plastic bags. 
NOT ONLY THE OLD HOARDS
It might seem like only seniors hoard, going by media reports and television shows of cases involving elderly folks. That is not so. Based on the Institute of Mental Health’s cases, hoarding has no age preponderance, and start outs when patients are young.

But with time, the longer you hoard, the bigger and more spectacular your hoard becomes, thus garnering some negative publicity that seems to indicate that hoarding is more prevalent in the elderly. 
A COMMUNITY NEEDED
Hoarding is particularly difficult to handle, as it is a protracted and chronic condition, which we know very little about. The most important advice Marie Kondo gives with regards to clearing stuff is not to buy so much stuff, in an age of plenty and excess, but this is an inclination many of us have.
For the hoarders however, the problem is not excess, but rather, loss, and the hoarding of items to fill that loss. So it is not enough to give them some pills or send them for  counselling and believe they will miraculously stop their hoarding behaviour.
An entire community needs to be involved, to be more understanding, to be more tolerant, to engage and mend these rifts between friends and family, so that the emotional support for the hoarder can be present.
An entire community must be there to assist in the decluttering, and fill up the vacuum that is created when the hoard is decluttered, by engaging the person in more meaningful activities so that he or she will have less time to go out and collect items, by accepting the person back into the community, so that their self-worth is not determined by their hoard, but rather, by who they really are.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/millennials-tired-no-sleep-exhausted-the-burntout-generation-11178398,"Commentary: Millennials, the burnout generation - CNA",04/02/2019,"MILTON KEYNES: In a popular BuzzFeed article, Anne Helen Petersen describes how millennials (people born between 1981 and 1996) became “the burnout generation”. She describes some of the stark consequences of edging towards burnout and identifies what she calls “errand paralysis”, marked by a struggle to do even simple or mundane tasks.
Many of the factors contributing to this burnout are rooted in the challenging job and economic conditions that millennials face, according to Petersen. She also describes “intensive parenting” as a contributing factor, because millennials have been relentlessly trained and prepared for the workplace by their parents. 
They have internalised the idea that they need to be working all the time or engaging in the never-ending pursuit of self-optimisation.
LIKE WORK BURNOUT
Millennial burnout has a lot of similarities with regular burnout, otherwise known as work burnout. Burnout is a response to prolonged stress and typically involves emotional exhaustion, cynicism or detachment, and feeling ineffective. 
The six main risk factors for work burnout are having an overwhelming workload, limited control, unrewarding work, unfair work, work that conflicts with values and a lack of community in the workplace.
People who have to navigate complex, contradictory and sometimes hostile environments are vulnerable to burnout. 
If millennials are found to be suffering higher levels of burnout, this might indicate that they face more problematic environments. It is quite possibly the same stuff that stresses everyone, but it is occurring in new, unexpected or greater ways for millennials, and we haven’t been paying attention.
For example, we know that traditional social comparison plays a role in work burnout. For millennials, social competition and comparison are continually reinforced online, and engaging with this has already been shown to be associated with depressive symptoms in young people.

Even if you avoid social media, using technology and going online can be physically and emotionally exhausting. Excessive internet use has been linked to burnout at school. 
These are just some of the ways that millennials have been increasingly exposed to the same stressors that we know can negatively affect people in the workplace.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
We know very little about how millennials experience burnout. Early research suggests there are generational differences. Specifically, millennials respond to emotional exhaustion (often the first stage of burnout) differently to baby boomers (people born between 1946 and 1964). When feeling emotionally exhausted, millennials are more likely to feel dissatisfied and want to leave their job than baby boomers.
Burnout research shows that complex environments and stressors, coupled with high expectations, create the conditions for traditional work burnout. The same can be said for the millennial burnout, which draws on similar notions of perfectionism.
Perfectionists, especially the self-critical ones, are at greater risk of burnout. Naturally, the self-critical type of perfectionist works hard to avoid failure, thereby putting themselves at high risk of burnout.
RESILIENCE AS PROTECTION
A recent approach to tackling work burnout is to train people to be more resilient. This is underpinned by the assumption that highly competent people can improve their working practices to avoid burnout. 
However, highly competent, psychologically healthy and seemingly resilient people are likely to face an increased risk of burnout.

It seems counterintuitive, but one of the earliest studies on workplace burnout showed that workers who were happier, less anxious and more able to relieve stress were more likely to develop burnout than those in a comparison group without these traits. This largely forgotten study involved air traffic controllers in the US in the 1970s; it followed over 400 of them for three years.
Most of the cohort (99 per cent) had served in the US Armed Forces, so we can expect that they had experience of extreme stress and most likely had developed resilience.
This study shows us some of the conditions for creating burnout in this seemingly high functioning and resilient group. Their work was continually becoming more complex, with new technologies being introduced, without the necessary training to use them. 
They worked long shifts without breaks and had poor environments to work in. Their hours and rotas were challenging and could be unpredictable. These characteristics probably look quite familiar to millennials and anyone working in the gig economy.
OPPOSITE EFFECT
The recent focus on training workers to avoid burnout by encouraging them to be more resilient is likely to become another stress, pressure or high ideal. It is likely that this serves to increase the risk for burnout, especially for the types of perfectionists who are highly self-critical.
The importance of our ideals, our view of what we are and should be, also shows us why labelling millennials as “snowflakes” is probably harmful.

Similarly, any intensive parenting that attempts to create resilient children may be counterproductive. This is because the core messages of intensive parenting are actually about social control and conformity, and these probably feed into children’s internal and external ideals for the future.
What we can learn from burnout trends is that work is becoming rapidly and overwhelmingly more difficult and complex. This is driving higher burnout levels in many professions and in informal workers, such as caregivers, and also, potentially, in millennials. 
The solution is to simplify complex, contradictory and hostile work and personal environments, rather than giving us all another job of training ourselves to be more resilient to these environments.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hiv-data-leaks-public-attitudes-fear-prejudice-myths-debunked-11193694,"Commentary: Public attitudes of HIV have not moved beyond narratives of fear, prejudice from early years of global epidemic - CNA",02/02/2019,"SINGAPORE: The first diagnosis of a human immunodeficiency virus or HIV infection in Singapore was made in 1985. The incidence of HIV infections has increased every year since then until 2008.
Today, the rate of new infections has stabilised and had even started to decline over the past few years, with just 434 new infections registered in 2017. A total of 7,982 Singapore residents were registered as being HIV-positive as of end-2017, of whom 6,022 remain alive today.
HIV targets a key cell that orchestrates the body’s immune response to a large number of infections and diseases. Left untreated, all infected individuals eventually succumb after a number of years in which their immune systems progressively weaken as more of these cells are destroyed until their body is unable to fight off opportunistic infections and cancers that rarely affect healthy people.
HIV is primarily spread by unprotected sexual intercourse. Other modes including contaminated needles, mother-to-child transmission and blood transfusions are rare, especially in Singapore, due to improvements in needlestick injury protocols, better antenatal care and effective antiretroviral regimens, as well as better screening of blood donors and products.
NO LONGER A DEATH SENTENCE
Marked scientific progress has been made since the start of the global HIV epidemic all those decades ago.
Although a cure or vaccine for HIV remains elusive, when treated, people living with HIV may achieve viral suppression or an undetectable viral load – meaning they do not have a measurable amount of HIV virus in their blood.
Advances in medical science, coupled with a regime of lifetime medication has reduced HIV infection from a death sentence to a chronic disease, with life expectancies close to that of an individual without the HIV virus.
More importantly, from a public health standpoint, individuals who achieve viral suppression are at virtually zero risk of spreading HIV to others.
Evidence from three large international observational cohort studies have shown that no transmission of HIV from a sexual partner with an undetectable viral load in nearly 130,000 acts of condom-less penetrative sex.
THE STIGMA REMAINS, EVEN AMONG NURSING AND MEDICAL STUDENTS
However, progress towards social acceptance and the de-stigmatisation of HIV has lagged behind scientific progress in most parts of the world, including Singapore.

Public perceptions and attitudes towards people living with HIV have not moved beyond the narratives of fear and prejudice that marked the early years of the epidemic.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
In a 2007 National Behavioural Surveillance Survey, only 54.1 per cent of 1,768 Singaporean survey respondents said they were willing to care for an HIV-infected relative, while only 22.4 per cent were willing to share a meal with an HIV-positive individual.
The results of a survey on the attitudes of 80 nursing and medical students in Singapore towards HIV were highlighted in an editorial in the Annals of the Academy of Medicine of Singapore in 2009.
37.5 per cent of respondents said they would not share a house with a person living with HIV. 34 per cent believed that it was the patient’s fault that he or she had HIV. 20 per cent would not perform surgery on a HIV-positive patient.
These and other studies suggest the stigma surrounding HIV remains prevalent in Singapore, even among professionals who might be called upon to administer care to the people they so stigmatise.
WE NEED TO MOVE BEYOND THIS NARRATIVE OF FEAR AND PREJUDICE
As a hub for healthcare excellence and innovation, Singapore is well-positioned to contribute to the global fight to eradicate HIV by eliminating new transmissions and ensuring all HIV-positive individuals have access to effective treatment.
However, we must tackle this stigma because it has very real implications for HIV transmission and prevention, and may prevent us from achieving the goal of zero new transmissions of HIV in Singapore.
HIV-related stigma is a key barrier to testing for HIV, while the internalisation or anticipation of such stigma among people living with HIV may lead to a late diagnosis of HIV, poor adherence to medication, and poor mental health outcomes.

These negatively impact HIV prevention because early diagnosis and treatment ensures earlier viral suppression, thus rendering it non-transmissible.
The Infectious Disease Act mandates that all individuals who test positive for HIV at any healthcare provider must be registered with the Ministry of Health within 72 hours of their diagnosis.
However, many fear the repercussions being on the register may have on their career prospects, and the reactions from their friends, colleagues, and family members if they were to find out about their HIV status.
MOH subsequently introduced the anonymous testing scheme in 1991 to encourage HIV testing, and there are a total of 10 designated anonymous test sites today.
In order to receive care and treatment for HIV in Singapore, however, individuals who previously tested positive anonymously will still have their HIV status registered with MOH by their healthcare providers.
The only option to avoid being on the HIV registry while undergoing treatment is to obtain the treatment overseas, a luxury few can afford.
TESTING REMAINS LOW
In spite of the availability of anonymous and affordable testing, voluntary testing rates remains sub-optimal among individuals at risk of acquiring HIV in Singapore.
Only 23 per cent of new HIV infections were detected via voluntary testing in 2017. Yet, only an estimated 72 per cent of Singaporeans who were living with HIV knew about their status in 2015, according to Senior Minister of State for Health Dr Amy Khor who highlighted this in her opening speech at the Singapore AIDS Conference in 2018.

We worry that MOH’s announcement of HIV registry data leak this past week may erode the public’s trust in the integrity and confidentiality of the Singapore’s HIV registry, which in turn may further exacerbate the fear of being registered as an HIV-positive person in Singapore.
This potentially further disincentivises non-anonymous HIV testing locally, and may lead to delayed treatment among those living with HIV, with the consequence of increasing opportunities for the onward transmission of the disease.
But we also see this crisis as an opportunity for Singapore to step up efforts to de-stigmatise HIV and tackle old, hurtful narratives head on.
TACKLE OUR FEARS
The fear of being recorded in Singapore’s HIV registry speaks of a deeper anxiety over one’s own alienation from society as someone living with HIV.
It stems from an overwhelming fear of the impact of disclosure of one’s HIV status to employers, family, friends, and other loved ones. Is it any wonder concealment of one’s HIV-positive status makes more sense to those living with HIV who want to avoid the possibility of discrimination or rejection from those they love?
We must recognise that HIV does not discriminate, but people do. Our response to this incident should be one of compassion and empathy, not only for those whose data were leaked, but also for others living with HIV or the possibility that they might be HIV-positive but are too afraid to find out.
We must recognise that HIV infection is today a chronic disease of public health concern, and not a moral failing.
By doing so, we not only indirectly improve the lives of people living with HIV by destigmatising the disease, but also signal our support for the health of our loved ones and for others in our community.
It is a critical step towards the eradication of HIV in Singapore if we want to achieve that goal in our lifetime.

The AIA Beyond Critical Care policy will cover five conditions - major depressive disorders, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder and Tourette Syndrome. The mental health aspect of the policy will provide coverage up to age 75, except for Tourette Syndrome, which will be up to age 21.
Once a policyholder is diagnosed by a psychiatrist for any of the five covered mental illnesses, the mental health benefits from the coverage will be paid out, said AIA in response to Channel NewsAsia's queries.
This is the ""first step in acknowledging mental health issues as legitimate health conditions that require treatment and support"", said Ms Ho Lee Yen, chief customer and marketing officer at AIA Singapore.
Policyholders will be insured for mental illnesses at 20 per cent of their basic plan's coverage. This means that a customer who holds a basic plan with coverage of S$250,000 will be eligible to S$50,000 for mental health conditions. This payout is capped at a lifetime limit of S$150,000.
Policyholders will also be reimbursed up to S$200 for the cost of health screenings.
One in seven people in Singapore has experienced a mood, anxiety or alcohol use disorder in their lifetime, according to the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016. The study also revealed that obsessive-compulsive disorder is one of the most common mental health conditions in Singapore. 
However, the findings also showed that the majority - or about 75 per cent - of people who have experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime did not seek professional help.

His mental health deteriorated, and he reached out to his teacher to share his problems. What happened next was not what the student was expecting, recounts Dr Jamie Chiu, a clinical psychologist in Hong Kong.
“The teacher just looked at him, patted him on the shoulder and was like, ‘Ka yao ah ('keep going' in Cantonese). Work harder, and you’ll be fine. Just study more,’” narrates Dr Chiu.
“That really sums up how people think of mental health issues in Hong Kong.”







                                    

In Hong Kong, ""there's this mentality of working harder, and you'll be fine"", says Dr Jamie Chiu.



The student is one of the many teens the 32-year-old has spoken with who have felt their calls for help being ignored.
And their struggles with poor mental health and suicidal thoughts were what convinced her to develop tools that would make mental health more measurable, so that teens can get the right support.
The support she gives to at-risk youth makes her one of Channel NewsAsia’s Champions for Change, a series marking the channel’s 20th anniversary this year by celebrating 20 individuals whose imagination, talents and efforts have uplifted communities across Asia.
They include a once-successful businessman who gave up his career to start the first non-profit organisation providing financial education for children in China and an Indian social entrepreneur who collects excess food and redistributes it to starving people.
CHILDHOOD PAINS
In Hong Kong, a surge of student suicides in 2016 prompted the Education Bureau to set up the Committee on Prevention of Student Suicides to address the situation.









The committee found multiple contributory factors in students’ suicidal behaviours, including mental health issues, psychological concerns as well as school adjustment and academic stress.
And the mental health issues are on the rise, according to Dr Chiu, who says: “We lose a young person to suicide every 9.3 days. And the even scarier thing is that for every one death, we have about 50 attempts.”









It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
She herself struggled with suicidal thoughts during her childhood. Born in Hong Kong, she was a young girl when her family relocated to Ghana for a work opportunity.
Growing up, she felt a loss of identity, as she could not really speak Chinese nor identify with Ghanaian culture. “It was a very odd feeling for me to try to fit in,” she remembers.
“I was always a very tense kid, and I was just so afraid of anything that would make me stand out from the rest of the class.”
When her parents’ marriage fell apart, she and her brother moved to Australia with their mother, leading to more feelings of isolation and identity loss.
It was not until she was 16 that she realised she might be suffering from anxiety and depression – after a class discussion about different kinds of mental illnesses.







                                    

During her teenage years, she hid her suicidal thoughts behind a facade.



“Previously I was always stuck in this mindset that ‘I suck’ and ‘I’m such a loser’ because I always felt I deserved to be sad and lonely,” she says.
Once I was able to accept that it’s okay to have a mental health issue, then I was able to do things to try to improve and make myself feel better.
She ended up studying psychology and, as a clinical psychologist today, committing to helping at-risk youth – developing early intervention and assessment tools to spot mental health issues before it is too late.
“Half of all mental health disorders start before the age of 14. However, most people don’t seek help until 10 years later,” she points out.
No one should have to struggle that long before getting help, and people need to get connected to the right support sooner, she believes.
What drives her, says fiance Mark Altosaar, is her “appreciation of how difficult it is to struggle”. He adds: “For her, (it’s) unacceptable that a student has to try to commit suicide before getting noticed.”







                                    

Mr Mark Altosaar.



GAME TO TEST FOR DEPRESSION
She first started employing clinical screening surveys during her doctorate studies to measure mental health among students, but soon realised such tools did not gather the data that mattered and the questions were insensitive.
One girl remarked that it was as if the questions were “mocking” her. For example, “do you feel like you want to die? Yes, no, sometimes, often”.
“She was like, ‘Who creates check marks for this? This is me that we’re talking about – I’m not just a group of symptoms,’” recalls Dr Chiu.







                                    

An example of a questionnaire.



After that rude awakening, she and Mr Altosaar brainstormed for more effective assessment tools.
Together they designed a video game called Eat It All Lemmy, in which the goal is to feed a character food in different forms and see how much it can eat before the food runs out.
The character’s tastes changes, and the player must figure out what it wants to eat. This game is a measurement tool for cognitive flexibility, aimed at getting a deeper understanding of the player’s executive function.
“We find that people who are depressed tend to stick with the same rule much longer – even though they're being told it’s wrong – because they're less able to think from other perspectives,” Dr Chiu explains.









The game, says Mr Altosaar, can detect whether a person is displaying cognitive patterns consistent with early signs of depression, and this could lead to early intervention.
Some hospitals and doctors started using the game as an assessment tool, and it even attracted interest from a hospital in Canada.
Many people, before they take their lives, have visited a doctor, but the signs of risk are missed, observes Mr Altosaar.
That's why I'm very excited to start putting our game into these kinds of settings, so that we can start catching people before they … end their lives.
Some schools were not keen on the game, concerned that students would have too much fun playing the game. But Dr Chiu was adamant about reaching out to these students and getting everyone talking openly about mental health issues.







                                    

Dr Chiu wants to reach out to more schools and more students.



“When you're a teenager, if your parents aren’t accessible to you, then you have no options except your school,” she says.
“If we don't empower the schools to be able to proactively support the students, then they can't get that support anywhere else.”
THEY’D RATHER TALK TO A BOT
The next tool designed by the couple, both co-founders of the Good Brain Labs and The Brightly Project, was a mental health screening programme called Know My Students.









It includes a chatbot that is able to engage with the students, creating an environment where they would feel safe to share and open up about their feelings.
If there are indications that a child is struggling, the school would be notified, to support that student. Data collected from the programme would also be useful for the school, especially if it wants to develop a mental health strategy.
For example, one school had a problem with girls engaging in self-harm, and from the data collected, Dr Chiu was able to find out the causes.
“There was a lot of bullying and isolation going on. And so the school decided to implement a friendship programme for that specific year to target that key issue,” she cites.







                                    

Dr Chiu works with schools so that they can take ownership of the data from the Know My Students programme.



But there are times she is saddened that these students are sharing much more on the tool than with their family, friends or teachers. “It’s really the human connection that can help them,” she says.
Many of these students would say that they don't have a friend and that they’re very lonely. I think that's a key aspect that we’re trying to tackle. But right now, we don't have a solution to that.
The stigma of mental illness is also still an issue.
“There was one time when I was working with the teachers on how to … talk to the kids if they’re struggling, and one of the teachers was saying, ‘It’s only happening because these kids aren’t tough enough,’” she cites.
“At that moment, it took all of my efforts just to stay calm and controlled.”









Seven schools in Hong Kong are now using Know My Students, which has also gained the interest of schools overseas.
But Dr Chiu is not satisfied with what she has achieved. She is now thinking about wearable technology to track attributes linked to mental illness, from heart rate to diet.
“I want to make sure that a young person's first contact with mental health support isn’t after they've tried to kill themselves,” she says.
“It comes from first making mental health more measurable and also by us reaching out to the kids who are struggling, rather than having them to come forward to ask for help … That's how we can make a difference.”

As the holiday season gets into full swing, many of us feel uplifted by the festivities happening all around us. Christmas’ universal messages of peace, celebration and gift-giving speak to our inner child and encourage us to look beyond our present circumstances. 
A poignant example was during the carnage of World War I, in the week leading up to Christmas, French, German, and British soldiers crossed trenches to exchange season greetings and talk.
In some areas, men from both sides ventured into no man's land on Christmas Eve and Christmas Day to mingle and exchange food and souvenirs. Men sang Christmas carols together and played games of football with one another, giving us one of the most memorable images of the truce.
A DARKER SIDE TO THE SEASON
Many in Singapore celebrate the holiday season - whether setting up a Christmas tree with decorations, shopping for presents for children, inviting friends over for meals or taking a trip down Orchard Road to view the Disney-themed light up.
It is a time for feasting, gift-giving and catching up with family and friends.
However, for some, the holiday season does have a darker side. In a study done by the American Psychological association in 2006, up to 26 per cent of people reported feeling lonely and 38 per cent felt an increase level of stress during this period.

A number also complained of other symptoms such as fatigue, irritability, sadness and anger.
Some of the stressors included preparing for meals, balancing work with increased social demands, trying to find the appropriate gifts in the midst of the a rush for gifts at the shopping mall. All while trying to create the perfect occasion for family and friends.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
In fact, for some, all this is so stressful that I know of some families who avoid this season entirely and use it as an opportunity to travel.
TRIGGERS FOR ANXIETY AND DEPRESSIVE DISORDERS
It is also easy to be lonely this season and feel isolated during gatherings. The feeling of one getting lost in the crowds is so much more starkly felt. Parties after parties can lead to ennui and feelings of hollowness.
Then, hidden at the edges of society, there are those who are alone. They may be without friends or family. They might have no home to stay and strive to make their living day by day. It is difficult to feel the joyous holiday spirit when you are struggling.
Feelings of loneliness and stress can trigger or exacerbate underlying conditions. When excessive, feelings of being stressed can become debilitating and possibly trigger anxiety or depressive disorders.

Loneliness, excessive ruminations and comparisons with others can lead to a depressive episode. Other mental health conditions like obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) may also be triggered.
While we know what loneliness and being stressed can feel like, there are also physical manifestations. Poor sleep, irritability, feeling on the edge are part of being stressed and lonely.
Anxiety disorders manifest by persistent feelings of anxiety, ranging from attacks and episodes of severe anxiety to feeling anxious all the time. They are also associated with a heightened “fight, fright, flight response”.
Sufferers also report feeling irritable and, on the edge, they may experience, tingling sensations in their peripheries, fast heart beats and rapid breathing. They may also complain of vague gastrointestinal symptoms and poor sleep.
Depressive disorders manifest by persistent feelings of low mood. 
These may be associated with low energy, poor appetite, poor concentration and memory, feelings of hopelessness as well as an inability to enjoy things. They also may have vague complaints of being in physical pain and poor sleep.
TROUBLE COPING WITH OCD
The recently released Singapore Mental Health Study 2016, OCD or obsessive compulsive disorder was highlighted as a disorder of particular concern. Singaporeans seem to have a higher prevalence of this disorder compared to the global prevalence rates.
OCD is characterised by persistent intrusive thoughts, obsessions and rituals. The sufferer feels compelled to repeat certain behaviours or rituals to assuage some anxieties or fears.
For all these conditions surveyed in the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016, the result of the symptoms is that the individual is unable to function. He or she is unable to work at their usual ability and unable to function as a wife, husband, father, mother or friend.
SIX SUGGESTIONS
I have six suggestions for those who might have trouble coping with the festive season.

First, lower your expectations. Things do not have to be perfect. Stop looking for that perfect gift or preparing that perfect dinner party. It may be cliched but it’s the thought that counts.
Second, choose your engagements. You do not have to agree to every gathering or party. Spend time with those who mean something to you.
Third, live healthy. In the midst of all the food temptations, eat in moderation. Find time to exercise. Make sure you have sufficient rest.
Fourth, recognise you are not alone. You are not the only one feeling the way you do. You do not have to be the life of the party.
Fifth, volunteer. Help others. Give not only in terms of material goods but volunteer your precious time.
Finally, seek help. It is alright to admit that you are feeling stressed, depressed or struggling with your emotions. It is alright to admit that you are struggling with thoughts of hopelessness and that life is not worth living, even in the midst of this holiday season.
Whether celebrating the season of peace and goodwill to all mankind or even as a chance to indulge in the year-end sales and food offerings, the holiday season is a joyous occasion but it can be a difficult time as well.
We should take steps to keep ourselves healthy and help those around who need some of the holiday spirit this season.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ocd-mental-health-condition-often-misunderstood-11046570,"'I thought I was going crazy': OCD, an often misunderstood mental health condition - CNA",22/12/2018,"SINGAPORE: Ms Alina has a mobile phone, but she does not turn it on. She fears that her private information is being shared.
Her first job lasted only months. She did not trust the photocopier she had to use frequently in her administrative role. 
Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, Ms Alina said: “I found it ridiculous.” But she could not stop herself.
Ms Alina who is in her 30s is not strange. She has a mental condition called Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) which she has been suffering from for the past eight years. 
WHAT IS OCD?
People with OCD experience obsessions in the form of intrusive persistent thoughts, images or urges, combined with feelings of doubt or danger, senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health Department(IMH) of Mood and Anxiety Dr Jackki Yim told Channel NewsAsia.
The recently released Second Mental Health Study found that 1 in 28 Singaporeans suffers from the condition, making it the third most common mental illness after major depressive disorder and alcohol abuse.
Dr Yim said OCD sufferers carry out compulsions in the form of repetitive physical and mental acts in order to reduce their distress or prevent the catastrophic consequence from actually coming true, she added.
""Some common obsessions are fears about the consequences of contamination, worry about harm, unwanted sexual thoughts, discomfort with asymmetry or unevenness, and need for perfection or completeness,"" she said. 
She added that some common compulsions involve checking, washing and cleaning, counting, repeating, arranging things so that they are “just right”, mental reviewing or analysing, and touching or tapping things. 
""People are diagnosed with OCD when these obsessions and compulsions take up a significant amount of their time and begin to impair their day-to-day functioning,"" she said. It was this that Ms Alina experienced. 
“I THOUGHT I WAS GOING CRAZY”
Ms Alina was fresh out of university and five months into her first job when she started experiencing issues she did not understand. 
She started to feel the need to check the copies that came out of the photocopier against the originals. It was just scanning the photocopied pages against the originals at first, but she soon found herself checking every word.
She said: “I was worried of making a mistake and the consequences that would have.” She even roped in a close friend to help. While the friend did not question her behaviour, her boss was not happy as her work inevitably suffered. She did not tell him about the issue she had.
""How do you tell someone you don't trust the photocopier?” she asked rhetorically. At the time, Ms Alina did not know she was suffering from OCD.
“I thought I was going crazy,” she said. 
AUNT NOTICED DEPLETING SOAP AND SHAMPOO 
She quit after about 10 months. Unemployed, she stayed at home, but her fears did not go away. They shifted. She became fearful that her private information was being shared. To relieve the anxiety she felt, she started washing her hands frequently, and showering for longer, which was noticed by an aunt who lives with her.
“She noticed that the soap and shampoo were depleting too quickly and came to ask me about it,” Ms Alina said. Her aunt encouraged her to seek the help of a counsellor but this did not resolve the problem.
""I remember vividly once, after washing my hands five times, I felt like something was wrong. I realised I need professional help,” she said. With her aunt by her side, she plucked the courage to seek help from IMH.
HEART “SANK” WHEN TOLD SHE HAD MENTAL CONDITION
Her heart sank when she was told she had a mental condition by the IMH psychologist. “I knew there was a stigma attached to having a mental illness,” she said.
Nevertheless, she got better with the help she received and medication.
As a next step, she was advised to try Exposure and Response Prevention (ERP) therapy. It works by deliberately exposing patients to obsessional cues, and then preventing them from engaging in the associated repetitive behaviour.
She tried it once, but was too afraid to continue with the therapy. At the time, she had landed a full-time administrative job.
Given that her condition was stable, she decided to go off her medications, which typically calmed her down. She also stopped seeing a psychologist. She learnt the hard way that she in fact was not okay. 
INTRUSIVE THOUGHTS OF SELF-HARM
She became alarmed when she started getting intrusive thoughts of harming herself, unaware that it was also a more severe facet of her condition.
She did however know she needed help. She returned to IMH. This time, with the persuasion of another psychologist, she decided to try ERP therapy. She remembers the words that got through to her.
“She told me I was on a sinking boat. It made me feel like it was time to try the treatment,” she said. The therapy involved Ms Alina attending her sessions at IMH on her own, as she had fears of doing that.
“I couldn't go on my own. I was always accompanied by my aunt or dad,” she said.
Her psychologist would take her around IMH, introducing her to the different parts of the building on Buangkok Green. By the third session, Ms Alina found the treatment was working for her.
“IMH did not seem dark, creepy and scary anymore. When I thought about IMH, the first word that came to my mind was ‘bright’,” Ms Alina said, the triumph and joy in her voice clear.
OCD OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD
Despite its high prevalence, OCD is still often misunderstood, said Dr Yim.
When OCD is used loosely and becomes synonymous with words like “clean”, “perfect”, or “organised”, it could trivialise the seriousness and complexity of the condition. 
It may seem to suggest that obsessions and compulsions are just something annoying or amusing that a person could get over. But for people with OCD, it is not simply a question of annoyance - it entails a great deal of suffering and produces extreme distress and major loss of quality of life, she said.
Dr Yim, who described OCD as a “common and treatable condition”, advised people to learn as much as possible about the condition and if they notice themselves displaying the symptoms. There are effective ways to keep OCD at bay, she said.
“However, if you have difficulty managing these symptoms and they are interfering with your daily functioning, do make an appointment to see a general practitioner,” she said.
She cautioned that when family members accommodate a patient’s OCD behaviours, they unwillingly contributing to the maintenance of OCD symptoms.
Dr Yim shared anecdotes of two challenging cases she has come across. In one, a woman who had a fear of contamination had not entered her room for eight years, sleeping instead in a cockroach-infested living room. 
In another, during therapy at a supermarket, a patient had obsessive fears that she might commit some horrific act on herself, her family members or other people. She became housebound, avoided sharp items including pens and toothbrushes, and avoided people generally, including her own young child, Dr Yim said.
“These two cases highlight the fact that the sufferings of patients with OCD can be real, crippling and disabling, and can affect the quality of life not only of a patient, but also of their families,” Dr Yim said.
She encouraged people with OCD to seek treatment early. “Although OCD cannot be cured completely, with appropriate treatments, however, a patient can learn to manage his or her OCD symptoms more effectively and thus can live a functional and meaningful life” Dr Yim said.
Ms Alina, who is currently unemployed, but coping well with her condition, had similar advice.
“It’s for you, for your health. It doesn’t matter what others think. It’s your life and your family that matter. Don’t be on the sinking boat.”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ocd-one-of-the-most-common-mental-disorders-in-singapore-11020354,OCD one of the most common mental disorders in Singapore - CNA,11/12/2018,"SINGAPORE: Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is one of most common mental health conditions here, according to findings from a nationwide study released on Tuesday (Dec 11).
The disorder affected one in 28 people in their lifetime, making it the third-most prevalent condition after major depressive disorder and alcohol abuse. The illness is commonly characterised by recurrent and persistent thoughts, impulses or images, and when severe, impedes a person's ability to function.
Younger people aged 18 to 34 were more likely to have the condition than those aged 50 and above, said researchers from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and Nanyang Technological University (NTU), citing the findings from the second Singapore Mental Health Study.
The study also found that those who had a monthly household income of between S$2,000 and S$3,999 were less likely to have the condition than those with a household income of less than S$2,000.
IMH's Professor Chong Siow Ann said that one symptom of OCD is the fear of contamination and could manifest in excessive washing. The condition causes “tremendous impairment” to a person's functioning, he said.
While the term ""OCD"" is loosely used in Singapore, and some people may even take pride in saying that they have OCD as it denotes a certain discipline, Prof Chong said that the clinical definition of the illness is different.
Such terms being loosely used could sometimes be a problem, said IMH chief executive Chua Hong Choon.
""That relates to the stigma and issue of what we understand of these disorders,"" he said.
OCD COULD START OFF MILD
Associate Professor Mythily Subramaniam also said that the 6,126 participants surveyed were asked if they had had recurring thoughts or concerns about order or symmetry, which is related to OCD.
“It’s a very neglected disorder,” said Assoc Prof Mythily. 
When it starts off, it could be mild, she said, adding that it could get worse over time, interfering with a person's life. She gave the example of a person who could start off washing his hands more frequently, but who could end up repeating the action so frequently that daily activities are interrupted and he suffers from infections. 
She gave examples of a person showering for two hours or taking an hour to wear shoelaces as signs of a person who has OCD.
Given that it could start off mild, the delay in seeking treatment by those with OCD was the longest among those who sought help for mental disorders.The estimated median number of years it took a sufferer to seek help was 11 years, compared those with other disorders such as alcohol abuse, which took four years.
Prevalence of lifetime OCD and OCD in the most recent one-year period in Singapore was higher than in South Korea, Australia and New Zealand.
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS
Overall, one in seven people in Singapore has experienced a mood, anxiety or alcohol use disorder in their lifetime, according to the study spearheaded by IMH in collaboration with the Ministry of Health (MOH) and NTU.
This is a significant increase from 2010, when the study was last done, Assoc Prof Mythily said. The recent one was initiated in 2016 and completed in one-and-a-half years.
The most common condition was major depressive disorder, experienced by 1 in 16 people.
Younger people in the 18 to 34 age group were more likely to have major depressive disorder than those aged 50 and above. Those who were divorced and separated were also more likely to experience the condition in their lifetime.
Alcohol abuse was the next most prevalent, affecting 1 in 24 people.
Other conditions that were surveyed were bipolar disorder and generalised anxiety disorder and alcohol dependence.
The 2016 study found that the majority of people, three-quarters, with a mental disorder in their lifetime, did not seek any professional help. This proportion is similar to the proportion of people who did not seek help in the 2010 study. 
However, those who sought help for their mental illness did so much earlier than what was observed in the last survey, researchers found.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teens-wary-dismissed-mental-health-help-without-parents-knowing-10752012,"Some teens, wary of being dismissed, seek mental health help without parents knowing - CNA",07/10/2018,"SINGAPORE: Some teenagers with mental health issues are seeking help without their parents' knowledge due to fears of being dismissed or a reluctance to make them worry, psychiatrists and counsellors said.
An increase in mental health public awareness could also be driving them to seek assistance, the experts said, adding that the teenagers know of the kinds of help available to them.
This comes as the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) said in September that more teens aged 10 to 19 were writing in for emotional support. In the 2017/18 fiscal year, 530 teens emailed the suicide prevention centre, a 53 per cent jump from the 347 the year before.
“Teens usually expressed their fear of being judged as well as of the reactions they may receive from family members,” an SOS spokesperson said. “Many teens feel a lack of effective communication and understanding between family members.”
Dr Ong Say How, senior consultant and chief of the department of developmental psychiatry at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), said he has observed teens who come by themselves for issues like relationship problems, academic stress and parent-child conflicts.
“Once in a while, there might be those aged 16, 17 or even 18 coming to the clinic on their own,” he told Channel NewsAsia. “Upon asking, they request not to involve their parents.”
This could be because such teens are wary of being dismissed at home, Dr Ong said. “Imagine how you would feel if your parents were upset and made comments that were not sensitive,” he added.
On the other hand, Dr Ong said they could be very protective of their parent’s feelings. “They want their parents to feel happy, so they may also exclude parents from the discussion totally,” he added.
Dr Ken Ung, a senior consultant psychiatrist at Adam Road Medical Centre who specialises in adolescent psychiatry, has also seen teens aged 13 upwards visiting his clinic alone.
One reason, he said, is that parent and child are not getting along. If that's not the case, then it could be culture.
“Even though they have a reasonable relationship with their parents, they come from families with parents who are more traditional, so they are not the types that may want to talk about feelings, emotions and problems,” he explained.
Besides these factors, Dr Ong said mental health help has also become more accessible. “Due to an increase in public mental health awareness, they are savvier right now in trying to self-help,” he added. “They know where to go.”
This is also seen at school, where students have shown a “growing awareness and willingness to seek help”, said Mdm Choy Wai Yin, guidance branch director at the Ministry of Education’s student development curriculum division.
HOW DOES TREATMENT GO?
When students reach out regarding parent-related problems, Mdm Choy said school counsellors will try to understand the student’s perspective, then help him or her understand the parents’ point of view.
“The counsellors will then work with the student to explore what he or she could do to resolve the problem and cope with the situation, before guiding him or her to develop a plan of action,” she added.
“If the safety or well-being of the student is compromised, the counsellor will contact the relevant external agencies, for example Child Protective Services, to provide further support.”
IMH’s Dr Ong said because the teens are minors, the clinic “would encourage them to inform and bring their parents along subsequently”. “Parents can help the child at home as well by applying some of the therapeutic principles that we use as clinicians,” he said.
Dr Ong pointed out that teens can also benefit from bringing their parents along by seeing their relationship improve.
“It’s also a discovery journey for some (parents),” he added. “By helping them understand their teenager, they can then take a step back, calm themselves and be able to accommodate what their teen is going through.
“With that understanding, the whole attitude changes to become more positive and nurturing.”
Adam Road Medical Centre’s Dr Ung said he would be happy to see the teens alone, as long they do not pose a danger to themselves or others, or need prescribed medicine. He would also try gaining their trust before involving parents in the equation.
“I would then say: ‘Look, maybe it’s a good idea for your parents to be involved. Why don’t I speak to them? Or we could meet together in case you’re worried they will overreact or blow up,’” he added.
TOUCH Youth Intervention (TYI), which does youth counselling and support groups for issues ranging from cyber wellness to transitional stresses, also gets hotline calls from youths who chose not to tell their parents.
But because most of them are minors, TYI senior counsellor Andrea Chan said the centre would need parental consent before starting therapy. However, counsellors would see them separately at the beginning.
“Based on the comfort level of the client, we would then decide if we would bring in the parents,” she added. “This is especially so in emotionally charged sessions where some youths might vent their frustrations on their parents.”
Nevertheless, Dr Ong said treatment would not be complete without “support from the home front”. “Usually, the teenagers would subsequently agree (to bring their parents) after a careful explanation,” he added.
WHAT CAN PARENTS DO?
At home, Dr Ong said parents can maintain healthy communication with their teens by making time for their child from a “really early” age, starting from pre-school.
“Things that are done in a very cursory or superficial manner don’t constitute quality time,” he said. “Asking about homework, have you eaten your meals, go to sleep now, shut down your computer – that kind of communication doesn’t constitute quality communication.”
Parents can also engage their teens by sharing about their own feelings or childhood experiences first. “After all, childhood, though it differs quite a lot through different generations, still share some commonalities,” he added.
“Importantly, parents should portray themselves as being open and non-judgmental. If the parents start criticising (their child’s) friends or show facial expressions that convey annoyance and irritability, the teenager will just clam up.”

Dr Ung said parents should understand that their teenagers have grown up and might not like excessive attention.
“It’s to do with trying to balance giving them a certain degree of independence and yet trying to continue to show concern,” he said, adding that parents can ask questions like “how’s your day” or “how are things” as an open invitation to share.
“But if the child is hesitant or reticent, then they should accept it and not push the matter. They should give some space so they can be there, ever present in the background.
“And if the teen knows that, then it will be very helpful.”

This would raise greater awareness of the needs of people with mental health issues, said President Halimah Yacob on Thursday (Oct 4) at the first Global Summit for Mental Health Advocates. 
""We can better support them in their journey of recovery and reintegration,"" said Mdm Halimah, who was speaking at the Grassroots Club in Ang Mo Kio.
President Halimah noted that a 2017 study by the National Council of Social Service found that one in two respondents believed that those with mental health conditions should not be given any responsibility.
More than half also said they were not willing to live near or work with a person with mental health conditions.
In her address, she encouraged voluntary welfare organisations supporting those with mental health conditions to apply for next year's edition of the Empowering for Life Fund. 
The fund, which helps vulnerable groups find employment, is part of the President's Challenge. 
It was established in February, with the Government matching donations dollar-for-dollar up to S$10 million for the next five years.
""We should leverage the fund to empower those with mental health conditions to return to the workplace, so that they can continue to contribute to society and be meaningfully engaged,"" Mdm Halimah said. 
""I hope that companies will also respond to this call and be more open to providing equal opportunities at work for this group.""
The Global Summit for Mental Health Advocates is initiated by non-profit organisation Silver Ribbon (Singapore) and Danish pharmaceutical company Lundbeck. 
It aims to provide a platform for global stakeholders to promote mental health, and share best practices.
Speaking to Channel NewsAsia, Silver Ribbon President Ellen Lee said that the stigma against mental health in Singapore is still prevalent, despite society’s progress. 
“Unfortunately, because society has progressed so fast, many people have suffered different stresses and anxieties, resulting in different levels of depression and different types of mental challenges.”
She added that ""the formation of this alliance is very timely because around the world, people are sitting up and looking at this issue very squarely in the face"".
The two-day Global Summit for Mental Health Advocates is attended by around 280 local and overseas guests, as well as speakers and delegates. 
This year’s theme is Unite for Mental Health. The second edition of the summit will be held in October 2019 in Taiwan.
October is the month for mental health issues, with World Mental Health Day observed on Oct 10.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hyper-competitive-culture-breeding-severe-test-anxiety-among-10744150,Commentary: A hyper-competitive culture is breeding severe test anxiety among many students - CNA,29/09/2018,"SINGAPORE: Xiao Jia*, 12, came to us as she could no longer cope with an intense fear of the upcoming Primary School Leaving Examination (PSLE).
She had set out to score more than an aggregate of 250 and didn’t want to disappoint her parents.
A plan of getting into her choice school, excelling later at the O and A-Levels, getting into her choice university course, and eventually securing a good job all hinged on doing well in this first national exam.
Her fears are not uncommon among her peers, albeit of varying degrees.
PRESSURE TO PERFORM AT EXAMS
Children and adolescents in Singapore face pressures at school and at home. Other than relationship and family problems, a commonly cited issue that afflicts many of the students we see at the Institute of Mental Health is academic-based stress.
A study conducted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) found that Singaporean students were significantly more anxious about tests and grades compared to their international peers.
This intensified dread over academic performance may be due to a more competitive culture in Singapore.
The astounding story of Singapore’s success has been largely attributed to its system of meritocracy, one where the best and brightest rise to the top by their own merit and hard work, and tales of leaders emerging from humble backgrounds are largely celebrated as testimonies that the system works.  
Singapore’s system of meritocracy in our education system is still based on academic success, and Singapore has done well in that aspect. It is ranked first in the 2015 Programme for International Student Assessment conducted by the OECD, based on assessments of 15-year-olds on reading, mathematics and science.

However, despite the brilliant performance on global academic rankings, Singapore has produced proportionally fewer top-ranked scientists, inventors, entrepreneurs and business leaders. 
When Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam was asked about this by CNN many years ago by Fareed Zakaria, he replied that Singapore was an “exam meritocracy”, compared to America which was a “talent meritocracy”. 
Understandably, there is no perfect measure to gauge a multifarious concept of merit. But studies have shown academic achievement is positively correlated to later occupational performance, and remains a valid measure of merit in Singapore’s context.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Over the years, meritocracy has worked well to sieve out scholastically-inclined students, and develop them into prominent leaders and captains of industry.
This, in turn, reinforces the belief that doing well in school equates doing well in life and that conversely, doing badly comes with huge, adverse consequences. 
Many students and their parents, driven by this belief, place utmost emphasis on academic achievement.
TOLL ON STUDENTS’ MENTAL HEALTH
A competitive education system has put our students scholastically ahead of others globally, with benefits to individuals. 
Studies have shown moderate amounts of stress and anxiety can motivate and encourage people to work harder and attain better performance. 
Stress is an inevitable part of life, and exposing students to a reasonable amount in school builds resilience that will serve them well in their adult lives.
But an overly competitive culture can be detrimental for students’ mental health. High expectations can lead to excessive stress and anxiety, especially during major examinations that have perceived consequence for one’s future, such as the PSLE, and the O-, N- and A-Level national examinations.

In psychology, stress is the body’s reaction to difficult situations, real or perceived. This “fight or flight” stress response, evolutionarily developed to enable humans to escape from physical danger, manifests as physiological symptoms such as a quicker heart rate, hyper-ventilation and muscle tension. 
While there are far less opportunities to meet physical or predatory threats in the modern society of Singapore, the stress response still remains in us. 
For some students who place utmost importance on academic success, performing “poorly” in examinations could represent a form of failure or threat. This could potentially trigger a stress response in some students as they try to meet their expectations.
In extreme cases, prolonged stressful situations associated with tests and examinations leads to the development of performance anxiety in some students.
Some suffer intense emotional symptoms like fear, anger, depression or helplessness, while others exhibit behavioural symptoms like avoidance or irritability or cognitive impairment that include racing thoughts, minds going blank, difficulty concentrating and negative thinking.
People also experience rapid heartbeat, shortness of breath, nausea, diarrhoea or excessive sweating. In severe cases, test anxiety can lead to a full-blown panic attack, crippling the person with a sudden onset of intense fear and uncontrollable physical symptoms.
There are no exact causes of test anxiety, but studies have found that contributory factors include low academic self-concept, fear of failure, feelings of helplessness, and parental as well as teachers’ pressure on students – that may be intensified by a hyper-competitive culture.
Worse, test anxiety as a disorder inevitably leads to poor performance, as the distressing symptoms inhibit a student’s ability to absorb, retain and recall facts and information, and can lead to other mental health disorders such as panic disorder or depression.

We tend to underestimate the effects but anxiety and mood disorders are highly prevalent in Singapore, and carry a high disease burden due to the associated decreased work productivity and significant loss of function.
In cases when test anxiety becomes so severe that it develops into a psychiatric disorder and affects the student's ability to function significantly, professional help might be needed.
HELP NEEDED
Parents can help their children by moderating their own expectations, and focus on their children's efforts rather than their results. Regular and open dialogues about school and academic stress, and being empathetic towards their difficulties without making critical judgements can aid.
Ensuring that the basic health needs of our children, such as getting enough sleep, maintaining a balanced diet and exercising regularly, are met can go a long way. If necessary, a school counsellor can provide extra support.
However, it may be more useful to attenuate the development of test anxiety and other mental health disorders at a macro level. 
A balanced approach where academically brilliant students are recognised and groomed, while the less academically inclined ones are supported and encouraged to pursue their interests based on their strengths, will be optimal.
We have already seen positive moves in this direction. There has been a shift in Singapore’s education system away from the narrow focus of grades and academic achievements. There were no final examinations for Primary 1 students since 2013, and the PSLE will do away with aggregate scoring from year 2021.

School rankings are no longer released to the public; and media reports have shifted from highlighting top scorers in national examinations to celebrating the achievements of students who overcame the odds and performed well.
FOCUS ON WELL-BEING
The idea that academic achievement is a necessary ingredient to obtain lifelong success has become a long-held but unhealthy belief ingrained into our culture. It is a momentous task to shift this national mindset to one that is more encompassing, more accepting and less competitive.
Yet, as Albert Einstein once wrote: 
If you judge a fish by its ability to climb a tree, it will live its whole life believing that it is stupid.
There are many students who excel in other varied areas, such as arts, sports or music, and deserve to be recognised for these non-academic abilities.
At the same time, expectations should be set according to individual abilities, with appropriate cajolements to push our children to reach their maximum potential, but not to the point where it becomes corrosive to their mental well-being.
Meritocracy has driven Singapore well, scholastically, and economically. It has played a large part in contributing to our nation’s success, and will continue to do so. 
However, it is also important to place emphasis on well-being and prioritise the mental health of students who are the future pillars of Singapore society.

ROAD TO RECOVERY
Xiao Jia’s case has a happy ending for now. She was able to communicate her feelings of performance anxiety and high self-expectations to her parents and the treatment team during therapy sessions.
Her parents responded well and constantly assured her that what mattered more were her efforts and not the final aggregate or whether she eventually got into her choice school.
To help her cope with her anxiety, she was taught calming techniques as well as encouraged to embrace a positive mindset that could help relieve anxiety during examinations.
That year, Xiao Jia sat for her PSLE and successfully enrolled into a secondary school of her choice.

In the 1970s, visual artist Choo Keng Kwang took a young boy of 10 who was painting scenes of the Singapore River under his wing, giving the budding artist tips.
That boy, however, disappeared from public view, his dream of becoming an artist unfulfilled.
He was diagnosed with schizophrenia and, for over three decades, has been warded in the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), where he has painted the Singapore he remembered from behind its walls.
But bit by bit, his extraordinary works gained notice, and this month, he took another step towards realising his long-awaited dream, with an exhibition of some 30 pieces of his works.







                                    

Most of the paintings on exhibition are of the historical Singapore River, Victoria Memorial Hall and open-air markets of Chinatown. (Photo: Jeremy Long)



And on Thursday, for the first time in four decades, mentor and former student met – and fell into that old relationship, almost as if no time had passed at all.
“Do you still draw, teacher?” Mr Sim, 50, asked shyly in Mandarin.
“Do I look like I can?” Mr Choo, 87, replied with a smile from his wheelchair. He is one of Singapore's first-generation artists, best known for his oil paintings, which can command six-figure sums.
And after all these years, he remains a hero to the younger man, who remembers his rendition of pigeons and the Singapore River.







                                    

Upon hearing that Mr Choo Keng Kwang had arrived, Mr Sim hotfooted it to his mentor and shook hands. (Photo: Jeremy Long)



The surprise meeting was organised by Goshen Art Gallery, where the exhibition-cum-sale of Mr Sim’s pieces – some never before seen in public – is on until the end of the month.
This comes on the heels of his first – and smaller – art display in July, which was for an exhibition highlighting the importance of mental health, organised by Temasek's staff-driven volunteer initiative T-Touch.
LEARNING FROM THE BEST

Mr Sim had always dreamt of showcasing – and selling – his art. But as people milled about Goshen’s showroom, his attention was focused only on his mentor as Mr Choo pored over his paintings and gave him advice.

He should “relax his brush strokes” and not clutter the backgrounds of his paintings. “To be an artist, one shouldn’t be in a rush,” Mr Choo said as his ward hung on to his every word.
He even compared Mr Sim’s tense style to tormented Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh, who had been confined to a French asylum and, similar to Mr Sim, spent many days painting in the asylum gardens.
Mr Sim’s sister, Cindy, recalled how her brother showed promise as a painter since very young, and their father took him frequently to the Singapore River to practise.
Some of the eminent local artists there every Sunday were Mr Choo, Mr Ong Kim Seng and the late Ong Chye Cho.

“He was there the whole day. He had no one at home to learn (painting) from, so he went to the Singapore River to look for (them),” said Ms Sim.
She added that he often spoke of Mr Choo as a talented artist who was willing to share his knowledge.
Goshen showcases Mr Choo’s pieces regularly and hopes to do the same for Mr Sim, whose paintings on show are mostly of the historical Singapore River, Victoria Memorial Hall and open-air markets of Chinatown.
The art gallery’s co-founder Faith Lum-Yu said the exhibition was to fulfil Mr Sim’s dream and help him reintegrate into society.

His works are selling for between S$1,500 and S$7,600, and part of the proceeds will go towards the gallery’s social enterprise ArtSE, which provides employment for individuals with special needs, especially artists.
Ms Lum-Yu had earlier offered him a job with ArtSE and, together with his sister, is working with the IMH on this possibility.
Mr Sim's exhibition is on until Sept 30, from 11am to 8pm, at 7 Fraser Street, #01-04, S(189356). Or for more details, email Ms Lum-Yu at Faith@artse.sg / Shan@goshenartgallery.com

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/world-alzheimers-day-dementia-signs-early-onset-age-detection-10667054,Commentary: Hard to grapple with dementia when early signs are often neglected - CNA,21/09/2018,"SINGAPORE: The World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that dementia currently affects 47 million people worldwide resulting in US$818 billion (S$1.12 trillion) in cost, which is mostly borne by the families of those affected. It is also the seventh leading cause of death in the world.
Last year, the WHO called for a global action plan on the public health response to dementia.
In Singapore, one in 10 elderly above the age of 60 has dementia, according to a Well-being of the Singapore Elderly (WiSE) study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health published in 2015.
HELP IDENTIFY DEMENTIA EARLY
Dementia is a group of disorders which interferes with how the brain normally functions, with the most common and well-known being Alzheimer’s disease.
The severity of problems faced by a person with dementia directly correlates with the degree of damage to the brain cells.
So, identifying this condition early through a general practitioner or polyclinic doctor should become one of the priorities for an individual or their family. Early identification of dementia can help slow down the progression of the condition.
In the early stages, patients can make decisions, allowing healthcare professionals to involve them in the planning of their future care, address legal matters like making a will and drawing up a lasting power of attorney. 
The latter enables the family to act as a legal deputy to safeguard the patient’s personal welfare, property and affairs as the condition progresses and he or she is unable to make decisions.

The medical community can also work with patients and caregivers on the support they require and link them up with resources in the community that they can tap on, like day care centres.
But most people with the illness do not come to medical attention as they are not aware that they have a problem, and may be contented with their situation. Some are just unwilling to go to the doctor for a check-up.
Their reluctance to accept help can cause a lot of stress for caregivers.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
DEMENTIA CAN’T BE PREVENTED, BUT CAN BE DELAYED
I wish I could say that dementia can be prevented but the short answer is no, because the single most important risk factor for developing the disease is increasing age.
Compared to elderly aged 60 to 74 years, the likelihood of dementia for those aged 75 to 84 years is 4.3 times higher, and for those 85 years and above, it is 18.4 times higher.
But several things can delay the onset or slow down the progression.
Advice given for chronic diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure and cholesterol holds good for dementia as well. This includes adopting a healthy lifestyle with regular mental and physical exercises and a well-balanced diet, stopping smoking, reducing alcohol intake, reducing life stressors and improving the quality of social relationships.
It is also important to go for health checks at least once a year even if no medical problems are encountered and more frequently as suggested by the doctor for existing illnesses.







                                    

According to the World Health Organisation, dementia affects some 47.5 million people worldwide -- with 7.7 million new cases every year. (Photo: AFP/Sébastien Bozon)




BEWARE DEPRESSION, PARANOIA, ANXIETY
People who suffer from dementia will become increasingly dependent on family members. They can develop depression and other psychological problems that include paranoia and anxiety.
They may also develop behavioural problems such as agitation, aggression, disinhibition, shouting and sleep disturbances.
If such behaviours are present then family members need to bring them to the attention of the doctors as early as possible as these symptoms tend to progress and can cause caregivers more stress. 
Fortunately, most can be effectively managed with a package of care which includes medication, day care, structured routines and home help to assist in activities of daily living. 
KEEP DEMENTIA PATIENTS ACTIVE
All is not lost when someone is diagnosed with dementia. Keeping people with dementia occupied and engaged can help maintain their quality of life.
Learning a new skill can be difficult for them, so caregivers should encourage them to do things they are familiar with and keep up with daily activities.
If they used to enjoy doing crossword puzzles, get them to pick it up again. They may not be able to do complex puzzles like before, but they can try their hand at simpler ones.
Having a daily routine and sticking with it will also help both the patient and caregiver. Adapting to changes in routine requires the use of short-term memory, which is impaired for those with the condition so they’ll have a problem coping and may feel distressed and confused.

A LITTLE CAN GO A LONG WAY
Dementia is a chronic illness which progresses over several years, so timely support and assistance to the caregiver is of vital importance.
The patient may eventually need 24-hour care in a nursing home but this does not imply that the family has failed, but more a recognition that their care needs have progressed beyond what can be provided at home.
Even if the patient resides in a nursing home, this does not prevent the family from visiting and collaborating with the staff in providing optimum care.  
The world is grappling with the problems of an ageing population including dementia.
There are international collaborations in research to find a drug to prevent dementia. Governments are building dementia-friendly communities. Hospitals are providing early diagnosis, treatments and advice on optimum care, and welfare organisations are providing help, advice and support to patients and caregivers.
However, each one of us can also make our own little contribution in combating this disease. In the end what really matters is the quality of life one has.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ns-mental-health-issues-nsmen-servicemen-10636712,"Enough help for servicemen with mental health issues, experts say, but some still find NS a challenge - CNA",15/09/2018,"SINGAPORE: While the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) has in place sufficient measures to detect and help pre-enlistees with mental health issues, experts said some might still slip through the cracks and face difficulties during National Service (NS).
Defence Minister Ng Eng Hen, in a written reply to Parliament in August, revealed that over the past five years, about 4 per cent of each NS cohort has been downgraded for mental health issues.
According to Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) figures, about 15,000 men enlist for NS each year.
“The majority were downgraded after the pre-enlistment check-ups before commencing their NS, and therefore the prevalence of mental disorders for national servicemen reflect that of the male population in Singapore,” Dr Ng wrote.
At the pre-enlistment stage, pre-enlistees undergo a “comprehensive” medical screening – including self-declaration and parent endorsement – for psychiatric, behavioural and adjustment problems. MINDEF also works with the Health Ministry to identify those with mental health history at public hospitals.
Pre-enlistees are exempted from NS if they are deemed to have “severe mental illnesses” that prevent them from performing their NS duties. From 2005 to 2015, about 400 pre-enlistees have been exempted from NS each year.
Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Gleneagles Hospital who sees youths who face difficulties in coping with NS, said these measures are ""sufficiently stringent"".
""However, it is pertinent to note that there are no screening processes that are foolproof or 100 per cent accurate,"" he added. ""These processes are also subjective and dependent on the cooperation of the pre-enlistees and their parents.""
Dr Marcus Tan, a psychiatrist at Nobel Psychological Wellness Clinic who is trained in military psychiatry, said the measures are ""as comprehensive as the ministry can muster at this point in time"".
However, he acknowledged that there are servicemen, including those who do not declare their mental illnesses, who ""slip through the gaps"" and eventually ""encounter difficulty post-enlistment"".
STRUGGLING WITH NS
One example is 21-year-old Derrek (not his real name), who was diagnosed with major depressive disorder in primary school.
Derrek told Channel NewsAsia that during his pre-enlistment check-up, he declared his condition to the medical officer, and was eventually assigned a PES E9L9 grade. This means he was still fit to serve NS.




                        

What the various PES grades mean. (Source: Central Manpower Base website)



PES refers to the Physical Employment Standards, which according to the Central Manpower Base is assigned based on a serviceman’s medical condition and is one factor used to determine his NS vocation.
While PES A and B1 indicate suitability for combat vocations, PES E denotes suitability only for combat service support and service vocations. PES F means exemption from NS.
Derrek enlisted last October and completed one month of Basic Military Training with fellow PES E servicemen before getting posted to the Navy as an administrative assistant.
His condition, however, worsened. 
In January, about two months into his new posting, Derrek said his mental health spiralled “out of control”.
The next month, Derrek was further downgraded to a pending exemption, before being granted full exemption from NS in April.
MENTAL HEALTH AND NATIONAL SERVICE
As with Derrek, NS is a “big change for any enlistee”, said the psychiatrist Dr Lim.
“People who are suffering from mental health issues are more sensitive to changes in life, may have more difficulties coping with these changes and may take a longer time to adjust,” he added.
“Those who are unable to transit into military life may find themselves having adjustment disorders with emotional and behavioural disturbances. Some may develop anxiety disorders and depression, particularly if they are already vulnerable in some ways.”

These servicemen might also experience mood, sleep or appetite disruptions due to the change in circumstances, Dr Tan said.
“They may experience exacerbation of their conditions and will need to be monitored intently, with requisite adjustments made to their immediate operating environments as needs arise,” he added.
WHAT IS THE SAF DOING?
In another written reply to Parliament last year, Dr Ng said enlisted servicemen with mental health issues are “closely monitored while in service, and where necessary, are provided with regular medical treatment and counselling by psychiatrists, psychologists, counsellors and para-counsellors”.
The SAF has more than 1,200 of such psychiatrists, counsellors, para-counsellors and psychologists. It also draws on resources in the national healthcare system, including the Institute of Mental Health and psychiatric departments in restructured hospitals.
Besides that, unit commanders interview servicemen at “regular intervals” to check if they are under any form of stress, including emotional or psychological problems. At the formation level, dedicated psychologists help commanders manage such servicemen.
Commanders also undergo “basic training” to help them better understand mental health conditions and manage servicemen with such conditions. This includes referring them to trained professionals or restricting their access to weapons and ammunition.
For the servicemen themselves, there’s a 24-hour SAF counselling hotline.
ARE THE MEASURES ENOUGH?
But Derrek said he still found it difficult communicating his issues to his commanders during NS.
“As much as they wanted to help, they simply were not equipped as they did not understand the basics of mental health and the implications of mental illnesses,” he added.
Still, the psychiatrists Dr Tan and Dr Lim insisted that the SAF’s measures to manage servicemen with mental health issues during NS were adequate.
""The measures are adequate to address day-to-day (issues) as well as contingencies,"" Dr Tan said. ""To have this system work well, close and timely communication between the serviceman, unit superiors and each member of this team will be key.""
THE STIGMA OF MALINGERING AND EXEMPTION
However, Dr Tan urged commanders and servicemen to better understand common mental health conditions and how to manage them, while Dr Lim said the lack of mental health awareness is an issue that goes beyond the SAF. 
“The problem is really a societal one and lies in a lack of understanding of mental illnesses, whereby leaders and commanders often assume those who declare their mental health issues to be malingering,” Dr Lim explained.
In 2014, an anonymous person posted online detailing how he allegedly escaped NS by faking mental illness, prompting a MINDEF investigation.
“Stigmatisation (surrounding malingering) often prevents those in need from seeking help,” Dr Lim added. “Improving the mental health literacy of commanders will no doubt help.”
There’s also the stigma associated with getting exempted from NS due to mental illness, something Derrek said he worried about even before enlisting.
“Admittedly, being exempted from NS on these grounds can cause self-stigmatisation and impact personal confidence,” Dr Tan said.
These men will also have to explain their exemption to future schools and employers, and therefore reveal their mental illnesses, Dr Lim added.
As for Derrek, he said he is doing much better now that he's out of NS, adding that his exemption has not affected his prospects in any way.
MANY STILL COMPLETE NATIONAL SERVICE
Defence Minister Dr Ng told Parliament in 2014 that “under our present regime, there have been many national servicemen with mental health disorders who have completed their NS duties well”.
Dr Tan, the psychiatrist, agreed, noting that most of the servicemen in this category “come out stronger through the NS experience”.
Nevertheless, Dr Ng said MINDEF and the SAF will continue to “periodically review and strengthen” its mental health system in consultation with its Psychiatry Specialist Advisory Board, which comprises senior psychiatrists from private practice and public hospitals.
“(This is) to ensure that all our national servicemen with medical conditions receive good care during NS,” he added.

Movie-goers might view the film as a satire on relationships. It is certainly easy to see the scenes of workplace harassment and the murderous plot it ultimately inspires as rather extreme.  
Nonetheless, workplace aggression is a serious issue, can take many forms and its effects on organisations is only just beginning to be understood.
INCIVILITY AND LOW-LEVEL MISTREATMENT
According to a 2011 survey by a global jobs portal, 64 per cent of more than 16,000 workers polled around the world said they had been bullied and were either physically hurt, driven to tears, or had their work performance affected as a result. 
Yet there are also other forms of workplace mistreatment, less overt than bullying or physical abuse, which can be highly damaging. 
With demands increasing for more cross-team collaboration within and outside the workplace to enhance connectivity and hence productivity, employees seldom work in silos. 
As these pressures grow, interactions between staff can give rise to friction. Without checks and balances, even seemingly minor acts of incivility, such as ignoring a co-worker persistently, rudeness or disregard for others, can cause some surprising negative effects.

When individuals are singled out and treated with incivility, they may feel stressed, blame themselves or withdraw from social interactions, according to a recent study we undertook with colleagues at Oregon State University. 
However, when the mistreated individual shares the same bad experience with a colleague, the impact of the harm is diminished. 
A SMALL EXPERIMENT WITH SURPRISING RESULTS
As email is a common form of workplace exchange within the workplace, we devised an experimental online game scenario in which 240 individuals were asked to interact with other users on a small creative project using an email system. 
The game was designed to place participants on the receiving end of low-level bullying behaviour, or witness another participant being mistreated. However, unknown to the participants, the other members of their assigned teams were actually computer-generated avatars.
Individuals in the game nearly always blamed themselves when faced with aggressive behaviour. However, the extent of self-blame diminished when individuals experienced such behaviour as part of a group. 
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
While the shared experience makes it less stressful, it can also result in larger consequences.
The results suggest individuals take cues from how they view others being treated and that can impact their workplace performance, creativity and helpfulness towards others.

Targets of incivility who were ignored, undermined in front of others, or experienced abusive supervision tend to have difficulty recalling information and are more distracted at work.
These in turn can have a significant impact on an organisation’s overall productivity and morale. 
INTERVENTIONS NEEDED
As workplaces become more interdependent, it is imperative for employers, supervisors and co-workers to pick up on tell-tale signs before real damage is done. 
However, more often than not, little action is taken – perhaps because of a lack of awareness among employers over ways to monitor and prevent such behaviour.
In Singapore, for example, the Ministry of Manpower’s tripartite advisory group guideline on Managing Workplace Harassment noted a myth of workplace harassment - that many believe it is a matter of personal relationships, and not for employers to intervene in.  
This myth suggests that conflicts of a personal relationship are nearly always met with little or no intervention by employers or HR staff. 
Yet there are effective steps employers can take. To curb bullying behaviour within the workplace, firms can formalise work policies and build in intervention mechanisms to reduce or prevent incivility. 
A first step would include clearly defining what constitutes uncivil acts in the workplace. From there, firms can devise training programmes for employees about incivility, to be incorporated into performance appraisals. 
Knowing what to look out for, supervisors can periodically review the tone used in their team’s interpersonal interactions and communications.

Being alert to uncivil verbal or written interactions would help identify specific areas for mediation in a timely manner. 
MANAGERS MUST BE PARTNERS IN THIS ENDEAVOUR
Second, firms should encourage managers to intervene and point out inappropriate behaviour when they arise. It is important for top management to lead by example, and managers should be reminded not to “close one eye” when they observe employees behaving uncivilly to each other.
Yet managers may not be aware of uncivil episodes between staff. Individuals may behave uncivilly to single targets in private, even though some may publicly lash out at multiple people. 
Third, simple prompts and reminders for civil exchange could be built into organisations’ internal messaging systems to curb incivility before it begins. These intervention mechanisms will help employees refrain from blaming themselves, and reduce other harmful effects caused by mistreatment.
In order to curtail incivility, more organisations need to emphasise civil behaviour in their HR policies. Given the mild character of uncivil workplace behaviour, targets, perpetrators, bystanders and leaders should intervene early, instead of dismissing it. This will help build more cohesive and productive work environments for everyone.
Ultimately, bad behaviour can be curbed if there is support from top management.

But on closer inspection, you will find that he took a year's break at the age of 24 and there have been some gaps between jobs.
This was due to Mr Tan’s condition. He has bipolar disorder - a mental condition characterised by extreme highs and lows in mood.
Diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder after a car accident, his emotions took a turn for the worse, culminating in fits of rage and hallucinations. It was then, in 2002, that he was diagnosed as bipolar. 
After that, he was reluctant to declare his condition in job applications.
“Once you declare, you may not even get an interview,” he told Channel NewsAsia. 
While that had been a hunch, proof that it was true came earlier this year. During an eight-month break, and looking to switch careers, he asked a consultant at a recruitment agency: What if the potential candidate has mental health issues?
The answer he received was: “Better not, lah. We don’t know when the person will snap. And I don’t think the company will know how to handle this group.”
But withholding the truth at work comes with its own challenges, he said.
“There’s always this insecurity. When colleagues’ behaviour towards me suddenly changes, I will wonder whether they found out from somewhere that I have bipolar. I will also think about what the consequences would be if my employer found out,” Mr Tan said.
He is now one month into his job at Club Heal, a voluntary welfare organisation that helps people with mental illnesses and their families.
CAMPAIGN TO GET RID OF THE STIGMA
Mr Tan could be better off than others who have a mental condition struggling to find a job.
The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) on Saturday (Sep 8) revealed findings of a study showing that five in 10 respondents believe that those with mental conditions should not be given any responsibility. 
NCSS hopes to change this perception through the first nationwide anti-stigma campaign.
The Beyond the Label campaign launched on Saturday is a five-year public education effort funded by the Tote Board's Mental Health Strategic initiative.
NCSS deputy chief executive Tina Hung, deputy chief executive at NCSS, said research shows that perceptions and attitudes are the most critical in changing the behaviour of individuals.
“Hence, it’s crucial for us to change perceptions and attitudes towards persons with mental health conditions, to support inclusion and a better quality of life for all. With support and acceptance, persons in recovery can integrate into society and thrive,” she said. 
TACKLING MISCONCEPTIONS
Employers need to understand that mental illness is a disease and, like other illnesses, it is manageable with medication, therapy, self-help and societal support and understanding of the affliction, a spokesperson for the Singapore Association for Mental Health said.
Ms Li Zhong Ying, principal occupational therapist at the Institute of Mental Health’s (IMH) Job Club, said very often supervisors and managers on the ground do not know how to better support employees with mental health conditions, or are unsure about the community support and services that are available.
“I’ve heard some of them say that they might as well set up a charity if they are going to employ people from this group. Others are afraid of being held responsible. They think the staff will have outbursts, and that there will be complaints,” said Ms Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health advocacy organisation Silver Ribbon.
It has been reaching out to firms to provide them with the information they need on hiring people with mental health issues.
REMOVING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION
However, the need to declare one’s mental health history when applying for a job remains a bugbear among advocates.
Ms Li from IMH’s Job Club said it encourages discrimination.
“The job market is already very competitive, and to state it on a job application form will only further lower the chances of persons with mental health conditions securing a job, given the negative assumptions held by the public towards people with mental health conditions,” she said.
She stressed that people with mental health conditions deserve a chance to prove that they can work productively.
“Many such individuals are not only able to function as well as others in the workplace, but also often have qualifications, skills, abilities and experiences as required by the jobs,” she said.
A perception shift is critical when it comes to the declaration of mental illness in a job application process, the Singapore Association for Mental Health said.
“With greater awareness and understanding of mental health conditions, the declaration of one’s mental health conditions should be considered with respect and empathy as this is an act of strength and courage,” its spokesperson said.
Even for those willing to hire, Ms Li cautioned against treating this group differently.
“Employers should accord them the same pay rates and benefits as other workers. Employers should not have a mindset of doing 'charity work' and pay people with mental health conditions less or view them as beneficiaries,” she said.
Still, the organisations acknowledged that more employers are now open to hiring those with a history of mental health issues. Between 2015 and 2017, Job Club has been in touch with 45 new companies who expressed interest in hiring its clients, Ms Li said.

The Singapore Association for Mental Health's MINDSET Learning Hub, the first vocational training centre for those with mental health issues has placed 123 individuals in jobs between July 2016 and July this year.
“To encourage a more inclusive workforce, incentives could be given to employers to encourage them to employ persons with mental health conditions, as well as to reward organisations that have already been doing so,” Ms Li said.
LEADING BY EXAMPLE
Eyewear shop Nanyang Optical has pledged to hire people with mental illnesses. So far, the firm, which has about 100 employees, has hired three people with schizophrenia and depression, said managing director Bernard Yang.
“We made a slight adjustment to the job scope and environment so that it is easier for them to adapt. In addition, we also try to be more generous in giving words of encouragement to them,” he said, adding that a lot of understanding and cooperation is required across departments and colleagues.
Mr Yang encouraged other companies to hire people with mental illnesses, and stressed the need for inclusion, as “everyone deserves a chance”.
“Actually, they are not any different from any of us. If we can adapt to the different kinds of people at a workplace, we can definitely work with people with mental illness. All they need is a little encouragement and a little kindness, and also an opportunity,” he said.
Although it may entail making changes to workflow, he said he believes it means a lot to them. There is also satisfaction, he said.
“We feel good and happy when we see them improving along with the job, their condition becomes stable, and they smile more often,” he said.
Mr Tan hopes that more employers will be accepting, hire people with mental health issues and see them for who they are.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/technology/do-digital-tools-social-media-cause-our-brain-to-degenerate-10624944,Is the use of digital tools and social media causing our brains to waste away? - CNA,18/08/2018,"SINGAPORE: You’re meeting a friend at an out-of-the-way shopping mall you’re unfamiliar with. 
Stumped for directions? Not if you have a map app like Google Search to navigate your way.
“Papa, how do you say grasshopper in Mandarin?” 
Once, you might reach for the English-to-Chinese dictionary collecting dust in the nook of your bookshelf to satisfy your child’s curiosity. Today, the answer is just a few taps away on your palm-sized computer – also known as your smartphone.
These are but a couple of everyday scenarios we face – and overcome – with the digital ""brain"" we have sitting in our palms or back pocket.
Yet, it's also this convenience at our fingertips that had one prominent American artificial intelligence (AI) expert Vivienne Ming sounding the alarm over its detrimental effects.
A recent Financial Times story cited her as predicting that “within a generation, we might see widespread early onset dementia” because the apps that we are using to do the abovementioned tasks are “depriving our brains of the exercise they’ve become used to over millions of years”.
Ms Ming said then: “I used Google Maps to get here from my hotel. I use it to get everywhere, and I do it knowing that it’s making me better in the short term but worse in the long.”
DIRE DIAGNOSIS?
Commenting on this quite dire projection of our future, Dr Chris Tsoi, a consultant at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) Department of Psychological Medicine, said: “It’s true… it’s (a) logical (conclusion).”
Dr Tsoi, who is also director of an outreach service providing psychiatric assessment and treatment for the elderly with mental health conditions, told Channel NewsAsia in a recent interview that letting a computer do the thinking for us in areas like navigation and searching for information will definitely have an effect on our mental capacity.
Citing the London cabbie study a few years back that found the parts of the brain linked with memory grew larger after the taxi drivers started memorising the different routes to navigate the city, he said the findings show the more you use a particular skill, the stronger it becomes.
“I’ve seen many of my cases where after a person retires, they develop dementia. Their brains start to degenerate,” the doctor said.
He was keen to add that these are his observations and that there are no conclusive medical studies backing this up because these digital services have not been available long enough to do so.




                        

Dr Chris Tsoi is worried about how the use of digital tools and social media may have negative impact on the development of today's young. (Photo: NUH)



Dr Tsoi also pointed to how such digital tools and platforms are developed - partly or primarily to hook people to the online services - have negative repercussions.
“They abuse the humans’ addictive characteristic when they designed these apps … so no surprise that these will monopolise the development of the brain,” Dr Tsoi pointed out.
“If they don’t care about how they develop their apps, certainly there will be more dementia.
“If the primary focus of these companies is to hook people to their apps, and the eye contact time as the value (they measure against), then of course people’s health won’t be looked after,” he said.
YOUTHS AT RISK
It is also from such observations that got Dr Tsoi worried about another demographic of society: The young.
“If the young have such convenient lives, and every part of their lives is so easy with the use of apps, then the most developed part of their brain is in (controlling) how they use their fingertips,” he said.
The doctor also qualified his comments by saying that there are positives to today’s technological innovations.
Dr Evelyn Law, who has been working with children and their developmental and behavioural issues since 2003, also gave her take on how digital tools and social media are impacting younger minds.
In an email interview, Dr Law said our brains are still developing during childhood and adolescence. Things like learning to have more self-control and longer attention spans, as well as problem solve in unexpected situations and complete more complex tasks mentally take place during this period.
However, too much digital media use, especially watching fast-paced shows, during this period is associated with problems in the areas of these cognitive skills, said the consultant in the developmental and behavioural paediatrics unit at NUH.







                                    

As of Apr 26, 189 countries across Asia, Europe, the Middle East, North America, and South America have implemented school and university closures. Singapore is one of them. 




Dr Law, citing a 2010 study by Dr Suzy Tomopoulos, said the length of time younger children use such digital media is associated with worse cognitive and language development. 
She also highlighted how recent research has shown that the interactive nature of new media, such as social media, has a negative impact on the socio-emotional wellbeing of children.
The doctor said children may suffer from anxiety and depression due to “technology-based negative social comparison, avoidance of social interaction because of substituted digital media use, worries about being inadequately connected and mood issues resulting from cyberbullying”, citing a 2017 study led by Dr Elizabeth Hoge.
ADULTS, BE BETTER ROLE MODELS
The young of today, dubbed digital natives as they never knew life without electronic devices, should also not be passive recipients of information. For instance, children might do a Google search to look for information but they should also engage in critical thinking for said information, Dr Law said.
“A good analogy is mastering a musical instrument,” she added. “The actual practice on a real instrument is needed, even when a child gets to watch his/her teacher play.”
That said, the doctor was keen to point out that digital media use is “unavoidable”, especially as more technology is integrated into education.
“Setting limits on the duration of use will not be appropriate,” she said.
Rather, the importance lies in how our children use such digital media. A 2015 study led by Dr Katerina Lup showed that teenagers who used Instagram to follow strangers and engage in social comparisons had higher depression symptoms, whereas those who followed close friends and engaged in fewer social comparisons had fewer symptoms.
She said beyond the number of hours spent on social media, the content choice and reason for consuming the content are “paramount”.
“When it comes to media, parents must walk the walk and model good behaviours for their children,” Dr Law said.
“If all the adults in the home do not consume media in a healthy manner, how can we expect the children in this home to consume media differently?”

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/sharing-shopping-on-social-media-unhealthy-anxiety-10576258,Commentary: Unhealthy culture of consumerism on social media fueling anxiety and low self-esteem - CNA,07/08/2018,"SYDNEY: Posting images on social media when we buy new clothes, eat out or purchase the latest gadget may seem harmless enough. But this consumption-oriented sharing may be undermining both our bank balance and our mental well-being.
Research has found that this sort of social media engagement is linked in some people to greater anxiety, lower self-esteem and an increased likelihood of excessive spending.
Around 40 per cent of the world’s population uses social media, with young people spending the greatest amount of time online. So understanding the influence of social media on health and well-being is critical to reducing potential harm.
SOCIAL COMPARISON
We surveyed 900 Singaporean university students aged 17 to 24 about their social media activities, to explore whether sharing product information had an influence on well-being.
On platforms like Facebook and Instagram everyone looks happy: Enjoying holidays, going to fancy restaurants, buying luxury goods and clothes. We were curious to understand whether this glossy portrayal has a psychological impact on social media users.
Previous research has looked at the impact of time spent on social media, but our research specifically examined the link between consumer-based content – such as posts about products or shopping experiences – and well-being.
Our survey was conducted face to face at several college campuses. Participants voluntarily reported their behaviours related to social media usage, peer comparison, well-being and spending levels. 
This data allowed us to assess the impact of participants’ sharing of consumption-related content on well-being, while controlling for demographics and media usage habits.

Findings suggest that when young adults engage in social media, creating and sharing content about products, it can trigger a social comparison process.
In the end, this hurts their psychological well-being, lowering their self-esteem and increasing anxiety levels.
Feelings of inferiority, low self-esteem and anxiety in some cases led to uncontrollable spending sprees – seemingly in an effort to close the gap between the students’ own lives and what they see in their news feeds.
While Singaporean culture has a strong focus on material life and peer comparison, the results are also applicable to social media users around the world, particularly young people.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Of particular concern is the link between consumption-oriented sharing and risky spending behaviour, including higher credit card debt. Just sharing general experiences does not seem to have the same impact.
HEALTHY PARENTAL RELATIONSHIPS HELP CURB THE PROBLEM
Negative impacts were more common in students who felt that materialistic possessions and financial success are “very important”. But those who said they had a good relationship with their parents were less affected.
Students who told us that they have a close, healthy relationship with their parents, using self-rated measures of attachment, support and warmth, did not suffer the same feelings of inferiority. Nor did they succumb to the behaviour that this can trigger.

The research has implications for government policy and awareness programmes for young people. We are keen to conduct more of such research, to better understand ways to help young people develop self-regulation and resilience.
The study also has ramifications for marketers because of what it says about the potentially negative impact of marketing products through social media “influencers” – people like beauty and fashion bloggers with large social media followings who are given free products or paid to endorse brands online.

Many others have responded generously, offering the family cash donations and to buy her brother’s paintings, following CNA Insider’s story about 50-year-old Sim Kah Lim, who has been institutionalised for nearly 35 years and paints old Singapore from memory.
The possible chance, however, for him to reintegrate into society, as both siblings see it, has thrilled them the most. “I’m happy and touched that somebody recognised his talents, and is willing to give him a chance,” said Ms Sim.
“It would be good for Kah Lim to get back into society, back to work and interacting with people. Now he’s still living in his own world. When people talk to him, he’d just interrupt.”
WATCH: His gift unfettered (6:16)

But there are many other considerations to take into first, and she admitted that it was early days.
The last time he was in any sort of job was as a 10-year-old helping an advertising company to paint movie posters and bus advertisements, before he was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
“Nor has he gone out for a long time. I’m just a bit worried about whether he can cope,” added Ms Sim.
Her brother, however, is already talking about using part of his future salary to employ a helper for their mother.

WAITING ON DOCTORS’ ADVICE
Ms Lum-Yu decided to offer Mr Sim help in the hope that he can “have a sustainable way of life”. Her new social enterprise ArtSE provides employment for individuals with special needs, especially artists.
And having met him and his sister at the Institute of Mental Health, she was struck by his talent and knowledge of the old Singaporean painters.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
“Kah Lim is such a lovable person. We talked about artists; even the ones that we represent, he knows them. We had a lovely time talking,” she said.

He was excited when they spoke about the possibility of employment, but she cautioned that “we want to take it slow”. She said: “We’ll wait for the doctors to advise us what days he can come out to work.
“We’re going to impact on another person, and that’s what we’re looking forward to – it gives a greater meaning to what we’re doing.”
The idea is to have a senior artist mentor Mr Sim at the gallery once or twice a week. He, too, could share his knowledge with budding artists, but that would depend on how ready he is.

Ms Sim intends to take her brother out to crowded public places first, to observe how he interacts with others. She will also show him the art gallery to see if he likes the environment.
Ascertaining whether he is ready for the job will take some time, while full reintegration is a long way off, she admitted, as a sudden return to society would be “a shock to the system”.
MANY FACTORS IN CONSIDERING REINTEGRATION
The first step, however, is for Ms Sim to work closely with the IMH doctors.
“His consultant said it would be good if he can slowly integrate back into society, and he’d love to see if Kah Lim can progress to that stage,” she said.
“I’d love for him to be out completely, but partially is good enough. Eventually, he can change for the better, to be completely okay.
We’ll take it step by step. I’m still in good health – I can take care of him.
When contacted, the IMH said that in assessing a patient’s readiness for reintegration, the care team would consider his clinical condition, the ability to support himself in the community in areas like home support, and the ability to do practical things like use public transport and money.
The team must also consider the patient’s wish to return home or not, and whether there are carers around, such as family members.
The IMH said its occupational therapists and vocational specialists assist individuals in their job search and placement when they are ready to take up employment, based on their interests and skills.

Most collaborations are in the administrative, retail, food and beverage and cleaning settings, where there are more opportunities.
“In addition to providing on-site job coaching to support clients at work, individual follow-up with clients is also carried out to help them identify and overcome any challenges they face at work,” said an IMH spokesperson.
To date, 26 patients from its slow-stream rehabilitation ward have been discharged to their homes and community rehabilitation facilities.
These patients are doing well and engaging with the IMH at the outpatient level, added the spokesperson, who declined to comment on Mr Sim’s case, citing patient confidentiality.
OFFERS FROM U.S., NEW ZEALAND
Apart from the job offer, as many as 80 people, including from the United States and New Zealand, have emailed Ms Sim to buy her brother’s paintings, donate art materials or even to commission him to paint something for them.

Some have offered monetary assistance, but she referred them to the IMH. “So many people there also need help, not just Kah Lim. That’s not right. He could always sell his paintings if he needs more money,” she said.
Some of his paintings have since been sold, but the details are being confirmed, she added.
It’s very great – the responses from the public. Some even messaged me. The first week, I was very emotional.
Ms Sim has created a website about her brother and diverted all the emails and queries there. She intends to photograph his paintings and catalogue them on the website for interested buyers.
It is a work in progress, and she hopes to upload the pictures in the next month or so. She has not even had the time, however, to price his paintings.
But she promised one thing: “I’ll also share updates about him and his progress.”

Outside, changes have swept the landscape, old buildings falling and new ones rising – skylines and shorelines of a 21st-century nation transformed. 
But in his mind’s eye – and in his bold-stroked acrylic and watercolour paintings – Mr Sim’s homeland is one where bumboats still crowd the Singapore River, ferrying goods and passengers; and where Chinatown’s open-air markets thrive and its five-foot ways are bustling with locals, not tourists.
They are pictures, frozen in time and memory, from early childhood when his father used to take him to these places.
“My father brought me outdoors (for) painting. I saw the Singapore River and all the artists,” the 50-year-old said, words spilling out without pause in a torrent of English and Mandarin, sometimes incoherent and muddied, like the river of his paintings during monsoon season.
It’s through his art that he finds order, focus and clarity in expressing himself.






Along the IMH corridors are hung some of his paintings. We counted 15 on our short tour, and there were more, including renditions of the old Woodbridge Hospital off Yio Chu Kang Road where he used to live.
More of his artworks are stuffed into cupboards in two rooms – and he bashfully takes them out one by one to show us, such as one of a Chinese dragon and another of a tiger.
His sister Cindy Sim later lets on that he paints these predators when he is feeling angry or moody.
AS A CHILD, LEARNING FROM THE MASTERS
Her brother was four when he started doodling and painting.
“He was really good,” Ms Sim recalled. “He could draw a very precise animal. 
For me, drawing a cat is like two balls, two ears and a tail. For him, he could draw the whole cat.
Recognising his potential, his father took him to the Singapore River and Kampong Glam to paint and learn from the artists who used to congregate there.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
Those veterans were generous in sharing their knowledge of stroke techniques, different mediums and colours. The young Kah Lim was even under the tutelage of renowned local artists Ong Kim Seng and the late Ong Chye Cho.
“There were a few artists who thought his painting was very nice so that’s why they advised him,” said Ms Sim. “He didn't go through any other proper training.”

Their father had also wanted to dissuade his son, the eldest of three, from drawing too many pictures of Chinese deities, as he thought that “drawing scenery and buildings was more meaningful”, added Ms Sim.
Those childhood visits became the strongest and happiest memories of her brother’s life. “He enjoyed those days. That's why he could remember those days better. Ever since then, he has kept drawing those (landscapes),” she said.
He also does still life (while CNA Insider was with him at IMH, he painted the garden); tackles portraits, and paints from photographs.
His flair for painting was rewarded at a young age when he won cash prizes at a couple of art competitions, and he seemed destined to be a professional artist.

WARDED AS A TEEN
When he was 14, however, his behaviour started to change. He started talking to himself, refused to leave the house and wanted only to paint. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia.
Then when he was 17, he fell from their sixth-storey flat but miraculously survived. “I don’t know why, but I believe he felt sad on that particular day, and he just looked down and fell,” said Ms Sim.
He was subsequently warded long-term at the mental hospital. His family were at a loss for what to do, but he seemed to adapt well.
“At the old IMH children’s unit, he was doing quite okay and was quite happy there because every day he was drawing,” said his sister.

Long-stay patients are classified as those who have been warded for more than a year, where all possible discharge options have been explored and failed. And Mr Sim is now one of the longest-staying residential patients at IMH.
Over the years, his art has been a record of sorts of his emotions.
“When he was in a bad shape, he drew more of the (Chinese) gods,” said his sister, adding that he would paint landscapes when he is in a good mood.









When asked why he liked to paint, he went off at a tangent once and broke into a National Day song.
But another time, he said with a smile: 
My work is my expression … It’s my dreaming world. It’s my dream to create the picture.
When he paints or draws, he is focused. He constantly shifts the easel to adjust to changes in the lighting.
Holding a pencil loosely, he makes broad strokes on the canvas, with seemingly little purpose to the untrained eye, but the result is an impressive sketch of IMH with its garden in the foreground.

BIG-HEARTED, PROLIFIC ARTIST
While some may think him a little odd, most people are more fascinated by his artwork. “Because he just draws, he doesn't disturb anybody,” said Ms Sim, who thinks her brother has faced “not so much” stigma.
But he is generous to a fault, which got him into trouble before.
He’s so generous he could take anything from our home to give to anybody, since young.
His sister added that whenever she visits him with food, he would share it with other patients. He has a hearty appetite, and often requests for local fare such as char kway teow and roti prata.
On special occasions, like Chinese New Year and Mother’s Day, Ms Sim – who moved near to  IMH so as to visit him more regularly – brings him home, as their mother has difficulty walking and their father is still working.
“He brings all his paintings, and puts (them) all over the place. And he can remember all his paintings,” she said. “He’d say, “Where’s my pigeon?’ Then I’d say, ‘Oh, upstairs. I’ll go and take it.’""







                                    

Chinatown of old, in Mr Sim's paintings.



He is such a prolific artist that he has paintings stored in a warehouse, and his sister doubles as his curator, framing those works she deems worthy. Her home and office are also scattered with his art.
Some of his pieces are displayed in the offices of other healthcare institutions like the National University Hospital. He also sold two paintings to non-profit organisation BizLink for its range of These Abled People greeting cards.
And now, some of his works have been selected for the 'One of Us' exhibition, organised by T-Touch – Temasek's staff-driven volunteer initiative – to highlight the importance of mental health.

Ms Sim is grateful for this chance to showcase his paintings, as he has been requesting for his own exhibition for some time.
“He keeps asking me to keep all his art pieces before they disappear, so that when he gets an art exhibition, he (can) show them. Of course, he also wants to sell his paintings,” she said.
BECOMING AN OBSESSION
Mr Sim said he also likes “singing, swimming, table tennis, badminton”. But he has a tireless commitment to painting, to the point of it becoming an obsession.
And that is cause for concern, said IMH occupational therapist Lee Shu Hui, who works with schizophrenia patients on social skills such as interacting with others and behaving in a group setting.
When she was first introduced to him, it was in a room full of his paintings, and there was not much space for them to move about.
While painting is his strength and should be encouraged, his goals all revolve around painting, and “it shouldn’t be the only part of his life”.
“We’re also looking at other aspects of his life: Whether or not he can take care of himself … whether he can overcome some of the conflicts he faces in the ward itself,” said Ms Lee.

While painting helps to calm Mr Sim down, he gets frustrated at those times he does not get to paint. And this is not helping his condition.
“We have to have a balance; we need to be able to pace ourselves also. Therefore we have to set structures for him,” added Ms Lee. 
We can have that allowance (for painting). But we can’t do that every day.
Mr Sim recognises Ms Lee’s point, even though he has told her before: “I can paint without food – I can don't eat; I can don't sleep.”
When he spoke to CNA Insider, he said: “Must rest. I every time continue to paint, never take a deep breath – cannot.”

His sister still dreams of reintegrating him into society, and even hopes that he can sell his paintings and help their parents buy a bigger home.
There is always hope. But as with all IMH patients, it is a matter of assessing their mental condition, whether they are ready and whether such a move is beneficial for them.
Said Ms Lee: “If we’re able to find that support in the community, and they’re able to manage, of course we’re more than happy to help them reintegrate.”

We have engineered solutions to send us to the moon, explored the deepest depths of the ocean, and split the atom.
We have written music and produced art that stirs the soul. We have produced criminals and masterminds. 
But for all of mankind’s ingenuity to improve an understanding of the world, we retain a tendency to generalise and compartmentalise things.
There is an underlying assumption that we are all created equal. There is the underlying belief that we can deal with our body and mind separately with complete agency. This is not the case.
It is obvious that the mind and body work together. A clear example would be insomnia caused by mental stress. Overtime, sleep deprivation will wreak havoc on the body and lead to serious physical health problems.
MUSICIANS, ARTISTS, MATHEMATICIANS AND THOSE VULNERABLE TO CERTAIN DISEASES
The Human Genome Project (HGP) was an international, collaborative research programme created with the goal of complete mapping and understanding of all the genes of human beings.
The HGP has revealed that there are probably about 20,500 human genes, each gene contributing to the human makeup to a different degree. The cumulative effects of these genes result in who each of us are today.
Some of us will be better musicians or artists, some of us will be good at mathematics and some of us might even be able to better understand quantum mechanics. The variations and therefore the possibilities are endless.

This also means that some of us are more vulnerable to developing certain diseases. Examples of diseases with a strong genetic link include cystic fibrosis, haemophilia, sickle cell anaemia and Tay-Sachs disease (which is rare in the general population but relatively common in Ashkenazi Jews).
Other diseases may not have such a strong link, but do show some degree of genetic involvement. Mental illnesses fall within this category.

Most major mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression and anxiety disorders have multiple causal factors. While there is a clear hereditary or genetic contribution, childhood factors, personality and environmental factors all play a part in the development of mental illnesses.
Mental illnesses can strike at any age. However, for most of them, there are peak age groups for the onset of the disease.
Schizophrenia, a major mental disorder in which a person would experience hallucinations and abnormal beliefs, commonly appears in early adulthood for males and slightly later for females.
Bipolar disorder, a mood disorder characterised by extreme mood swings, commonly appears in early adulthood to when someone is in their 30s. Both anxiety disorders and depressive disorders also tend to manifest in early adulthood.

LIFE-CYCLE STRESSES
As we go through life, we will face major events that can cause no small degree of stress. Exams are often cited as a common cause of stress for the young.
In young adults, having to face the final years of education, exploring relationships, dealing with new jobs, getting married, moving to a new home and starting a family are major life events that may have positive connotations but can be causes of stress nonetheless.
In the later years, dealing with family or the lack of, career and eventually retirement can be sources of stress as well. There are also upsetting events that can strike anyone at any time. Illness and the death of a loved one are good examples.
DON’T RULE OUT TRIGGERS
Most of us will be able to navigate through life and cope with each event as it comes along.
However, when there is an existing genetic vulnerability coupled with other factors such as childhood abuse or trauma, the lack of social and family support or even several events happening at the same time can trigger a mental illness.
Once triggered, a delay in seeking treatment or incomplete treatment can increase difficulties and the risk of the illness relapsing. Unfortunately, it has been shown that with each relapse, the chances of recidivism also increase.
However, the converse can also happen. Despite having a genetic vulnerability or pre-disposition, changes in other factors can help prevent the development of a mental illness.
Having a healthy upbringing with positive childhood experiences, good family and social support, a healthy and balanced lifestyle, and matured ways of coping with stress can help build resilience and prevent the development of mental illnesses.
Indeed, this is why in twin studies, it is never a definitive chance that both identical twins will develop the same mental illness.

Similarly, once having developed a mental illness, it is not just medication that makes a difference. Repeated studies have shown that early detection and proper treatment improves the long-term prognosis of the illness.
Beyond that, good physical and mental health promotes recovery and helps in prevention of future relapses.
LIVE WELL TO COPE WELL
We all go through mixed experiences. We all have different reactions to these experiences.
For some people, mental illness develops due to a combination of influences including genetics, childhood experiences and a host of other factors such as personality, the presence of other disorders, illnesses, drugs or alcohol misuse and the lack of a support structure.
Living well, leading a healthy lifestyle, having a good balance of rest, work, exercise and recreational time, having time for yourself, friends and family, having a faith and contributing to society in terms of helping others − all these, while small tasks in themselves, make a difference.
They help to build resilience and help us cope with the challenges of modern day life, in turn helping with the prevention and recovery of mental illness.
Much like exploring the deepest depths of the ocean, we are only at the tip of the iceberg when it comes to understanding mental illness.
There is much to learn but with increased awareness of what helps to prevent mental illness, we can do our best to support ourselves and others.

A sudden clap of thunder woke me up from a fitful slumber and disoriented me.
Somehow seized with the notion I was under surveillance, I thought to myself: “The world is ending”. Something moved near me. I bolted upright.
“Are you awake?” my sister whispered.
“What’s happening to me?” I responded, confused.
She crept up to my bed and put her arms around me; I hugged her close.
I was diagnosed with a brief psychotic disorder when I was 25.
A few episodes later, doctors revised their diagnosis to schizophrenia, a form of psychosis where an individual’s thoughts and perceptions become increasingly detached from reality.
Often misconceived as a person having a split personality, schizophrenia manifests itself in a variety of symptoms including visual and hearing hallucinations, delusions, distorted thinking and difficulties in communication.
These are signs I can attest to. When the illness hits, it is a struggle to hold onto my thoughts and put them together in a coherent manner. At the height of my last psychotic experience in December 2017, I was convinced that I was a test subject forced to participate in a scientific experiment.
Conspiracy theories loomed large, and my erratic thoughts were frightening to deal with. Yet, the symptoms subsided in a week and I went back to work in February after an extended break.

THE ROAD TO RECOVERY
It was encouraging to learn that more than half of patients who experienced psychosis recover completely or at least show significant improvements, according to studies from a number of countries in the 1970s to 1980s.
Many healthcare professionals are seized with “clinical recovery”, a remission from or reduction in symptoms, and restoration of functions in a patient with the disease. To doctors, schizophrenia is a medical illness, a result of changes in the prefrontal cortex, an area of the brain that controls language, abstract thinking and appropriate social behaviour, as a result of stress and other triggers.
But those who suffer from mental health issues favour the idea of “personal recovery”, and in rediscovering anew life’s meaning, purpose and hope while living with the disease.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
A widely-cited definition of personal recovery by famed healthcare expert William Antony of the Boston University’s Centre for Psychiatric Rehabilitation describes the process:
Recovery is a deeply personal, unique process of changing one’s attitudes, values, feelings, goals, skills or roles. It is a way of living a satisfying, hopeful and contributing life even within the limitations caused by illness. Recovery involves the development of new meaning and purpose in one’s life as one grows beyond the catastrophic effects of mental illness.
Medical treatment and psychiatric forms of therapy, including widely used cognitive behavioural therapy, may help to reduce symptoms but those who suffer from it value the journey of recovery, including finding a purpose and their place in the community.
Sometimes part of this rehabilitation process includes re-engaging with work, in developing a repertoire of actions that aid with recovery.
A person who has lost a limb due to diabetes may not be able to grow one back, but may consider himself recovered when he adapts to the loss and finds ways to lead a productive life.
It is similar for people with mental health issues. I’ve met so many people in the course of my work who go on to live gratifying lives and form meaningful relationships, despite their struggles with mental health issues.

WHAT DOES RECOVERY MEAN TO ME?
For me personally, recovery is about taking control, changing my outlook on life, and adapting.
I have come to understand myself better than before and appreciate the importance of my emotional health. I have also grown more empathetic and sensitive towards people in emotional distress.
But recovery has not been an easy journey. There was a period in my life that was filled with negativity. At my lowest point, getting out of bed in the morning was an agony.
I wish I could say that I woke up one day and it all went away. But it didn’t. Recovery was a very slow, painful and non-linear process of transformation. 
BARRIERS TO RECOVERY
The accompanying stigma remains a huge challenge for people living with mental health issues. A person struggling with, say, depression is more likely to be told to “get a grip” than to be met with empathy and concern. People are also more familiar with dealing with anxiety or depression than psychosis.
A mental health literacy study conducted in Singapore in 2016, Mind Matters, found that the majority of respondents think that persons with mental health issues are “weak, not sick”. Even a person suffering from depression may be telling himself to be stronger and more diligent about turning his life around.
Stigma prevents people from seeking the help or taking the rest they need. Can you imagine a person running a high fever struggling to get out of bed to go to school or work, yet refusing to see a doctor? Many people with mental health issues are doing exactly that.
In the Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2010, the time taken for patients to seek help for major depression was four years, and nine years for bipolar disorder. That is a long time to live with a disease.

IT TAKES A VILLAGE
No man is an island. It takes a lot of support and understanding from the people around to help someone recover from a mental health issue.
You may be a family member, a friend, or a co-worker to someone living with a mental illness. A word of encouragement, a simple meal, or a listening ear can make a world of difference. As Stephen King so eloquently wrote about mental health issues in The Body:
The secret stays locked within not for want of a teller but for want of an understanding ear.
From my experience, the simple act of someone providing a safe space for me to share my inner thoughts without the fear of judgment made the sum difference. It is okay to tell us you don’t know what to say, or just stay silent in the moment.
I did not get out of the terror of psychosis on my own. My family and friends’ unwavering support for me in the last five years played a huge role.
On another note, it is important for friends and family members to provide space for the person in recovery. Being overly concerned and getting on the person’s case may aggravate the situation.
Recovery from schizophrenia is a lifelong journey, a balancing act and those of us who once suffered from the terrifying grips of the disease know we need all the support we can get.

https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/48-young-onset-dementia-alzheimers-singapore-10398838,"He’s 48, and already grappling with dementia - CNA",07/06/2018,"SINGAPORE: He was once an accomplished teacher and published author of two chemistry books. But two years ago, when he was only 46, Mr George Chong was diagnosed with younger-onset Alzheimer’s, an uncommon form of dementia.
There was no cure, the doctor told him – and he slowly began to lose control of his daily life. Over time, he found it hard to follow instructions, do simple calculations and, sometimes, even distinguish his right hand from his left.
“Because of Alzheimer’s, I was very agitated. It was so bad that I even scolded my wife: ‘Why didn’t you take care of me?’” said a fit-looking Mr Chong, who was an avid long-distance runner before the diagnosis.









When he could not even fill in a form and struggled to speak logically, his wife of 23 years Lynn Chong tried to dissuade him from resuming work at their tuition centre. At first, he refused to accept the reality.
“He said, ‘If I’m back at work … I’ll be back to my old self,’” she recounted. “One month later, one of his colleagues called me and asked me if something was wrong. They found out that George was very forgetful.”
There are an estimated 40,000 persons living with dementia in Singapore, and this number is expected to double by 2030.
More alarmingly, what was once considered an “old person’s” disease is now affecting younger adults like Mr Chong, who featured on the programme Talking Point. (Watch the episode here.)
By 2016, the National Neuroscience Institute (NNI) Neuroscience Clinic (Tan Tock Seng Hospital Campus) was seeing a fivefold increase – over five years – in patients with young-onset dementia, which affects those aged 65 and below.

WHY IT AFFECTS YOUNGER FOLKS
Dementia is a term that describes a number of different conditions affecting the brain, and it robs patients of their memory and daily functions.
An estimated 4,000 people in Singapore have young-onset dementia. Many are still working and have young families when the disease sets in, the NNI said in 2016.
A study by the institute found that these patients face substantial health, social and financial problems, as well as a diminished quality of life.
It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.
“Patients are reported to have shorter survival, more rapid cognitive deterioration, greater frequency of language disturbance, as well as early and more severe behavioural changes as compared to older patients with dementia,” said the NNI.









For example, Mr Chong finally had to stop work in 2016 when his symptoms worsened.
Talking Point host Steven Chia, who is two years younger, observed moments when Mr Chong would forget bits of information he had just shared with him or would have difficulty finding the right words to express himself.
“Those are the kinds of symptoms that are not apparent to the rest of us,” said Mr Chia. “It’s hard to imagine what he has to live with every day.”







                                    

Mr Chong struggles to put names to faces in old photos.



So how can one tell if a person has dementia? The bottom line is that patients usually must undergo a magnetic resonance imaging for confirmation.
What is clear is that the two leading causes of young-onset dementia are Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia.
The latter develops when mini strokes occur in the brain. Over time, these undetected blood clots damage blood vessels and, eventually, parts of the brain. The more common cause, however, is Alzheimer’s, a neurodegenerative disease that causes brain cell death.
And when young-onset dementia results, especially as early as the age of 50, it is partly a genetic inheritance, noted Associate Professor Philip Yap, the director of Khoo Teck Puat Hospital’s Geriatric Centre.
“Having a family member with young-onset dementia would definitely increase the risk … (to) the children,” he said.
He added that the rising number of younger patients being diagnosed is also partly caused by the upward trend in lifestyle diseases, such as diabetes and high blood pressure, with more people suffering a stroke at a younger age.

FOR A SPOUSE, LOSING 'A SIDEKICK'
As dementia hits career people in the prime of their lives, it devastates both the individual and the family.
Mrs Chong, who used to be a homemaker, started teaching part-time in 2016 to support her husband and their three children.
“I hadn’t worked for 20-plus years … The priority has always been family. George was always the one working,” she said.
I feel as if I’m doing everything myself now. It used to be that I had a sidekick, but now no longer.
To add to her load, she struggles with her husband’s memory loss and cognitive decline.
“Even simple things like, if there’s a bowl of food and we’re sharing it, I used to say ‘Okay, you just leave a certain portion for me’. He’d say, ‘Yeah, yeah.’ But by the time I come back, the food’s all gone,” she said.









Often, she has to oversee him when he does the chores, and it tires her out. “There are times when I give instructions, he nods and says yes, then he turns around and he’ll do something else,” she added.
“On certain days, I think that I’m not helping him. I feel as if I’m pressuring him.”
(Read the commentary: Dementia caregivers put on a brave front – while watching loved ones fade away)
A PLACE TO FIT IN
This year, Mr Chong found work at the Alzheimer's Disease Association’s ADAcafe in Toa Payoh, which provides a form of engagement for people with young-onset dementia.
Cafe supervisor Geraldine Sim said she must brief him on his everyday tasks “each time he comes”. “That’s part of being forgetful, but we make it very light-hearted ... We don’t make a big deal about being forgetful,’” she said.
We want to provide a place where they can … be themselves, knowing that whatever mistake they make, everybody is accommodating.
Indeed, Mr Chong makes the effort with his tasks, which include washing dishes and serving food. While the work is a far cry from what he used to do, he is not complaining, but rather is grateful for the opportunity.









ADA chief executive officer Jason Foo explained that the cafe was set up in 2016 precisely because people with young-onset dementia often cannot hold down a regular job, yet are too young to retire.
He hopes that the physical and mental engagement there will slow down their disease or the deterioration of their condition.
Another consideration is that other patients at dementia day-care centres or senior care centres are typically about 70 to 75 years old.
“To someone who’s younger, in her 50s or 40s … it just feels completely out of place,” said Mr Foo.
“When we spoke to this group of people, a lot of them said, ‘Can I do something so that I can feel I’m part of society? Don’t lock me away in a day-care centre.’”







                                    

Before he got dementia, Mr Chong authored two chemistry books and had his own tuition agency.



HOW TO REDUCE THE RISK
To prevent dementia, the Age Well Every Day programme, which aims to help people improve their brain health and stay active, is being scaled up to more neighbourhood centres across the island.
But, for starters, a healthy lifestyle always helps, said National University Health System (NUHS) senior consultant psychiatrist Kua Ee Heok, who advised against a high cholesterol diet, smoking and having too much alcohol.
“These are things that lead on to high blood pressure, diabetes and narrowing of the blood vessels to the brain, and then you’re more prone to (dementia),” he said.
Another tip from Professor Kua: Listen to music, which can help to stimulate one's memory.
“Some people would tell me that when they heard a song, they knew exactly who the people beside them were (in the past) because the song left an imprint in their mind. It causes them happiness,” he said.







                                    

Listening to music can help stimulate the brain.



And apparently, regular dancing is rated as an even better activity. One study found that it reduces the risk of dementia by 76 per cent – twice as much as reading.
This is because dancing requires co-ordination that activates several brain regions, and it improves one’s mood, memory and cognitive functions, as well as relieves stress.
Prof Kua also suggests walking in parks and immersing in a green environment, to get away from the urban jungle.
“This is something very therapeutic. We’ve done the research and found that it lowers the heart rate and blood pressure. This is very important,” he explained.
“You’re able to restore the mental faculties better – (you’re) more relaxed and able to cope with stress.”









The NUHS researchers have proposed that the National Parks Board build therapy gardens round the island, so people can appreciate nature and “walk mindfully” as they get to know the plants around them.
“And it’s wonderful for them because the brain functions,” added Prof Kua.
While there is still no cure for dementia, the risk of developing the disease can thus be reduced in many ways, from exercising regularly and eating healthily to doing crossword puzzles and even playing certain video games to stimulate the brain.

A Dutch painter in the 1800s and one of the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art, Van Gogh suffered from several mental breakdowns in his life.
He often neglected his physical health. 
His friendship with a close friend and fellow painter, Paul Gauguin ended after a purported mental episode in which Van Gogh severed part of his own left ear and offered it to a prostitute.
As a result of his mental breakdowns, he spent extended periods of time in several psychiatric hospitals in the last few years of his life. After his last discharge, he moved to a place near Paris.
But his depression persisted and on Jul 27, 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.
Although it is difficult to say with certainty, Van Gogh may have well suffered from bipolar disorder. He had episodes of extreme elevated moods and episodes of severe depression.
It is not an uncommon illness. In a Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2010, we found that 1.2 per cent of Singaporeans suffered from this condition in their lifetime.

INVINCIBLE AND POWERFUL, THEN DEPRESSIVE AND WITHDRAWN 
Bipolar disorder is a very complex illness. Like many mental disorders, there are no obvious external signs. Rather, a person is susceptible to episodes of extreme moods.
They could have periods of extreme euphoria. During these episodes, they may feel invincible and powerful. They may feel rich or have the belief that they have special powers.
Sufferers have grandiose ideas or may perform irrational acts such as starting up several companies or buying 10 bedframes to give away.
During this state of extreme euphoria, they may also experience other symptoms including feeling like they have unlimited energy, their mind racing from idea to idea, or feel that they don’t need sleep. In milder cases, they may have spells of extreme creativity or productivity.
Then the pendulum swings, giving way to depressive episodes. Those who suffer from bipolar disorder would be thrown into extremely low moods. Many become socially withdrawn and in severe cases, feel keenly that life is not worth living.

Studies have shown that even between episodes, those who suffer from the illness have a greater degree of mood swings compared to the general population. Understandably, this paints a rather grim prognosis for anyone with the illness.
Stigma, dealing with the day-to-day challenges of a chronic illness, caregiver burden, its effects on the various facets of a person’s life (including career and family), all make it difficult to live with the illness.
LIVING WITH THE ILLNESS, FEELING LIFE MORE DEEPLY
However, while it is a complex illness, those who suffer from it should not feel like they have to go through it alone in the same way Van Gogh did.
Indeed, World Bipolar Day is not meant to be a day of grimness and negativity but a celebration of uniqueness and strength.
Author and psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison wrote in her autobiography An Unquiet Mind about her struggles living with the illness and how difficult it was to accept that she needed medication. However, she ended with a rhetorical question. If given a choice, would she still choose to have the illness?
She said that she would not if she had not received treatment. But with medication, her answer was different. She said the illness had enabled her to feel things more deeply, to experience both life and death intimately, and to experience loyalty and care.







                                    

Screengrab of YouTube video of author and psychologist Kay Redfield Jamison. 




Although her autobiography was written in the 1980s, much of this still holds true today. There are more medication available to treat bipolar disorder today than in the 1980s. While they do not offer a cure, the medication help stabilise severe mood episodes.
OVERCOME THE STIGMA OF MEDICATION
A common fallacy is that once the mood episodes have been treated, medicines are no longer required.
However, it is recommended that such medication or mood stabilisers be taken on a regular basis. Doing so has been shown to help those who suffer from bipolar disorder manage mood swings in between episodes.
Many see medication as a reminder of their illness and a crutch. Some even see it as causing harm.
Indeed, many may feel like they need to stop their medication, in order to show they have recovered and can move on with life. It may be encouraged by friends and family.
There is also the fear that employers would discriminate against them if they learn about their illness and that it would render them uninsurable by healthcare insurance providers.
Yet, the goal of treatment is to enable a person to live a normal and full life, free from the severe mood episodes and mood swings. There is no reason why a person living with bipolar disorder should not be able to complete school, find a job, advance in their career and find love.

A CELEBRATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT
Today, beyond medication, there are resources and support groups available to help the person on their journey.
Specific therapies have been shown to help a person remain stable and well. Support groups and online information are available to help both the sufferer and caregivers learn to cope with such an illness.
Kay Redfield Jamison eventually became a professor of psychiatry at the John Hopkins University School of Medicine. 
Many famous and successful people similarly struggled with and overcame bipolar disorder to achieve success in their fields.
Among them count Winston Churchill, the British prime minister during World War II, Carrie Fisher who starred as Princess Leia in Star Wars and famed singers like Demi Lovato and Sinead O’Connor.
So let’s celebrate World Bipolar Day. It’s a celebration of how far we have come in the management of this illness.
It’s a celebration of every struggle that those who suffer the illness had to face and overcome.
It’s a celebration of those who fell down and picked themselves up again and ultimately, a celebration of the human spirit.
