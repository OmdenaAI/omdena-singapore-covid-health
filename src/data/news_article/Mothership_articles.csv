Image via TAFEP    In addition, TAFEP has also stated that employers should remove all declarations on mental health condition from the job application forms.  Not abiding by TAFEP guidelines in the future may render employers liable to enforcement actions by the Ministry of Manpower on the grounds of discrimination.According to The Straits Times, TAFEP has engaged more than 8,000 employers to raise awareness.Halimah Yacob affirms TAFEP's recent guidelines update On Jan. 20, President Halimah Yacob posted an update on Facebook, affirming TAFEP's recent move.Halimah stated:""Many have campaigned against a requirement in job application forms for a person to state his or mental health condition. I’m really glad that the Tripartite Alliance for Fair Employment Practices has now declared that this is discriminatory. Indeed it is."" She continued by saying that applicants with mental health conditions will not get the job if they are honest in their declarations, yet are also susceptible to dismissal by their employers if they hide their condition and it is subsequently discovered.Halimah ended off her post by saying  that the practice of having to declare one's mental health condition is not only discriminatory but also a ""major contributing factor as to why people with mental health issues do not seek treatment"". Previously, a 2016 study by Institute of Mental Health found that one in seven people here have experienced a mental health condition at some point in their life.

2,"MOE to tackle bullying & mental health with peer support structure, curriculum revision",https://mothership.sg/2021/03/mental-health-bullying-moe-cos-2021/,"March 03, 2021, 05:15 PM "," The Ministry of Education (MOE) will strengthen support for students' mental well being across the education system this year.Dedicated key personnel to oversee students' well-being During the Committee of Supply (COS) debate on March 3, Minister of State for MOE Sun Xueling said that starting in 2021, schools will appoint a dedicated key personnel to oversee peer support and student well-being matters. This key personnel will consist of experienced teachers in the school's student development teams.They will oversee and implement prevention and intervention measures to create a peer support culture in students' learning, social, and cyber spaces.They will also tap on peer supporters to positively influence and support students involved in bullying and cyber issues.According to MOE, all schools are expected to have appointed these key personnel by the end of 2021.Peer support MOE is also on track to have a peer support structure and culture in every primary, secondary, and pre-university schools by end-2021.This will allow students look out for one another and encourage those in distress to seek help from trusted adults, such as their parents, teachers or school counsellors.Schools will also train up to five per cent of students as peer support leaders (PSLs) to anchor a supportive network in the school.As PSLs, they will promote positive mindsets, prosocial behaviours both online and offline, and be a good role model to other students.Revising CCE curriculum The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum will be revised to make it more authentic, relevant and purposeful for students.The revised curriculum will have a strengthened mental health and cyber wellness education, explained Sun.""We recognise the nexus between increasing digital usage and mental health concerns, even more so amongst our young who may not know how to regulate the use of social media,"" explained Sun.Sun added that teachers will work alongside student peer supporters to look out for other students. MOE will also work with parents to help guide their children in the use of online media.During CCE lessons, students will learn to identify risks in the digital space, such as doxing or scams, discern unverified or inappropriate content, and take steps to protect themselves and others.Schools will also guide students to report cyber-bullying and harmful content to the online service provider.In secondary schools and pre-university, students will also have regular discussions on contemporary issues, such as environmental sustainability, and race and religion.According to MOE, the revised curriculum will be progressively implemented in all schools from this year, starting with the secondary level.Sun said:""Through CCE 2021, we hope that students will be equipped to become more resilient, and to be healthy, and engage one another respectfully and constructively on issues."" New mental wellness curriculum in poly and ITE The Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs) are similarly strengthening their ongoing efforts to support students' mental health, said Sun.MOE is introducing a new mental wellness curriculum for all Year 1 students in polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) from AY2020 and AY2021 respectively.The curriculum was designed in collaboration with the Health Promotion Board (HPB) to raise awareness and understanding of mental health, through topics such as identifying risk factors and stress.It also aims to teach students to understand signs of anxiety and depression, and encourage early help-seeking behaviour.Besides the new curriculum, the polytechnics and ITE, in collaboration with HPB, will roll out a common training programme for peer supporters from 2021 to 2023.Peer supporters will be trained on a range of key skillsets, such as active listening, how to recognise signs of distress, and having a deeper appreciation of the importance of self-care.This will better equip them to look out for one another's well-being and alert a trusted adult if their peers are feeling distressed or facing mental health issues.Peer support structures will also be enhanced, including through regular supervision of and greater recognition for peer supporters.Additionally, the IHLs will continue to build community partnerships, partnering community organisations to further amplify mental well-being messages, including raising awareness of support available to students and youths in the community.More CCE training for teachers Previously during the COS debate, education minister Lawrence Wong had said that teachers will be receiving more help this year to be better equipped to support the students' mental well-being.Wong announced that MOE will be strengthening PD for teachers in CCE and establishing a centre for CCE in the National Institute of Education (NIE) by end-2022.The centre will provide thought leadership for CCE and conduct CCE-related research to inform policy and practice, with greater emphasis on practice and pedagogy in the local context.It will also collaborate with schools to enhance learning of CCE, and provide pre-service and in-service professional development (PD) courses, with various forms of certifications.MOE and the NIE have developed a new pre-service CCE course to equip all student-teachers with the fundamental content and skills to teach CCE.Almost all secondary schools now have four specialised CCE teachers to role model and mentor other teachers in facilitating challenging discussions in CCE lessons.From 2022 onwards, all pre-universities will also have a group of specialised CCE teachers to facilitate learning in CCE, including topics that may be complex and/or sensitive.""Our goal is for every teacher to be a CCE teacher and we will provide them full support to achieve this,"" said Wong.Top image from MOE/FB for illustration purposes only.

3,S'porean resilience not possible without improving mental health support: NMP Anthea Ong,https://mothership.sg/2020/02/mental-health-budget-2020-anthea-ong/,"February 27, 2020, 09:39 AM "," Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Finance Heng Swee Keat's calls for strengthening resilience among Singaporeans are not possible without tackling mental health issues in Singapore, said Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong in her Budget 2020 debate speech on Wednesday (Feb. 26).In what she said was ""likely [her] last Budget speech"", Ong, a social entrepreneur, called on the government to improve the affordability, accessibility, and quality of mental healthcare in Singapore -- the same theme of her maiden speech in Parliament.Resilience can't happen without supporting good mental health  Ong referenced Heng's Budget speech, which he gave on Tuesday, Feb. 18, in which he mentioned the word ""resilience"" multiple times.While she thanked Heng and his MOF team for their hard work on a ""generous"" Budget, Ong said she was disappointed that mental health was not mentioned.She added: ""The ability to adapt to significant and adverse changes we call resilience is not happenstance -- it is enabled by good mental health.""She noted there had been a rise in the prevalence of mental illness in Singapore over the past two decades.Ong and her team conducted a public consultation Ong drew from over 400 responses that she and her team received in the public consultation on mental health they conducted earlier this year, the first done in Singapore.Ong and her team will be sharing their findings from the public consultations online here.Of the 400 responses, she said, 70 per cent were from people with lived experiences, while the remainder were from caregivers and mental healthcare professionals.Improving affordability, accessibility, and quality of mental healthcare Affordability: 66 per cent of the respondents said that mental healthcare costs were high, while others had stopped seeking treatment for financial reasons.""How is it that our world-class healthcare system has denied so many people the mental healthcare that they need?"", Ong asked.She pointed out there is a significant difference between treating physical health as compared to mental health for the limits of Medisave and Medishield Life.  Medisave: Inpatient claim limit of S$450 per day for physical health conditions, as compared to S$150 per day for psychiatric treatment.  MediShield Life: Claim limit of S$700 per day for inpatient treatment of physical health conditions in a normal ward, versus the limit of S$100 a day for inpatient psychiatric treatment.  Ong called for the limits to be made equal for physical and mental health conditions, in order to remove the ""entrenched stigma"" surrounding mental health issues.Accessibility: In Singapore, there are 4.4 psychiatrists and 8.3 psychologists for every 100,000 people. The overall median waiting time for new subsidised appointments across public hospitals is 27 days to see a psychiatrist, and 28 days to see a psychologist.71 respondents cited they did not seek help because of a lack of relevant and trusted information.However, she said, she was encouraged by respondents who praised CHAT (Community Health Assessment Team), a public healthcare initiative by IMH located within the community.CHAT provides free and confidential mental health check service and care navigation, including subsidised referral for public mental healthcare services if required.Ong hoped that this could be expanded to support people of all ages, and not just youths at present.Quality: 36 per cent of respondents explicitly mentioned the lack of empathy shown by the mental healthcare professionals they interacted with, as well as the ""dismal environment"" of the psychiatric wards in public hospitals.Ong was not trying to imply that all mental healthcare professionals are ""incompetent or without heart"", and many respondents felt the poor quality could be due to ""the excessive workload which strains both professionals and the system"".She emphasised the importance of feedback and public consultations with people with lived experiences and their caretakers when putting together plans such as the Community Mental Health Masterplan, launched by the Ministry of Health (MOH) in 2017.She added that she would speak more about issues surrounding mental healthcare for vulnerable communities, such as LGBTQ+ people, migrant workers and the differently abled during the upcoming Committee of Supply Debates.Necessary paradigm shifts Ong also highlighted paradigm shifts needed to be made in order to ""move beyond mental healthcare to total wellbeing for every Singaporean"".She mentioned considerations the government could make, such as treating mental health as a public health issue.This could result in measures like conducting mental health screening for students, similar to physical health and dental checks.In the workplace, employees could be allowed to use sick leave for mental health treatment or recovery.Another shift would be to recognise that mental health is something that affects all of us, and that it is a ""critical part of total well-being"". Said Ong:""Strong mental health support at schools and workplace directly impacts how we show up for our roles in our family and community - which contributes to how we support our children as parents, our elderly parents as caregivers, and how we build strong ties and connections with our friends, our colleagues and our neighbours."" Message to Singaporeans: it's not your fault Ong noted that Singaporeans' mental wellbeing ""forms the bedrock of our psychological resilience and social cohesion"", said Ong.She directly asked Heng what needs to happen for mental health to be a ""national and budget priority"" and called on the government to make quality mental healthcare accessible and affordable for all Singaporeans.Ong closed her speech with a powerful message to Singaporeans:""To Singaporeans, I invite you to remember that wherever you are on the mental health continuum is not solely a matter of personal agency but also largely determined by your social support structures, or lack of.So if you are struggling right now, I hope you know it’s not a personal failing. We are all responsible for each other’s mental wellbeing, including the Government and institutions.You have, in fact, shown us what true resilience is by fiercely living each day with less-than-adequate state support in mental healthcare whilst constantly dealing with structural stigma and discriminative behaviours.""

4,"""Strong, United S'pore"" only possible if mental health is a S'pore govt priority: NMP Anthea Ong",https://mothership.sg/2019/02/anthea-ong-mental-health-budget-2019/,"February 27, 2019, 04:47 PM "," While other MPs kicked off the Budget 2019 debate by discussing various aspects of the budget and industry sectors, Nominated MP Anthea Ong chose to take a different tack.In her maiden Budget speech on Wednesday, Feb. 27, Ong, a social entrepreneur, acknowledged inequality, ageing population and climate change as long-term challenges facing Singapore, but something that's so far not been discussed is the issue of mental health and well-being.""Mental wellbeing must be an ongoing national and whole-of-government priority with the recognition that our quality of life is defined not only by markers of economic growth and our material wellbeing but also our subjective wellbeing. We must constantly question if our national policies and spending empower, beyond just enabling, our people to be ready for challenges ahead and confident of our future.""  Personal experiences with mental health issues In her speech, Ong shared her own personal experiences with depression.She mentioned her own ""close shave"" with depression 12 years ago, despite having achieved professional and economic success.Ong also talked about the people she had known in her life who had their own experience with mental health issues.These include a colleague who almost committed suicide even though he was being treated for depression, a neighbour who started sleeping at a void deck after his wife's death, a taxi driver whose grandfather committed suicide while the rest of his family was eating breakfast just inside where he jumped, and her own teenage nephew, who was diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder.People of all ages are affected Ong pointed out that her nephew was not alone, with more young Singaporeans seeking help with mental health issues:  The number of Singaporeans between 16 and 30 who sought help from the Institute of Mental Health's (IMH) Community Health Assessment Team has risen by 190 per cent over the past three years.  The number of children aged five to nine calling the SOS hotline gone up more than fivefold in less than three years.  Suicide is the leading cause of death in Singapore for those aged 10 - 29.  She also said young Singaporeans are the group most at risk of suffering from mental disorders, according to the December 2018 Singapore Mental Health Study.But Ong also cited more statistics to show that working adults and the elderly are also at risk if mental health issues are not addressed:  90 per cent of psychological conditions in working Singaporean adults are caused by workplace stress.  86.5 per cent of employed workers do not seek help with mental health difficulties.  The mental well-being of working adults in Singapore is 13 per cent lower than the general population.  20 per cent of Singaporeans aged 75 and above show signs of depression.  The number of Singaporeans aged 60 and above who committed suicide was the highest in 2017, since records began in 1991.  Ong added that vulnerable communities like elderly caregivers, migrant workers and single-parent heads of households were also at high risk of suffering from mental health issues.1 in 9 S'poreans suffer from diabetes, but 1 in 7 have mental health conditions And while the government has declared a war on diabetes, Ong pointed out that diabetes affects one in nine Singaporeans (in 2017), while mental health conditions affect one in seven Singaporeans.This is an increase from one in eight Singaporeans, just eight years ago.Ong acknowledged the importance of addressing the challenges that come with our ageing population in policy-making.""Yet, there is clear and present danger that the invisible yet mounting challenge of mental health could be headed that way with the escalating prevalence. We must therefore make mental health a deafening priority now rather than languishing it in the shadows because mental health affects the lives of Singaporeans across all ages and segments.""    Screen shot from Samaritans of Singapore.   View mental health as a ""basic need"", reduce stigma in seeking help Ong made some suggestions on how the government could proceed with tackling the issue.The first is to normalise mental health, reduce stigma and view it as a basic need, and bring it out into the open.This is important when 86.5 per cent of those employed don't seek help for mental health difficulties, and two-thirds don't seek help due to stigma and discrimination.The second is to recognise that support for mental health should not be the sole purview of the Ministry of Health.Instead, the impact any policy may have on mental health should be considered across the whole of government.Ong also suggested that optional mental health programmes in schools should be made mandatory, to provide better support and help normalise the issue.She also proposed that the Workplace Health and Safety Act could be updated to also cover mental as well as physical well-being.Long-term focus needed Ong said she doubted that ""one-off and discriminate bonus payouts"" would be enough to allow citizens to thrive ""mentally and confidently"".""The way we look at mental health reminds me of climate change, Mr. Speaker. It’s invisible, and so it gets parked mindlessly and incorrectly in the ‘important but not urgent’ quadrant of our awareness. Yet like climate change, it’s our future — our young ones — that we are jeopardising most if we continue with a transactional approach in addressing the challenge."" Instead, she suggested that a national coordinating body be established to improve mental well-being. Said Ong:""It’s time for the government to recognise, acknowledge and understand the complexity of mental health and to create opportunities and solutions to improve the lives of our people, especially our children and youth.It’s time to redefine our values as a nation as cherish every individual’s subjective well-being, dreams and aspirations beyond just their material and economic achievements. It can be done, it must be done because mental health is what makes us human."" Related stories: Top image from Parliament and Samaritans of Singapore. ",FALSE,

MOM added that such incidents stem from ""issues that migrant workers face back home such as marital or familial issues, or unforeseen mishaps in their home countries"".Due to the Covid-19 situation, migrant workers may face delays in returning to their home countries.MOM cited factors such as the need to ensure workers have fully recovered and have taken a swab test for the delay.Meanwhile, MOM is taking actions to ensure migrant workers' mental health is taken care of.Taking care of migrant workers' mental health To provide mental health support and assistance to the workers, MOM has been working with non-governmental organisations (NGO)s, such as the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) and HealthServe.According to MOM, MWC’s Helpline has received about 300 calls a week during this period.Meanwhile, HealthServe has counselled over 700 migrant workers since mid-April this year.These NGOs will follow up closely with the workers on their respective issues and will escalate them to MOM for further actions if necessary.MOM has also made ""considerable effort"" to keep the workers updated on Covid-19 related efforts.This is done through daily messages and materials in the workers' languages to promote their mental health and well-being.""These materials encourage workers to identify symptoms of distress, look out for one another, be a buddy to a friend, and know where to seek help,"" stated MOM.The Forward Assurance & Support Teams (FAST) have also stepped up vigilance to proactively look out for workers whom they assess may benefit from speaking to a mental health counsellor.MOM has worked with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) to train and better equip frontline staff to help workers who need support.Plans to allow workers to leave their dorms In addition to taking care of the migrant workers' mental health, MOM is also planning to reduce the effect of isolation.It has scheduled time for workers to leave their rooms and access common areas.MOM has also worked with the NGOs to run activities for the workers.For example, HealthServe conducts activities such as exercise sessions for workers staying at cruise ships thrice a week.When community and dormitory cases have been sustained at low levels for a period of time, MOM has plans to allow the workers to leave their dormitories for Recreational Centres (RCs) in a measured and safe manner.Helplines MOM has advised all workers not to put themselves in harm's way if they encounter problems.Those who may be facing any issues can call the MWC's 24-hour helpline at 6536 2692 or Healthserve at +65 31384443.They can also reach out to MOM online if they require assistance.""MOM will be able to better assist and help workers solve their problems sooner if they do not act rashly.""

8,Feeling 'heat & anger': EDB chief opens up about recent mental health struggle,https://mothership.sg/2020/11/chng-kai-fong/,"November 23, 2020, 09:12 PM "," A top bureaucrat in Singapore has opened up about his struggles with mental health amid the Covid-19 pandemic, Bloomberg reports.The man in question is Chng Kai Fong, managing director of the Economic Development Board (EDB).He was also the principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong from 2014 to 2017. Chng, who was part of a panel during a virtual technology conference, She Loves Tech, on November 2, opened up about the ""unprecedented year in terms of personal crisis"".He lost his brother-in-law to cancer in April. Another close family member is also going through serious mental health issues.The emotional and mental state that Chng found himself in was very unique, he said, and one that he had never experienced before.There were physiological symptoms that manifested, according to Chng:“There was this feeling of heat and anger starting with palms and then sort of moves towards your entire body.” “There was one day when I couldn’t even wake up,"" he added.""I had to really drag myself out at 11:30 and go for a run because I knew these were signs of depressive bouts. Even during the run, I was super breathless. It was a bad sign.” In its report, Bloomberg quoted a Mercer survey which found that more senior management (jumping from 9 per cent to 33 per cent) reported experiencing high levels of stress during the pandemic.Chng said that he decided to share about his experience with people who might face pressure to lead during uncertain times.He found that acknowledging that ""it's OK not to be OK"" helped him to cope with the pressure. He also suggested pro-actively seeking help.Chng said that while such situations will always take time to heal, he decided to openly share his experience with others who might be facing mounting pressure to lead during times of fear and uncertainty.One thing that helped him cope is to “acknowledge that it’s OK not to be OK,” he said. Another thing is to pro-actively seek help.“We can do a lot more as leaders to acknowledge that and to share a little bit more about ourselves. And that builds trust.” We deliver more stories to you on LinkedIn Top image via Challenge/PSD. ",TRUE,

HealthServe's dedicated hotline which provides medical information and tele-counselling sessions.  The HealthServe hotline, which was launched in April 2020, has received more than 15,000 enquiries and helped more than 1,100 workers, said Teo.Being able to return to work can also help to prevent ""isolation-induced stress"" and address anxiety over job stability, said Teo.The testing and clearing of workers in dormitories have helped workers to return to their work faster, she said.""This process started in June and was completed in mid-August. As of 31 Aug, close to 90 per cent of workers in the dormitories are able to resume work."" The manpower ministry has also started trials to allow residents of selected cleared dormitories to visit Recreation Centres on their rest days at staggered timings. MOM is also working with NGOs to provide workers with free hair cuts and other ""mental wellness engagement activities"".Foreign Worker Ambassador, FAST teams identify distressed workers Forward Assurance & Support Teams (FAST) are also trained to identify and manage mental health issues. Complementing this team is the Migrant Worker Centre's network of 5,000 Foreign Worker Ambassadors who proactively look out for distressed migrant workers to understand their key concerns so that the right help can be given quickly.The ministry also sends daily bulletins to dormitory operators, the Migrant Worker Centre Ambassadors, and foreign worker mobile applications. These bulletins feature doctors' advice on how one can protect oneself and recovered workers' experience.MOM has also facilitated the departure of workers who wanted to return home.""There are signs that these measures have helped,"" said Teo.""After calls to the MWC Helpline spiked to 700 calls per week during circuit breaker, call volume has reduced to around 500 a week now. This is not too far from the pre-Covid-19 call volume of around 400 a week. We will continue to monitor and support the workers closely."" Related stories: Top image via MOM. ",TRUE,

11,Sick leave can be used for both mental & physical health conditions: Zaqy Mohamad,https://mothership.sg/2020/03/mom-mental-health-sick-leave/,"March 03, 2020, 04:58 PM "," Sick leave can be used for both mental and physical health conditions, Minister of State for Ministry of Manpower (MOM) Zaqy Mohamad stated during the Committee of Supply debates in Parliament on Feb. 3.In issuing a medical certificate, doctors should not indicate the nature of the patient's health condition to the employer, unless the patient has consented to it, he added.Zaqy's statement was in response to a suggestion by Nominated Member of Parliament Anthea Ong, in her Budget 2020 debate speech on Feb. 26, in which employees could be allowed to use sick leave for mental health treatment or recovery. Employers should not ask job applicants about their mental health On top of that, employers should not be asking job applicants about their mental health, he further stated.They are expected to practise fair and merit-based employment practices, as defined within the Tripartite Guidelines on Fair Employment Practices, he added.Previously in Jan., the Tripartite Alliance for Fair and Progressive Employment Practices (TAFEP) updated its guidelines, advising employers that they “should not ask job applicants to declare personal information such as their mental health condition unless there is a job related requirement.”In addition, TAFEP has also stated that employers should remove all declarations on mental health condition from the job application forms.Not abiding by TAFEP guidelines in the future may render employers liable to enforcement actions by the Ministry of Manpower on the grounds of discrimination.Only certain jobs can ask for such information The only situations where it is reasonable to ask for applicants for such information is for certain jobs such as pilots and police officers, Zaqy said.In such cases, some mental health conditions may affect their ability to perform their job roles safely.Hence, information on mental health is necessary for such employers to make a holistic assessment of well-being.Tripartite advisory on mental health to be formulated Zaqy then said that he agreed with Ong that employers have an important role to play in supporting the mental well-being of their employees.Here, he highlighted that as per Ong's suggestion, the government will formulate a Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being, for the purpose of educating employers on what can be done.The advisory will then highlight initiatives that companies should emulate, including progressive practices such as providing access to anonymised external counselling service, or training supervisors to identify mental health symptoms early.The advisory will also seek the views of different stakeholders such as members of the newly announced Youth Mental Well-being Network.Zaqy also noted that Ong had suggested including mental health expenses as part of medical benefits for employees.On this matter, he said that one way it could be done was through including it as part of employer-provided medical benefits that complemented current healthcare financing offerings.Zaqy added that this was something which the tripartite partners could discuss while crafting the Advisory and that the aim was to finalise the advisory in the second half of 2020.MOM will also partner with Labour Movement to address mental health On top of that, MOM will also parter with the Labour Movement to support the well-being of employees and initiate mental health studies.He cited the potential promotion of the usage of iWorkHealth, a web-based psychosocial assessment tool currently being piloted by MOM, for launch later in the year.In elaborating on what the app entailed, Zaqy said that the tool was aimed at helping both employers and their employees identify stressors at the workplace, by raising awareness of factors causing excessive stress.The app will also recommend ways to improve mental well-being.Top image screenshot from gov.sg YouTube ",FALSE,
12,Mental health education to be emphasised in new primary & secondary curriculum,https://mothership.sg/2020/03/moe-mental-health-in-curriculum/,"March 04, 2020, 12:22 PM "," The Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) curriculum in all primary and secondary schools in Singapore will see an enhanced focus on mental health.This new initiative was announced by Education Minister Ong Ye Kung during the Committee of Supply debates on Wednesday (March 4).Will be rolled out progressively from 2021  The Ministry of Education (MOE) has clarified that the new CCE curriculum will be progressively rolled out from 2021.In his speech, Ong explained that the current CCE lessons in schools are already equipping students with socio-emotional competencies.However, the new curriculum will strengthen one important aspect: peer support.Peer support structures Second Minister for Education Indranee Rajah highlighted the importance of fostering a peer support culture within a wider ecosystem comprising teachers, counsellors and external professionals.Some schools, such as Bukit Merah Secondary School, have already introduced the new peer support structures.Indranee quoted an example of a Bukit Merah Secondary student who was trained to be a peer support leader.He was then partnered with a troubled student who was frequently absent from school due to his gaming addiction.The peer support leader ended up playing an important role by being a supportive, encouraging and understanding friend:""The smallest, simplest gestures can make a difference. Anyone can do it. That’s what makes peer support so powerful."" MOE hopes to establish the peer support structures in all schools by 2022. Peer support programmes have also been put in place in the Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs).Enhancing mental health education On Tuesday (March 3), Workers' Party's Daniel Goh filed a Committee of Supply cut suggesting that mental health education in schools be strengthened.Goh explained:""It is not just that the stress of school work creating anxieties and problems with self-worth. But young people are also caught up in social relationships and search for identity in the setting of schools."" Indranee addressed this point in her speech, stating that MOE will also enhance the mental health education in the new CCE curriculum.This curriculum will help students understand common mental health issues, when and how to seek help and support, as well as develop empathy and care towards people with mental illnesses.Schools will also explicitly teach students how to maintain their well-being as well as recognise signs of mental distress.Additional support for those struggling with mental health issues Indranee, however, noted there will still be a small number of students who struggle with mental health issues.For these students, additional support by professionals is needed.To help identify these students, teachers in schools and class advisors in IHLs are trained to pick up distress signs.They are also trained to reach out to students who are facing difficulties and refer them to a counselling professionals in schools if necessary.Students assessed by counsellors to have more serious mental health issues will then be referred to external professionals for further clinical assessment and intervention.Indranee said:""With stronger mental health education and peer support cultures, students will also be able to look out for one another, and seek guidance from teachers and counsellors if they notice that a friend is struggling.""

13,It’s okay to struggle with your mental health during a pandemic. You aren’t alone.,https://mothership.sg/2020/09/mental-health-during-covid-19/,"September 30, 2020, 06:58 PM "," While everyone is busy looking after their physical health amid the Covid-19 pandemic, there’s one thing we often overlook.Our mental health.Fear, anxiety, and stress are some common feelings that may arise during this difficult period.Especially if one is affected by the economic fallout. Like getting retrenched, for example. A short film by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) explores just that — how a man from the sandwich generation struggles to cope with his life and mental health after losing his job.Lost his job The short film begins with the man unpacking.The radio plays softly in the background and we are told that this short film takes place during Singapore’s circuit breaker period.The man then comes across a dusty, old clock with these words engraved on it: ""20 Years Long Service Award 2010 - Ong Soon Teck"". He subsequently tries to fix the broken clock, but his wife enters the room and fusses over what he’s doing. She says: ""Why are you fixing that clock? For goodness sake, not like the company is going to take you back. Throw it away.""He asks for some batteries instead.It soon becomes apparent — the man had lost his job, and he hasn't come to terms with it.Father suffers from dementia The man leaves his home to work as a ride-hailing driver.At one point, he takes off his mask and stares ahead with a blank expression.  He makes a pit stop at his parents’ house to give his mum some fruits.He attempts to give her some allowance money too, but she firmly rejects.""No you keep it for yourself,"" she says. Still standing at the gate, he peeks inside and sees his dad sitting in the living room.He calls out to him a few times.But his dad turns to look at him for a few seconds, looking confused and saying nothing, before looking away.He doesn’t recognise his son as his health and memory is failing day by day.And due to the Circuit Breaker measures, the man can only call out to his father from afar, unable to physically be by his side. Spiralling out of control The next few scenes continue to show the man’s struggles with life, except it gradually gets worse and worse.He reaches his breaking point too in what is arguably the most heart-wrenching part in the entire film.To find out what eventually happens to the man, you can watch the full film here: Key Takeaways As stated at the end of the film:“We are in difficult times. Remember, you are not alone. Talk to your loved ones or seek help early for your mental health.”Taking care of one’s mental health is imperative, especially during tough times like this.It’s also important to remember that mental health conditions know no boundaries.It could very well affect your friend, family, or the person sitting beside you in school or at work.So spread the word to your loved ones, that it is okay to not be okay.

Listen to their story.,https://mothership.sg/2019/10/mental-health-ncss/,"October 16, 2019, 05:52 PM "," Talking about mental health issues can be a challenge because of the stigma that surrounds it.The 2017 Attitude Study by the National Council of Social Service (NCSS) revealed that more than one in two adults in Singapore are not willing to live with, live near or work with a person with mental health conditions.Mental health conditions do not discriminate — it could affect anyone Mental health is an issue that society seeks to address, as this is something that could affect anyone. It could very well be your friend, family, or the person sitting beside you in school or at work. The National Council of Social Service (NCSS) wants to help people understand the stigma that people living with mental health conditions face and how support can help them in their recovery journeys.NCSS hopes to give a brief perspective of real people who have had to deal with their mental health conditions.From the perspective of persons with mental health conditionsThis one-minute clip by NCSS depicts the inner perspective of people who live with mental health conditions.The video shows some of the social hurdles that they face, and the pain that they go through daily, disconnected with their colleagues, friends, and loved ones.It also reflects their desire to reconnect, break out of their shell, and live like everybody else.The video said:""What I really miss most is being able to get out of bed, meet people, have fulfilling relationships, and do my job well.Just like everybody else."" More often than not, understanding the hurdles faced by those with mental health conditions is also a challenge for the people around them.It is important for those who need help to seek help by opening up, and talking about their mental health with those who care.However, this means that the public also plays a key role in creating a conducive environment for those living with mental health conditions to open up, by ditching the stigma and looking beyond the label.From the perspective of a caregiver, employer or friendThese two videos take on the perspective of the caregiver, employer and friend around those who live with mental health conditions.Similar to any medical condition, it is difficult for those who have not been through the pain of the illness to fully understand how the person in recovery feels.However, it is still possible to listen to them, be with them, and respect the needs that people of mental health conditions have, as long as people are willing to look beyond themselves.The key message of both videos:“We need to look beyond ourselves, as caregivers, employers, and friends, to realise your recovery can begin with us.” The road to recovery for any illness, including mental health conditions, is never easy, but the journey can be made less painful and treacherous with supportive friends, colleagues, and family beside them.It is time for us to put aside our labels and stigma, and talk about mental health, and it can only be done if both parties are willing to.Spread the message Spread the word to your friends, colleagues, and loved ones, that it is okay to seek help and talk about mental health.Visit Beyond The Label’s Facebook page to learn more, or talk to their helpbot.

Under this scheme, it is necessary for her to set aside a full retirement sum of S$171,000 in her Retirement Account.  Tan could make withdrawals above a Basic Retirement Sum of S$85,500, but only under certain conditions which she did not fulfil.  Tan would, however, be able to explore using MediSave to cover her son's medical expenses.  Here's what Tan wrote in response:  She needed to withdraw S$70,000 from her CPF for alternative treatment for her son's mental illness.  She said the medicine prescribed by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) for her son allegedly made his condition worse.  The authorities have been heavy-handed in handling her case and that she therefore holds them responsible for any negative consequences, including her son's suicide or her own suicide.  It turns out, though, that there was information that neither the letters nor the TISG article mentioned — namely that Tan and her son were already receiving financial support.Mother and son received ComCare assistance CPF clarified the circumstances of the mother's situation (referred to as ""Madam T"" in their post), and added that both she and her son were receiving assistance.The organisation noted that Madam T is 56 years old, and had already drawn out part of her CPF in 2018.CPF added that Tan's son was 25 years old, and that it was important for Tan to preserve her savings for both their futures.It then highlighted that both of them had been receiving monthly assistance from ComCare since Jan. 2018, and that her son's treatment at IMH was covered under ComCare as well.It further added that IMH was also providing Tan and her son with financial assistance and necessary support, and pointed out that Tan could also approach the Medical Social Worker at IMH for more assistance.The CPF Board then concluded by stating that Tan was receiving support from the Family Service Centre, the Medical Social Worker, as well as CPF's agencies and VWO community partners.
