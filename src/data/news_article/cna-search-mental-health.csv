0,‘Mental health is everyone’s business’: How society can better protect seniors’ mental wellbeing,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-elderly-suicide-death-wellbeing-15187078,09 Jul 2021 05:19PM,"SINGAPORE: Amid a rapidly ageing society, the entire community – down to the individual – has a role to play in caring for the mental wellbeing of seniors, said organisations serving the elderly.Efforts that must be undertaken include looking out for vulnerable seniors, strengthening partnerships between care providers and helping the elderly become more resilient, they said.The mental health of seniors is in the spotlight amid a report by suicide prevention organisation Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) that stated elderly suicides hit a nearly two-decade high in the country last year.Out of the 452 suicides reported in Singapore in 2020, 154 were among people aged 60 and above – the highest recorded figure since 1991.This also marked a 26 per cent increase from the year before, according to SOS.""COVID-19 has severely affected the nation's economy, lifestyle and mental health. We are extremely worried about how our elderly are coping during this public health crisis,"" said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan when the data was released on Thursday.Apart from social isolation, the difficulty in constantly adapting to changes was also a key issue among this group.""IT’S EVERYBODY’S BUSINESS""Moving forward, to better care for seniors’ wellbeing, every member of society has a role to play, said Ms Porsche Poh, the executive director of Silver Ribbon (Singapore).“Some will say it’s the Government’s responsibility, it’s the charity’s responsibility. But mental health is everyone’s business … Everyone has a role to play in promoting a caring society.”She noted that while social service agencies implement programmes to engage the elderly, grassroots organisations and individuals can also reach out to involve those in their circles.One can simply start by paying attention to the elderly in their families, she said.“We’ve really heard of elderly saying they’re very lonely … For the elderly with children, the kids could spend some time just by having a meal with them ... Educate them, speak to them (about mental health),” said Ms Poh.She added: “Show your concern and keep a look out for your neighbours too … Just say: ‘Hello, how are you? Are you okay?’”Ms Joyz Tan, a senior social worker at Fei Yue Community Services, echoed the importance of interactions within the community.""We really hope that the elderly will find that the environment that they stay in is a pleasant one - (where there's a face that they're familiar with) that will say hello to them.“When we have such a vibrant community of people who can still make friends, I think that will really build up a sense of positivity in their lives.”At an organisational level, institutions serving the elderly – such as hospitals and social service agencies – should also partner up because a single agency cannot do everything, said Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation.“When we have discussions, we can talk about the observations we have, what kind of care plan we can come up with and who can do which part - the monitoring, the psychosocial intervention.“That is a very helpful strategy … It is so important that we share the same direction, understand the needs of the client and come up with a more holistic care plan together,” she said.From an operational perspective, the recent relaxation of COVID-19 safe management measures is also an essential move for protecting seniors’ wellbeing, said Ms Poh.This is because face-to-face meetings, which provide a human touch, are critical for seniors who feel isolated, she said.Ms Poh also noted that many prefer in-person meetings as they are not digitally savvy, hence making door-to-door visits all the more important.These must be kept up, she said, stressing that one must not assume all seniors can catch up with technology, even if there are growing efforts to help them go online.“We should know that the elderly can be quite stubborn. You can have all the courses to educate them, but (some are) not ready or do not believe in it.”Ms Wang stressed that this is unfamiliar territory for many seniors, who may lack the confidence to try new things.""It's not so easy for the elderly to step out of their comfort zone ... (We can) be more patient, be more encouraging, help them to learn.""But it is also important to empower the elderly with more confidence and skills to cope with change, she said.So far, the disruptions caused by COVID-19 may have led to fear, anxiety and a sense of helplessness among seniors, and teaching them to examine these could make them more resilient, Ms Wang said.“What’s behind these emotions? I think a lot of times it's the yearning for safety and a sense of control.“So then, we need to help them see … How are we able to learn from these feelings? How are we able to provide some comfort and (soothe) ourselves? And how can they accept that this change could be the new normal?“That's the important part for them to really feel more confident and can take back control in a way,” said Ms Wang.“We do have the ability to make choices to adapt to changes. I think we need to help them to build their confidence,” she said.She also said that helping the elderly tap on these “internal resources” is just as important as giving them external resources.",True,"['COVID-19', 'elderly', 'mental health']",Singapore
1,Commentary: Why annual leave seems less restful without travel and what to do about it,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/best-leave-plans-singapore-recharge-free-what-to-do-travel-rest-15164792,09 Jul 2021 06:30AM,"How can we cultivate better forms of leisure? SUSS’ Dr Brandon Koh explains how to use your next leave to more fully recharge.SINGAPORE: The announcement Singapore may allow leisure travel by year-end by co-chair of the multi-ministry task force and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung was warmly welcomed last week. Many in Singapore have sorely missed holidaying overseas since the pandemic struck.Singapore was ranked the most “vacation deprived” country in the world in Expedia’s 2021 edition of the annual ranking surveying 9,200 consumers in 16 markets.Seven in 10 surveyed said they were either very or somewhat vacation deprived.Travel has been so synonymous with leisure and rest that many employees struggled to clear annual leave in 2020, with employers adjusting leave policies to accommodate them.WHY IS TRAVEL RESTFUL?For many, travel is particularly restful because it is a very different experience from their day-to-day lives. Overseas holidays usually depart from the mundane and are filled with novel experiences.The rejuvenation we find in travelling also arises because almost all activities, be it work, leisure, or even chores are more pleasant uninterrupted.When people can immerse themselves in a single task, like a long holiday overseas, they experience a state which famed psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi terms “flow”.Recall those moments when time seem to fly by when you are fully engrossed in something. Under flow, people feel alert, strongly engaged and at the peak of their abilities. Feeling flow leaves people happy and fulfilled, even when the activities themselves are tiring.In today’s highly connected era, many find themselves constantly tethered to work. Even if one puts aside all their devices off on a weekend, you worry about missing an urgent message from your boss or client. This makes it hard to switch off and soak in day-to-day leisure activities when clearing leave in Singapore.Pre-pandemic leisure travel, however, provided a clear separation from work. People are forced to disconnect due to limited mobile and internet connectivity.Even when connections were available, the social norm was to avoid contacting those on overseas vacations. Travellers too felt less pressure to respond.The high travel expenses and sunk cost fallacy also ironically help people throw themselves in their vacation to savour every moment.CULTURE OF BUSYNESS HAS CHANGED OUR PERSPECTIVE OF LEISUREOur modern “culture of busyness” has reshaped society’s view of leisure. These days, people often readily define work first, and treat leisure as the remaining time one is not working.Interestingly, scholars have found that in the teaching of many early civilisations, people defined and pursued leisure foremost, and work was simply the absence of leisure. Dating back as early as ancient Greece, the philosophers Plato and Aristotle considered leisure the primary avenue where one cultivates the self and discover new knowledge.Leisure was less defined by ease and self-indulgence, as is contemporarily so, but the pursuit of growth, self-examination and ultimately one’s meaning in life. Similar ideas can be seen in various cultures and religious teaching in historical times.Today, many modern societies highly revere people with a strong work ethic. Busy people are seen as highly competent. Some people would even “humblebrag” about how occupied they are with work that they cannot take any leave.In my research, I have found that such feelings of busyness lead to greater productivity and performance for people who do want to feel busy. However, those who feel pressured by society and guilty about not working may find themselves headed for burnout.More importantly, people today are more likely to pursue self-development, growth and meaning in life through their careers, and neglect these important aspects during leisure.The end result is that leisure gradually becomes reduced to a “time off work”, which promotes passive activities such as idling, watching television or shopping.WHY IS TRAVEL A “GOOD” FORM OF LEISURE?The process from pre- to post-travel provides a sense of progress and growth through planning, pursuing, and completing one’s goals and bucket lists.Being physically present in the moment when we travel can be taxing - recall the stress of navigating, trouble communicating with locals, bugs on the hikes, and worries of pickpockets lurking in the crowds.Yet, as the trip fades into the past, people usually recall a positive and abstract snapshot, sharing stories of the serene landscapes or how Paris is the “City of Love”.Travel also provides many opportunities for self-development and discovery. We learn about other cultures which contributes to one’s sense of growth. In fact, multicultural experiences improve our creative abilities according to Dr Angela Leung’s research at the Singapore Management University.For others, travel can help complete a personal challenge, such as climbing a difficult mountain or braving their first bungee jump.The dedicated time set aside during travel can also allow one to cultivate meaningful relationships with travel partners in connecting with each other.HOW TO CULTIVATE BETTER LEISURE?On the bright side, our inability to travel today provides a chance to reflect on how to cultivate a higher quality of everyday leisure. Depending on whether other countries lift their quarantine requirements and costs, we might not choose to travel even if Singapore unilaterally relaxes our restrictions.It starts by being mindful about which leisure activities bring us happiness.The American Time Use Survey estimates that Americans watch television 40 per cent of the time. Yet, they also report this as less enjoyable than other activities but say it is cheap, easy, and convenient. Many in Singapore can relate to this in the new normal.Paradoxically, research finds that passive leisure activities are not restful and may even increase feelings of fatigue, apathy and lethargy.A 2018 study from the University of Buffalo also show that sedentary, passive leisure activities are frequently linked to eating and weight gain.Leisure activities are more restful when they differ in nature from work-like activities, research generally indicates. A hobby such as pottery or woodworking can be restful, and even spark creativity if the experience vastly differs from someone’s paid day job.I recommend that readers explore “deep play” - activities people pursue with intense focus and dedication. They are rewarding on their own, involving a degree of challenge but carry additional personal significance for the individual.Quite often, they cultivate the same skills people develop from work, but are channelled towards a non-work activity. In this way, deep play also forms an integration between work and rest.Mountaineering, for instance, demands careful planning, resource optimisation, and fostering camaraderie with one’s teammates among other skills.The physically gruelling process tests the limits of one’s adaptivity and resilience. Yet, reaching the peak can be one of the most satisfying and psychologically restful experiences.So find a sport or art that ignites your passion, and channel your free-time, skill and energy towards it during your leave days. You may discover that such deep play recharges your psychological reserves to perform at work – even if you don’t get to travel this year.Dr Brandon Koh is an industrial-organisational psychologist and lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

2,Suicide cases in Singapore highest in 8 years amid COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/suicide-highest-record-elderly-mental-health-isolation-covid-19-15179528,08 Jul 2021 02:59PM,"SINGAPORE: Singapore reported 452 suicides last year, the nation's highest count since 2012, amid the isolation and psychological distress brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Last year's case count was a 13 per cent increase from the 400 cases recorded in 2019, according to data released by the Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) on Thursday (Jul 8).The increase was observed across all age groups but in particular the elderly, which recorded the highest number of suicides since 1991.Among people aged 60 and above, a total of 154 took their own lives. This was a 26 per cent increase from 2019.In the other age groups - youths aged 10 to 29 and adults aged 30 to 59 - the number of suicides rose by 7 per cent from 2019.Overall, the number of suicide deaths rose to 8.88 per 100,000 residents, up by 0.88 when compared to 2019.""COVID-19 has severely affected the nation's economy, lifestyle and mental health. We are extremely worried about how our elderly are coping during this public health crisis,"" said SOS chief executive Gasper Tan.ELDERLY IN DISTRESSDuring the pandemic, the elderly are more likely to face social isolation and financial worries, said Mr Tan.They may also face difficulties with constantly adapting to changes and prolonged feelings of loneliness, which may be ""devastating"", he said.Despite the higher number of elderly suicides, SOS saw a fall in the number of calls it received from this group through its 24-hour suicide prevention hotline.There were 4,455 calls to the hotline from the elderly last year, compared to 4,816 calls in 2019.Among those who revealed their age, 17 per cent of all calls were made by those aged 60 and above in the financial year 2020, compared to 20 per cent in the previous financial year.FIND WAYS TO CONNECTCallers faced difficulties in coping with loneliness and inactivity due to isolation, psychological distress, and impaired social and family relationships, said SOS.Some elderly people live alone and lack the support to cope with the pandemic, said Adjunct Associate Professor Lee Cheng, clinical director at the Institute of Mental Health's Office of Population Health.""For example, while they wish to comply with the call by the Government to stay at home as much as possible, they may still have to go out to get their necessities.""Those who are used to attending social activities outside on a regular basis will also likely feel socially isolated during this period,"" he said.As many in-person activities for the elderly have gone digital since the pandemic, those with limited proficiency at technology may find themselves ""lost and helpless"", said SOS' Mr Tan.""Given the uncertainty of how long the pandemic will last, it is imperative that we continue to build on existing efforts and find new ways to support the mental health of the elderly,"" he said.People should find as many ways as possible to connect with the elderly who are lonely and socially isolated, said Associated Professor Helen Ko, who teaches gerontology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.""Very often, most elderly persons want to hear a human voice and they long to hear the familiar voice of a loved one. For those who are not digitally savvy, please be very patient as they may need more time to pick up digital skills,"" she said.DIAL 1-767 FOR HELPFrom Jul 26, the public will be able to reach SOS' 24-hour hotline through a new four-digit number, 1-767 (1-SOS), the organisation announced.Many people who have suicide ideations remain hesitant and fearful of reaching out for help, noted SOS, which attended to a total of 39,779 calls in the last financial year.The shortened number is intended to be easier for those who are feeling overwhelmed and in crisis to recall, said Mr Tan.The hotline will remain toll-free and can also be reached at the existing number, 1800 221 4444.""The acknowledgment as a special service in the community and the assignment of the new four-digit short code marks a humbling milestone for SOS,"" said the organisation.",False,"['suicide', 'mental health', 'Samaritans of Singapore', 'SOS']",Singapore

4,Migrant worker who performed traditional Indian martial arts wins top prize at talent competition,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-worker-talent-competition-martial-art-wins-mwc-15159638,06 Jul 2021 08:45AM,"SINGAPORE: A migrant worker who choreographed and performed a sequence of Silambam - a traditional martial art form practised in India - took home the top prize at a talent competition on Monday night (Jul 5). Mr Ganesan Sandhirakasan came in first place with the most number of likes and views for his video on the @sg4mw TikTok account, beating 19 other shortlisted individuals to take home the prize money of S$1,000. The competition is part of the Tamil variety series Chill Pannu Maappi!, which is commissioned by the Ministry of Communication and Information and produced by Cosmic Ultima Pictures. Silambam has been practised in India since 4th century BC. The 33-year old migrant worker, who teaches Taekwondo, started practising martial arts at the age of 12 and won a silver medal for India at the first Silambam World Championship in 2010. ""(I decided to take part) after seeing the advertisement (for the competition) on the website. My workplace was closed during the COVID period,"" he said of the talent competition held in Singapore.""I wanted to use the time usefully on something. Therefore, I choreographed (a demonstration of) the Indian martial art Silambam.""The series was made for migrant workers in Singapore and the final episode aired on Monday night. Migrant workers were invited to send in video submissions of their talents, and the show received more than 600 submissions, said executive producer of the show S S Vikneshwaran. Out of the submissions, 20 participants including Mr Ganesan were shortlisted by award-winning actress Aishwarya Rajesh. The top three finalists were decided by the number of views and likes their videos got on TikTok. Mr Ganesan said he submitted his video with the intention of making the martial art form known to more people, and to encourage others to keep fit, he said. ""It takes concentration, fitness, and practice to perform a continuous sequence of Silambam. Learners benefit from both physical health and mental health,"" he added. Mr Ganesan has lived in Singapore for the past seven years, and been teaching Taekwondo here for the past five years. The second place in the competition went to Mr Vignesh Sathish, whose video of him performing a traditional dance known as the Karagattam in costume won him S$500. The third place winner - with a prize money of S$300 - was Mr Saran Raj, an assistant supervisor with a cleaning company who submitted a video of himself singing.Mr Ganesan said he was “happy and excited” to find out he won the top prize. He plans to keep half of the S$1,000 prize money for his own use, and donate the other half to his hometown Mayiladuthurai in the Tamil Nadu region in India. The donation will go to a foundation in his hometown, and provide at least 500 meals for the elderly. Mr Ganesan said he hopes the money will help individuals who are facing “challenging times” due to the COVID-19 pandemic, especially those who may be struggling to feed themselves.

5,Commentary: New primary healthcare plan for migrant workers can mitigate risk of disease outbreaks,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/migrant-workers-covid-19-welfare-healthcare-needs-15158320,06 Jul 2021 06:05AM,"A recent Request for Proposal by the Manpower Ministry sends a powerful signal that migrant worker health is now front and centre on the agenda, say two researchers from the NUS Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.SINGAPORE: In late June, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) for the provision of primary healthcare services to migrant workers.In the RFP, the workers would be organised into six geographic regions with each having a comprehensive medical centre supported by mobile clinics and telemedicine capabilities.The RFP sends a powerful signal that migrant worker health is now front and centre on the agenda and that the Government is prepared to intervene proactively and shape the market.To appreciate the significance of this plan, one needs to understand how migrant healthcare worked.MIGRANT WORKER HEALTHCARE CAN BE IMPROVEDToday’s approach for migrant worker healthcare is largely reactive, focusing on episodic treatment of acute conditions such as injuries and infections with minimal attention to preventive health.Even in immediate care, little is known about the extent, duration, whether adequate treatment is delivered and whether the costs are fully borne by employers.Health insurance today mainly covers in-patient and day surgery expenses and is more limited in covering chronic conditions which do not warrant medical attention in an in-patient setting.So migrant workers may not seek treatment for chronic conditions such as diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol due to cost barriers.Through our networks, we know that prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, some migrant workers with chronic diseases such as diabetes would circumvent the cost issue by seeking care in their home countries with medicines prescribed for an entire year or brought into Singapore informally by friends at regular intervals.This arrangement was far from ideal and today is no longer even tenable given travel restrictions.A GOLDEN OPPORTUNITYThe organisation of primary care as laid out in the RFP presents a golden opportunity to re-imagine primary healthcare for migrant workers.Primary care should be comprehensive, accessible, and affordable, with strong coordination and continuity of care. There is further opportunity to encourage providers to innovate care models given the stable patient population in a clearly defined geography and the prescribed capabilities operators need to possess.Patients with high blood pressure need only to consult the physician only once a year instead of the quarterly visits, if daily blood pressure readings can be captured in the dormitories, patients communicate remotely with a care coordinator or physician assistant and medicines delivered to the dormitories.While this arrangement may appear to segregate the migrant workers from the larger population, a tight primary care network would make sense from quality and efficiency perspectives whereby more timely and targeted interventions can be delivered. This arrangement also allows for more culturally and linguistically sensitive settings for the migrant workers, with fewer logistical barriers.The American integrated payer-provider Kaiser Permanente (KP) shows what successful primary care could look like. KP is both an insurer and a healthcare provider. Incentives are strongly aligned to keep patients healthy and minimise healthcare episodes through preventive services.Interestingly, while KP is now in multiple states across the US serving all age groups, its genesis in 1933 was in employer-funded healthcare for workers building the Colorado River Aqueduct in the Mojave Desert.Why has KP been able to achieve good and cost-effective patient outcomes?First, it adopts an integrated, population health approach that pays equal attention to both acute, reactive care and preventive, proactive health services such as health education and screening.Second, it heavily uses care pathways to integrate and standardise care provided to ensure consistent, high quality care. A care pathway is a clinical protocol used to manage a defined group of patients (like those with a specific condition such as diabetes).The protocol sets out step-by-step the tasks each healthcare professional is responsible for and the timeline to be followed. It is evidence-based and serves as a guide for clinicians on the best practices for managing patients with this condition.Third, KP has prioritised “digitalisation” to seamlessly monitor patient outcomes and service delivery indicators. It can also identify opportunities to innovate and improve at both individual patient and at system levels.For example, KP’s IT system allows them to identify when changes have been made to the care pathway, what results these changes produced, and their effects on costs. Changes which improve outcomes or optimise costs can then be scaled to other care providers in the KP system.Finally, and perhaps most crucially, the adoption of a capitated healthcare financing model that utilises a fixed payment per person covering all eligible services with some financial upsides in the form of bonus payments for improved patient outcomes, has encouraged providers to invest in systems that minimises waste.Providers keep the difference between the operating costs and the amount paid by the insurer. They are thus incentivised to invest in preventive health approaches such as health education and screening because early intervention can stop or slow disease progression, thereby reducing utilisation of costly healthcare services.EXECUTION IS EVERYTHINGBeyond the intent of better structuring today’s haphazard provider networks, the RFP emphasises minimising language and cultural barriers.Healthcare providers must be able to communicate in the major languages used by migrant workers (for example, Tamil, Bengali and Mandarin). There are also provisions to allow recruitment of care professionals hailing from workers’ home countries to ensure care is provided in a culturally sensitive manner.Will the RFP be successful in transforming primary care for the migrant worker population?The right balance must be struck. The health financing model – how much, who pays and how is the system financed — is critical to achieve success and sustainability for the long term.Workers should not be deterred from seeking care due to financial constraint, but the economics must be sustainable for operators.But as Kaiser Permanente has shown, this is possible. It will require upfront investment in IT systems, hiring of staff in advance of demand, and maturing the operating models until the efficiencies and improvements in care kick in with corresponding decline in costs.Hence bidders for the RFP will need a prospective payment system such as capitation to generate enough funds for these investments. But this may not be sufficient and some degree of initial government subsidisation will be needed.Why should the Government, or rather the taxpayer, fund this? Beyond the humanitarian imperative, a healthy worker is a more productive worker.The painful circuit breaker we have gone through last year makes it clear that a country is only as safe as its weakest link.At present, a review of health insurance coverage for migrant workers is underway. While the exact design of the scheme is yet to be known, configuring a risk pooling mechanism for a community care insurance with shared responsibilities from the Government, employers, and employees in financing the premiums would make pragmatic sense in the long run.A robust primary care system for migrant workers will strengthen disease surveillance and mitigate the risk of uncontrolled outbreaks.The MOM should be applauded for taking this first step to improve migrant workers’ access to better healthcare. But as John Doerr, the famous venture capitalist said: Ideas are easy. Execution is everything. And it takes a team to win.Chia Hui Xiang is a Research Assistant from the Leadership Institute for Global Health Transformation, and Tan Si Ying is a Research Fellow, both at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

6,A*STAR scientist admits to obscene acts including lying naked on bed for woman to see,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/a-star-scientist-admits-to-lying-naked-bed-xie-danpeng-15157902,05 Jul 2021 12:46PM,"SINGAPORE: A scientist with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research (A*STAR) admitted in court on Monday (Jul 5) to committing various obscene acts including exposing himself to three women.Xie Danpeng, a 31-year-old China national, pleaded guilty to four charges including trespass, sexual exposure and dishonest misappropriation. Another two charges will be considered in sentencing.The court heard that Xie targeted two women at a condominium in the southern part of Singapore on Apr 12, 2020. One of them, aged 37, was going home after hanging out some laundry when she saw Xie masturbating in the common area between 8am and 9am. The woman took a video of him.Xie kept on the obscene act while staring at her. Alarmed, she ran home. The woman showed her employer the video she had taken and the latter called the police.At about the same time, the other victim, aged 26, was in her unit when she saw Xie masturbating. Xie made eye contact with her as well, alarming her. The victim called out to her boyfriend, who rushed to the balcony and asked Xie what he was doing. Xie ran away but the second victim's boyfriend confronted him and reported the incident to the management of the condominium.Xie was arrested that same day and released on bail. He was told not to return to the condominium, but he went back on Apr 19, 2020.After entering via an unlocked door near the rubbish collection area, Xie took a pair of shoes from a rack outside a unit.Investigations revealed that he also tried to return to the condo on Apr 15, 2020 and the police were called in by the condo's management.At about 11am on Jun 12, 2020, Xie went to the room of a 32-year-old woman and lay down completely naked on her bed. The woman saw Xie when she walked in and called the police. Investigations revealed that Xie had been walking around the unit wearing only transparent underwear in the week before this.The court also heard that two days before the exposure incidents, Xie rode a mountain bicycle, which did not belong to him, away from where it had been parked outside Alexandra Retail Centre.Xie's lawyer Chung Ting Fai asked for a report to assess Xie's suitability for a mandatory treatment order. He said Xie was undergoing ""tremendous stress at work"" and was ""feeling pressurised over his girlfriend's desire to relocate to Singapore"".""Our client decided to release the sexual tension kept up inside of him by masturbating in the vicinity of the premises,"" said Mr Chung.He said his client had told a doctor at the Institute of Mental Health that he experienced ""voices within his head that were laughing at him and telling him to take off his pants and masturbate"".The prosecutor objected to the calling for a mandatory treatment order suitability report, saying that there were no contributory links between Xie's conditions and the offences.He was diagnosed with exhibitionistic disorder by IMH in October 2020 and had a history of adjustment disorder with depressed mood during early 2020, with work as a stressor.The judge agreed to the defence's request for a report assessing Xie's suitability for a mandatory treatment order, but stressed that this did not mean he would definitely be given such a sentence. He will return to court next month.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['court', 'crime']",Singapore
7,Commentary: New mums need courage to fend off unrealistic expectations from family and work,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/new-mums-post-natal-depression-unrealistic-expectations-15146746,05 Jul 2021 06:06AM,"The period just after a baby is born can be the most challenging in a woman’s life. Add family expectations and work to this mix and things can spiral, says NUS’ Dr Shefaly Shorey.SINGAPORE: Elizabeth Quek is one of the rare women who has given four weeks of her maternity leave to her husband. In Singapore, partners can claim up to four weeks in what is known as shared parental leave. Despite having a supportive husband who was willing to shoulder quite a bit of the demands of caring for a baby, when it was time for both parents to get back to work, the couple began having arguments.“I had to become the default caregiver. But I would say, 'why aren't you taking care of her? I need to work.' And he would be like, 'I have so much work to do too'. So that’s where we ended up getting into arguments,’’ said Elizabeth on CNA’s Heart of the Matter podcast.Elizabeth began feeling upset, overwhelmed and found it hard to cope. Like her, Sara (not her real name), one of my research participants, found the period after her childbirth to be a rough ride. She felt overwhelmed with breastfeeding and was constantly reminded by her family members that she should breastfeed for at least six months after her daughter’s birth. She started feeling anxious and developed a nagging fear of going back to work. She was especially concerned about how she would cope with breastfeeding while working. She would cry every night from the lack of rest and giving in to the demands of her newborn. She started blaming herself for not being a good mum and started to have feelings of guilt about not enjoying motherhood.(She felt a sense of ""despair"" each time she had to breastfeed. But there’s one thing that made all the difference in this difficult journey, this new mother says on this week's Heart of the Matter podcast.)Both Sara’s and Elizabeth’s stories are common – in fact, they epitomise the experience of hundreds of women I have met in my research work. The transition to motherhood is a stressful period for new mothers – with women being extremely vulnerable to biological, emotional, and familial changes. Especially for working women, motherhood may pose additional stressors of juggling with parenting roles and employee roles. Though the research around employment status and postpartum depression is inconclusive, in my own research study of 138 women, 43 per cent were working mothers and majority of them felt overwhelmed with newborn care tasks and work-related demands. Nationally, postpartum depression affects one in 10 mothers, and it can be hard to diagnose as women do not seek timely help. Many women often have no idea they have early signs of depression, nor do anyone in their family and close social circle.This is something Elizabeth mentioned in the podcast. “My friends didn't really talk about their experience and how difficult it was to be a mother until, I started opening up about my journey. Then they responded. So my hypothesis is that mothers normalise the stress they go through – that mothers have to be sacrificial and you just endure it.’’ Even among women who recognise they are feeling emotionally down, getting timely help and treatment is rare. Those affected often feel reluctant to seek help due to the social stigma around mental health, especially during what is supposed to be one of the most joyous times of their lives – motherhood. In my experience speaking to these women who don’t get help tend to dismiss their symptoms as “normal feelings” and keep to themselves. But the problem, if untreated, can become so deep that it can lead to devastating consequences. One such worst-case scenario played out last year, when a 35-year-old mother jumped to her death from her flat on the 10th storey, with her five-week-old daughter in her arms. SCREENING IS USEFUL BUT MISSED OPPORTUNITIES REMAINIn Singapore, pre and post-natal check-ups are an essential part of the system. If doctors detect signs of depression they can request for more support for these mothers. That’s a good step but depending on screening alone is not enough. There are mothers who default on their hospital visits. And even among those who don’t, many brush away concerns. Sara was one such mum. Despite feeling overwhelmed, she did not seek help as she was concerned about being judged to have fallen short as a mother.As part of my research, I’ve discovered that it is important to bring mental health awareness and interventions to new moms who need them, instead of expecting them to seek it on their own. As a mother myself, I can understand that the focus is seldom on self-care as the entire world revolves around the new baby. One experiment we are working on is a large-scale peer-support programme in which trained peer volunteer mothers, who have experienced and recovered from postpartum depression, are matched to at-risk mothers to talk over the mobile phone as and when needed. We matched Sara to one, who happened to have similar breastfeeding experiences, and shared she only breastfed her baby for two weeks. When Sara learnt that the baby grew up to become a healthy teenager, she mustered the courage to tell her husband she wanted to stop breastfeeding. He was supportive and communicated their decision to their extended family members. Sara managed to feel better as she had more time for herself, and her husband started to help with the feeding after work. In Sara’s own words, “Life became normal.” My study showed that those who received peer support over the phone in the first three months after giving birth, had a 20 per cent reduced risk of developing postpartum depression. A non-judgmental listening ear and a friend to talk to provide emotional comfort, reassurance and reduced negative feelings and loneliness at a vulnerable time for new mothers fearing being viewed as incapable.FATHERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLEThis type of support can complement other sources of aid. Fathers play a crucial role in the well-being of the new mothers. They can take care of other household responsibilities like preparing meals and bathing the baby. Fathers should keep in mind that merely listening to their wives’ needs without trying to solve all their problems can be beneficial. Small, encouraging words to acknowledge their wives’ efforts go a long way. They also play a vital role in ensuring that family members do not write off the mother’s symptoms, or confuse her with outdated advice. Interestingly, research has shown that partners of depressed new mothers are at higher risk of developing postpartum depression themselves. A local study on 200 fathers conducted between 2016 and 2018 found that the early postpartum period is a stressful time for dads. The study revealed that at the six-month mark, at least one father was reported to be at risk of depression.One way to avoid falling into this trap would be to engage in “couple time” so that fathers and mothers can support each other, especially when mothers go back to work. EASING BACK TO WORKOne of the toughest transitions for mothers is getting back to work – while their babies are still very needy. This can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy. Many in my research group feel they have to live up to expectations of being a good mother and a committed employee.But these can be unrealistic – because every family is different and workplaces can vary greatly in their demands. New mothers need to learn how to enjoy their motherhood at their own pace and be clear about what they can and cannot do.I tell new mothers that it is fine to ask for lighter responsibilities for the first few months at work to re-accustom yourself to your role after spending time away. Ask that you leave on time and for flexible work arrangements. To ease in, you can also consider taking half days instead of the full set of maternity leave.Sara has found her footing and is a much happier working mother now. For her, speaking to someone who walked the same path before made a big difference and this should be an important lifeline for all mothers because they shouldn’t have to travel this road alone.Dr Shefaly Shorey is an Assistant Professor at the National University of Singapore’s Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies.

8,"The Big Read: As COVID-19 becomes endemic, it’s a race against time to get more seniors vaccinated",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-endemic-race-seniors-vaccinated-sinovac-pfizer-moderna-15147586,05 Jul 2021 06:06AM,"Apart from concerns over the newness of mRNA technology, other factors include fear of the side effects, a belief that vaccines are not necessary. religious convictions and also a general lack of awareness of how to get vaccinated, interviews show.SINGAPORE: Mr Paul Poh’s wife had been urging him to get vaccinated against COVID-19, even dangling the carrot of a safer environment for him to spend time with his grandchildren.But the 72-year-old retiree would not be rushed; it was only after the authorities allowed some private clinics to administer China’s Sinovac vaccine last month — to overwhelming demand —  that he decided to register for his doses. He is now waiting to receive his first jab.His main reason for not participating in Singapore’s national vaccination programme — which only administers the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna shots — is because both vaccines use the messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) technology.This is the first time that the mRNA technology has been approved by the World Health Organization and health authorities around the world for widespread use as vaccines, amid the battle against an unprecedented global health scourge that is COVID-19.Mr Poh reiterated that his preference for Sinovac stems from the fact that it uses inactivated coronavirus to trigger an immune response — a more traditional vaccine technology that had been used to develop vaccines for other diseases such as polio.Both the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have shown efficacy rates of well over 90 per cent against symptomatic disease in clinical trials, compared with Sinovac's 51 per cent.Singapore’s expert committee on COVID-19 vaccination under the Ministry of Health (MOH) had previously come out to stress that current mRNA COVID-19 vaccines used here continue to be “safe and highly effective”, and “show protection against variants of concern”.Separately, infectious diseases expert David Lye also said that the vaccines using mRNA technology are the most effective against the coronavirus, including its variants, while there is hardly any data on how the Sinovac vaccine performs against the variants.Mr Poh is among a sizeable group of seniors aged 60 and above in Singapore who have yet to come onboard the national vaccination programme, which was started about six months ago with seniors as the first group eligible for the jabs. Vaccination is seen as key for a pandemic-weary nation to move to a “new normal”, where social distancing requirements and travel restrictions could be relaxed.Apart from concerns over the newness of mRNA technology, other factors include fear of the side effects, especially among those who have pre-existing illnesses; a belief that vaccines are not necessary; religious convictions; and also a general lack of awareness of how to get vaccinated, interviews with those aged 60 and above showed.Ms Patricia Lai, who is in her late 60s, is afraid that she would not be able to withstand the side effects, given that she is already riddled with several health problems, such as difficulty in walking due to her swollen legs.“No vaccine is the best. Who likes vaccination?” she said.Ms Lai added that she has always seen traditional Chinese medicine practitioners for any health ailments and does not want to be injected due to her overall distrust of Western medicine.The Government has set a target of having two thirds of its population fully vaccinated by National Day on Aug 9. Based on MOH’s latest figures, as of Jun 28, 76 per cent of seniors aged 60 and above have had at least one dose of the vaccine.In April, it was revealed in Parliament that at the time, about 60 per cent of eligible seniors aged 70 and above had either been jabbed or booked their vaccination appointments. This was lower than the proportion (70 per cent) of those between 60 and 69 who had done so.Throughout the pandemic, government leaders including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong himself have made impassioned pleas for seniors to get vaccinated.Most recently, the three co-chairs of the multi-ministry COVID-19 task force — Trade and Industry Minister Gan Kim Yong, Finance Minister Lawrence Wong and Health Minister Ong Ye Kung — as well as MOH director of medical services Kenneth Mak all repeated the call last week.The Government has left no stones unturned in its bid to encourage seniors to get jabbed. For example, it has been deploying doctors and nurses to homes to help those who are homebound or not mobile to receive their jabs. Those aged 60 and above can also walk into any vaccination centre and get vaccinated on the spot, without the need for prior registration.In recent days, Cabinet Ministers have appeared in online videos with local celebrities and speaking in various vernacular languages about the importance of vaccination.Infectious diseases specialists said vaccination is especially vital for the elderly — who are vulnerable to severe illness from COVID-19 — as it provides them with the needed protection when COVID-19 becomes endemic. This is when people will get used to living with the coronavirus in their midst and where there may be occasional spikes in the infection rates — just like they have learnt to live with dengue and the common cold.WHAT’S HOLDING SENIORS BACKWhile the Sinovac vaccine offers recipients some form of protection against the COVID-19 virus, it is not part of Singapore's national vaccination regime. The Health Sciences Authority has yet to approve Sinovac because of the lack of some critical data from its manufacturer.Sinovac is provided here only under the Special Access Route framework. Vaccines under this framework are not covered under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme, which supports people who suffer adverse effects from their COVID-19 jabs.MOH has said that residents who choose Sinovac have to pay for consultation fees and the 7 per cent goods and services tax, but they would not be charged for the vaccine itself, since it is being provided at no cost to these private clinics.Still, some seniors remain apprehensive of the mRNA technology. “We are being treated like guinea pigs,” said a relief kindergarten teacher, who wanted to be known only as Ms Yap, about her fears in relation to mRNA vaccines.The 63-year-old was speaking while registering her interest for the Sinovac vaccine at the HeartlandHealth clinic at Bedok South, one of 24 private clinics selected to administer the Government’s stock of Sinovac vaccines.Mr S Teo, who declined to give his full name, said he also prefers Sinovac as it is made using the same technology as the flu vaccine he takes every year.“I know you may say there are no side effects now, but maybe in five to 10 years, you don’t know what are the effects that are going to come out,” said the 64-year-old.Mr Poh and Mr Teo also cited reports from Israel on how young men who had taken the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine appeared to have a higher risk of developing heart muscle inflammation.On this, the expert committee said the benefits of getting vaccinated still outweigh the risk. Nevertheless, it has advised “adolescents and younger men” to avoid strenuous physical activity for a week after their second dose as a precaution against a “small risk” of heart inflammation.Mr Poh said he has doctor-friends who send him reports of potential negative effects of mRNA vaccines, and he is confused as to which reports he should trust.Ultimately, he opted for Sinovac on the basis that it is developed with an older and therefore proven technology.Some seniors said that they do not want to be vaccinated due to religious convictions.“If you are so strong in your faith and believe that God is in control, you don’t need that kind of vaccination. That’s my take,” said Mr Simon Wee, a 62-year-old Christian.Mr Eric Tan, 72, said that he will only take the vaccine if it is made mandatory or if he needs to go overseas.Mr Tan, who works in the courier service, said while he does not fear contracting COVID-19, he still takes precautions such as wearing a mask and washing his hands when he goes out.“I will not allow fear to come upon me … and I pray for God’s protection,” he added.‘I’M SO OLD ANYWAY’Some other seniors said that they do not believe that vaccination is necessary for them since they rarely leave their homes and do not interact with many people.An 83-year-old, who wanted to be known only as Madam Ong, said that she finds it too troublesome to get vaccinated.“I’m so old anyway, so why should I get vaccinated?” she said. “Only if the Government makes vaccination compulsory, then I will get vaccinated.”Similarly, Madam Fatmah Hakimdin, 77, said that she has not been vaccinated as she only goes out once a week to buy groceries from the market.“I’m mostly at home … I’m not worried about getting COVID-19 and falling sick,” she added. Mdm Fatmah is also fearful of the possible side effects from taking the vaccine as she had suffered allergic reactions after taking muscle relaxant pills.But she has not ruled out getting vaccinated, adding that she will take the next one to two weeks to make a decision. “When I’m ready and more relaxed, maybe I’ll take the vaccine.”For Mr Ang Heng Soon, 70, he does not want to trouble his sons and grandchildren in case he suffers from any side effects from the vaccination, given that he is already beset with health issues.“My body is deteriorating quite badly. I don’t want to live so long. I’m retired, I just live life peacefully and quietly ... Why should I get jabbed and feel uncomfortable?,” he said in Mandarin.He believes that exercising daily, eating well and not going out too often are good enough.“If I get it (COVID-19), then I will think of what to do … We cannot be scared of everything as human beings,” said the retiree.Other unvaccinated seniors, such as an 82-year-old retiree, who wanted to be known only as Mr Chew, said he is “waiting to see how things go” by monitoring the side effects of others who had taken the vaccine first.“I’m a bit selfish, I would like for more people to get vaccinated so we can get herd immunity. But I might only get vaccinated when I know for certain that (the vaccines are) safe,” he said.Mr Chew said that while he goes out every day to run errands and exercise, he takes precautions such as keeping his distance from people and driving to his destinations instead of taking public transport.Dissuaded by her daughter and son-in-law, Madam Koh Kah Mooi has delayed getting vaccinated as she is concerned that she may develop health problems later.“My family members are all busy, who will take care of me?” said the 75-year-old, who works as a part-time consultant.Despite her reservations, Mdm Koh is now considering getting jabbed in the next one to two months after observing that most of her vaccinated friends have not experienced side effects.Encouragement from her eldest grandson and the fact she goes out daily are other factors that have led her to reconsider.There are also seniors, such as Madam Teo Ah Eng, who want to be vaccinated but do not know how to go about it.The 85-year-old said in Mandarin that she is waiting for her son to take her to the vaccination centre when he is free.“I think it’s important but I don’t dare to go myself. I don’t know the direction, and I don’t know how to get back,” said Mdm Teo, who was not even aware that the vaccine has to be taken in two doses.EFFORTS TO GET SENIORS VACCINATEDFrom house visits to dialogue sessions, Members of Parliament (MPs) said they have deployed various outreach methods to encourage elderly residents in their constituencies to get vaccinated.A common problem is that many elders have mobility issues, and find it difficult to travel to vaccination centres.Ms Tin Pei Ling, MP for MacPherson Single Member Constituency (SMC), said her team appealed to MOH to have a mobile vaccination team at MacPherson Community Centre so that elderly residents in the area would not have to travel to Geylang Serai to get vaccinated, as that was the closest vaccination centre for them then.She and her team then went door-to-door to inform residents.Other MPs made special arrangements for those with mobility issues by helping to arrange transport to vaccination centres and back, or to have them vaccinated at their own homes.Several MPs also said that they, along with grassroot activists and volunteers from the Silver Generation Office, conduct home visits to correct misconceptions the elderly may have about getting vaccinated.Mr Wan Rizal, MP for Jalan Besar Group Representation Constituency (GRC), said that he would approach each elderly person differently based on the reasons why they do not want to be vaccinated.For those who have been misinformed, he said it is important to prepare facts beforehand.“For example, last year there was talk that in a particular foreign country the residents in the old folks’ home died after vaccination. So we had to show them the proof that it wasn't so,” he said.Ms Joan Pereira, MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC, said that she and her team would try to allay the senior citizens’ fears and suspicions about the vaccine by explaining to them using simple terms in the language or dialect that they understand.Yio Chu Kang MP, Yip Hon Weng, said that his team analysed data on the characteristics of unvaccinated seniors, such as whether there are language barriers, to understand various reasons among different groups of residents for not getting the vaccine. “Specific population segments may have varying reasons for this, for example, age group, where they live in the estate, living arrangements (alone/with family members), etc. Following on, we could then take a targeted approach in addressing each of these groups’ concerns, and come up with more focused communications and outreach to tackle the issue,” he said.MPs such as Mr Yip, Mr Wan Rizal, Ms Denise Phua (Jalan Besar GRC) and Mr Melvin Yong (Radin Mas SMC), have also held various forums and dialogues, both in-person and online, with a medical doctor to explain how mRNA vaccines work.Mr Yong said some seniors even brought their medication along to ask the doctor whether it was safe for them to be vaccinated.“These sessions, facilitated by our numerous Senior Activity Centres, have been useful in dispelling the misinformation they receive via social media and forwarded messages on various chat apps,” he said.Given that some elderly are not so tech-savvy, Mr Wan Rizal said he would use the iPad and show such residents the videos featuring the Cabinet Ministers talking in dialects about the importance of vaccination, when conducting door-to-door visits.However, he added that more seniors these days are using messaging services such as WhatsApp, which can help circulate these videos.Nonetheless, the MPs agreed that such online videos need to be complemented with home visits to reach out to more of the elderly and address their concerns about vaccinations.Workers’ Party’s Hougang MP Dennis Tan said a small number of his residents who are above 60 had told him that they could not take the jabs due to their medical conditions.“A few wanted to wait for the Sinovac vaccination. MOH should continue to reach out to those who still do not understand why Sinovac is not available generally in the same manner as (the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines) are,” he said. “It would be desirable if everyone understands the correct rationale for vaccination and chooses to vaccinate for the right reasons.”WHY SENIORS NEED TO BE VACCINATEDWhile the concerns and fears that the elderly have about COVID-19 vaccines are valid, it is of paramount importance that they are persuaded to get vaccinated as soon as possible, infectious disease specialists said.Professor Leo Yee Sin, executive director of the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, pointed out that over a third (35.5 per cent) of COVID-19 cases during the recent surge between Jun 12 and 24 involved those aged 60 and above.While she said that there is no set target for the vaccination rate of the elderly, Singapore should aim to have as many people vaccinated as it reduces the risk of infection and severe illness, helps to protect others and reduces the viral load in the community.“Based on our observations thus far, no vaccinated individual was required to be mechanically ventilated. This is a stark contrast to those who were unvaccinated,” she said.If vaccine coverage for the oldest age groups can go up from 60 per cent to 90 per cent, the number of deaths due to COVID-19 can be reduced by 75 per cent, said Associate Professor Alex Cook, vice-dean of research from the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health at the National University of Singapore (NUS).“Once COVID-19 becomes endemic, it will be circulating at levels higher than Singaporeans have become accustomed to over the last year, and the key modifiable determinant in how many deaths occur will be how many of our elders have been vaccinated,” he said.He added: “The lower the vaccine coverage in the elderly, the more cautious will be our reopening, and the longer we’ll have to live with the damage to livelihoods and well-being caused by the control measures in place.”About a week ago, the three co-chairs of the multi-ministry COVID-19 task force wrote in an opinion piece published in the newspapers that the coronavirus may never go away and will likely become endemic. “The evidence is clear: Vaccines are highly effective in reducing the risk of infection as well as transmission. Even if you are infected, vaccines will help prevent severe COVID-19 symptoms,” they wrote, adding that a road map is being drawn to help Singapore to transit to a “new normal”.The “new normal” would refer to a situation where Singapore would register a few COVID-19 infections every now and then but with the elderly and vulnerable protected, said Associate Professor Paul Tambyah, President of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection.He added that major pandemics, such as the “Spanish flu” in 1918 to 1919 and the H1N1 influenza in 2009, which was circulating up to May last year, have become endemic.“The focus of vaccination for endemic diseases is preventing sickness and death,” said Assoc Prof Tambyah. This is why seniors are encouraged to take the flu vaccine every year. Healthcare workers are also urged to be vaccinated against the flu to protect the vulnerable.If not enough seniors are being vaccinated, Assoc Prof Cook said that there is a “substantial risk” that Singapore would not be able to reach herd immunity through vaccination.“In that case, we can expect that whenever we finally relax our control measures, we’ll see a wave of infections.”If herd immunity is not achieved when safe-distancing measures to curb the spread of the disease have ceased, an epidemic will ensue, noted Assoc Prof Cook.“Our models say that the most important factor determining how many people will die in that epidemic is the vaccination rate of the elderly, since their risk of dying from COVID if unvaccinated is so much higher than younger ages,” he said.DOING MORE TO NUDGE SENIORSTo boost vaccination rates, jurisdictions such as Hong Kong and the United States have resorted to giving prizes for vaccinated citizens.They include a brand new HK$10.8 million flat in Hong Kong or a lottery cash prize of US$1 million in the American state of North Carolina.In Singapore, private companies have also started to offer their own incentives, although on a much smaller scale.While some MPs applaud these efforts by the private sector and view them as fulfilling their corporate social responsibility, most are cautious about such an approach if it were to be taken up by the public sector. Mr Lim Biow Chuan, MP for Mountbatten, said that such incentives may be unfair for residents who had stepped forward earlier to get vaccinated.Mr Yip added that citizens may also expect future government programmes to offer incentives.Some MPs felt that such inducements may not be enough to persuade seniors who have strong convictions that the vaccine is not safe for them.  Mr Wan Rizal said a better long-term solution would be to establish befriender programmes or networks with the elderly where they can be informed about the benefits of vaccination.Mr Yip also suggested allowing residents in their 30s or 40s to book for their appointment and be vaccinated with their parents at the same time, especially those staying in the same household.Infectious disease experts said that an important step is to incorporate vaccination in Singapore’s primary healthcare system, which refers to the general practitioner (GP) clinics and polyclinics which most Singaporeans go to as part of their routine medical care.Based on his team’s research on promoting influenza vaccines before the pandemic, Assoc Prof Cook said that the most effective way to encourage vaccination is for doctors at GP clinics or polyclinics check on the vaccination status of seniors when they consult them, and offer their unvaccinated patients a jab on the spot. By offering vaccination through primary care, Assoc Prof Tambyah said this would integrate vaccination into routine care and would not involve complicated electronic booking systems, which can be a challenge for many seniors.Ms Ng Ling Ling, deputy chairperson for the Government Parliamentary Committee for Health, said that such an approach has merit as primary care family doctors are often the first line of medical advice that seniors seek out.However, Ms Ng, who is also an MP for Ang Mo Kio GRC, said there may be practical and operational constraints, especially for smaller standalone GP clinics to administer the vaccination.“The logistical and storage requirements of the vaccination can be difficult to manage for smaller GP clinics and they will need support to be part of the vaccination programme,” she said.MPs also stressed the importance of having friends and family members in encouraging their elderly loved ones to get vaccinated.While there is a lot of scientific information available and one can go into the technical details of how mRNA vaccines work, Ms Tin said the personal touch is the most important.“Knowing that their friends or friends who may have similar symptoms or conditions themselves went through (the vaccination process) and are okay, I think these would all be helpful.“The fear always comes from ‘what if’ or ‘I don’t know enough, this is so new’... But when they see that their peers are okay, that would be more encouraging,” Ms Tin said.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

10,"Traditional dance, cooking, martial arts: Migrant workers showcase skills for talent competition",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-worker-talent-competition-singapore-mwc-15153740,05 Jul 2021 06:05AM,"SINGAPORE: Logistics handler Maruthaiyan Kumaravelu, 35, grew up watching his mother cook. The Indian national developed an interest in cooking as a young boy at the age of 7, after helping her out in the kitchen as she asked him to grab different spices as she put the dishes together. He stopped cooking after he went to college. But after moving to Singapore for work and living with five other roommates, having other people around who liked to cook sparked his interest again. Over the last four years, he has become the chef among his friends, and they all enjoy his food. They often request his briyani, and crab or chicken curry, especially on special occasions like Deepavali. He now shares a flat with just one housemate. Before leaving for work, he cooks packed lunches for both of them, which they bring to work. On Sundays, he dabbles in snacks and desserts. ""I love cooking to please others, and to make other people happy,"" he said, adding that even friends who are picky about food say that his cooking is very good. ""I don't know what I've learnt since I've come to Singapore, but I've definitely learned how to become a really good cook."" Mr Kumaravelu is just one of the 20 individuals from Tamil Nadu in India who are vying for the top place in a new migrant worker talent competition held in Singapore. The competition is part of Tamil variety series Chill Pannu Maappi!, which is commissioned by the Ministry of Communication and Information and produced by Cosmic Ultima Pictures. The series was made for migrant workers in Singapore and the final episode will air on Monday night (Jul 5). Migrant workers were invited to send in video submissions of their talents, and the show received more than 600 submissions, said executive producer of the show S.S. Vikneshwaran. Out of all these submissions, 20 participants were shortlisted by award-winning actress Aishwarya Rajesh. ""That was also really a pull for them, because a lot of migrant workers actually adore her a lot,"" said Mr Vikneshwaran, adding that many of them relate to the rural village characters she often plays. The reception for the show and the competition segment has been ""pretty good"" so far, he said, adding that both migrant workers and Singaporeans enjoy the series. ""They seem to love the idea of being able to connect with familiar faces that they know from back home. They enjoy the dance, the songs, their favourite so far has been the stand-up comedy segment, which features some sensational comedians from Tamil Nadu."" The competition saw submissions including those of singing, dancing, playing instruments, said Ms Soffy Hariyanti, director of MCI's campaigns and production department. There were also some unique entries featuring martial art forms and folk dances, she added. The top three winners with the highest number of likes and views on the @sg4mw TikTok account will take home S$1,000, S$500 and S$300 respectively. For Mr Kumaravelu, he hopes that his version of a dish he grew up eating will nab him a top spot. His submission was an instructional recipe video for needlefish fried with a thick paste made of dried chilli, pepper, garlic, cumin seeds and ginger. He chose to use needlefish as it is also a popular choice used in his village located by the sea because it does not have many bones and can be caught fresh. The style of cooking is also reminiscent of dishes from his hometown. As he often visits Tekka market and the stores along Serangoon Road, he also noticed that many migrant workers in Singapore buy this fish. ""I thought I would choose this so other people can also learn and try it out,"" he said, adding that those who want to try the recipe can also use Spanish mackerel or rockfish. He chose this particular style of cooking because in big cities, many chefs at home opt for pre-made or mass-produced spice powders. With his video, he wanted to highlight that in the more rural parts of the country, ingredients are used from scratch. For example, many spices are pounded into powders or pastes by hand with a mortar and pestle, he added. These spices are not processed, with no added colouring or flavouring. ""I wanted to use this style to show that it's healthy and it can be very delicious,"" he said. Another shortlisted participant is Mr Ganesan Sandhirakasan, a 33-year-old who teaches Taekwondo. His submission was a demonstration of Silambam, a traditional martial art form practiced in India since 4th century BC. He started practising martial arts at the age of 12. At the first Silambam World Championship in 2010, he won the silver medal for India. ""(I decided to take part) after seeing the advertisement (for the competition) on the website. My workplace was closed during the COVID period,"" he said. ""I wanted to use the time usefully on something. Therefore, I choreographed (a demonstration of) the Indian martial art Silambam."" He made the video with the intention of making the martial art form known to more people, and to encourage others to keep fit, he said. ""It takes concentration, fitness, and practice to perform a continuous sequence of Silambam. Learners benefit from both physical health and mental health,"" he added. He has lived in Singapore for the past seven years, and has taught Taekwondo here for the past five. As for Mr Vignesh Sathish, whose video of him performing a traditional dance known as the Karagattam was also shortlisted, he taught himself the dance as a child while watching professionals perform it in festivals. The dance is an ancient art form that involves holding a heavy pot above your head and dancing with it. It is typically performed in temples or for South Indian festivals. The dancer should not ever drop the pot. As a child, Mr Sathish started learning the dance using a plastic pot he had at home, and eventually took part in school performances for 10 years. Soon after, his neighbour in the village where he lived noticed his talent and invited him to perform with his troupe that travelled to neighbouring villages to dance. Two years after coming to Singapore, he joined a dance crew and has performed on stage and on TV with them three times for the Pongal festival or Deepavali. He often joins the crew for practice after work. The 27-year-old has worked in Singapore for four years, handling administrative work for a cable laying company. For his video, friends from his dance group came over to help him prepare for the dance. He wore a costume from a previous performance with the dance group, and they helped him apply makeup and film the video, which took about an hour. When asked why he chose to perform the Karagattam, he said: ""Now there are so many dance forms, and people tend to go towards the modern dance forms.

11,"Commentary: While in quarantine, athletes face great difficulty keeping up training for Tokyo Olympics",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-olympics-tokyo-quarantine-six-days-training-sports-15140208,04 Jul 2021 06:01AM,"For those who are competing in Tokyo, the recent announcement that arrivals from certain countries may be subject to a six-day quarantine has dealt another blow to athletes, says a sports lecturer.NOTTINGHAM: Although athletes broadly accepted the reason the Tokyo Olympic Games was postponed in 2020, it has not been an easy year. If many found the decision heartbreaking, it was in part because not all were certain they could take part this year.Several have since retired. Japanese women’s volleyball player Risa Shinnabe, who was a bronze medallist in 2012, cited fears that she would not be able to maintain her condition as one of the reasons for doing so.Maintaining physical condition, mental focus and motivation over the 15 months has been a huge challenge for athletes.For those who are competing in Tokyo, the recent announcement that arrivals from certain countries, including Great Britain, may be subject to a six-day quarantine has dealt another blow. This is an additional stress not only for the athletes but also for their support staff.Tennis players competing in the 2021 Australian Open faced similar conditions. Some were able to train at limited times. Others were restricted to their hotel rooms for 14 days due to a positive COVID test on an incoming flight.Social media was awash with tennis players coming up with innovative ways to practice using hotel furniture and room windows. The media might love these anecdotes, but these are circumstances that would have been unimaginable, pre-COVID. And in the days leading up to the Tokyo competitions, they will be less than optimal.TRAINING ADJUSTMENTSFollowing the postponement last year, training plans have no doubt been scrapped and rewritten, potentially multiple times.Ongoing uncertainty and the cancellation of pre-Games competitions has made planning difficult. The coaches of those athletes heading to Tokyo have had a difficult time ensuring that training programmes would enable peak performance during the Olympics, which opens on Jul 23.Some national teams may have envisaged organisers imposing some form of self-isolation and adapted travel plans accordingly. For many, though, this might not have been achievable given the tight time constraints on training and competition schedules.Research conducted over the previous year has shown that being in quarantine for the general population has an impact on our mental health. People have suffered from depression, stress, anxiety and anger, especially those who are more vulnerable.Elite athletes are not considered a vulnerable population group, but they have nonetheless been shown to experience mental health disorders and symptoms at a similar or higher rate than non-athletes. The continued uncertainty and a looming quarantine is likely to amplify already heightened anxiety levels.This could result in greater fatigue, more difficulties in training and sleep disorders. As the games approach, athletes may have to rely more on psychological support than they might have previously. Such support, however, may not be available to all competing athletes.NEW ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORSAmong elite athletes, inadequate sleep is a known problem. Research has found 50 per cent to 78 per cent suffer from sleep disturbance.Unfamiliar sleeping environments, long-haul travel, and training sessions and competitions scheduled early or late in the day, which the athletes may not be used to, does not help – nor does being confined to a hotel room for six days.Typically, endurance and strength-based athletes reduce their training load in the days or weeks leading up to a competition.This strategy enables them to recover from the fatigue of training, while ensuring that they retain or enhance subsequent performance.The strategy, known as tapering, is highly individualised and is likely to be heavily affected by a period of quarantine. Unless of course athletes have access to exercise equipment, such as treadmills, gym bikes or weights, in their rooms.For some sports, swimming or shooting, for example, athletes simply won’t be able to train in a hotel room. They can of course continue with conditioning, but not actual preparations.Stress levels may be exacerbated further knowing that close rivals, who do not face the same quarantine measures, may have full access to essential facilities.Many athletes will have probably undertaken heat acclimation before arriving to train their bodies to cope with the hot and humid conditions of a Japanese summer. In July and August temperatures range from 28 degrees Celsius to 31 degrees Celsius with relative humidity exceeding 60 per cent.For heat acclimation to work, you need to do it as close to the competition event as possible, without it affecting your pre-travel and competition training and recovery.Athletes often also do final training sessions in the competition environment, which won’t be possible if you have to spend six days in an air-conditioned hotel room.They might, however, put their hotel room facilities to best use and have hot baths, post exercise instead, to induce a heat-related physiological response.Ultimately, not being able to train for six days will not lead to so-called de-training effects: Typically it takes two weeks or more for such losses on physical condition to be noticeable.A six-day quarantine could, however, hamper those final preparations that make the difference between winning a medal and going home empty handed.The margin between the two, at the Olympic level, is incredibly tight.Katy Griggs is Senior Lecturer in Sport Engineering at Nottingham Trent University.

12,"From unlimited leave to four-day weeks, some firms are embracing more flexible time-off policies",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/unlimited-leave-four-day-work-week-flexible-time-off-15116326,04 Jul 2021 06:01AM,"From unlimited leave to four-day weeks, here are how some firms in Singapore are embracing more flexible time-off policies for their employees.SINGAPORE: From June to August, senior application consultant Heemank Verma enjoys a long weekend every week.Mr Verma, who works in fintech firm Mambu’s Singapore office, uses his Fridays off to hike one of Singapore’s nature trails and to practice a new language - Mandarin.Mambu, a Berlin-based startup, has a summer four-day work week policy for its offices across the globe. From June to August - the European summer months - the roughly 40 employees employed in Singapore also get an additional day off a week. On top of that, Mr Verma gets 25 days of annual leave.It’s a big difference from a more conventional multinational firm where he worked before, which was also in Singapore, he said.Companies in Singapore typically offer 14 to 21 days of annual leave along with a mix of other leave types such as compassionate leave, childcare leave and marriage leave.“To be honest, we are always looking forward to the three months. Even when we are working in January or February, we are excited,” said Mr Verma.“Our company does not (condone) micromanagement, people take ownership of their work. I feel like that is a fundamental basis of the four-day work week.”Mambu said that their assumption was that people will be motivated to “work smarter, and be more productive and effective” during the days they are at work.“At Mambu we prefer to focus on productivity, output and results rather than just the amount of time spent working,” said its APAC managing director Myles Bertrand.It’s among a number of firms in Singapore that have adopted more flexible leave and time-off policies in recent years, a trend that started in Silicon Valley.UNLIMITED VACATION POLICYNetflix famously started a “No Vacation Policy” way back in 2003 and other tech companies have followed suit. Rather than count the number of leave days workers are entitled to, the companies leave it up to them to decide.In Singapore, Deloitte is one company that has taken this up. Instead of different leave types, the professional services firm subsumes family leave, compassionate leave, marriage leave, volunteer leave and public holidays in-lieu into a “flexi-leave” policy.In effect, employees decide how much leave they take each year under the policy launched in July 2019. Mr Melvin Wong, senior account manager at Deloitte Singapore, said that he took 18 days of leave in the last financial year, slightly less than the 20 days he normally plans for.“Pre-pandemic, I would plan for an annual family holiday trip that would take up about 10 to 12 days while the remaining eight to 10 days are scattered through the year for birthdays, local staycations and running races,” he said.He said that he works with his supervisors to determine the calendar of events at the start of each financial year, which allows him to plan his leave while ensuring that the days off do not clash with any major client activity. During the COVID-19 pandemic, he adjusted his working hours so that he could help his family through the spurts of home-base learning and to mentally and physically recharge, he said.Deloitte’s flexi-leave policy is part of a broader work-life integration programme which also includes flexi-work - where workers have the flexibility to customise their work arrangements.They can choose to work from home when circumstances allow, and to adjust their work start and end times in accordance to their family or personal needs, said Ms Ong Siok Peng, Deloitte Singapore talent leader.“HUGE MINDSET CHANGE”“It took a little while for our people to get used to this change ... It also requires a huge mindset change for the team leaders – we educated them on the details of the new policy and have continuously communicated that the focus should be on whether KPIs (key performance indicators) are met and on the quality and  timeliness of work, and not the where and the how,” said Ms Ong. 
 
She said that under the new policy, they have found that Deloitte employees typically take an average of 20 days of leave per person.
 
“Interestingly, this figure is just about the same leave entitlement figure we had in the past. Obviously, some employees took more leave, while some took less,” she said.“We find that our people have been responsible with this flexibility, and have not encountered any issues of misuse.”During the COVID-19 pandemic, an added advantage was that no administrative work was needed to remind employees to clear leave, carry forward leave and extend leave. “Even though all of us cannot travel at the moment, employees are still encouraged to take leave to avoid burn-outs,” she added.Ms Deanna Lim, consultant for HR & business support at recruitment agency Robert Walters Singapore, said that she has seen some unusual leave policies in job postings in recent years. Some have offered unlimited annual leave, particularly in the financial services and ecommerce sectors.“Others are showing more support to their employees by providing extended maternity and adoption leave – beyond the 16 weeks of maternity leave mandated by the Government,” she said.“Other recent trends that we’ve observed include birthday leave, flexible time-off working arrangements, and study or examination leave which are offered to student employees.”At Facebook Singapore, for instance, employees get two Choice Days on top of 20 days of annual leave.They can take the time off to volunteer, celebrate a faith-based, community or cultural event, on their birthday or just use it as a free day to do something they enjoy.The company had special leave days in 2020 to support people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and this year, the Singapore office is giving workers three additional company-wide days off on to give people time to rest and recharge.“PROGRESSIVE MOVE” AWAY FROM DOCUMENTED LEAVEMs Lim said that moving forward, more firms are expected to adopt more flexible leave policies.“This allows them to stay competitive within their industry. Increasingly, we also see more firms adopting different initiatives and revising their existing employee benefits so they can support the formation of family units,” she said.Dr Rashimah Rajah, a lecturer in the Department of Management & Organisation at the National University of Singapore (NUS) Business School, called this a “progressive move” away from documented leave.For example, more firms now don't require employees to produce medical certificates if the sick leave is just for one or two days, she said.“From a management and organisational perspective, what such policies bring is a heightened amount of trust,” said Dr Rashimah. “Cultivating a culture of trust and also respecting others' personal space when they are on leave leads to better collaboration and engagement among employees.”She noted that the prevailing culture of the organisation is an important factor in determining the success of such policies. “If the culture of trust and respect has been there for some time, having these policies can improve productivity. ""However, if the culture was one that included things like micromanagement, giving employees ‘sudden freedom’ might lead to potential abuse of the system because employees might use this as a way to release frustrations with the organisation,” she said. “What is important is aligning expectations through communication, set common goals and objectives, and understanding that there might be one non-negotiable objective, but the way to get to the objective can be flexible.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

13,Commentary: Looking for a dream job can create nightmare expectations,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/dream-job-work-life-satisfaction-what-to-look-for-negotiate-15115242,04 Jul 2021 06:00AM,"The weight of expectations has never been greater – we want an enlightened boss and work that is fulfilling and yet pays well. Crystal Lim-Lange says the concept of a dream job can be problematic.SINGAPORE: You’d think that a gloomy economic outlook would make us appreciate the careers that we have but about half of our workforce is planning to leave their employer this year, according to Microsoft’s recent Work Trend Index.  I’ve seen this growing trend of dissatisfaction gain momentum amongst the hundreds of people that I’ve trained and coached since the pandemic started last year. One concept that keeps cropping up in my discussions with my coaching clients is the concept of the “dream job”. This is both powerful and problematic. On one hand, many successful careers and businesses start off with commitment to a vision.However, the “dream” becomes dangerous when people suffer from the magical thinking that the elusive dream job is responsible for transforming one’s life into an unfettered smorgasbord of unicorns and rainbows. While I do think that it is healthy for us to want fulfilling work, the concept of a dream job needs careful re-evaluation. Firstly, there is the phenomenon of expectation inflation. Behavioural economics research suggests that happiness and satisfaction can be reduced to a simple equation of expectations minus reality. Simply put, if your expectations are lower than your reality, this results in happiness. However, if your expectations are higher than what life offers, then the net result is unhappiness.Take the pioneer generation for example, who grew up in times of war and uncertainty. Their expectations were mainly to survive, provide for their family and lead a stable life.Couple these relatively low expectations with the unexpected reality of their lives in a developing Singapore – affordable property prices, asset appreciation, a rapidly expanding economy - and you get a situation where their reality was significantly better than their expectations. Net happiness, in other words.Now, contrast this with the experience of millennials, the biggest proportion of today’s workforce. These are job seekers who grew up in times of prosperity in households with fewer kids and higher parental attention. The messaging for this generation is to accomplish anything they want – the sky is the limit.Add social media to this mix – the continuous drip feeding of overnight success stories and influencers doing what they love – and you get a sea of unmet expectations at a level unseen before.For many, this means being constantly disappointed that their job is no longer just a means of providing for oneself or family. It now has to be much more: Fulfilling, meaningful, fun, secure and providing a sense of freedom.THE WEIGHT OF GREAT EXPECTATIONSThis reminds me of what renowned psychotherapist Esther Perel said about marriages. For centuries marriage was merely a financial and legal transaction.These days, we expect our partner to be our confidante, lover, therapist, mentor, best friend, soulmate etc. In effect, we are looking to one person to provide us with what a village or tribe used to. Similarly, employees tell us that it is no longer enough for their job to provide them with money, but that they also expect personal growth and intellectual stimulation. They expect more out of their managers – to provide mentorship and feedback, a work culture that gives them a sense of community, not to mention recognition, agency, stability and of course, a steady income goes without saying.It’s not just the employees that have raised the bar, we see this expectation inflation at work from companies as well. Employers too expect gruelling hours before quarterly results reporting and micromanage every detail of how work is done in pandemic times.Yes, the state of play has changed. Wanting much more in a career is not wrong – it speaks to how work and the value we place on it has evolved.Especially in these last few months, work has become all-consuming so it is natural that people have less time for leisure, self-care and community. And this may explain why we want work to provide us with all the stimulation and fulfilment that we would have sought in our leisure time.CRAFTING CAREER EXPERIMENTSAre these expectations of work and life sustainable or healthy? I’d say we need to take responsibility for our mental and emotional well-being rather than expect our jobs to fulfil us on every level. One likely enemy in your pursuit for your dream job is the paradox of choice.  Psychologist Barry Schartz, the author of The Paradox of Choice argues that: “One effect of having so many options is that it produces paralysis rather than liberation (and) even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice, we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options”. What we can do instead is spend more time on constructing careful career experiments and these can be grouped into three main categories.The first type of type of experiments are high-risk ones involving an extended break from one’s normal work, for example the “radical sabbatical”, a term coined by Laura van Bouchot who celebrated her 30th birthday trying 30 different jobs. Interestingly, Laura compared her experience to dating – she found that prospects who technically met her mental wishlist of qualities did nothing for her, while at some points she found something that didn’t meet half her checklist but blew her away. Her conclusion? “Finding the right career is not about thinking and planning but about doing lots of job dating, trying things out until you feel a spark.”This approach is quite unrealistic for most of us and as it requires massive investment and risk. The second type of career experiments are mid-risk ones known as “branching projects” or “temporary assignments” which are more practical and less intimidating. These couple existing work with temporary experiences, such as stretch assignments, volunteering part-time or starting a side-hustle business.For example, you may teach pilates on the weekends to test whether it brings you joy. Or perhaps you want to venture into event management – volunteer to help out at a large event to check out what the job really entails behind the scenes? The third type of experiments are the lowest-risk and entail networking with people from a diverse array of industries and broadening your social circle. Our world view is inordinately shaped by who we regularly spend time with.If you desperately long to break out of law but all the people you hang out with are lawyers, it’s going to be much more difficult to envisage a different reality and transition to it. Instead of pondering imaginary options in your head, join a new networking group online and schedule coffee with people in fields that you may be interested to venture in.IS THE DREAM REALLY YOURS?Many of my clients tell me their jobs were a result of their parents’ dreams, not theirs. Family pressures and expectations can have outsized impact on our early educational and job decisions, especially for Asians. In one UK study, 25 per cent of British Asian graduates admitted to feeling that their parents significantly influenced their career choice compared to just one in 10 non-Asians. As you grow and evolve as a person, your idea of what constitutes a dream job changes too. Instead of constantly thinking of a dream job, a healthier way to approach work is to look for growth experiences where you can build skills for life. When I worked in a large university, I found the bureaucracy tedious but forced myself to look at areas of opportunity. In doing that, I took on tasks that allowed me to navigate large, complex systems and learnt how career guidance worked. These skills proved highly useful when I eventually transitioned to setting up my coaching business.Similarly, instead of over-focusing on finding the ideal boss, spend your time working on your relationship skills with the one you have.This is not to say you need to stay in a job you hate or tolerate a boss from hell, but as in all relationships, there are good and bad times and in an era of change, managers don’t stay put for too long. Or ask to do something different if your organisation is large enough.The people I find most fulfilled by their work are those who use the concept of a dream job to sharpen their self-awareness about their values, while holding their expectations lightly. Ultimately, the secret of a rewarding career lies in the ability to enjoy and throw yourself into this lifelong journey of experimentation, evolution, course correction and growth. Above all, trust that with effort, all the pieces may form a tapestry of work that is bigger and more rewarding than the notion of an elusive dream job could ever be.Crystal Lim-Lange is co-author of the national bestselling book Deep Human - Practical Superskills for a Future of Success, strategic advisor to Minerva Project, and the CEO of Forest Wolf, a leadership training and talent development consultancy.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

14,Commentary: The great book revival in Singapore during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/more-reading-singapore-covid-19-coronavirus-best-bookstores-15066506,03 Jul 2021 06:08AM,"We have stayed home more days than we've wanted to but we need not be a prisoner in our confined spaces, says Josephine Chia.SINGAPORE: In Roman mythology, Janus is the god of doors, gates and transitions. This reference is not just to physical gateways but to spatial, emotional, psychological and metaphorical space.He is often depicted on a coin or in portrait as having two faces, but each facing the opposite direction.  One faces the past, the other the future. Though he represents opposites, he also represents movement from one space to the other, thus the transitionary dimension.You may have seen his icon displayed in theatres and playhouses, with his faces expressing joy as well as sorrow. This is the nature of duality that exists in our human condition.But he is not without hope, for in his right hand, he holds a key to signify that a traveller has come to shelter in a safe harbour.If you looked at what had taken place throughout the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, you may sense that the huge storm that had shocked the world is beginning to abate slightly.The global record is patchy but several countries are opening their borders and are moving from the pandemic stage to the endemic. Singapore is still in a state of heightened alert. But change is definitely coming with vaccinations, testing and contact tracing being ramped up. Janus is heralding the transitory stage.A PRISONER IN OUR MINDSThe change in daily rituals and circumstances, like working and schooling from home, have made personal space more precious. Especially, in a country where the majority live in HDB flats with confined space, it has been challenging to stay home.It made people exhibit Janus’ two countenances, one of anger and fear, even of xenophobia, the other of heart-warming kindness to others.There is an old saying that stone walls do not a prison make. We may have had to stay home more often than we liked in recent months but a prison does not come about because of restricted spaces but from the shutting of the soul to new, stimulating experiences that provoke thought and nurse contemplation.For we can become prisoners in our minds too. Watching TV, HBO, Netflix etc is an escape. It can take us out of the containment of our homes for a while and give us some respite.Many people therefore binge-watched. But there’s a limit to how many hours one can spend in front of a screen, before going hazy-eyed.As more meetings and events are being held online, on Zoom and other platforms, many are suffering from screen fatigue.THE RUSH TOWARDS BOOKSThat is why books are making such an impressive comeback. The UK found last year that people have doubled the time they spent reading books during the lockdown, with sale of fiction books going up by 16 per cent despite bookstores being closed.Interestingly, physical print-books are more in demand than e-books, possibly because e-books are still screen-based.Personally, for me, an e-book doesn’t provide the comfort of touch that a print-book has. Perhaps the interaction with paper from a tree that had breathed life has an energy that cannot be replicated by an inert electronic device.Proprietor of Closetful of Books, Ms Denise Tan says: “If we can’t travel, books allow us to do so.” Indeed. Though we cannot physically travel, the world in books do not close their borders. They stay open for us to roam and explore.Though our physical body is confined, our mental and psychological aspects of our being is untethered and free to wander in the wondrous worlds created by the story we are reading.It is this sense of freedom given by books which many people are newly discovering or re-discovering. It is only through reading these books that one can feel free. And it is in exploring new worlds that this inward journey helps people find what they have always looked for in everything they watch, do and hope for: Themselves.BOOKSTORES SEIZING THE MOMENTBookstores which can assuage this urgent hunger are seizing the moment. New Chinese language bookstore Zall opened in Orchard in February.In Singapore, boutique bookshops, like Books Actually, Woods in the Books, Chio Books, Closetful of Books, some of whom, have swapped their physical bookstores for online platforms are making healthy sales.Their owners have a verve and passion for books. They treat them not as a mere product for generating income, but present them as portals to a myriad world of adventures, magic and creative expansion. Readers are invited, not just to buy, but to experience a book.Denise tells me: “An indie bookstore is nimble enough to find new ways of putting books in the readers’ hands.”Like the other indie booksellers, Closetful of Books play an active part in reaching out to their readers. Denise and her team used to run bookfairs in schools.They were proactive in getting the books to pupils who may not have the propensity to go down to Orchard Road to browse in major bookstores. They interacted face-to-face with the kids and can ascertain their reading interests, then pair them with the right books to keep them coming back for more.They engage authors to go to schools to talk about their books with fervour so that children can see that within the covers of books, stories come alive and are not just dead text.During this period of the pandemic, due to restrictions of movement and size of crowds, Denise runs a similar service online, virtual book fairs to continue this dynamic interaction. She acts as a book consultant to parents and libraries to recommend a range of books that will whet their children’s appetite for reading and stir their capacity for imagination.The successful bookstores here are those that reach out to its potential readers, embracing them not just as buyers but as a community who enjoys reading and sharing stories, like in the halcyon, kampong days.THE TRANSFORMATIVE POWER OF BOOKSWhat is magical about reading books is its transformative quality.Reading helps the reader to access her or his own creativity and imagination. Stuck at home, people felt the need to express their creativity.Films encourage imagination but in a more limited way because the visuals in the film, pertaining to characters and places are interpreted and presented by their makers.However, in books, though the writer presents the words to allow the reader to visualise the character and place, it is the reader who brings his own creativity to invent the characters and places as she or he sees them. That is why reading a book is that much more satisfying.The reader has an active role in the creative process of the story as it unfolds. Story-telling has been around before tablets of stone first became books for reading. Psychologists will tell you the art of story-telling is an innate aspect of human living. Each of us tell stories about ourselves, to ourselves, and to others.That is why spiritual teachings try to teach you how to manage the kind of story you tell yourself so that it remains a positive one and inspires you to great things.MAKING THE MOST OF THIS SHORT LIFEThis pandemic has shown that life can be snuffed out easily. We know we have to make the most of our life, while we have the capacity.We have to value our loved ones and others while we have them. We have to live our life to the best that we can. And if we can’t go out to scale mountains, swim with dolphins, skydive or whatever, due to the imposed limitations, at least we can do it vicariously through stories and books.Like Janus, who holds the key to a safe harbour, books hold the key to our safe harbour. We can delight in our adventures and dreams, and still be assured of a safe haven in our own reading room.Why not pick up your key and open to other exciting worlds?Josephine Chia is author of many books, most famously Kampong Spirit: Gotong Royong, Goodbye My Kampong and the children’s edition, Growing Up in Kampong Potong Pasir, and most recently, Big Tree in a Small Pot.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

16,"Commentary: For victims of stalking, a new court may relieve some of the bitter agony",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/stalking-harassment-singapore-poha-sexual-ex-boyfriend-admirer-14985896,02 Jul 2021 06:06AM,"The new Protection from Harassment Court can help prosecute cases expeditiously and end the trauma for victims earlier, says AWARE president Margaret Thomas.SINGAPORE: Five years ago, in June 2016, a man was jailed for 12 months for stalking and harassing his former lover.It was a historic case – the first conviction of a stalker under the Protection from Harassment Act, or POHA.Until POHA came into force in November 2014, there was almost nothing people who were being stalked could do about it. Unless there was physical violence, the police could do little beyond issuing a warning. Stalking and other forms of harassment were simply not criminal offences. To try to get a harasser to stop, you had to file a civil suit to get an injunction.FOUR YEARS OF HARASSMENTThe closest there was to a law under which stalkers could be taken to task was the Miscellaneous Offences Act. In 2011, a woman was convicted under this law for having harassed former journalist Joanne Lee for four years.Over those four years, Joanne’s mental health deteriorated to the point where she dared not answer her office phone. She was in a constant state of anxiety, suffered panic attacks and became withdrawn.Joanne had to file three police reports and produce hundreds of letters and emails, hours of voice messages, and countless gifts she had received from the woman, before the Attorney General’s Chambers (AGC) decided there was enough evidence to prosecute.The stalker, who was found to have schizophrenia, pleaded guilty and was fined S$4,000.If POHA had been in existence then, Joanne could have been spared some of the distress she suffered.She could have applied for a protection order against her stalker. If the stalker persisted with harassment, the police could have stepped in and the AGC could have prosecuted her. And if found guilty, the stalker could have faced not just a fine but also a jail sentence.POHA criminalised harassment, stalking and other anti-social behaviour, in recognition of the many ways in which such behaviour manifests, and the seriousness of its impact.And starting in June, a specialised Protection from Harassment Court and streamlined processes, including online filing of claims, will make it easier for victims of stalking and other forms of harassment to get Protection Orders, and for cases to be heard more quickly.REDRESS FOR VAST NUMBERS OF VICTIMSPOHA was passed too late for Joanne, but it has brought relief and redress for a good number of victims of harassment since it became law.In May 2019, when the Law Ministry made some amendments to the Act, it was revealed there had been more than 1,700 prosecutions under POHA.Details of these prosecutions are not known, but undoubtedly some would have been for stalking. Police say they handled an average of about 50 stalking cases a year between 2016 and 2020.But these are likely to be just a fraction of the actual incidence.In the UK, it is thought that one in five women and one in 10 men experience stalking during their adult life, according to Paladin, a stalking advocacy service. In the US, the 2015 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey says that one in six women and one in 17 men have experienced stalking in their lifetimes.To some — especially those who believe physical violence to be more serious than psychological violence — stalking might seem to be relatively mild or harmless behaviour.This notion is likely exacerbated by irresponsible narrative tropes too often found in popular culture, which laud a prospective lover for his “persistence” even after he is rejected by the object of his affection.Yet for those who have experienced stalking, which these days includes cyber-stalking, the effect can be devastating and life-changing: Constant anxiety, fear, anger, terror, panic attacks, depression, self-doubt, insecurity, loss of self-esteem. These affect both mental and physical health, which in turn affects their work and social lives.After all, stalking, like all forms of sexual violence, is ultimately about asserting power and control over another person - in regularly reminding them that their privacy is being eroded and their life is not entirely their own.With today’s multitudinous points of access into someone’s life - not just at their homes or workplaces, but on their social media and other digital accounts - perpetrators have so many more ways to do just that.A CASE OF PROLONGED AND VICIOUS STALKINGIn the 2016 case of the first stalker to be jailed under POHA, the teenage victim had suicidal thoughts during the three years she was harassed by a former boyfriend.After their brief sexual relationship, he insisted on accompanying her to school and back. When she tried to avoid him by blocking him on her phone, he posted nude pictures of her on her school’s social media platforms and distributed flyers with these pictures in her neighbourhood.In sending the stalker to jail, District Judge Lim Keng Yeow said the man’s acts and threats were prolonged and unrelenting, and acute and vicious.They were, the judge said, “aimed at keeping the victim trapped under his power so as to do his bidding and calculated to cause as much embarrassment and inflict as much humiliation as possible”.VICTIMS OTHERWISE SUFFER IN SILENCEPsychologists say there are several types of stalkers, including those driven by lust, the love-scorned (usually an acquaintance), and those who stalk celebrities.Most commonly, however, stalkers are current or former intimate partners. And, as with other forms of sexual violence, victims of stalking may not seek help because they do not fully understand what is happening to them or realise that it is illegal.They may not know where they can go for help. They may blame themselves for “having landed themselves in such a situation”, or they may think no one will believe them.For one woman who called AWARE’s Sexual Assault Care Centre, her anguish was compounded by the fact that her stalker was a man with whom she had had an extramarital affair. Despite the affair ending, her ex-lover stalked and harassed her persistently, repeatedly demanding that she come away with him.In Singapore, the legal framework is in place, with what constitutes stalking and harassment clearly defined. And it has just been made simpler and easier for people who are being harassed to seek redress. As Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam recently said, people need to know that they do not have to suffer in silence because there is a system to protect them.(Who gives sexual assault victims second chances? Is gender equality a pipe dream because men serve NS? Listen to Minister K Shanmugam give his frank take on women's issues, sexual assault and NS on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)OUTREACH AND EDUCATIONWhat is now needed is outreach and education so people know they have recourse to help (for example, the National Care Hotline) if someone is causing them distress and pain.But in the longer term, we have to educate our children about such matters. We need comprehensive sexuality education in our schools to prepare young people for the relationships they will have in life, both good and bad.They need, for instance, to understand the psychology and power dynamics behind stalking behaviours. They need to know why acts such as these are wrong, and what to do if it happens to them – or if they find themselves drawn to such behaviour.While there are, of course, female stalkers and male victims of stalking, the statistics show that like so many facets of sexual violence, stalking is linked to a gendered power imbalance. So ultimately, as Minister Shanmugam declared in September 2020, we can only hope to reduce the incidence of sexual violence if there is gender equality.“Every boy and girl must grow up imbibing the value of gender equality,” he said. “They need to be taught from a very early age that boys and girls are to be treated equally, and very importantly, with respect. It has to be a deep mindset change.”Let’s hope this does not take a generation or two. Much will depend on whether we as a society can come together and commit to this vision of gender equality.A good start will be made if the Government’s White Paper that is due later this year paints a bold and inspiring picture of what can be, with a clear pathway of the practical steps that will be taken to get us to the goal of a gender-equal Singapore.Margaret Thomas is President of AWARE.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

18,Commentary: Are university-educated women in Singapore asking too much for marriage? No,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/census-single-40s-women-men-single-dating-career-salary-marriage-15109758,30 Jun 2021 06:03AM,"Almost one in five female university grads in their 40s is single. Three such women tell Tracy Lee why.SINGAPORE: Every decade, the unveiling of the latest Singapore Population Census data holds some delicious morsels of information of who we are as a nation.The latest 2020 iteration surveyed 150,000 households. One finding that jumped out at me was singlehood becoming more common among males with lower educational qualifications, and among females with higher educational qualifications. More specifically, 21.1 per cent of men aged 40 to 49 who did not complete secondary school were single in 2020, compared with 12.3 per cent of men in the same age group who went to university.Similarly, 8.7 per cent of women aged 40 to 49 who did not complete secondary school were single in 2020, but 18.7 per cent of women in this age group who went to university were single – a figure that was roughly the same 10 years ago.According to the book The Adapted Mind: Evolutionary Psychology and the Generation of Culture by anthropologists Jerome Barkow and John Tooby and psychologist Leda Cosmides, characteristics that women link to high mate value include economic status, willingness to invest in relationships, security, and control of resources.So it is not difficult to see why men who only completed primary school and may be more likely to have lower paying jobs, remain unattached. Especially in a country like Singapore where cost of living is high, and where the economy is driven by high-knowledge industries such as finance, info-communications, and value-added manufacturing.Factor in the sky-high cost of housing, cars, and raising children who need tuition to survive the system – it’s no wonder there are so many dual-career couples. In fact, they form the largest group among married couples, increasing from 47.1 per cent in 2010 to 52.5 per cent in 2020.(She went into despair each time she had to breastfeed. But Elizabeth Quek says there’s one thing that made all the difference in this difficult motherhood journey on CNA's Heart of the Matter's podcast.) ENTER THE EDUCATED WOMANGiven how expensive and competitive life in Singapore is, you would think a university-educated career woman would have sky-high mate value. She’d be in the best position to help foot the bills, teach the children heuristic math models and give their partners helpful career advice and contacts.But no – one in five university-educated women in their 40s is single. What gives? Are they too picky, too busy, too independent, too intimidating?Since quite a few of my girlfriends fall into the “single, tertiary-educated 40-something careerwoman” demographic, I reached out to three of them for insights.Media consultant Hwee, who’s 48 and in a long-term relationship (neither she nor her partner wish to get married), admits she can be hard to handle even though she never had trouble getting dates, or entering a series of long-term relationships.“Since my 20s, I’ve had guys tell me that I’m too outspoken, too independent, too intimidating,’’ adding that while she’s mostly “fun to be with, low-maintenance and chill” she still ended up in big arguments with past boyfriends over ideological differences and broke up with them.“One said if we were to get married, I’d have to convert to his religion. Another said he would get married only if we had kids, knowing full well I didn’t want any. Then he got an overseas posting, but there was no way I was going to give up my job to move with him if we weren’t getting married.”“Yet another was all for my career, except that he enjoyed gloating over how much more money he made than me,” she recalls.It’s something she can’t help, she says. “If I do encounter b*******, I call it out. I don’t see why I have to defer to someone who’s clearly wrong, unreasonable, or idiotic,’’ she says emphatically.“Maybe I’ve been unlucky in love? Too unwilling to compromise? Bad at picking the right kind of guy? Missed some invisible ‘critical deadline’ for marrying by 35?” she muses.One guy she went on a couple of dinners with told her point blank she was too smart for her own good.“He said I was good company but it was hard for him to imagine being in a relationship with me. He said I was better off dating foreigners who could ‘tahan outspoken women’.”“Can you imagine that comment came from a top lawyer in his 50s? So if even smart, successful, outspoken, older men are intimidated by me, what about the average dude?” she wonders.GIVING UP TOO MUCH?But dig deeper and you find a whole host of other concerns. Women like Hwee earn a good keep, they have apartments and are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves.Marriage is about kids at the end of the day, she tells me.  And that’s where the biggest rub lies.Let’s get real about who does the heavy lifting, she says. “I feel in marriage and motherhood, the woman gets the short end of the stick. It can hold back her career, while burdening her with the lion’s share of household responsibilities.”At 45, she finally met someone who admires her independent mind and lifestyle but is not about to step into the Registry of Marriages anytime soon.Dee, a 43-year-old project manager has these exact sentiments – she’s had five long-term relationships but they ended when the men wanted a family.“Many friends say I should have gotten married, then I will change my mind about having kids at a later stage. I don’t agree. I have also seen my married friends fighting over frivolous things, and going through divorces, and I don’t understand why did they put themselves through this,” she observes.She says she doesn’t have an ideal guy, and is open to dating someone who earns less than her – she’s done that before. But she’s had a fair share of the proverbial frogs in the dating scene.EMBRACING SINGLEHOODFor my educated female friends, dating is a hit and miss in Singapore – they come across angry men on the rebound, nervous wrecks who think women are out to cheat them and the downright weirdos who send pictures of their genitalia.The sheer tedium of it means many of these women simply go on leading the rich, full lives they’ve always had – working hard, exploring the world for work or play, tending to dogs, cats and plants, and taking up interesting hobbies. Those who enjoy the company of children (without the full responsibilities of parenthood), dote on nieces, nephews and friends’ kids.But for many, like my friend Melanie, a senior advertising executive in her early 40s, poor relationships in her past have made it very clear what she won’t settle for.Are her standards unreasonably high? No, she says and proceeds to give me a list.Will she accept that potential dates may find this a high bar and so she may be forever single?“If it doesn’t happen, it’s fine. No one will die. I’d rather be single and happy, than attached but irritated.”Tracy Lee is a freelance writer who writes about food, travel, fashion and beauty.Editor's note: The headline has been edited to better reflect the substance of the Commentary.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

21,Commentary: How Britney Spears was trapped in a web of injustice,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/britney-spears-conservator-guardian-us-court-framing-documentary-15108750,29 Jun 2021 06:03AM,"While celebrities like Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson were surrounded by yes-men, Britney Spears is surrounded by no-men, says the Financial Times’ Henry Mance.LONDON: There are many villains in the story of pop star Britney Spears.There are the pundits, who used her for sexual titillation when she was a girl and as a punchline when she was a young woman. There are the paparazzi, who harassed her when she was with her baby. There are ex-boyfriends, hangers-on and us, the demanding fans.The justice system’s job is to recognise villains, and send them packing.Instead, for 13 years, courts in California have rewarded Spears’s father Jamie, a failed businessman who struggled with alcoholism, once filed for bankruptcy and who, according to the documentary , was often absent from his daughter’s childhood. They have enabled arguably the most egregious villain of them all.In 2008, when his daughter suffered an apparent mental health crisis, Jamie asked a court to make him her conservator – that is, legal guardian.He has mostly kept the power since. He has decided which friends she sees, what medical treatment she receives and what happens to her fortune, estimated at US$60 million.Yet, from the start, Spears made clear that she didn’t want him to have this power. She was prepared to accept a conservator, but not him, her one-time lawyer said in Framing Britney Spears.The court dismissed her view, deeming her mentally unfit to appoint a lawyer.Spears is now 39, and for most of her adult life she has been controlled by a man she does not want in that role. She is deemed well enough to perform to thousands, but not to visit her friends.HORRIFYING EVIDENCEOn Wednesday, I listened to the singer break her public silence over the situation to a Los Angeles court.Her evidence was horrifying. She said those involved in managing the conservatorship, including her father, “should be in jail”; “I would honestly like to sue my family”.They had made her work seven days a week, taken her credit cards and given her no privacy when undressing. “In California the only similar thing to this is called sex-trafficking,” she said.They would not let her have an intrauterine device removed, because they didn’t want her to have more kids. But they did allow a doctor to prescribe her lithium “out of nowhere”.In her younger days, Spears was remarkably composed. On Wednesday, she sounded anxious. “I cry every day,” she said.When she last spoke in court, she had been made to feel “like I was dead, like I didn’t matter”. This time, she told the judge: “I wish I could stay on the phone with you forever.”GUARDIANSHIP WIDELY ABUSED IN AMERICASpears’s story is the converse of some celebrity tragedies. Elvis Presley and Michael Jackson were surrounded by yes-men. Spears is surrounded by no-men.As a result, her story is more universal. Guardianship is widely abused in the US.Professional guardians can identify elderly people, with minor health conditions, and tell a court these people are unable to fend for themselves, without even having to inform the subjects or their closest relatives.Hearings may last only a few minutes. Then the guardian has control of a stranger’s life. They can move them into a care home and sell their possessions to pay for it. The fees roll in.What is it about the US justice system that produces such flagrant injustices?This practice was satirised in the film I Care A Lot. One estimate is that 1.5 million American adults, with US$273 billion in assets, are in the hands of guardians.There are few examples of conservatees escaping the arrangements.Spears has the unique advantage of devoted fans, the Free Britney movement. The lesson of her case is that courts should pay heed to people with disabilities and mental health problems, whether or not they are famous.The strongest restrictions should come with the strongest oversight. Right now, if you are vulnerable and asset-rich, the US justice system may not only fail to protect you from the villains, it may well facilitate them.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

22,Man jailed 23 years for sexually abusing girlfriend's daughters aged 10 and 17,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jailed-23-years-for-sexually-abusing-girlfriend-daughters-15109126,28 Jun 2021 05:13PM,"SINGAPORE: Over three years, a man sexually abused his girlfriend's 17-year-old daughter before turning to molest her 10-year-old sister and escalating the acts to sexual assault.Both girls ""suffered alone"" and in silence, not knowing the other had been subjected to ""similar deplorable acts"", said the prosecution. The younger girl was found with self-harm marks on her wrist and forearm when the abuse was uncovered.The 53-year-old offender, who cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the sisters' identities, was sentenced to 23 years' jail on Monday (Jun 28).Of this, six months was in lieu of caning as he is above 50 and cannot be caned.The court heard that the man met the victims' mother in 2010 at a coffee shop. A week after this, he was introduced to her two daughters.They began dating, and the accused provided financially for the victims' mother, who used part of the money on her daughters.As the girls' mother was unable to take care of them, they were admitted into an approved home and were given home leave only on some occasions. Whenever they were given home leave, they stayed with their mother and the accused.In November 2012, the girls' mother gave birth to another child fathered by the accused. The child was also given to a home in 2013 as the girls' mother could not care for the child.The accused began molesting the older daughter in 2015. He turned to the younger daughter, who was 10 at the time, in 2017 when she stayed with the family while on home leave.He began by molesting her when she came out of the shower, and moved to molesting her while she was asleep. These offences progressed to penetrative acts, said the prosecutors.On one occasion, the accused persistently preyed on the girl despite the girl saying no.He attempted to rape her but was unsuccessful, and remembered ""that it would be difficult"" to do so with young girls as ""he has a young daughter of his own"", according to court documents.YOUNGER VICTIM TOLD SCHOOL RESEARCHER ABOUT ABUSEThe offences came to light in May 2019, when the victim told a school researcher that the accused had touched her.The school, as well as officers from the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) were notified. They had some difficulty locating the victim, as she had stopped going to school and was seldom at the family flat.Officers managed to locate her in August 2019 and took her to a social service office, with a police report subsequently lodged.Investigations into the case uncovered the sexual abuse against the victim's older sister by the accused. He molested her while she was cooking in the kitchen, and told her not to tell her mother.She complied as she feared having to return to the children's home after escaping from it, a fact that the accused knew.The police arrested the accused on Aug 15, 2019. The younger victim was assessed in a hospital the findings were consistent with her description of what happened. She was also found to have multiple blade marks on her wrist and forearm from self-harm.She told a psychiatrist that she cut herself to relieve her stress over friendship difficulties and when she recalled what the accused did to her.She said she felt disgusted, sad, angry and helpless during the incidents of sexual abuse and remained quiet during the assault.The psychiatrist stated that the girl's anger and sadness continued ""long after the incident until she disclosed the matter to a counsellor with whom she felt safe"".The victim also said the accused had also shown her pornographic videos on multiple occasions.The accused was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and disclosed that he had ""entertained erotic thoughts"" of the girl for a year.He pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault by penetration of a minor and one charge of molestation. Another nine charges including attempted rape were considered in sentencing.Prosecutors called the accused ""a persistent sexual offender who repeatedly exploited the trust placed in him as a father figure, and sexually abused two young girls for his own perverse gratification"".This is the lowest overall number of total daily cases reported in Singapore since Jun 9 when four infections were identified.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

23,"The Big Read: In a prolonged crisis, pragmatism rules as recent graduates put dreams on hold",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/prolonged-crisis-pragmatism-graduates-job-search-pay-15097280,28 Jun 2021 06:01AM,"The story of broken dreams and difficult job search is not uncommon among young jobseekers as Singapore’s economy tries to chart its path in a pandemic-forced new normal.SINGAPORE: Eager to carve a career in the performing arts, Ms Lili Muslihah had ended her stint with a theatre company in February last year to go freelance — a common route for many in the industry.But the 27-year-old’s dreams came crashing down after the COVID-19 virus began to spread its tentacles here, infecting hundreds and then thousands, and causing havoc to the Singapore economy, as elsewhere around the world.“Right after I resigned, the whole situation just unravelled, all the (performing arts) events were cancelled,” said Ms Lili, who graduated from the Royal Central School of Speech and Drama at the University of London with a degree in theatre practice in December 2019.She began looking for odd jobs to help sustain her income, and eventually took up a gig as a food delivery rider during the two-month circuit breaker period, which began in early April last year.At the time, she still hoped to return to the performing arts scene when things improved.But weeks turned into months, and before she knew it, she had been delivering food for 10 months.Pursuing a performing arts career in Singapore is challenging enough in normal times. What more during what has been dubbed a once-in-a-generation crisis?Amid the long drawn-out pandemic, the realisation eventually hit Ms Lili, who began to look for a job outside the industry in January, applying for over 100 job openings on various career portals.“I applied for jobs in healthcare, corporate, even government positions … whatever I saw, I just tried.” But she hardly got any responses.It was only in May when she finally received an offer from an industry she had never expected to be in — education. She now teaches English part-time at a tuition centre, earning about S$1,000 a month.Ms Lili’s story of broken dreams and difficult job search is not uncommon among young jobseekers as Singapore’s economy tries to chart its path in a pandemic-forced new normal.According to the Ministry of Manpower’s (MOM) latest labour market report for the first quarter of this year, the youth unemployment rate was 10.6 per cent in 2020, when Singapore experienced its worst recession since its independence in 1965.The figure is higher compared with previous economic downturns — 8.8 per cent during the 2009 Global Financial Crisis, and 9.3 per cent during the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) pandemic.Economists said that while the unemployment numbers during last year’s recession seemed only slightly higher than the previous downturns, this was partly because many youths had taken on temporary positions, many of which were created under government-initiated schemes, such as the SGUnited Traineeships Programme.MOM said that four in 10 youths in employment were in temporary or contract jobs, and were mostly students who were working on the side. A youth is defined by the ministry as a person aged 15 to 24. Interviews with those in the age group as well as recent graduates aged slightly older found that the latter are in a similar predicament.Like Ms Lili, many of those interviewed had struggled to look for employment. And even though the economy and job market are expected to recover this year, jobseekers from the class of 2020 now find themselves having to compete with the graduating cohort this year. Nevertheless, some of those who graduated last year said they were grateful for the traineeship programmes that had been offered to them, since these allowed them to upskill and in some cases, even led to conversion to full-time roles.“In previous recessions, we didn't have the SGUnited Traineeships Programme, and the unemployment rate stood at 9-odd per cent,” said DBS Bank senior economist Irvin Seah.“(Now) even with the traineeship programme and employment-focused policy measures, the unemployment rate has still hit 10 per cent.“It would have been a lot worse compared to previous crises ... (the youth unemployment rate) is only marginally higher now that we have these government measures,” he said.TRAINEESHIP WOES AND TRIUMPHSA graduate who wanted to be known only as Walter had been taking on performing arts roles on a freelance basis, such as providing support at live performances. But like Ms Lili, his lifeline was cut when the industry ground to a halt due to COVID-19. The 28-year-old graduated from a local university in 2019 with a degree in the arts, and had to work as a food delivery rider during the circuit breaker period. He searched for opportunities at the same time, and found a traineeship with a tech start-up under the SGUnited Traineeships Programme.The government-funded programme — part of a slew of measures to cushion the pandemic’s impact on the job market — is meant to help fresh graduates develop industry-relevant skills, and they also receive a monthly training allowance.Walter’s traineeship started in October, and he was tasked with marketing the company’s products, which included managing its social media presence. This was a “360-degree turn” from the industry he had set his sights on before the pandemic.While he knew that some traineeships had a structured programme where trainees were attached to a mentor, Walter said that his company had no such structure. He was “thrown into the deep end”, as it was a new role created just for him.“What I’m surmising is that the firm decided to take full advantage of the programme and tried to open up a position and see if anything comes out of it,” he said. While the programme is a 12-month stint, he has no intention to convert full-time, even if offered.Walter did not want to reveal his real name as he has not told his employer about his plans to leave the firm.Ms Lili said that in her job search, she did not consider applying for traineeships, due to the prevailing sentiment among her peers that trainees would do full-time work but be paid lower than market rates.But there are others who have reaped the benefits of the traineeships.Mr Andrew Lee, who was featured last year as part of Big Read on the national traineeship programme, had worked for almost a year in his traineeship at logistics and warehousing firm Yang Kee Logistics when he received the good news — that he would be converted to a full-time software developer executive.“My (initial) thoughts were that software development will be stressful and very fast-paced and I would not have any work-life balance,” the 24-year-old said.But his traineeship at the firm has proven otherwise. “I’m quite happy as I’m quite comfortable here, and it isn’t so stressful,” Mr Lee said.The polytechnic graduate, who had served National Service before embarking on the traineeship last year, said that he had decided even before graduation that he wanted to do software development, but was not sure which industry to enter.“For coding, I could go anywhere, so I did not have a specific industry in mind such as banking or logistics, I felt like anything would do,” he said. “During this time, you can’t be picky.”In response to queries, Workforce Singapore (WSG) said that as of April, about 9,200 had joined the SGUnited Traineeships Programme, and that most of these traineeships are still ongoing.Of the figure, over 680 graduates had been offered full-time conversions with their host organisations, or had found full-time employment elsewhere.“We expect more fresh graduates to come onboard the programme after the 2021 cohort graduates progressively from the various Institutes of Higher Learning this year,” WSG said.For participants in the programme who have not secured full-time employment, WSG said it has been engaging with them to support their job search.“Experience gained from these contract work and traineeships will add to their resume and allow them to build meaningful experience and useful networks which can open doors to potential new careers,” WSG said.ENTERING A CRISIS-HIT WORKING WORLDAs the economic outlook remains murky, and with the pandemic forcing many companies to rethink their business models — all of which will have an impact in terms of jobs availability and salaries offered — some fresh graduates from this year’s cohort have had to go back to the drawing board when it comes to their job search.For Mr Muhd Izzdanial, he had found a liking for nature during a final semester internship in the first half of this year with the National Parks Board (NParks).During the internship, the Nanyang Technological University (NTU) biological sciences graduate was tasked to organise workshops for youths interested in the biodiversity here, heading out on field trips to nature parks around Singapore.The 24-year-old also volunteered at butterfly-watching events organised by NParks, among other responsibilities.“During this job, I began to know more about animals in Singapore and I can name most of them,” he said.A full-time stint with NParks is one of about 40 job openings that he has applied for since he started his job search this month.Mr Izzdanial is also open to other industries, such as data engineering or as a laboratory scientist, both of which are more related to his degree.“(I’m willing to work in) whatever industry to get through this and earn a salary, until I find a better suited role,” he said.He said his ideal job would involve nature advocacy — teaching members of the public about the biodiversity here.Apart from getting a job, some fresh graduates are also concerned whether employers will lowball them and “take advantage” of the pandemic to get a good deal.Melissa (not her real name), who graduated in May with a finance degree from a local university, had initially hoped to be recruited for a data analyst role in the finance industry.However, the 22-year-old was unable to get her desired job despite making more than 400 applications in the months before she graduated.She suffers from one disadvantage: She lacks the experience that graduates from the past year’s batch, all vying for the same jobs, have.“Last year, there were also traineeships, so we are also competing with (last year’s graduates) for full-time roles,” she said.Instead, Melissa found a data analyst role in a different industry. As she was not familiar with the industry, she had quoted a low starting salary, which the firm accepted.“I then realised what the industry value (for starting salaries) was, but they were not willing to change the terms.”At the same time, Melissa was accepted into a part-time Masters programme in analytics at another local university, which she decided to pursue in the hope the pandemic would be over by the time she completed her studies.Upon accepting the offer, she quit her job at the firm early this month (June), after working for only one day, as she “didn’t want to waste the company’s time”.She did not want to give her real name, nor reveal the industry she had briefly joined, as she did not want to be identified by her former employer.“I think it is an ethical issue, if it’s a pandemic and we give in and accept a lower pay, when the pandemic is over, the company will tag their salary to your previous salary, and employers won’t understand that your pay was lower because of the pandemic,” Melissa said.Indeed, a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research in the United States published last year shows that cohorts that had graduated during the period of economic weakness following the Global Financial Crisis in 2009 had weaker earning trajectories compared to cohorts that entered the job market earlier.It was also found that these cohorts, which face high unemployment during graduation, tend to show lower employment rates throughout their careers.Local universities said that they have a slew of support measures to help fresh graduates find employment.For example, a National University of Singapore (NUS) spokesman said that the NUS Centre for Future-ready Graduates has several initiatives to help recent graduates, including job search support through virtual networking events with potential employers, and career advisors whom students can consult.NUS will also offer four free continuing education and training (CET) modules to the Class of 2020 and Class of 2021 graduates until March 31 next year.Similarly, NTU alumni who graduated last year will receive an additional S$1,600 in alumni credits for CET courses, on top of the existing S$1,600 available to all alumni.Singapore Management University’s director of the Dato’ Kho Hui Meng Career Centre Sim Cher Young said that the career centre has been providing clinics to graduating students to help them “fine tune their employability skills in time for the applications season and soon after with interviews”.The centre also offers support for alumni up to three years after they graduate.ADVICE FROM HR EXPERTSGiven that the pandemic has now affected a second batch of graduates, it is up to those who graduated earlier but have still not secured full-time employment to find ways to stand out from the crowd, human resource (HR) experts said.Mr Adrian Choo, founder of career consulting company Career Agility International, said that it is important for job-seeking graduates to learn more about the industries that they are interested in.“Be proactive, reach out to talk to people (in the industries), talk to target companies, there’s also always online courses,” he said.He added that unless a person has studied in a specialised field, such as in a pilot school or medicine, what graduates study in universities typically has “low relevance” to the industry which they enter eventually.“Employers want to see the potential, the promise, and in the long run, they want people who can bring potential to the company,” he said. “You have to show me that you have been learning, that you are capable of performing.”Agreeing, veteran HR practitioner Adrian Tan said that one advice he would give to recently graduated jobseekers is to look for job listings in their desired industries, and look for what skills employers are looking for in those roles.“Look at the gap between the job posting and yourself. And ask yourself, for this gap, how to acquire the experience?“And if in future an interview does materialise, you can easily tell people ‘Oh, I got this skill set from Coursera, related to project management’, for example,” said Mr Tan.Veteran HR practitioner Carmen Wee said that graduates during this period should not fixate on their “dream” industries if these have been impacted by the pandemic. Instead, they should be flexible and look for opportunities in adjacent fields.“Those in aviation, tourism, hospitality ... they may need to find adjacent skills, move into industries that make use of their skills,” said Ms Wee.For example, those in the hospitality industry could find work in other industries such as the food and beverage sector which are looking for people with customer service skills.She added that fresh graduates should take up whatever jobs they can during this period to gain some base experience, as they may not have much leverage over prospective employers as they still lack the skills.“If these graduates have the skills the market really wants, they would be snapped up by now,” Ms Wee said. “Even if it’s a junior position, you need to start from somewhere.”Mr Tan added that experience can come in many forms, and need not be tagged to an institution.For example, a mass communications graduate could start a YouTube channel while searching for a job, and gain experience in how to edit videos and create content.“When an employer asks for your portfolio, you can say ‘yes, here are these videos that I made on YouTube’,” he said.As for those who are considering going into the gig economy as food delivery riders, Mr Tan said that it is a good way to earn income — but only out of necessity.Graduates should remember to juggle this part-time work and upgrade their career-relevant skills at the same time.“You just want to build a runway (because) you still need time to practise your craft,” said Mr Tan.With many people — including recent graduates — turning to working as food delivery riders to make ends meet as employment opportunities dry up, food delivery companies reiterated that they have been providing upskilling opportunities to fresh graduates who have come onboard their platforms.A Foodpanda spokesperson said that while the company does not keep track of the number of fresh graduates among its delivery riders, the percentage of riders between the ages of 18 and 24 is around 10 to 15 per cent.The spokesperson said that it has partnered with various organisations, including SkillsFuture, to develop and offer learning content for its riders, including courses in financial literacy.The other major food delivery firms — Deliveroo and Grab — were also unable to provide figures for fresh graduates working with them.A Grab spokesperson said that it has partnered with Microsoft and Temasek Polytechnic as part of the SGUnited Skills programme for an eight-month training programme for individuals who are interested in software development roles, among other opportunities.Deliveroo has partnered with OpenClassrooms, an online education platform for vocational training, to provide free online learning for riders in Singapore and globally across a range of different subjects, including help to start-up businesses, soft skills training and web design courses.CHALLENGE FOR POLICYMAKERSWhen it comes to youth unemployment, a key indicator that the economy is out of the woods is when it is able to create permanent jobs, said Mr Seah, the DBS Bank senior economist.“Today, many of those jobs created for fresh grads are actually temp positions, not permanent roles and henceforth there is less job security.“The key question is how are we able to create more permanent roles, and that is the biggest challenge for policymakers today,” he said.The long-term unemployment rate here — which refers to those unemployed for at least 25 weeks — among the youths was 1.1 per cent in 2020, comparable to the overall average of 1 per cent, and during the SARS pandemic (1.3 per cent) and the Global Financial Crisis (1 per cent).It is also one of the lowest when compared against other economies such as France (8.4 per cent), the United Kingdom (4 per cent) and Hong Kong (3.8 per cent).OCBC Bank head of treasury research and strategy Selena Ling said that while the youth employment situation is far from ideal, the job environment is improving “slightly” amid a broader economic recovery.The Government expects full-year economic growth to reach 4 to 6 per cent this year. A recent survey of private sector economists by the Monetary Authority of Singapore projects an expansion beyond the range at 6.5 per cent.Ms Ling said: “(Employers and consumers) are more confident of the recovery story, as vaccines are underway and people can look ahead … if the consumers are willing to spend, then businesses will be more confident to expand their operations.”Agreeing, Mr Seah said that it is thus important for Singapore to normalise its economic activities.“If the engines of the economy start to create more permanent jobs, then we will be able to absorb the slack in the labour market.”Should the economy fail to provide permanent roles for youths, long-term consequences can arise, as observed in other economies with high youth unemployment.During the debt crisis in Europe that began in 2008, for example, thousands of youths in the region were left without jobs.“Youth unemployment spiked up to 40 per cent (then) in some countries,” said Mr Seah. “It became a social problem, there was more violence and more crimes … It was short of saying that there was a lost generation.”For Ms Lili and Walter, the lessons that they have taken away from the pandemic have made them stronger, and determined to let go of old dreams and venture into new industries. “I have gotten a lot more resilient, especially over the course of the past year,” said Walter. “I think the turning point was realising that it is ok to not be in an industry that I was prepared for from my undergrad days.”After his traineeship ends in October, Walter plans to take up courses in counselling, as he intends to eventually set up a venture or initiative to help counsel individuals in the arts scene. The industry does not receive enough support on the mental health front, he said.“Taking space outside of this industry I love so much has given me both hard and soft skills that will be useful, if and when I do choose to come back,” Walter added.For Ms Lili, she plans to return to schools to teach dance classes, something she had been doing before the pandemic, when co-curricular activities are allowed to resume.“I feel that all these hardships in looking for a stable job has built me up as a person, as I also have to keep encouraging myself to push on whenever I hit a bump on the road,” she said. “It’s part of moving on with life and adapting to new changes.”Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramFor more news like this, visit todayonline.comCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

25,Commentary: Pop stars used to bare skin. Now they bare their souls,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/music-eilish-spears-lovato-gaga-metoo-abuse-mental-health-media-15090460,26 Jun 2021 06:19AM,"Today, many artists are making their personal vulnerabilities – not their music, their performances or their bodies – the centerpiece of their brands, says a professor.BOSTON, Massachusetts: In Billie Eilish’s 2019 video for Bury A Friend, the then-17-year-old singer blurs the lines between being in a nightmare and being committed to a psychiatric hospital.“I want to end me,” she repeats six times before the song ends.But somehow, that’s not what stuck with audiences, media outlets or industry decision-makers, who – until her British Vogue cover broke on May 2 – were more likely to talk about how groundbreaking she was for wearing baggy clothes than her repeated mentions of suicidal thoughts.It’s a familiar story, whether it’s Amy Winehouse singing about not wanting to go to rehab before dying of alcohol poisoning at 27, or Kurt Cobain writing a song called I Hate Myself And Want To Die before dying by suicide at 27.Audiences devour trauma narratives. Perhaps they provide a source of comfort by validating viewers’ own experiences, making them feel less alone or reminding them that they’re comparatively lucky.On the flip side, the titillating content can offer fans a sort of voyeuristic pleasure from the safety of their living rooms.In any case, the implicit agreement appears to be that artists may express their pain as long as audiences can imagine that it’s not really a problem they need to be concerned with, but is just something being amplified for artistic effect.While these revelations can boost an artist’s popularity, they can also overshadow all other aspects of the artists’ life and work – and can end up veering into another form of exploitation.AFTER THE CLOTHES COME OFF, WHAT’S NEXT?Since the advent of MTV in the 1980s, the music industry has fashioned women pop stars to resonate more as sexy entertainers than as talented musicians.They are more likely to be framed as gorgeous, frivolous or “hot messes” than vocally or musically adept. Positioning and managing female artists this way has had a negative effect on their creative expression, mental health and career longevity.Because top stars have been shedding their clothes for decades, skin-deep revelations have become so common they no longer stand out.So, in a crisis for connection, stars reversed the order of operations, keeping their clothes on while sharing their secrets. Stars began to expose their insides – more specifically, their inner turmoil – in bids for deeper relationships with their fans.This broke the social contract of stardom. For decades, public relations efforts presented women stars as perfect – an impossible illusion for anyone to maintain. Until stars such as Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston experienced public breakdowns, their struggles had largely been hidden to protect their impeccable brands.Social media further changed the dynamic. Audiences demanded greater authenticity rather than PR spin. And that’s exactly what they’ve been getting for the past several years, as pop star brands have begun to embody and reflect current cultural concerns about misogyny, racism, sexual violence and mental health.EMOTIONAL STRIPPINGArtists’ openness about their experiences with sexual violence, trauma and addiction represents an important shift toward thinking about them as people more than products.However, today, many artists are making their personal vulnerabilities – not their music, their performances or their bodies – the centerpiece of their brands.Prior to the popularisation of #MeToo in 2017, pop stars had been offering their stories for years to varying levels of reception. In 2013, Madonna shared that she had been raped at knifepoint shortly after moving to New York City.In 2014, Kesha alleged that producer Dr Luke “sexually, physically, verbally and emotionally” abused her for years, and in 2016 Lady Gaga revealed that she had experienced sexual trauma, which resulted in ongoing PTSD.As the #MeToo movement gained prominence in the fall of 2017, these popular artists experienced a long-overdue cultural rebranding, becoming esteemed warriors seeking to hold abusive systems and individual abusers accountable.Audiences and media outlets became more sensitive to women’s struggles with mental health, addiction and trauma, and began to realise that maybe the stars’ breakdowns were actually reasonable human responses to various forms of gender-based abuse.They started hating the game, rather than blaming the players, and wanting to know more – all as the dominant streaming services were thirsty for more winning content.The floodgates opened, but in typical American fashion, a good thing was overextended to the point of absurdity.In recent years, more stars have told their own survivor stories in powerfully direct or resonant ways: Ariana Grande shared a brain scan to reveal her PTSD diagnosis in 2019; Mariah Carey released a memoir in which she discussed past abuse, her 2001 breakdown and her bipolar disorder diagnosis; and, in 2021, Pink dropped a documentary about her aptly titled “Beautiful Trauma” world tour.Stars’ talent and musicianship has become almost incidental, subservient to their ability to process their pain in public. Pop stars’ oversharing detailed trauma stories has become routine.I call it “emotional stripping”.Emotional stripping is different from when artists transform trauma into great art, as Beyonce did in Lemonade and Fiona Apple pulled off in Fetch The Bolt Cutters.In each album, the artist is able to universalise her struggles without giving away all of the personal details. These albums embolden the stars as they share their rage, fear, disappointments and vulnerabilities.But emotional stripping prioritises the overexposure of the star’s human self – her traumas, addictions, and mental health struggles – above all other aspects of her brand and personhood. When a star emotionally strips, she peels away her brand – which, if built and managed properly, should be the protective layer between herself and her audience.This trend signals progress in one regard – audiences are now less singularly focused on objectifying the stars’ actual bodies, as they had been trained to do for decades.But it also creates a new danger; now audiences feel entitled to know the gory details about everything that happens to and within stars’ bodies and minds. They greedily consume trauma stories rather than thinking more deeply about how to stop the production of them.Emotional stripping pays dividends: It gets the audience’s attention. It can also come at great expense to the artist, who doesn’t magically heal by simply telling her story from a large enough platform.Talking about trauma has value, but it does not release it; as trauma expert Bessel van der Kolk noted in the title of his bestselling book, “the body keeps the score”. It can also cause stars harm through retraumatisation.THE POP STAR AS HUMAN SACRIFICEBut given audience demands for authenticity and the proliferation of pop star tell-all streaming documentaries, it appears that most emerging artists vying for the top of the charts now have little choice but to reveal themselves anyway.Just as certain body types and fashion styles have defined the rules of engagement at other times, emotional stripping has become standard operating procedure in popular music.This may seem like a dream come true. But it may be more like the waking nightmare depicted in Eilish’s video for Bury A Friend.Britney Spears and other 1990s stars, from Jennifer Love Hewitt to Paris Hilton, reported being triggered by Framing Britney Spears, a well-intentioned, pro-Britney documentary. Spears refused to participate in the film, which chronicled her breakdown, involuntary hospitalisation and subsequent conservatorship.In the documentary Tina, Tina Turner indicated that she was sick of talking about her abusive ex-husband Ike and wanted to move on.The question is: Will audiences let Turner and other traumatised female pop stars move on? Or are audiences too invested in trauma narratives to let them go?Fans’ laser focus on stars and stars’ tendency to please can even lead fans to disturbing levels of entitlement.Alanis Morissette, who wrote Jagged Little Pill when she was 19, shared that at the height of her popularity, fans in crowds would literally try to grab pieces of her hair and skin. They wanted to possess a piece of her and felt emboldened to just take it.Fittingly, Katy Perry’s documentary was called Part Of Me.Meanwhile, it’s typically the star, not the audience, who gets constructed as being crazy or needing better boundaries as the public annihilates them.There’s a precedent for this dynamic – the religious ritual of human sacrifice. Religion scholar Kathryn Lofton has written about this phenomenon in her analysis of Britney Spears.“Ritual is a controlled environment, a ring for spectatorship. While there are many rituals at play in the religions of Britney Spears’ celebrity, perhaps the most tempting is that of sacrifice. Britney Spears rises and falls, time and again, is plumped for the slaughter then primed for the comeback. Watching those declines and ascents might be productively read as a sort of public sacrifice.”Spears has become the rule, not the exception. These days, pop stars seem to exist to entertain fans and carry their burdens, and can sometimes seem to even ultimately die for them, commercially or literally. Fans then move on to the next star, gorge on their trauma and then watch them flame out.The silver lining is that we’re in the middle of the golden age of pop star documentaries. Some, like Amy and Whitney Can I Be Me, chronicle tragic endings.Others enable stars to show their more vulnerable sides while they’re still alive and performing – Billie Eilish: The World’s A Bit Blurry, Taylor Swift’s Miss Americana and Lady Gaga’s Five Foot Two.Many of these documentaries complicate their subjects in positive ways, rehabilitating their troubled or entitled images by inserting nuance, empathy and context into their stories, often for the first time.A DEMI-GODDESS OF THE ZEITGEISTWoman pop stars are finally starting to be seen more completely, at least superficially, as documentary filmmakers deliver to evolved and evolving audiences nuanced takes on complicated and aspirational women.But this momentary opportunity has quickly developed into what can look like a competition for which star can be the most vulnerable.Demi Lovato, who recently came out as nonbinary, may be winning that distinction with Dancing With The Devil, a four-part documentary series that explores both personal and career challenges.The series is bold and moving, and sheds light on the impact of trauma and addiction. What remains to be seen is how the series will impact Lovato’s career.Lovato, who is now 28, overdosed in 2018, surviving some brutal effects: Three strokes, a heart attack and partial blindness. In Anyone, a song recorded days before the overdose, Lovato laments telling “secrets till my voice was sore” because “no one hears me anymore”, “nobody’s listening.”“I’m on my ninth life,” Lovato said in Dancing With The Devil, “and I don’t know how many opportunities I have left.”THE NEED FOR BETTER LISTENINGFor those consuming these films for more than their entertainment value, some key questions about existing relationships between artists and fans should be emerging.What are they sacrificing for audiences? Gender and sexuality scholar Jane Caputi compares the extraction of resources from the land to the enduring damage to bodies and minds caused by sexual violence. In an interview, she said the emotional stripping of pop stars enacts “that same paradigm of extraction without reciprocity, of taking what one wants and dumping what one refuses,” with places and peoples reduced to “sacrifice zones”.While Caputi suggests that this emotional stripping abuse of female pop stars reflects larger patterns of exploitation, communication scholar Nancy Baym argues that music “often predicts social change”.If that’s true, maybe the regular exposure of previously taboo subjects such as addiction and sexual abuse could minimise their stigma, and make audiences less drawn to the subjects.Perhaps then – finally – the musicians’ actual music can be the central focus of their careers.And while it’s unlikely emotional stripping will stop, the music industry could become more involved in helping these stars survive and thrive. This could range from adding thoughtful and inclusive wellness provisions to artist contracts – including seasoned hazards-of-fame counsellors in the standard artist entourage – and teaching fans how to be less reliant on their idols and more emotionally secure themselves.They could also train the parents of young artists on the cusp of fame to be more attuned to signs of distress in their children.In Lonely, the closing track on Justin Bieber’s new record, he sings: “Everybody saw me sick, and it felt like no one gave a sh**.” GQ reported in May 2021 that at the peak of Bieber’s fame, his bodyguards would check his pulse as he slept to make sure he was still alive.Perhaps Bieber’s words could lead his fans and team to consider their complicity.Despite the positive attention and accolades she receives, Eilish, too, appears to be screaming into the void. In Bury A Friend Eilish sings: “Honestly, I thought that I would be dead by now (Wow).”Her notebooks, shown in her documentary, reveal lines like: “I am a void. The epitome of nothing”.Yet at one point in the film, Eilish’s mother, frustrated by people calling Billie’s music depressing, notes that Billie’s music isn’t depressing, it’s just that teenagers are depressed.“We need a stop gap for artist care,” artist manager Janet Billig-Rich, who managed Nirvana and Hole, among others, told me. “There is a parallel to the Amy Winehouse story where people are saying, ‘At least the parents are there and really involved.’ But they’re on the payroll, too, so there’s a conflict.“There need to be people in that inner circle thinking only about the artist’s interest. If we could convince the families and business people to be long-term greedy rather than short-term greedy, the artists would have longer, healthier lifespans and even more lucrative careers.”Perhaps doing the right thing for the wrong reasons is the best we can hope for from the music business.Kristin J Lieb is Associate Professor at Emerson College.

26,IN FOCUS: How social media can be a bane and a boon for mums struggling to breastfeed,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/in-focus-breastfeeding-struggles-social-media-advice-15083768,26 Jun 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: When Ms Nuraizani Ismail gave birth in 2018, she was sure she would be breastfeeding her son, the milk would flow effortlessly and that the process would feel completely natural. She was prepared, and she was eager.  The reality was more challenging. She only had “small tiny dots of colostrum coming, but nothing else”, the 33-year-old part-time administrative assistant told CNA. She was referring to the milk-like fluid released after birth that is chock-full of antibodies for the newborn.  She was determined to increase her supply, but the experience she had with a lactation consultant at the hospital left her stressed and discouraged.“They were like ‘no, you can (breastfeed)', like almost scolding me, and I’m like ‘I can't, I just can’t. Why are you forcing it on me? I just can't. Can you (not) scold me?’ I was almost on the verge of crying,” she said.“It was so overwhelming.”She persevered on her own at home, joining a social media group for breastfeeding support. She did not consider seeking professional help because she was afraid to see another lactation consultant, she said. The process turned out to be exhausting, she found, with her son waking up every hour.“I couldn’t even sleep for two hours. Half an hour, finish latching put him down, then half an hour later, he would be awake again. When am I going to sleep like this?” she said, recounting her struggle. “I was very sad. I kept comparing myself to the ex-colleague of mine. I was like why don’t I have the same amount she has. What did I do wrong? Am I not eating well? Is there something wrong with me?"" Turning to social media for answers to these questions and hoping to learn from the experience of other new mums didn't help.""When reading all those posts on one breastfeeding group, I got very demoralised. It’s like why can’t I, why they can?"" she said.“It got worse when I read through (comments on) the breastfeeding group that I should continue. Some comments were super pro-breastfeeding and they were like 'No no no! Formula is not good. That is for cows, not for babies, babies are human',”  she said.Ms Nuraizani struggled with guilt that she would be doing her baby a disservice by stopping breastfeeding altogether, she said. “Here I am struggling, I just wanted somebody to back me up and say that it’s okay you tried your best, you’ve done what you can, it’s ok if you don’t have (breast milk supply), not everybody can,'' she said.She stopped breastfeeding after three months of trying, and over time came across other mothers, who like her, were trying to find support because their breastfeeding journeys were taking a toll on their mental health. To reach out to more mothers, she started a Facebook page of her own. She said that the page is designed to be a non-judgmental place where mothers can discuss their issues with breastfeeding and discuss all options. “My aim is to tell mummies there is no need to feel guilty that they cannot breastfeed or latch or have no or low supply,” she said. This was not how she felt when she sought help on the breastfeeding group she was on as she saw that discussion on formula milk or saying that it is okay not to breastfeed was not allowed. PRESSURE FROM SOCIAL MEDIA A look at breastfeeding advice on social media pages and discussion groups shows many positive and supportive messages for mothers who are struggling for various reasons to breastfeed.However, it is not uncommon to find judgmental posts and comments questioning a mother’s breastfeeding struggles or looking down on their feeding decisions. Among such comments seen by CNA was: ""A baby that’s fed formula is getting the proteins and hormones that drive cow growth, not human growth.""Another one: ""It (breastfeeding) was challenging for the first week or two but actually was really easy and quick after that. I lost weight quickly, I had the benefits of BF (breastfeeding) as well as my babies. Not everyone has problems, sometimes it's easy!""Ms Ashwinni Manasseh from Alliance Counselling, who sees new and expecting parents, said that some mothers may experience shame when they compare themselves to other mums on social media.“On social media, sometimes you see women who post pictures of how much milk they've pumped. And some women can become quite obsessed with their output and so they start to become fixated on pumping and checking how much milk they're pumping, they focus so much on the quantity,” she said.“It can lead to depression because they're feeling a lot of shame and guilt and regret.”Mother of two Ms Elizabeth Soh, 33, said that what she saw on social media made her think that she was not producing enough milk.She would see photos of the amount of milk pumped by other mothers, and see that hers paled in comparison, and how mothers were taking supplements to increase their supply, said the business owner. “I don’t think I was under-producing, but I started buying into it. That really stressed me and caused my supply to dip,” she said. Among the signs that mothers may need to seek help for their mental health are struggling to bond with their babies, feelings of guilt, shame and hopelessness, constantly worrying that something bad is going to happen, not enjoying things that they used to enjoy and “obsessing” over things like infant sleep and milk supply, Ms Ashwinni said.She urged mothers to monitor their social media usage because it can be “quite triggering” for mothers, adding that many of them tend to follow many pages on Instagram and Facebook. “If you're struggling with anything in motherhood and you're constantly seeing images that are upsetting to you, it's really important to just ask yourself how is this serving you and if it's not, to unfollow any of those pages and really just set boundaries when it comes to social media,” she said.She added that what they see, while often not an accurate depiction, can cause mothers to feel inadequate.ADVICE FROM LAYPERSONSDr Kamini Rajaratnam, a psychiatrist with an interest in perinatal psychiatry, said that in her experience with patients, mothers get many opinions which are not from professionals when they seek help on social media platforms. “They may be getting layman opinions, and because it’s a community of mums supposedly in the same situation (as her patients), they feel like ‘What is wrong with me? How come all of them can breastfeed and I can’t?'"" she said. She added that well-intended comments from these laypersons can sometimes be problematic. “Sometimes, they try to be positive, but it can be quite toxic actually, when they say things like ‘Don’t give up, you can do it,'” she said.“But this poor mum has been trying for six months and she can’t do it. If they say don’t give up, then she is going to feel like ‘Maybe I’m not trying hard enough.’.”She said that mothers may also receive unsolicited advice. For example, a mother asking for recommendations on formula milk may get responses saying that using it should be avoided, she said. “Not everybody is very sensitive on social media. If you don’t walk (in) the shoes of a mum who’s having a lot of difficulty breastfeeding, it’s really difficult to empathise.”Dr Kamini suggested that mothers could make contact with a lactation consultant they find themselves comfortable with before giving birth, adding that those who have just given birth are “not in a place” to look for one. A trained lactation consultant will be able to give proper advice, she added. “It’s very important to have someone you can reach out to if you’re struggling with breastfeeding,” she said.“You need someone who is non-judgmental, someone who doesn’t scare you and someone who is willing to work with your goals. If you can find someone like that before delivery, that will be such an important person who can be an ally when you’re facing troubles, and then you know you can reach out and you can get proper advice and not get judgment and not get all this layman advice.” Dr Mohana Rajakulendran, paediatrician at Parkway East Paediatric Clinic in Parkway East Hospital, said that when she encounters mothers struggling with their breastfeeding journey, she reassures them that they are doing well and doing their best and that any amount of breast milk they can give their baby is providing the benefits that baby needs. She pointed out that they also need to take care of their own needs like rest, hydration and good nutrition as these are important to achieve good breast milk supply and maintain a healthy mental state as well, she said. “A happy mother is a happy baby. And if formula supplementation takes away that stress and allows you to spend good time bonding with your baby then that is precious enough and your baby will definitely reap the benefits of love and attention from his mother,” she said. Despite its potentially negative impact on some, the experts stressed that social media can help mothers, offering appropriate encouragement and providing worthwhile advice. Dr Kamini said that when women ask questions on social media platforms, they sometimes get good responses from other mothers who are honest about their struggles. ""Social media can help in that it makes support for mums more accessible. You don’t have to go out and meet someone. That’s the good of it - support is very accessible and helps with this village that mums need,"" she said.Ms Uma Thambidurai, director of Mother and Child, which provides prenatal and postnatal services, said that its such mother-to-mother support that helps these women through their tough times.""Social media in this day provides a lot of support for all mothers when they are isolated at home, more than ever with COVID-19,"" she said.FEELINGS OF INADEQUACY, SHAME AND GUILT Mothers who do not breastfeed or exclusively breastfeed for reasons such as low milk supply and oversupply face feelings of inadequacy, shame and guilt, mental health experts said.Breastfeeding, which is recommended to be initiated within the first hour of birth and done exclusively for six months by the World Health Organization, has well-documented benefits for mother and baby, including protection for babies from diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and eczema.On the other hand, formula feeding has been associated with a higher risk of health conditions like obesity and Type 2 diabetes.Dr Kamini said that the ability to breastfeed centres heavily in her clients’ issues.“A 100 per cent of my mums with postpartum depression have had very traumatic experiences with breastfeeding or with judgment around how they feed their baby,” she said.“There is a lot of guilt and shame involved when they can’t successfully breastfeed or exclusively breastfeed.”She said that the issues with breastfeeding are usually shared by clients in recounting their birth stories. “They are bruised and in a lot of pain, but nobody is focused on the mum,” she said.When they are unable to provide for their babies immediately after birth, they think they have done irreversible damage to their babies, she said.“It leads to a lot of feelings of inadequacy as a mum because you feel like ‘Oh, why don’t I have enough milk?’ but the truth is that you did just give birth, and you are still in a bit of shock, emotionally and physically and it can be very hard to put all that aside and successfully breastfeed,” she said.As a medical doctor, Dr Kamini said she is aware of the benefits of breastfeeding  but she said that the judgment mothers get is “unnecessary”.She said that while trying to make breastfeeding more accessible and trying to undo the marketing efforts of formula milk companies that touted their products as being superior to breast milk, society has created the pressure for mothers to exclusively breastfeed.“Many mums were thinking that formula is the best, but they (breastfeeding advocates) tried to turn the tide by saying that breastfeeding is easy, and you can do it. That’s how it started. It’s a fantastic movement,” she said.“But it is just about giving mums the choices and empowering them with the options. If you do have problems breastfeeding, what can you do? There has to be a middle ground, it’s not all black and white, you can always re-establish it later. It’s about being a bit more kind with mums, and just giving them the option.”When mothers seek help online, they are asking how they can continue to breastfeed while keeping their sanity, she added.“They are not asking for judgment, or the easy way out. It is not an easy choice to formula feed an infant,” she said, adding that formula feeding has its own challenges, such as a baby refusing to take a bottle.ONLINE SUPPORT FOR MOTHERSMs Khatim Hamidon, president of Breastfeeding Mothers’ Support Group (Singapore), said that the group, which has 25,000 members on its Facebook page and is a popular resource, recognises that there may be situations where a mother eventually decides to give her baby formula milk in the early days or many months after. However, the group does not give technical advice on formula milk or suggest particular brands as it is not the group's mandate, she said. Formula milk recommendations have to be made by a medical professional where medically indicated, she added. ""Having said that, any mother who seeks advice on how she can make breastfeeding work despite having to use formula is welcome to gain support from us and we have provided support to many,"" she said. There are instances when mothers wish to wean their babies off formula milk and relactate and also mothers who give their babies breast milk and supplement with formula milk because of perceived low supply, she said. “We will then provide resources that they can tap on to increase their supply and transit baby to full breastfeeding,” she said. She said that counsellors on the page, who go through an “intensive” 12-week training programme licensed by the Australian Breastfeeding Association, are trained to counsel every mother with “unconditional positive regard”.Each day, about 15 counsellors log in to help mothers through the group’s helpline, WhatsApp service and Facebook, she said. In their training, the emphasis is on the importance of providing empathy, commiseration and care in interactions with mothers, she said.“We will support the mother’s decision even if she chooses to supplement with formula and continue to provide her with breastfeeding support and knowledge if she requires it,” she said.She added that they are “very insistent that our mothers fully abide by the group rules - such as limiting coarse language and snarky comments”.LOW SUPPLY ISSUES Social media pages are rife with questions from mothers worried that their supply is low.Ms Khatim said that it is common for new mothers to perceive that they have low supply, especially in the early days after giving birth. “There are two reasons why this happens - misinformation about what is considered normal about breastfeeding in a formula-feeding society, and the lack of trained or skilled support from her environment,” she said.For example, colostrum, the sticky, yellow “liquid gold” that a mother produces during the first few days, is counted in milliliters which is often mistakenly thought to be insufficient, she said.“Though small in quantity, it is highly concentrated with what a newborn needs - antibodies - and is just in the right amount because newborn tummies are very small. Colostrum is usually best extracted through a baby’s latch or by hand expressing if the mother is unable to latch her baby,” she said.However, she, like the lactation consultants who spoke to CNA, said that there are cases where mothers could have a real supply issue. “When mothers are stressed and anxious, we find that the milk letdown reflex may be hindered and the milk flow is reduced,” said Dr Mythili Pandi, who is an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant (IBCLC) and a doctor. However, she said that skin-to-skin contact between mother and child can help in such situations as there is a surge of oxytocin - the so-called love hormone - which aids milk flow.Other reasons behind low supply are ineffective latching by babies, the mothers’ health such as diabetes during pregnancy or insufficient glandular tissue or poor breastfeeding management like sleep training or infrequent milk removal from breasts, Dr Mythili said.Health issues like hormonal or endocrine problems like thyroid problems and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) could also impact breast milk supply, she said. She added that some medication, like long-term antihistamines and certain types of birth control pills can affect milk supply. Having a caesarean birth may also affect milk supply both physiologically and psychologically, Dr Mythili added.“It’s got to do with how the mother feels, that the birth process may have hindered on her capacity or feelings about mothering and feelings about being able to nurture her child,” she said.Such births may also affect the skin-to-skin contact between mother and child, she said.“When mums and babies miss out on that precious hour, or that time right after birth, that actually does have an impact on the rest of the breastfeeding journey, the bonding and the ability to connect after birth,” she said.She added that the scar from the surgery could be so painful that mothers may struggle to hold their child and breastfeed in certain positions. Pain itself may also hinder milk supply, she added. FINDING SOLUTIONS Dr Mythili said that it is important to understand what exactly is affecting milk supply. “Once we have identified the issues, we can then work on possible solutions which suit the family,” she said.The experts stressed the importance of seeking help early, and specifically from a certified professional. “I would always suggest that mothers see an IBCLC prior to discharge from the maternity hospital so that the position and attachment at the breasts is checked and early issues can be identified and managed,” Dr Mythili said.She added that there are many IBCLCs in the community who can do home visits as well, after the mother has been discharged from hospital.She urged mothers to verify that the professional they are seeking help from is a trained IBCLC “to be assured that you are receiving evidence-based and well-studied knowledge and assistance”.Ms Uma also said seeking help early is crucial.“Not often are they coming early enough for help.  if they come early enough, you can turn it around. As lactation consultants, we steer them and guide them and support them and give them the advice to get them through the early weeks,” said the IBCLC.She acknowledged however that the services of private lactation consultants like herself may not be affordable to many. “I would like to see all polyclinics having IBCLC to help. Then the help is available to everybody,” she said. “That's where they should be looking at to provide every woman with the support because she's going to the polyclinic from day one to check the jaundice levels and weigh the baby, and if there was an IBCLC there guiding her, then she's getting that support from day one.”Ms Uma, who said she sees many mothers with issues of low milk supply, said that she encourages mothers who see her to latch their babies instead of using a pump because “the baby is far more a stimulant than a pump”.“While what they did wrong or did not do enough of in the first two weeks may have contributed to a low milk supply, “we can still work on it”, she said. Ms Uma said that in her more than 20 years of experience, she has dealt with mothers, who by the time they approach her, have tried “everything”.“(It) may be at six weeks, it may be in three months, we can still do something to increase the milk supply,” she said, adding that it is common to see new mothers having problems with breastfeeding especially in the early weeks. While many women may be able to increase their supply with help,  the experts said that there are cases where that does not happen. “In rare cases where very little else can be done to increase the milk supply, then we remind mothers that breastfeeding does not have to be an all-or-nothing method of feeding their baby,” Dr Mythili said. “Every single drop of breastmilk still contains antibodies, anti-infective properties, growth factors and hormones which would have an impact on the baby's growth and development.”Ms Uma said: “If we don't (increase milk supply), I tell mothers that they should be actually enjoying the acts of breastfeeding, bonding with their child, rather than worrying about how much the baby's actually getting from them.”Ms Nuraizani said that she did find some tips and encouragement on social media, but that it did not comfort her. ""If they (people on social media) know someone is not going through a smooth (breastfeeding) journey, they could be more sensitive in their choice of words. If it not working them for some reason, tell them that it is okay, that they are not alone,"" she said. This is the lowest overall number of total daily cases reported in Singapore since Jun 9 when four infections were identified.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

27,Commentary: Why some night owls are flourishing during this work-from-home era,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/night-owls-work-home-more-rest-morning-lark-revenge-bedtime-15082770,25 Jun 2021 06:09AM,"What revenge bedtime procrastination and coronasomnia? Nocturnal types are finally living their best lives with the flexible hours that working from home affords, says Karen Tee.SINGAPORE: To paraphrase Linda Evangelista, the model who famously said she does not get out of bed for less than US$10,000 a day, I don’t get out of bed before 10am.I did pry my eyes open for a 9am Zoom appointment the other day, but after wrapping up, I promptly wiped off my lipstick and changed back into pyjamas to catch more zzzs before starting my day proper at noon.As a lifelong creature of nocturnal habits, I have finally embraced the fact that some of us function much more effectively and productively as late risers and rising before the sun does like most model CEOs supposedly do is just pointless.This epiphany struck after one sleepless night during last year’s circuit breaker, when I stopped regarding my sleeplessness as “losing sleep”, treating it as “extra” leisure time instead.These days, I will read a book or scroll through social media when unable to drift off to dreamland and set the alarm for seven hours later once fatigue sets in.Instead of trying in vain to conform to norms of waking up before 8am, then feeling groggy and grumpy for the next few hours, I now happily stay up past 1am or 2am and rouse gently from slumber at about 10am every day.THE GENES OF NIGHT OWLSPlease don’t hate me. It’s not a late sleeper’s fault they’re wired that way when sleeping patterns are written into our genetic codes.UK research involving 700,000 in 2019 identified genes that determined how much of an early bird a person is. The researchers from the University of Exeter say night owls keeping to a morning lark’s schedule may be forced to fight their internal body clock.Night owls can clock eight hours of work too, just not necessarily from nine to five. Instead, by syncing working hours to when energy levels are at their highest, they can be more efficient and productive.The fortunate flexibility my career offers has been a key enabler allowing me to get more done despite these odd hours. And with WFH as the default for most of the past year, the people I work with do not even notice that I keep to “jetlag hours”.Starting the day late does mean work occasionally continues into the wee hours of the night. But the silence and solitude allows me to get things done with fewer interruptions and greater focus.Most of all, I no longer feel guilty about sleeping late nor do I worry about waking by a certain time. This, to me, is happiness.WHY OWLS ARE OFTEN SLEEP DEPRIVEDSleep experts point to the COVID-19 pandemic as the cause of multiple sleeping disorders such as revenge bedtime procrastination, where people choose to go to bed later to reclaim some spare time for themselves; and coronasomnia, sleeplessness caused by pandemic-related worries.There is no doubt insufficient sleep can affect job performance, in diminishing one’s concentration, causing slower reaction times and increasing irritability.In the long run, poor-quality or insufficient sleep can heighten the risk of health problems like obesity, heart disease and dementia, studies have shown. Late risers are at a greater risk of depression or tend to have a shorter lifespan.But what these don’t consider is that owls often do not get enough quality sleep because even though their internal body clock makes them sleepy at a later hour, they typically still have to wake early.“The health problems associated with being a night owl are likely a result of being a night owl living in a morning person's world, which leads to disruption in their body's circadian rhythms,"" said sleep specialist Kristen Knutson of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.To counter this, experts recommend finding ways to embrace the body’s natural rhythm, which in the case of late sleepers could mean working more flexible hours so they can sleep when they feel tired.BENEFITS OF BEING NOCTURNALThis might not be possible for some firms and many operational roles, but the pandemic’s rewriting of corporate norms has forced a refocus towards employees’ well-being and engagement, so there is no better time like the present to review those boundaries.Indeed, this has been the silver lining of pandemic living. After years of frustration over being unable to sleep early, I am finally leaning into my vampiric nature thanks to the flexi work hours afforded by widespread WFH practices.All of this might seem unconventional to those accustomed to keeping deskbound hours in an office but they are more achievable than you might imagine.I am fortunate because my job does not require me accounting for every waking minute so long as deadlines are met and high standards are adhered to.But with many of us now working from home, there are certain owl habits that may benefit even the morning larks.For example, why not wake up a little later since you do not need to commute, instead of sticking to your usual early rising schedule because it’s the “hardworking” thing to do? And how about finding small breaks in the day if you find value in working and thinking in the quiet of the night?Parents who care for their kids in the morning could also fit in an afternoon nap with their young ones when they return home from school.After all, short naps are known to offer benefits such as improved memory and stress relief, so there is no need to feel like you are skiving. Take it from me: Waking up after a snooze can make you feel like your brain has undergone a reset, such that you are ready to tackle whatever deadline lies in wait.That WFH is likely to extend into the foreseeable future also allows employers to warm up to a hybrid style of juggling work and life.Society has long tended to think of people who wake up late as lazy, unproductive and spoilt. That sort of old-fashioned thinking needs to find the door in an Internet age when work has become somewhat 24/7 for so many industries.A more constructive and mature way of approaching this situation is to first assess whether workers have the right priorities and can deliver results, juggle their work and get the rest they need. Then the firm can decide how to offer more flexibility in when and how they work.When so many traditional notions of work have been disrupted by the pandemic, there is no better time than the present than to allow the owls to rise and lead the way – just not before 10am please.(Intermittent fasting could help you lose weight but at what cost?

29,Commentary: Workers appreciate mental health days off after a crazy pandemic year,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/mental-health-challenges-work-from-home-employers-leave-15066440,23 Jun 2021 06:02AM,"Does your organisation have the necessary support in place if you are feeling burnt out or need time out from work? Mayank Parekh explains what needs to change in the new normal.SINGAPORE: You may have read about Naomi Osaka bowing out of the French Open saying she had to prioritise her mental health over her commercial obligations and professional advancement. This was a point reiterated by President Halimah who in a Facebook post said people have to walk away from toxic environments despite the stigma.Because most adults spend the bulk of their time working, the workplace is naturally one environment facing fresh challenges in a new normal. In a 2020 survey by EngageRocket, one in six workers said they felt stressed.In particular, 30 per cent of employees working in the education sector and 22 per cent from consumer industries indicated their stress levels were unacceptable. The 2021 survey results are expected at the end of June and it will come as no surprise if more employees feel this way.So what can employers do when they find themselves with requests from employees for time out? How can employers tell apart workers feeling isolated and exhausted trying to cope with work and family from those genuinely struggling with issues such as anxiety and depression? They are two distinct conditions although both could manifest with similar symptoms such as the lack of energy or cynicism towards work and colleagues. Being aware of these differences can help employers differentiate when adjustments at work may help and when medical interventions including treatment in the form of therapy or medication may be needed instead.There are useful resources to tap on so that managers can understand the difference. In Singapore, these range from self-help assessment tools such as iWorkHealth developed by the Ministry of Manpower’s Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Institute to online mental health platforms such as the My Mental Health microsite.The Health Promotion Board (HPB) also runs workshops to equip managers and human resource personnel with the knowledge to recognise staff facing difficulties at work and may need help and be supportive leaders at their workplace.But the reality for many organisations is employees shy away from speaking to their bosses about their personal struggles for fear of being seen as weak or even worse, stigmatised. So the problem is often not knowing there is a problem in the first place. The good news is that companies can adopt good management practices to uncover insights using data, recognise the sensitivities, set the right tone and nurture a culture of trust and openness on mental wellbeing.CHECK-INS AND SURVEYSAlmost every company utilises surveys to take the pulse on a number of issues – from corporate culture to change management and views on leadership. Done well, this sort of data provides critical real-time information on how employees feel about their work, their bosses or their prospects in the organisation. The Harvard Business Review has good resources on how a well-designed survey can lead to quantifiable gains. Tech giant Facebook took things even further and worked with Wharton Professor Adam Grant to study what keeps employees engaged.Companies that use regular check-ins and surveys to take the pulse of how employees are coping have data to pinpoint where the pain points are instead of relying on “gut feel”.This is especially at a time when WFH is the default and bosses may not get to meet their staff as often as they would like to and cannot have conversations by the corridor that give them a sense of how they are coping.When done properly, data and insights on employees can drive effective decision-making for the organisation. For example, HR can have an overview of its entire workforce’s mental well-being and identify opportunities to drive better engagement. Or they can use this data to target interventions on specific departments needing more support. CHANGES TO HR POLICYYour company’s HR policies can help promote a conducive environment that respects an individual’s privacy and accommodates those with mental health issues.While it is not always possible to remove the stigma, keeping mental health information strictly private and confidential and separate from an employee’s normal personnel file can help reassure and encourage more staff struggling to come forward for help. Some companies have expanded leave policies to allow for mental health days without a medical certificate to encourage people to take time off when they need it and reduce stress and burnout. LinkedIn gave its 15,900 full-time employees a paid week off in April to help them combat burnout and encourage them to unplug and recharge. Global companies including SAP, Cisco, Google and Thomson Reuters have instituted companywide “mental health days”. Smaller companies with more limited resources can start by instituting more flexi-work arrangements. In 2020, more than 8,000 companies comprising 90,000 employees took advantage of government funding support to implement and sustain flexible work arrangements (FWAs) for all employees. Flexible employee benefits can be expanded to include mental health consultations and treatments, as well as mental well-being programmes.Indeed, because working from home has blurred the boundaries, clarity on an after-hours policy is one of the recommendations of the Tripartite Advisory issued in November last year.Don’t leave it for another day - start relooking longstanding HR policies out of sync with the new realities of work. With more staff aware they can work effectively from anywhere, more employees will feel empowered to ask for flexible work arrangements. This is especially if they have dependents and find it easier to balance work and family. This will also benefit those who are starting to feel the effects of isolation from going for long periods without interaction with their teams. Companies that make accommodations to make flexible work as part of their life to get ahead of this curve will get the talent they need who will make an impact to their business.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on CNA's Heart of the Matter.) CREATING SUPPORT TEAMS IN COMPANIESGreater flexible work arrangements, the blurring of boundaries between work and home and managing burnout is bringing into sharper focus this greater burden on the manager to pick up. So companies must level up managers, support them with these tools and get a handle on what’s going on. When a manager shows that supporting someone with mental health challenges does not mean he is any less valuable or will not be promoted or given increments goes a long way in getting employees to not just get help but to be committed to your organisation. Other employees should also get mental health training to recognise “psychosocial hazards”, so they can identify a problem and extend help before it develops, and step in to cover for colleagues who need time off to protect their mental health. There is no one-size-fits-all approach to accommodating workers with mental illness. The key is to try out various approaches to see what works. Even small companies can start by surveys to gather feedback and benchmark their employee perceptions. While there is plenty that employers can do to help prevent stress and burnout, the best vaccine for mental health is a strong foundation of personal relationships at work with managers and teams that builds trust and goodwill.

31,"The Big Read: High time to talk about racism, but Singapore society ill-equipped after decades of treating it as taboo",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-racism-singapore-society-race-interracial-15047448,21 Jun 2021 06:02AM,"Activists, community organisers and academics agree that the conversations of race need to move forward productively in the age of social media where tensions are inflamed easily.SINGAPORE: When former national sprinter Canagasabai Kunalan and his wife, Madam Chong Yoong Yin, both 79, saw the viral video of a polytechnic lecturer making racist remarks to an interracial couple two weeks ago, they couldn't believe their eyes. The video evoked memories of 1964, when the couple were given the ultimatum by their families to end their relationship or leave their homes — because one of them was Indian and the other was Chinese — amid the racial tensions that were gripping Singapore.“Singaporeans now are so educated … how can we still think like this?” said Mr Kunalan. The racial riots between the Malays and Chinese in Singapore following its merger with Malaysia in 1963 plunged the country into nationwide violence. Houses were burnt down, the police were deployed to enforce curfews and people were beaten and killed.Yet, even in the most uncertain of times, there were also people of different ethnic groups standing together regardless of race.Older generations of Singaporeans recounted how people stepped up in solidarity when emotive racial conflicts shattered the peace.Mr Kunalan, who was then a 22-year-old sprinter preparing for the 1964 Tokyo Olympics, said: “The riots were happening in different areas in Singapore. Surprisingly, in my kampung (village), it was peaceful. There were no tensions at all. Or maybe we just didn’t know what was happening on the other side.”Mr Lionel de Souza, 78, a former police officer who worked as a community liaison officer in Geylang during the 1964 racial riots, recalled how Singaporeans volunteered in droves for “goodwill committees” as well as the Vigilante Corps to help keep the peace in volatile areas during curfew hours.Comprising an equal number of Chinese and Malay volunteers, they and Mr de Souza would patrol their beat in Kampung Kim Hong and talk to residents in coffee shops and town halls to help dispel suspicion between the different Chinese and Malay groups that were then segregated in different villages.“There were allegations that people on one side were shooting fire arrows at the other, and rumours were flying everywhere,” said Mr de Souza of the situation then.Singapore has since come a long way from those dark days of violent racial conflict, having taken early steps as a newly independent nation to abandon colonial-era race-based policies, and pledging to not let racial fault lines divide society.Following its independence, the young Republic embarked on a unique path among nations of the time as a multiracial and multicultural country, one that affirms its ethnic diversity as a strength and recognises the rights of minorities.Dr Janil Puthucheary, Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information, said in an interview with TODAY: “Many societies have had to wrestle with (race, racism and multiculturalism) around the world, but the place that multiculturalism has in our aspirations as a people is quite special. It is fundamentally why we became an independent country.”Because of Singapore’s diverse society and the dynamics among the major cultural and ethnic groups, the topic of race is present in every discussion, every issue, and every policy.“You need to then understand our social context, our historical context and our future in order to have a dialogue about race productively in Singapore,” said Dr Janil.Yet, the topic of racism has returned to the fore once again following recent events, including the street confrontation between the Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer and an inter-ethnic couple as well as other viral videos of racially-charged encounters.Commenting on the video, Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam had said in a Facebook post: “I used to believe that Singapore was moving in the right direction on racial tolerance and harmony. Based on recent events, I am not so sure anymore.”Activists, community organisers and academics spoken to agree that the conversations of race need to move forward productively in the age of social media where tensions are inflamed easily.And when the heat surrounding the recent incidents fades away, some good may emerge from these episodes if Singaporeans can understand the experiences of others and engage with each other in good faith, several said.Associate Professor Chong Ja Ian, a political scientist from the National University of Singapore (NUS), said: “It is important, in my opinion, to identify these biases and stereotypes and understand where they come from and how they link to the various fears, anxieties, suspicions, frustrations that people have.“Some of this will look ugly, but if we can start addressing them bit by bit, with understanding, there is a good chance we can move forward.”Pondering about what the recent racist incidents say about the state and direction of Singapore’s hard-won racial harmony, older Singaporeans such as Mr Kunalan and Mr de Souza know that the stakes are high.“We never want that (racial riots) to happen again, which is why we should all feel strongly about protecting our racial harmony,” said Mr de Souza.(Can we have conversations about race and diversity and how do we take on views of younger Singaporeans who may want a more open discussion? Experts discuss this on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)WHAT IS RACISM?The Oxford English Dictionary today defines racism as acts of prejudice, discrimination and antagonism by a person, community or institution against a person or people based on their race and ethnic identity.And by this definition, racism is usually experienced by people from minority racial groups that are subjected to such acts of discrimination.But as contributing writer Ben Zimmer for The Atlantic magazine wrote, even dictionaries had to revise their definitions about racism.Before 2020, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary primarily defined racism as “a belief that race is the primary determinant of human traits and capacities and that racial differences produce an inherent superiority of a particular race”.It was also defined as “a doctrine or political program based on the assumption of racism and designed to execute its principles”. This secondary definition was refined to “the systemic oppression of a racial group to the social, economic, and political advantage of another”, following the Black Lives Matter protests in the United States last year.Mr Mohamed Imran Mohamed Taib, founding board member of the Centre for Interfaith Understanding (CIFU) in Singapore, said that racism is essentially formed from two components — that a race has essential traits and characteristics, and whether these are behind the inequalities and disparities between the races in society.“Therefore, racism is any act, system or policy that appeals to or reinforces ‘essentialised’ perceptions of racial groups that strengthens the political, economic or cultural inequalities between the races in society,” he said.Regardless of which definition is best, the debate of what racism is, and what makes an action or speech racist, has also emerged in Singapore in recent days.In May, an Indian woman was called racial slurs and kicked in the chest by a Chinese man while brisk-walking along Choa Chu Kang Drive. He had insisted she wear a mask even though she was exercising.A month later, Ngee Ann Polytechnic lecturer Tan Boon Lee was seen in a viral video confronting and making racist remarks towards an inter-ethnic couple, while proclaiming to be a racist himself.Allegations by a former student that he had made Islamophobic remarks in class surfaced a week later. The polytechnic has since said it would sack Mr Tan, after completing investigations into the two matters.Another video was uploaded the same week of a Chinese woman hitting a small gong repeatedly while an Indian man was ringing a prayer bell outside his public housing flat as part of his daily prayers.But the debate about what constitutes racism grew loudest online in the case of Ms Sarah Bagharib, who had called out the People’s Association for using a cutout of her wedding photo — sans the couple’s faces — as part of Hari Raya decorations without her permission.Netizens were split on the issue. Some claimed that the matter is not a case of racism but one of cultural insensitivity. Others were wont to point out that racism does not exist in Singapore, which prides itself on its multiracial society.Another viewpoint was that the blunder was made because of a lack of understanding of the Malay culture that had stemmed from ignorance that needed to be dismantled.As Dr Nazry Bahrawi, a senior lecturer at the Singapore University of Technology and Design, put it, two narratives have emerged about the state of race relations here — one says Singapore is racially harmonious, and another says that it is still not quite there.“The first has been the official position reproduced on many occasions and in many spheres, while the latter is a position that has received less airing because it is perceived to be less valid, making those who raise it seem like they are troublemakers or have an agenda to divide society,” said Dr Nazry.For race discourse to be productive, Singaporeans from all walks of life must first be able to establish that racist acts are not condoned by society. “Because, if so, then it would be considered outlandish that people who call out racism are seen as playing the race card,” he said, adding that these people might be commenting from a position of privilege as they may not have experienced racism.Asked about this, Dr Janil, who is also the chairperson of the non-profit OnePeople.sg (OPSG), said it is not a bad thing that there are people who state that they have never experienced racism or have never seen it happen.The turning point is when they find out that because not everyone shares this view, they may be “energised” to improve the experiences of others, he said.“The uncharitable view is to say ‘hello, wake up, you don’t know what’s going on and you don’t recognise (racism)... But the glass half-full version is, aren’t we lucky that there are some people who have actually had this experience in Singapore, it’s a sign ... that maybe we’ve made some progress.”Such views are also heard among people who participate in OPSG’s initiatives on race as well, especially among younger participants who have been “blessed with a positive experience about race”, but also could learn about the negative experiences of others, Dr Janil added.The Singapore Government has taken the approach that racism exists here, he emphasised.“What we want to be sure of is that our policies, our systems, our approach, is to understand that there is racism, and we must always push against it,” said Dr Janil.Comparing indicators of racial and religious harmony from 2013 and 2018, a study by the Institute of Policy Studies (IPS) and OPSG in 2019 found that while racism exists, it is not widespread in Singapore.Lead researcher Dr Mathew Mathews said about 10 per cent of Chinese respondents in the study and around 20 per cent of minorities said that they had experienced racial tension in the 2018 study. There was little change from the results of the 2013 findings.“When asked about specific incidents, most cited they had felt insulted at how perhaps social/mainstream media had portrayed their race or cultural practices – so there is certainly some racism here, but it is not rampant,” said Dr Mathews.WHY SOME STILL CONSIDER IT TABOOOn the other hand, some people felt that the recent spate of racist incidents is an indication that racism in Singapore not only exists but has been gathering speed for some time, though hidden from view because of a lack of discourse and the difficulty in detecting unintentional and unconscious forms of racism.Dr Peter Chew, a senior lecturer of psychology at the James Cook University, explained that overt racism tends to be low in Singapore due to the function of laws that protect racial harmony here, such as the Sedition Act.The Act makes it illegal for anyone in Singapore to promote feelings of ill-will and hostility between different races or classes of the population.Laws like these do well to keep overt racism in check but also have an effect of quieting discourse about race, he said.“This reluctance could be due to a misunderstanding of what constitutes racism.Anecdotally, some individuals think that talking about race or pointing out racist incidents is, by their very nature, racist,” said Dr Chew.A 2016 CNA and IPS study, which was also led by Dr Mathews, found that two-thirds of respondents felt that discussions of race could lead to tension.Raising such issues may be deemed “too sensitive”, and so issues about race and culture tend to be thought of as private matters rather than meant for broader conversations, said the researcher.Agreeing, Mr Gosteloa Spencer, founder of community group Not OK SG, said this could be due to generations of Singaporeans suppressing talk of racism, discrimination, and racial inequality for fear of creating rifts among the different ethnic communities.He believes it is this inhibition that led to casual racism, where people make jokes, off-handed comments, or exclusionary body language based on race. These acts also often go unnoticed and unaddressed.“Just because it’s casual, does it make it okay to pass a racist comment?” he added. “Racism is racism, no matter what form it takes.”Mr Sharvesh Leatchmanan, co-founder and editor of Minority Voices, which serves as a platform for minorities who have faced discrimination to come forth and share their experiences, said the concept of racial tolerance that is entrenched in the Singapore identity has also been problematic.“Over time, this tolerance runs out … as can be seen from the recent acts of racism on social media. We need to move away from tolerance to acceptance and celebration.”But while Singaporeans may have held back on talking about race in the past, some said that this is rapidly changing in the age of social media, where racially charged incidents can be quickly shared online and go viral.And these incidents also encourage others to speak up and to call out racist acts publicly.Mr Sharvesh, 24, said he received more than a hundred submissions from people sharing their stories of discrimination over the past week.Ms Priyahnisha, who goes by one name, is the founder of non-profit organisation Mental ACT, which champions mental health services in the Indian community.She noted the overwhelming response recently to any content on racism that she or her organisation put up on social media.The 29-year-old full-time professional counsellor at a social service agency added: “As soon as we post, the likes, comments and shares really escalate and it has actually been way off the charts as compared to any of the other content we have put up in the past couple of months”.The problem is that when people talk about race, their past inexperience means they lack the language and protocols needed to discuss it in a constructive manner, said those interviewed.NUS’ Assoc Prof Chong said: “Singaporeans are not the best-equipped to handle such discussions because we have put them aside for so long.”“But there are opportunities to learn … What is important is to not hastily conclude that the other side has bad faith, especially if the other party is engaging from a position of relative weakness and vulnerability,” he added. “It is through such engagement that we develop a vocabulary and approach suitable for our society.”‘SAFE AND BRAVE’ SPACES … NOT JUST BEHIND CLOSED DOORS Earlier this month, Mr Jose Raymond started the Call It Out SG movement with three others to raise awareness of issues pertaining to race following the slew of racist incidents here. “This is simply a case of minorities saying that enough is enough and that racism is inexcusable,” he said.“Perhaps in the past, when minorities faced racism, we didn't have the tools to articulate ourselves properly or the courage to call it out. Now we do,” added the former Singapore People’s Party chairman.The movement urges people to call out instances of racism that they see, and has gained momentum in the light of the recent incidents.On the flipside, while the process of publicly calling for accountability and boycotting if nothing else seems to work, has become an important tool of social justice, Mr Spencer said it is difficult to control the extent of it and make sure things do not go out of hand.Associate Professor Daniel Goh, an NUS sociologist specialising in race relations, noted that it is people’s “duty to call out racism when we see it”.“The question is how we do it,” he said.“We should do it in a respectful way that seeks to educate each other and deepen intercultural understanding, and the large part of the burden should not fall on the victims or members of ethnic minorities to do so, members of the ethnic majority should do so too.”For more severe forms of discrimination, such as getting fired from a job, physical violence, or the shaming of ethnic minorities in a classroom setting, for example, victims should call for institutional and legal redress, said the former Workers’ Party (WP) Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP).“The key calculus for me is how to balance education with redress, and my hope is that the victim is not alone in calculating this and can depend on witnesses and friends, especially those from the ethnic majority, for help and support,” said Assoc Prof Goh, who had stepped down from WP’s leadership due to health reasons but remains a party member.Referring to the parliamentary replies to MP Faisal Manap (WP-Aljunied) earlier this year on the issue of the tudung, Assoc Prof Goh said the authorities rely on “back channels” for discussions and resolutions, and to manage racial relations in a pragmatic and careful way.Mr Faisal had asked in Parliament whether the Government would relook allowing Muslim women in uniformed services to don the tudung. In response, Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Masagos Zulkifli said the topics that involve racial and religious insensitivities have to be discussed away from the glare of the public.Mr Masagos said this is because “public aggressive pressure” can only make compromise harder and any government concession to religious pressure would also cause other groups to adopt similarly aggressive postures.Assoc Prof Goh highlighted examples of safe spaces where such issues could be discussed, such as the Inter-Racial and Religious Confidence Circles.“A space is safe when all participants can come to speak confidently and freely of their experiences with the expectation that everyone will listen and seek deeper understanding as equals and peers, all in a respectful manner without fear of discrimination, harassment, criticism or emotional violence,” said Assoc Prof Goh.But the Government would have to adapt to changing trends in internet culture, social media and social justice. He noted that for younger generations of Singaporeans, the internet and social media make up “the natural space for their articulation (on issues of concern) … not back channels”.Mr Raymond agreed, stating that racism does not hide behind closed doors.Responding, Dr Janil, who is from the ruling People’s Action Party, said there will always be a need for both public discussions and private dialogues.“It is not an either-or. Race is a multifaceted issue,” he said.OPSG, for example, has moved its activities online in the course of the pandemic. Despite the usual people-to-people nature of its engagements, it has been able to maintain participation rates and in some cases, reach out to new spaces for people to be involved in.Outside of the non-profit, Dr Janil observed that in the last five years, there are already increasing numbers of Singaporeans engaging in the online space to push back against extreme views.“(They are) basically saying, ‘hey look, here's the middle ground, let's find a way to bring peace to this’. So in that sense I guess they are trying to create some safe space online and it's tough because the online space is often dominated by extreme views,” said Dr Janil.Aside from safe spaces, CIFU’s Mr Imran also urged the creation of “brave spaces” for people to confront their own views while listening to the experience of those at the receiving ends of racism.“A brave space involves the willingness to interrogate our own assumptions and take a stand to correct our inability to see privilege and other blindspots that we have. A safe space opens up the conversation. But a brave space ensures that the conversation becomes transformative and not a mere exchange of stories,” he said.POLICIES WHICH SHAPED SOCIETYIn its history, Singapore has relied on a panoply of policies to maintain a harmonious state, and to ensure minority representation in the highest echelons of governance.The Housing and Development Board’s Ethnic Integration Policy, for example, helps to ensure a balanced mix of various ethnic communities in public housing estates and prevent the formation of racial enclaves.The four self-help groups — the Chinese Development Assistance Council, Eurasian Association, Singapore Indian Development Association and Yayasan Mendaki — were also conceived to build resilient communities.The Group Representation Constituency (GRC) scheme, along with the reserved presidential election, was implemented to enshrine minority representation in leadership positions and Parliament.These policies and laws are part of what builds a brand of “active and inclusive multiculturalism”, as described by then Deputy Prime Minister Tharman Shanmugaratnam in 2017.Such an approach is distinct from the “live and let live” mindset in many other countries, which has resulted in communities elsewhere that are living apart and also growing apart, he said.The key is not to dilute or weaken the various cultures in the hope of developing a single, common culture, nor is it to strengthen each separate culture. The former will likely create a confused cultural identity, while the latter will not foster a strong national identity, Mr Tharman had said.But following the recent spate of racist incidents, some people have also questioned whether it was still useful to retain the traditional Chinese, Malay, Indian and Others (CMIO) framework, the foundation on which many policies have been based upon.Speaking in a webinar organised by Academia.sg website last week, Dr Lai Ah-Eng, an adjunct senior fellow associate at NUS’ University Scholars Programme, said the CMIO model imposes a racialised lens and tends to ignore “hybridities” such as mixed marriages.“Do we throw out this CMIO framework as some people have argued for, or should we do a more reduced and careful referencing by ethnicity, bearing in mind that some groups at least still want their ethnic identities as part of a larger range of multiple identities,” said Dr Lai.Associate Professor Anju Mary Paul, an international migration scholar from the Yale-NUS College, said in the webinar that the CMIO model serves as a neat and a simple model which helps people go about their daily lives.“But as Singapore society becomes increasingly complex, this model is showing some strain,” she said.As of 2018, more than one in five couples who tie the knot are in mixed marriages, according to official statistics.Dr Nazry said it is important to understand that racism is not “natural” because race itself is a social construct, as many scholars have said.“Now, this does not mean that the sense of belonging to an ethnic community is not real — this is influenced by our context, family, society and personal experiences.“I think we can begin with the acknowledgement that diversity exists within our own ethnic community ... This sounds simple, but it is not as practised as it should be,” Dr Nazry said.Dr Janil said that the CMIO framework is a policy tool and should not be conflated with the goals of multiculturalism in Singapore. Any social policy or social intervention that is based on a racial categorisation will need such a framework, he added.“You can remove racial categorisation from your (NRIC), but that is not going to prevent someone knowing what you look like when you sit across from them at an interview table or pass them on the street,” he said.Experts said what is needed is a keener interest in each other’s cultures, which is something that has to be established from young.Mr Mohamed Irshad, former Nominated MP and founder of interfaith group Roses of Peace, highlighted the importance of cultural education as a possible way to move forward in the race discourse.“We know about all the different public holidays of various races and religious groups … Beyond that do people know the various non-public holiday events and occasions that the different racial and religious groups observe?” said Mr Irshad, 31.“As a country, we can do a lot more in educating people about the various cultural nuances across various ethnic groups.”Such engagement must be a constant effort in schools and workplaces, and not just something done on Racial Harmony Day, he added.ROLE MODEL SOCIETY NEEDS TO FIND ITS OWN WAY, AGAIN Singapore may have come a long way from the 1964 riots to build a multiracial and multicultural society, but it is clear that this is always a work-in-progress for the country, said people interviewed.Former national sprinter Mr Kunalan said he was thankful that even interracial marriages like his are celebrated now, despite the noise.Though he believes this racial progress will continue, he is worried that recent cases of racism may fuel anger among Singaporeans.“Because there was a lot of anger and when you have anger, there is always a danger that something might explode,” he added, speaking from his experiences back in the day.CIFU’s Mr Imran reiterated that the stakes for Singapore are high: “We cannot allow racism to fester and divide society. Striving for racial equality even if it cannot be fully realised, is crucial. The national pledge that says ‘regardless of race, language or religion to build a democratic society’ should continue to be our guiding principle.”With racial tensions flaring up in many countries today, there are also few positive examples of multiculturalism that Singapore can learn from.Dr Janil said: “We took that unprecedented step in 1965 when we set out on this path … There is no one else with our unique history, and there's no one else that has gone down this road before. But we have been down this road for many decades and we should learn our own lessons first.”In 2013, former Chief Justice Chan Sek Keong gave a lecture to the Singapore Academy of Law on the growth of multiculturalism in Singapore. He said that if demography is destiny, then Singapore’s destiny is to be a multicultural state.“If its citizens are unable to share a common space suffused with shared values, the people will forever be unable to forge a nation that can survive and prosper,” Mr Chan said then.In an email to TODAY, Mr Chan, 83, agreed that the recent racist incidents have highlighted how racism is innate in Singapore’s society. Positive dialogue is sorely needed to move the topic forward constructively, he said.After decades of being held up around the world as a role model society for multiculturalism and multiracialism, Singapore seems to be at a crossroads — and it now needs to find its own way again, having blazed the trail for others.  Surely though, it is doing so from a position of strength, said several academics interviewed. While some believe that the recent incidents reveal deeper issues that need to be addressed, there is little doubt that inter-racial ties in Singapore are built on a solid foundation, and Singaporeans also need to be careful to ensure that societal fault lines are not exploited by nefarious forces within and outside the country. Looking back, media consultant Ian de Cotta, 62, attributed this foundation to the kampung spirit which had its heyday in the aftermath of the 1964 racial riots.“Our neighbours’ doors were always open, even at night, and people would just walk in to chit chat and have coffee,” he said. “This kampung spirit that was so deeply rooted in our people was something that worked in Singapore’s favour.”Agreeing, Mr Kunalan added: “To live harmoniously like in the kampung ... there must be understanding and there must be forgiveness.”With Singapore’s kampung days long gone, the younger generations would do well to remember the adage as they find their own way forward.

Tan Beow Hiong, 57, was charged with one count of public nuisance and two counts of knowingly committing an act that is prejudicial to the maintenance of harmony between different religious or racial groups and disturbs or is likely to disturb the public tranquility. According to court documents, two of her charges were over the MRT incident. She was accused of ""singling out other passengers in the cabin whom you thought were Malay"", making derogatory remarks against them and causing annoyance to other passengers nearby.She was also charged over allegedly maintaining a YouTube channel comprising ""multiple videos alleging racism or harassment by persons of other races"".In a video titled ""Malay Man Attempted to Molest Chinese Woman"", Tan ""repeatedly insinuated"" that Malay people should not touch Chinese people, court documents stated. In a news release on Friday, the police said they were alerted to an online post on Apr 22 at about 12.10pm. The post showed ""a woman who had allegedly made derogatory remarks on Apr 21 against a group of passengers in a train based on a presumption that they were of Malay ethnicity,"" they said. In a separate post on May 11, the woman purportedly spoke loudly on a train, claiming she was not racist. The police added that she also made statement that alluded to the incident depicted in the post. ""Officers from Jurong Police Division had established the identity of the woman on Apr 23, 2021, and she had since been assisting with police investigations,"" said the authorities. Tan's comments in the MRT incident were caught in a video that went viral in April. In the video, she said ""Malay, is it? Okay, no wonder,"" to another commuter. A male voice is then heard saying: ""Racist.""Later in the video, she said she would ""never mix around with you guys because you are so different"". The YouTube channel that purportedly belonged to Tan was terminated for violating the platform's harassment and cyberbullying policies. She was also fired from her job at Knight Frank Singapore, the property agency said in a Facebook post in April.Tan will be remanded for two weeks at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric evaluation. She was unrepresented and made a request for a lawyer under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme. Her case is expected to be heard next on Jul 2.If convicted, she faces up to three years' jail and a fine.

34,Commentary: Survivors of India’s ferocious second COVID-19 wave left scarred by crisis,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/india-covid-19-wave-case-death-rate-oxygen-hospital-treatment-15032864,18 Jun 2021 06:07AM,"While India’s daily infections are down sharply, many now suffer from insomnia, panic attacks and other psychological symptoms, says the Financial Times’ Amy Kazmin.NEW DELHI: A friend stricken with COVID-19 at the peak of India’s ferocious second wave – as I was – called to catch up.Though she’d had breathing difficulties while ill, she’s fine physically now. But, she said, “I think we are all suffering post-traumatic stress disorder”.I had to agree. Days earlier another friend, Jyoti, who’d required oxygen support in her own battle with COVID in April, messaged that her cousin had just succumbed to the virus.But after her own terrifying illness, and the deaths of many other friends, she was too numb to grieve.For me, India’s devastating COVID wave – fuelled by the highly transmissible Delta variant now gaining ground in the UK and the US – has stirred painful memories of another deadly wave: The 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, which killed more than 230,000 people.I was a correspondent in Bangkok when the tsunami struck and was dispatched to the battered Thai coast.Victims’ shrouded bodies were everywhere – in Buddhist temples and wrecked luxury hotels. Survivors recounted the seemingly chance factors that determined who lived and who perished.What affected me most deeply, though, were the billboards with photos of the missing, especially young children.I grew up near the Pacific Ocean and the rhythm of the waves was always a source of comfort. But after the tsunami, it took years before I could visit a beach without recalling the sea’s destructive power.‘THE VIRUS WAS EVERYWHERE’While India’s devastating COVID-19 wave is now receding, with new daily infections down sharply, it has left a trail of wreckage, grief and psychological scars that mental health experts say will haunt society.For many, the country’s surge truly felt like a tsunami, bearing down with destructive force as society – and government – stood paralysed.Weeks on, I still can’t fathom how so many friends, their parents and professional contacts all fell ill almost simultaneously. “The virus was everywhere,” one said simply.Since early April, it seems as if virtually every Delhi resident has lost at least one family member, friend or colleague to COVID – if not many more since early April.Prominent universities lost dozens of professors. My colleague Jyotsna tallied well over 40 friends, relatives, neighbours and colleagues who succumbed.DESPAIR, HELPLESSNESS, ANXIETYYet people are not only reeling from the magnitude of personal losses, but also their struggles to access life-saving medical care and the distressing conditions in which loved ones died.“The way we look at stability in our lives – all of that has changed,” says Achal Bhagat, a veteran Delhi psychiatrist.For weeks, Delhi’s entire population seemed to be desperately – and often unsuccessfully – hunting for hospital beds, medicines and oxygen for family, friends and friends of friends. People tapped any contact they could muster.Such quests often proved futile – a psychological jolt to middle-class and affluent Indians, whose education, social networks and financial clout usually insulates them from India’s broader state failings.The despair, helplessness and anxiety left of their experiences will not dissipate easily.“Even rich people’s resources and networks were not able to get them support,” Bhagat says. “It’s like we are now going back to the 1970s or 80s, where no amount of network could get you the resources you needed. The helplessness of people looking for oxygen will stay with us for a long time.”Many people are now suffering from insomnia, panic attacks and other psychological symptoms.But Bhagat says the collective trauma is also likely to have serious social consequences, such as compassion fatigue, loss of empathy, growing anger and intolerance, greater risk-taking, violence and substance abuse.“The social contract has started breaking down,” he says. “You start … prioritising your own needs and the sense of community starts losing out.”Yet what India’s COVID tsunami has perhaps battered most severely, Bhagat tells me, is people’s confidence in themselves, their country’s prospects and their ability to fulfil their aspirations.And what the wave has left in its wake is “a sense of disillusionment and demoralisation as a society”.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit.

She was given most of the charges last month, after turning up in court for an earlier offence and being photographed without a mask.She was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health and released on bail, but no details of her IMH report were given in open court.On Tuesday, the prosecutor asked for a three-week adjournment, saying there were additional charges pending for Phoon.Phoon, who was unrepresented, told District Judge Janet Wang: ""I'm applying for all these charges to be dropped. I was an ex-naval officer in the SAF ... I was an ex-plaintiff to cases and an eyewitness, it's not possible for me to have a fair hearing because of all these cases previously.""She added that she could not continue with this public case without prejudicing or causing embarrassment to the SAF and the Government of Singapore.Asked by the judge to explain what these past cases were, Phoon repeated that she was a plaintiff in ""a few cases"", without elaborating.""I should be granted immunity as a citizen and also as an ex-SAF officer,"" she added.The judge reiterated to her that any prior matters she might have faced in the SAF would not be relevant to the current set of charges.""Your honour I beg to differ, because due to the grave matters in the previous charges when I was serving in the SAF, it's not possible for me to have a fair hearing in any court in Singapore,"" Phoon said.""These are matters which (are) very serious ... and I do not have the privy to discuss this in a public court.""The judge told her again that this is not relevant, but Phoon said she begged to differ. Judge Wang told her she might want to seek legal advice and adjourned the case to July. Phoon remains out on bail of S$8,000.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

37,"Commentary: Reopening schools should be an urgent priority, as online learning is no substitute",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-school-close-open-asia-health-education-15011580,15 Jun 2021 06:11AM,"While the relatively low risks of children being in school are easily managed, the consequences of keeping them out of their classrooms are grave and far-reaching, say Takeshi Kasai and Karin Hulshof.MANILA: With the COVID-19 pandemic now well into its second year, safely reopening schools has become an urgent priority.School attendance is critical for children’s education and lifetime prospects. The long-term costs of closures – both for individual children and society – are simply too large to justify on a continuing basis.Evidence since the start of the pandemic shows that COVID-19 does not pose a high risk to children, and that schools are not drivers of transmission within the surrounding community.We have also amassed a large body of knowledge about how to reduce the risks to children, teachers and their families. Using this knowledge, we all need to urgently work toward reopening schools safely to protect our children’s future.IMPACT OF PROLONGED SCHOOL CLOSURESProlonged school closures have a significant impact not just on children’s skills attainment and earning prospects, but also on their physical and mental health.While online education can guarantee some continuity of learning for some children, these services are no substitute for in-person attendance.Moreover, access to online learning remains woefully uneven, with disadvantaged children – including those with disabilities, those affected by migration and excluded minorities – bearing the brunt of the shortcomings of digital education.The evidence shows increases in anxiety, depression and self-harm among school-aged children since the start of the pandemic.Children who are not in the classroom also experience increased loneliness, difficulty concentrating, and high levels of learning anxiety. These problems will only grow worse the longer schools remain closed.School closures have also led to reduced physical activity, poor eating habits and disrupted sleep patterns. For some children, more time at home has increased the risk of domestic violence, just as more screen time has exacerbated the risks of online harm.And with schools closed, a critical avenue for identifying and reporting abuse and mental-health issues has been closed off.In nearly half the countries in developing Asia, schools have been closed for more than 200 days during the pandemic.The region should prepare for a reduction in the expected gains in reading and math skills for children in both preschool and primary school, as well as a wider achievement gap between disadvantaged children and their peers.The Asian Development Bank warns that the learning losses caused by prolonged school closures will significantly reduce the future productivity and lifetime earnings of affected students in the region. It estimates the present value of these losses to be US$1.25 trillion – 5.4 per cent of the region’s 2020 GDP.Achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for education was already going to be challenging enough before the pandemic. Now, UNICEF and UNESCO estimate that education budgets in the region will need to increase by at least 7 per cent to stay within striking distance of those targets.SCHOOLS LIKELY NOT HIGH-RISK SETTINGS FOR TRANSMISSIONDespite the obvious costs of school closures, many countries are still reluctant to reopen, citing fears of further transmission. But our focus now should be on using what we know about COVID-19 and children to work towards the safe reopening of schools.Globally, children account for a very small proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Children of primary-school age and younger are among the least likely cohorts to be infected.Even when they do contract COVID-19, they tend to have milder symptoms than adults (which is why they have not contributed significantly to the proportion of hospitalised cases or reported deaths). And a study of children from the Republic of Korea shows that infected children are less likely to spread the virus.In short, primary schools, preschools, and early childhood development (ECD) centres are not high-risk settings for transmission, especially if the right safety measures are followed. Transmission levels in these settings have been found to reflect those of the surrounding community.The one possible exception is secondary schools (high schools), which have accounted for a higher number of outbreaks than primary schools. Because adolescents appear to transmit the virus much like adults, partial closures for secondary schools should remain an option, but only as a last resort and for limited periods where community transmission is surging.When schools are forced to close temporarily, this must be done in conjunction with other community-level public-health and social measures.But overall, the evidence overwhelmingly points to the need for schools, especially preschools and primary schools, to be reopened. The same applies for ECD centres.REOPENING SCHOOLS SAFELYThere is no such thing as zero risk. But the risks are manageable with robust mitigation strategies.The World Health Organization’s guidance on operating schools during the pandemic includes several measures to reduce COVID-19 exposure and transmission. These include personal hygiene practices, proper mask use, physical distancing, adequate ventilation, and regular cleaning and disinfection of surfaces.Clear and consistent communication with parents and children to ensure compliance both in the classroom and during after-school activities is equally important.Policymakers must also consider the local context for resuming in-school learning, including factors such as the level of community transmission and the capacity to respond to an increase in infections.In some places, health and education services will need additional resources to implement the necessary safety measures.Maintaining vigilance and adherence to all of these measures is critical – not only for schools, but also for our broader efforts to contain COVID-19, including the development and spread of virus variants and mutations.The good news is that school reopenings are not dependent on the availability of vaccines. We need to work toward a sustainable “new normal” right now.While the relatively low risks of children being in school are easily managed, the consequences of keeping them out of their classrooms are grave and far-reaching. It is time for the school gates to reopen.Listen to two parents share their front-row experience to their kids' educational journey of home-based learning during the circuit breaker on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:Takeshi Kasai is World Health Organization Regional Director for the Western Pacific.

38,Commentary: Revenge bedtime procrastination in Singapore is coming at a cost,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/revenge-bedtime-procrastination-sleep-difficulty-falling-asleep-14971486,15 Jun 2021 06:10AM,"Many people feel the strong need to reclaim time for themselves, freeing themselves from the constant demands of their jobs, before sleep. But this can hurt their physical and mental health, say NUS academics.SINGAPORE: The benefits of good sleep are well known.After a poor night of sleep, we feel groggy, moody, and we have trouble staying focused. There is enough evidence that people do not perform their best when they are not well-rested.Yet, many of us find ourselves regularly going to bed later then we had intended. Even if we have a busy day ahead, we may be tempted to stay up later than we know is good for us.Bedtime procrastination, as this phenomenon is called, was first described by Dutch psychologist Dr Floor Kroese and refers to a pattern of choosing to go to bed later than intended despite being aware of negative consequences.This behaviour was found in 53 per cent of persons in the original Dutch study in 2014. In work we conducted among Singaporean adolescents, university students, and working adults, 28 per cent of the 321 respondents surveyed over the past two years indicated that they occasionally go to bed later than intended, while 55 per cent reported frequently struggling with this.People often find it hard to disengage from their activities and go to sleep. When we are catching up on our favourite TV drama shows, it may not seem so important to be refreshed the next morning.(Intermittent fasting could help you lose weight but at what cost? And doesn’t it ignore conventional wisdom on not skipping breakfast? Experts unpack the myths on CNA's Heart of the Matter.)JUST ONE MORE EPISODEIn this era of digital media, it is hardly surprising that people feel tempted to stay up late. The Internet provides an endless offering of entertainment, education, and everything in between.Studies have shown that using e-devices close to bedtime can disrupt sleep and push back bedtime. Phones can have an alerting effect due to the content and light emitted. Often, we are engrossed in the media and cannot resist the urge to watch just one more YouTube clip.Our data shows that people who use their phones more heavily during the hours before bedtime, sleep later by 40 minutes on average, compared with a group of light phone users.Furthermore, 65 per cent of respondents indicated that scrolling on their phones, or engaging with some types of electronic media, was one of the activities that kept them from going to bed on time.SWEET REVENGEAnother factor that may influence our sleep habits is our work or school pressure.A Duke-NUS study found that Singaporean secondary school students spent on average 2.9 hours a day on homework during weekdays and 4.5 hours during weekends. Time spent on homework was directly related to shorter time spent in bed for sleeping. On weekdays, the primary pre-condition for going to sleep, was that homework was finished.Browsing our phones might be the last thing that we do before sleeping, but often the time before is packed with school and work assignments. In our data, after digital media, finishing school or work assignments was the second most often mentioned reason for bedtime procrastination.Moreover, high pressure and packed schedules could push our sleep back further, as we seek to regain some “me time”.This phenomenon has recently become known as “revenge bedtime procrastination”.Popularised on Chinese social media, many people describe how they feel the strong need to reclaim time for themselves, freeing themselves from the constant demands of their jobs. Respondents in our study described that after a day of work, family duties, and chores they need some time to relax. “Watching videos, reading online. That keeps me happy” as one respondent puts it.WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT?While it is easy to recognise this issue, it is harder to prevent it. Studies have shown that providing people with knowledge about the importance of sleep, does not necessarily result in people adopting better sleep habits. This is known as the intention-behaviour gap. To plug this gap between knowledge and good intentions, we often need actionable strategies to achieve our goals.   Here are some things that we can do to counter the urge to procrastinate our bedtime.First, have a planned bedtime, and have a bedtime plan. Adolescents whose parents set bedtime sleep significantly longer than those whose parents do not.But equally important is to have a plan in mind on how to go about it. What time should you get ready for bed? When should you put away your phone? What are the obstacles to achieving your plan?Be intentional about limiting screen time before bed. Start a movement among your friends not to message beyond 10pm, except for emergencies.Second, plan to get some physical exercise. Only 35 per cent of Singaporeans exercise regularly and overall, 44 per cent of physical activity comes from commuting which has been significantly reduced as a result of hybrid work.Moderately intense aerobic exercise benefits sleep and often exposes one to natural light. Morning light exposure perks up the brain and keeps our circadian clock from drifting to seeking a later bedtime.Third, there needs to be a sea change in how we influence one another about after-hours work. The potential time savings and work-hour productivity gains from not having to battle through the daily commute should be gains. Both employees and managers should co-operate to complete planned tasks in a timely fashion.Homework can be cut if learning is paced in a manner that accommodates different learning rates to ensure thoughtful assimilation.This will leave time to all to collectively reflect on how to be more effective instead of merely ticking off check-boxes.Everyone should collectively review the hosting of serial virtual meetings where participants are mentally absent. Consideration should also be given for time and energy chipped away by childcare and home-based learning.Lastly, we should be aware that, in the attention economy, our waking hours have become a commodity.Netflix CEO Reed Hastings once said that the company’s biggest competitor is sleep. Companies are competing for your engagement and will fight for every opportunity to do that.Whether through dwelling on whether to make that online purchase, e-games, video streaming, sports offerings or e-gossiping, the addictive nature of engaging in any or all of these activities through a single device is something few can resist.Be aware that you may be trading your health and mental well-being for taps, clicks and swipes. By cutting your sleep, you may become the victim of your own revenge.Stijn Massar is a Senior Research Fellow at the Sleep and Cognition Laboratory, Centre for Sleep and Cognition, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore.

39,Commentary: Here’s the kind of normal you should aim to return to after COVID-19,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-productivity-mental-health-wellbeing-tips-14993716,14 Jun 2021 06:28AM,"COVID-19 has given us the gift of a reboot, and we can be intentional about what we choose to do with it, says a psychologist.CHARLOTTESVILLE, Virginia: You’ve been waiting … and waiting … and waiting for this amazing, magical day when you can return to “normal life”.For many people in the US, it feels like that dim light at the end of the pandemic tunnel is becoming brighter. My 12- and 14-year-old daughters now have their first shot, with the second one soon to follow.I was euphoric when the kids received their vaccinations, choking up under my mask at the relief that my family was now unlikely to get sick or pass the coronavirus on to others more vulnerable than we are. Finally our family could start returning to so-called normal life.But what should those of us fortunate enough to be vaccinated return to? I didn’t exactly feel euphoric each day in my normal life pre-COVID-19. How should you choose what to rebuild, what to leave behind and what new paths to try for the first time?Clinical psychological science provides some helpful clues for how to chart your course out of pandemic life.SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONSYou are less likely to be disappointed if you set reasonable expectations.For instance, you’ll likely feel some anxiety as you try to figure out what’s OK to do and what’s still risky. Even as the risk level has declined in many places, there is still uncertainty and unpredictability tied to the current coronavirus risks, and it’s natural to feel anxious or ambivalent when letting go of an established habit, like wearing masks.So, be ready for some anxiety and realise it doesn’t mean something is wrong – it’s a natural reaction to a very unnatural situation.It’s also likely that many social interactions will feel a little awkward at first. Most Americans are out of practice socialising, and repeated practice is what helps us feel comfortable.Even if your social skills were at their peak, the current moment serves up a lot to navigate interpersonally. Chances are you won’t always agree with the people in your life on where to draw the lines about what’s safe and what’s not.There are going to be some complicated July Fourth parties to navigate given many families have some members vaccinated and some not. That will be frustrating after waiting so long to finally get together.And you won’t automatically have warm, fuzzy feelings about all your colleagues, family, friends and neighbours. Many of those little annoyances that cropped up in your interactions before you ever heard of COVID-19 will still be there.So, expect some awkwardness, frustration and annoyance – everyone’s creating new patterns and adjusting to changed relationships. This should all get easier with time and practice, but having realistic expectations can make the transition smoother.LIVE YOUR VALUESTo help plan which activities and relationships to put time into, think about your priorities.Living in ways that are consistent with your values can promote well-being and reduce anxiety and depression. Many therapeutic exercises are designed to help reduce the discrepancy between your stated values and the choices you make day to day.Imagine you are asked to carve a pie to illustrate your different roles and how important each is to the way you feel about yourself and the values you prioritise. You might value your roles as a mother, a spouse and a friend most highly, assigning them the biggest pieces of your pie.Now, what if you were asked to carve that pie in a way that reflects how you actually allocate your time and energy, or how you actually tend to evaluate yourself. Is the time you spend with friends much lower than its value to you? Is the tendency to judge yourself based on rigid work demands much higher?Of course, time is not the only meaningful metric, and all of us have periods when certain parts of our lives need to dominate – think about life as a parent of a newborn, or a student during final exams.But this process of considering your values and trying to align what you value and how you live can help guide your choices during this complex time.KEEP TRACKClinical psychologists recommend engaging in activities that feel rewarding in some way to stave off negative moods. Doing things that are pleasurable, that provide a sense of accomplishment or help you meet your goals can all feel rewarding, so this isn’t just about having fun.For most people, some balance of fun, productive, social, active and relaxing activities in life is key to feeling like your different needs are being met. So, try keeping track of your activities and mood for a week.See when you feel more or less happy and when you feel like you’re meeting your goals, and adjust accordingly. It will take some trial and error to find the balance of activities that provides that sense of reward.TIME OF GROWTH OR PRESERVATION?There is fascinating research showing that the perception of time can influence your goals and motivation. If you feel time is waning – as often occurs for older adults or those experiencing a serious illness – you are likely to seek deeper connections with a smaller number of people.Alternatively, those who feel time is open-ended and expansive tend to seek new relationships and experiences.As restrictions loosen, are you desperate to visit a close friend in the town you grew up in? Or more excited to travel to an exotic location and make new friends?There isn’t a right answer, but this research can help you consider your current priorities and plan that next reunion or trip accordingly.PAY IT FORWARDIf you are vaccinated and healthy and can return to more normal activities, then you are in a fortunate group after a year of such devastating losses.As you plan how to use this time, consider the research showing that your emotional health improves when you do things to benefit others.Being intentional about helping others is a win-win. Many people and communities are in need right now, so think about how you can contribute – be it time, money, resources, skills or a listening ear.Asking what your community needs to recover and thrive and how you can help address those needs, as well as considering what you and your household need, can boost everyone’s well-being.As the return to so-called normal life becomes more of a reality, don’t idealise post-pandemic life or you are bound to be disappointed.Instead, be grateful and intentional about what you choose to do with this gift of a reboot. With a little thought, you can do better than “normal”.Bethany Teachman is Professor of Psychology at the University of Virginia.

41,Commentary: A precious chance to see my ageing mother in Germany after being separated by COVID-19,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid19-homesickness-separated-visiting-ageing-mother-14978892,12 Jun 2021 06:00AM,"The pandemic has been particularly cruel to families separated by distance – with borders closed and travel tedious and costly, some never have the chance to hold their loved ones. Greg Lim-Lange is glad he had the chance.SINGAPORE: It is not normal for a son to ask: “When is my mother going to die?” or “Will I be able to see her before the inevitable fate that awaits us all sooner or later?”But I have had to ask this difficult question because like many people, I live thousands of miles away from my mother. I have lived here for 12 years, while my mother, who turns 85 this year, lives in Germany.Since the beginning of the pandemic, my Singaporean wife and I had been waiting for countries to control the virus, for travel to “normalise”, and to able to fly and meet her. But by May 2021, I hadn’t seen her in almost two years.For those of us separated from families, there were windows of hope that could have enabled a trip home - relatively low COVID-19 numbers in Singapore, a potential travel bubble via Hong Kong where business opportunities there mean we can avoid a lengthy quarantine after spending some time there, and vaccines being rapidly developed.But not only did numbers increase, the travel bubble burst twice, dashing many hopes. The fluidity in the COVID-19 situation has meant unpredictable changes to travel restrictions since last year. At the height of the pandemic for instance, Singapore closed its borders to all short-term visitors. This year, when the mutant strains raised infection numbers again, Singaporeans and Permanent Residents had to test negative before flying back.Even if we took the risk to travel, there was a nagging fear – what if during my travel, I catch the virus and then bring it home to my mum? Or what if I pass it on to my wife? How long should I wait before it is safe – knowing that there would never really be a “right time”?TAKING THE RISK TO TRAVELThe good news is vaccinations became available and my mother was first in line to receive her shots in Freiburg, a small city nestled in the Black Forest in the south of Germany. I myself got fully vaccinated by May.The possibility of a trip came into sharper focus. However, there were still logistical challenges and uncertainties involved in making the trip. Should I go alone or go together with my wife?  What if there is another outbreak and Singapore changes entry re-entry requirements? How about work – we could not be away indefinitely and needed contingency plans.My wife and I decided to travel together. It helped that we are self-employed and could do some work remotely.Yet, shortly after we booked our tickets and just days before our departure, things took a turn for the worse. Germany went into a hard lockdown as numbers there spiralled. The new and more contagious variants of the virus also arrived in Singapore.   Germany required a negative pre-flight COVID-19 test no earlier than 48 hours before arrival.  With PCR tests taking up to two days to process, we scheduled not one but two tests to be taken just in case of a rare false positive. It would be terrible to have come this far and then be turned around at the airport before we could enter Germany.Meanwhile the new restrictions in Germany to stop transmission meant that all restaurants, shops, and hotels were closed and there was even a curfew in place from 10pm to 6am every night. So again, there was the concern of being infected and the thought of whether we should still go or postpone came to mind. We had just 12 hours to decide. All our COVID-19 tests had come back negative and we stuck to what mattered most – using this opportunity to see my mother, who had been waiting for two years to be reunited with us.AN EERIE JOURNEYIt was an eerie journey through empty hallways at Changi Airport with personnel in full PPE, and always a niggling concern in the back of my mind whether we would be let through the immigration controls in Germany.With a pandemic that throws up spikes in cases without warning, what was the chance of new regulations mid-flight barring all visitors or new quarantine requirements which so far had not been the case in Germany?Perhaps it was good that our anxieties were also hidden behind our masks that we were required to wear for the entire flight except for mealtimes.  This clearly wasn’t joyful travelling as it used to be.In the end, the journey there went smoothly, the immigration officer glanced at our test results and apologised for the new restrictions and we got through immigration within minutes. After a two-and-a-half-hour ride on a strangely empty Autobahn, we arrived at my mother’s home. She burst into tears of joy hugging me tightly after being separated for so long and my wife caught this moment of pure joy on camera. Our journey to Germany really brought home the point that we are wired to connect with our loved ones physically. No video call can ever replace the feeling of being held by a loved one or the taste of a mother’s meal. My mother had already been cooking our favourite dishes for a week before we arrived in anticipation.THE RETURN JOURNEYOnly a few days after arriving in Germany, the compulsory 14-day quarantine in Singapore was changed to 21 days.  Then there was a big cluster at Changi Airport and we started to worry if the airport might be closed under a new circuit breaker. The following week we learned that non- Singaporeans or PRs would not be allowed to re-enter Singapore until August. For some of our international friends currently travelling, that meant that they could not even return to their business or loved ones in Singapore. My wife and I remained apprehensive about our journey home – our children were waiting for us. We kept checking online if any new requirements cropped up before boarding our flight home.We made it back safely and Changi Airport was even emptier than we remembered. Well-organised as always, immigration and testing upon arrival went quite smoothly as a small army of helpful guides walked alongside us and directed us to every station we needed to pass, from immigration to swab test to our shuttle bus. Was this arduous journey filled with twists, turns and worries worth it?I would say yes – my time with my mother was so very precious. The two weeks we were there went by so quickly. I didn’t have the courage to tell her how much death was on my mind or how my fears of uncertainty were bothering me. I simply stayed with her, listened to her, ate all her lovingly prepared dishes and held her tight.I know we are very privileged to be able to spend the time and the money needed to see our loved ones. My heart goes out to the many more who are stuck in this pandemic limbo with one lockdown after another, still connecting using technology and yearning for the time they can take a trip to finally hold each other again.

42,Commentary: Why are some people less productive than others when working from home?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/work-from-home-productivity-mental-health-employees-14808720,10 Jun 2021 06:03AM,"The vast majority of those polled said they got more done at home but prolonged isolation that comes from not being around colleagues does take a toll on work, says this researcher.LANCASTER, England: Has working at home during lockdown made people more productive or not? This has been the subject of some lively debate recently.Many companies do not routinely measure productivity. A large number will have traditionally assumed that they get the highest output when staff work longer hours or under close supervision, but remote working is clearly causing some to re-evaluate this.Major firms, for instance professional services group PwC, have been sufficiently impressed to make remote working a permanent option for their staff.On the other hand, some business leaders insist that remote working is compromising productivity and is therefore not workable in the long term. Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon, for example, has dismissed it as an “aberration that we’re going to correct as soon as possible”. So who is right?Surveys tend not to be good at measuring productivity objectively. The research partnership Work After Lockdown, on which I’m a co-investigator, has been trying to improve on this.We have just published the results of an ESRC-funded survey in which we asked 1,085 respondents working from home in the UK about their productivity.We chose to use standard measure of labour productivity used by economists, output per hour worked, where output refers to the value of the goods or services in question. Using this meant we weren’t just measuring whether people were working longer hours.We asked our respondents whether they felt that their self-reported productivity was the same, better or worse compared with the pre-lockdown period. From the results, 54 per cent thought they got “a little more” or “much more” done per hour worked than before the lockdown.Combined with those who reported that their productivity was the same as before lockdown, it meant that almost 90 per cent reported that productivity had been maintained or improved – echoing the results of other UK studies.In other words, barely one in 10 people reported that their productivity had gone down during lockdown. So why would working from home have made most people more productive, but some less so?PRODUCTIVITY AND MENTAL HEALTHWe also questioned our respondents about their mental health, and scored them using the World Health Organization’s WHO-5 index. From plotting the results we can see a very clear pattern, with higher productivity associated with better mental health.In fact, the mental health scores for the most productive workers in our survey were twice as high as the least productive.It is not clear from our data whether poor mental health causes or contributes to a decline in productivity or whether being productive helps to boost mental health. It seems reasonable to think that both are probably true.To explore this relationship, we looked at people’s ability to adapt to changing circumstances and their capacity to overcome setbacks or interruptions – referred to in the literature as self-regulation.We might expect people with such abilities to remain focused on a task, and be more productive as a result. Sure enough, this was supported by the data.Over 90 per cent of our respondents reported that they could concentrate on one activity for a long time; 94 per cent said they were able to use the autonomy afforded them by their employer to re-order work tasks; 85 per cent said they could control their thoughts from distracting them from the task in hand; and 83 per cent said that they had no problem resuming a concentrated style of working after an interruption.Each of these dimensions of self-regulation were strongly positively correlated with high productivity per hour worked.It’s worth remembering, of course, that many people working from home during lockdown have been living with mental-health challenges such as isolation, money worries, home-schooling or other health problems.Clearly if organisations want to ensure that employees are productive working from home, the value of investing in measures to support psychological well-being is very clear.IS HYBRID WORK THE WAY TO GO?The social disconnection of working at home over an extended period may well erode people’s mental well-being and productivity in future – perhaps especially among workers who thrive on interacting with colleagues and clients to swap and shape ideas.The outgoing chief economist of the Bank of England, Andy Haldane, has expressed concerns about this, and 73 per cent of our survey respondents reported that they ideally wanted working patterns that allowed them to vary their place of work to reflect the tasks they were performing.With this in mind, it has become very fashionable for companies to talk about “hybrid” working lately. But it’s an imprecise concept, and if businesses are to give employees clarity around what can be done at home and what needs to happen at a traditional workplace, they will need to decide which jobs truly need to be done at a particular time or location.Getting this wrong may risk compromising the mental health of employees – for example, if prolonged remote working increases isolation or increases work intensity.It may also mean that companies never quite manage to deliver the long-term productivity gains they are hoping to secure once lockdown is over.Stephen Bevan is Head of HR Research Development, Institute for Employment Studies at Lancaster University.

44,"Man jailed for slashing boss to death, attacking 2 others in office after getting fired",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jailed-slashing-boss-death-attacking-2-others-office-fired-14978604,09 Jun 2021 02:40PM,"SINGAPORE: After rejecting a job promotion, a warehouse employee began falling behind in work until his bosses eventually fired him.Angered by the perceived rejection and after weeks of searching ""how to kill people so that they can die easily"", 24-year-old Malaysian Yee Jing Man took a chopper to the office where he slashed one of his three bosses to death.He slashed another boss grievously and made the third eat a red packet as he felt this boss had given him a low amount of money for Chinese New Year.Yee was sentenced to 20 years' jail on Wednesday (Jun 9) for one charge of culpable homicide not amounting to murder and another of voluntarily causing grievous hurt by a dangerous weapon.Another eight charges including wrongful confinement and criminal intimidation were taken into consideration.The court heard that Yee was introduced to the job at e-commerce firm Ji Ji by his girlfriend, who worked there.The company was helmed by three directors: The deceased, 29-year-old Lin Xinjie, 30-year-old Li Mingqiao and Ryan Pan Zai Xing, 29.Yee began working as a warehouse employee at the company in Sungei Kadut in March 2017, loading purchases onto delivery trucks.Initially, he performed well at work and was praised by his boss for being hardworking.In 2018, Mr Lin - whom Yee later slashed to death - gave Yee a red packet containing S$999 for Chinese New Year due to his good performance.He also offered to promote Yee to warehouse manager, and raise his salary by S$300. This would take Yee's monthly salary to S$2,000.Yee rejected the offer because he did not want the increase in workload and stress, the court heard.HIS WORK PERFORMANCE WORSENEDFrom September 2018, Yee's work performance worsened, court documents said. He missed work on multiple occasions and did not provide medical certificates explaining his absence for some of those occasions.Between Dec 1, 2017, and Mar 12, 2019, he was absent from work for 69 days.Yee began bearing a grudge against Mr Lin and Mr Li, as he felt he had been scolded unreasonably or spoken to sarcastically by them, the court heard.He felt that Mr Lin in particular was ""a stubborn and useless person"" who became a boss only because of his family's wealth.By February 2019, Yee was suffering from insomnia and started visualising hacking the three directors to death with a chopper whenever he tried to fall asleep, the court heard.He also decided he would commit suicide if he were to kill the trio as he did not want to be a fugitive and felt there was no purpose in living if he had to constantly worry about earning money.On Feb 12, 2019, Yee's girlfriend called him and told him that Mr Lin wanted to fire him.Yee had thoughts of chopping Mr Lin to death at that time, the court heard. He told his girlfriend he was going to buy a chopper to attack Mr Lin, and purchased one from a provision shop before hiding it in his sling bag, the court heard.He then headed to the office, and demanded that Mr Lin give him a termination letter. Mr Lin responded that he was busy and would do it later.While Yee waited for Mr Lin, Yee's girlfriend felt a hard and odd-shaped object in his bag, the court heard. Yee brushed her hand away and warned her angrily not to touch his bag.Yee later changed his mind about killing the deceased, the prosecutors said.INTERNET HISTORYEventually, two of his bosses decided that Yee should take the rest of the month off and continue working thereafter for lower pay.For the rest of February 2019, Yee mostly stayed at the home he rented with his girlfriend.She noticed that he mainly played games on his phone and saw that his Internet search history included topics such as ""how to die quickly"" and ""how to kill people so that they can die easily"", the court heard.Yee returned to work at Ji Ji in March 2019, but his performance did not improve. He stopped showing up by Mar 6, 2019, and took leave to explain his absence.On Mar 11, Yee told his girlfriend that he was tired and did not feel like going to work. Angered, his girlfriend slapped him and told him to return to Ipoh, offering to buy him a bus ticket.Later that morning, Mr Pan texted Yee's girlfriend saying that Yee no longer needed to return to work. She forwarded the messages to Yee, adding ""you decide for yourself"".Yee grew very angry after reading the messages and decided to attack the three directors of the firm. He retrieved the chopper he bought earlier as well as another knife.Before leaving the house, he made an Internet search on whether he would be deported back to Malaysia after his arrest, the court heard.He sent a message to Mr Pan saying he had made a decision and asking him not to run. He alleged that he was treated ""like a beggar"" as he was given only a S$20 red packet for Chinese New Year that year.THE OFFICE ASSAULTYee arrived at the office at 12.55pm. He walked to Mr Li, who was seated at his desk, and slashed his head and neck from the back.He then walked to Mr Lin and swung the chopper a few times towards the back of his neck. Several employees witnessed the attack.Yee then pointed his chopper at Mr Pan and threw the red packet Mr Pan had previously given back at him. He told Mr Pan to eat it, and Mr Pan complied.Yee closed the door and barricaded the entrance with cabinets and tables to prevent people from leaving or entering. Mr Lin was bleeding and asked his workers to call the ambulance.Yee told Mr Pan ""I have no way to go"" and stabbed himself in the stomach with the knife before slashing his wrist with the chopper.As he collapsed to the floor, he threw up and said in Mandarin: ""Why you all have to dismiss me, I have no other way to go.""Officers arrived at the scene and restrained Yee, who put up a struggle.Mr Lin was pronounced dead at the scene by paramedics. He had multiple injuries including a 19.5cm-long gaping wound on his neck, and he died of incised wounds to the neck.Mr Li suffered injuries including lacerations to his scalp, injuries to his face and a fractured jaw. Yee was treated in hospital for a liver laceration from his stab injury and a deep cut on his wrist. He was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, placed under suicide caution and prescribed an antidepressant and sedative.IMH REPORTSAn Institute of Mental Health report found that Yee was suffering from major depressive disorder which caused ""blinkered and catastrophic thinking"" and substantially impaired his ability to think of more obvious, logical and pro-social solutions.A second report found that the disorder had significantly impaired Yee's mental responsibility and qualify him for the defence of diminished responsibility.A subsequent medical report in April 2020 found that Yee had responded well to antidepressant medications in prison and his condition had significantly improved.Another report found that his risk of reoffending and violence was low, and that he was of a ""much reduced risk of danger"". However, he needed to continue his antidepressant medication. The prosecution called for at least 21 years' jail, citing the degree of premeditation and blatant disregard for human life displayed. In view of his mental condition, they did not call for caning. The killing would have been classified as murder but for his mental condition, said the prosecutors.Justice Valerie Thean said Yee wrongfully confined and criminally detained four people and demanded that Mr Pan swallow a red packet.However, she said Yee's mental condition was a central focus of the case. She considered that the offences arose out of ""a single episode of mental breakdown, of which he was hitherto undiagnosed"". ""In this context I also consider his otherwise clean record, relative youth and, with proper medication and care, his ability to rehabilitate,"" she said.For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, he could have been jailed either for life or up to 20 years' jail, fined and caned.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

The judge granted his request.Leow was arrested in an operation conducted by the National Parks Board’s Animal and Veterinary Service with police support on Tuesday morning, the board earlier said.According to animal welfare group SPCA, 10 cats with slash wounds were seen in Ang Mo Kio last month, after an injured cat was first spotted at the end of April.The penalties for a first-time offender convicted of animal cruelty are a jail term of up to 18 months, a fine of up to S$15,000, or both.Repeat offenders face up to three years’ jail, a maximum S$30,000 fine, or both.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

46,Commentary: Grassroots health surveillance can help detect new outbreaks of COVID-19 and other illnesses,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-community-health-surveillance-pandemic-detection-14964262,09 Jun 2021 06:10AM,"To be better prepared for future pandemics, our top-down models and agreements must shape responses grounded firmly in local communities who offer valuable insight, say Ngaire Woods and Ok Pannenborg.OXFORD: The World Health Assembly met in May amid a slew of proposals to create stronger, enforceable global rules for tackling future infectious disease outbreaks.The most recent was from the United Nations Independent Panel for Pandemic Preparedness and Response.A new global pandemic treaty, more robust and independent international institutions, and an international pandemic financing facility are all in the mix.But a bottom-up strategy might work better.STRENGTHENING GLOBAL HEALTHA separate review by the World Health Organization earlier this year highlighted four ways to strengthen global health governance.It called for a centralised approach to bolstering countries’ preparedness for health emergencies; a worldwide notification system to ensure robust monitoring of compliance; global capacities such as a genomic sequencing infrastructure; and closer coordination among international institutions, including the WHO, the World Organisation for Animal Health, the Food and Agriculture Organization, and the United Nations Environment Programme.These are all worthy objectives. But is a top-down approach the best way to pursue them?To answer that question, global health experts should pay more attention to successful grassroots efforts to combat disease.CASES OF EFFECTIVE COMMUNITY SURVEILLANCEConsider the fight against onchocerciasis, or river blindness.In the 1970s, it was led by World Bank President Robert McNamara, Merck CEO Roy Vagelos, and WHO Director-General Halfdan Mahler. But over time, a bottom-up strategy whereby almost a half-million village community health workers owned the problem, proved more effective.A 1994-95 multi-country study showed that when communities are responsible for organising their own distribution of ivermectin (the drug that treats onchocerciasis), coverage is higher than when the health system delivers the drug.Another report by the Carter Center highlights the role that kinship and local networks play in tackling this disease.Similarly, the Bombay Leprosy Project is a longstanding programme in Mumbai’s largest slums, such as Dharavi.Community volunteers, trained by paramedical workers, conduct door-to-door surveys among the population in order to detect new cases.During the pandemic, it has been one of the most effective channels for delivering personal protective equipment (PPE), healthcare, food, and now COVID-19 vaccinations to the poorest of the poor in areas where the Maharashtra state and federal governments are essentially absent.REBUILDING NATIONAL RESILIENCEThe importance of bottom-up initiatives in responding to the pandemic is not limited to developing countries.The United Kingdom’s government invested heavily in a centralised national COVID-19 test-and-trace service. But evidence suggests that even relatively underfunded local schemes performed better, leading the government to rethink its approach.Increased efficacy is not the only reason to consider a grassroots strategy.Politically, many countries – perhaps scarred by their experience of trade blockages at the outset of the pandemic, the worldwide scramble for PPE supplies, and vaccine nationalism – are currently more focused on national resilience than global commitments.A new emphasis on local resilience may therefore find a much more receptive audience in communities around the world.One of the shortcomings of international health regulations during the COVID-19 pandemic has been the failure to prepare, provide, and coordinate adequate resources at the country level. A bottom-up approach could change this.(""Hawkers are not stupid or stubborn."" Find out why KF Seetoh says it will take more than hawkers embracing deliveries and going digital to save Singapore's food culture on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)FUNDING EARLY WARNING FOR OUTBREAKSMoreover, investments in community-level health-surveillance capacity will likely be key to tackling this and future pandemics. Here, the right financial incentives are crucial.Rural smallholders in Africa and Asia will be the first to know when some of their chickens or ducks seem sick – possibly with an avian influenza virus that could trigger a human pandemic.But if farmers who report a disease outbreak face the prospect of culling their entire flock without receiving adequate compensation, they may well decide not to share the information.Likewise, as Stefan Dercon of the University of Oxford has argued, investing in the reach and quality of community health care and in health workers’ protection is vital to ensure the continuation of basic medical services.These include vaccination, provision of antiretrovirals, supplementary feeding, maternal health, bed net distribution, and malaria treatment. Community health workers are also essential for shielding the most vulnerable in densely populated areas, and for tracking and controlling disease.Such bottom-up approaches will require government support, including financing of local efforts. Any backing may need to be anchored in law to be sustainable, as was the case with the funding of Brazil’s public health research institution Fiocruz in the early 20th century.Such statutes may protect organisations from attempts to reduce budget allocations or finance other programmes at their expense.Historically, global health and environmental cooperation has reflected various combinations of top-down and bottom-up measures.While the 1987 Montreal Protocol to protect the ozone layer was an example of top-down regulation, the 2015 Paris climate agreement resulted from a much longer process involving communities, cities, and countries around the world.Academic studies and research by hundreds of universities, institutes, and scientists, and early initiatives by mayors and individual communities, greatly heightened grassroots awareness and commitments from families, schools, local media, municipalities, and regional administrators.In the end, even the best bottom-up disease-control efforts risk being thwarted by international failures to ensure access to PPE, genetic sequencing, or vaccines. But policymakers must not neglect local-level healthcare.To be better prepared for future pandemics, our top-down models and agreements must shape responses that are grounded firmly in local communities and value their engagement, risk ownership, and anxieties.Ngaire Woods is Dean of the Blavatnik School of Government at the University of Oxford.

Phoon Chiu Yoke, 53, faces multiple charges for contravening COVID-19 regulations by not wearing a mask. She was given most of the charges last month, after turning up in court for an earlier offence and being photographed without a mask.She was taken back to court on Tuesday (Jun 8) at the end of her remand at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).The prosecutor said the IMH report was ready, but did not provide more details on it.The prosecutor asked for four weeks' adjournment pending the completion of investigations, as well as possible additional charges for similar offences to be tendered.The prosecution offered Phoon, who was unrepresented, S$10,000 bail, with various conditions including to abide by COVID-19 restrictions and not to reoffend.When the judge asked Phoon if she had anything to say, she said: ""I would like to apply for the charges to be dropped and for me to be discharged.""Phoon, who was escorted by officers and was wearing a mask, said: ""This is in consideration that I am a professional. I am an ex-Naval officer and have strong professional standing. I also have a series of ex-medical history which in most other cases many other people will be ... totally dependent on a respiratory system.""Phoon said that the charges should not stand as there were ""various procedural errors"" in investigations.Providing an example, she claimed the investigating officer did not ask her for her identity, and did not have an arrest warrant when she arrested her.When District Judge Janet Wang asked Phoon if she would like to engage counsel, Phoon said she would like to defend herself at this point in time.""Before I was discharged at IMH, I was given a copy of the court outcome. I was informed I would be discharged and the cases would be dropped,"" she continued.On the offered bail of S$10,000, Phoon said she would like it to be reduced to S$3,000, again referencing her former Navy career and ""contributions to Singapore as a pioneer"".""If I have to pay for bail, then it will just be S$3,000 and no need for any surety, because I have a strong professional standing,"" she said.When asked who could stand bail for her, Phoon said her family members in Singapore were either ill or in old age, and that most of her friends were overseas.""I don't think the charges are serious enough to ask for such a high bail amount,"" she added.The judge offered her S$8,000 bail, slightly lower than what the prosecution asked for, and granted her two local phone calls to make the necessary arrangements.She reminded Phoon that she could not commit any offence while on bail, and to abide by COVID-19 restrictions.""Your honour, could you clarify what's the COVID-19 (restrictions)?"" asked Phoon.""The laws everyone is abiding by,"" replied Judge Wang. ""To put your mask on when you are in a public space.""""Yes, your honour,"" said Phoon.Phoon will return to court next week.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

49,Commentary: Why some miss their regular kopi pit stop after dining-in restrictions kicked in,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-phase-2-dining-in-parent-mum-kid-burnout-mental-health-14966242,08 Jun 2021 06:01AM,"That coffee break used to allow essential workers and parents some distance and recuperation, says mum June Yong.SINGAPORE: Going down to the coffeeshop or a nearby cafe used to mark a midpoint in the day for me, a good half hour away from my three kids to catch my breath and hold onto my sanity.Since Phase 2 (Heightened Alert) kicked in and schools shifted to HBL in mid-May, mums like me have been feeling the heat from caring for our children 24/7, while also coping with an erosion of personal space within and outside the home.Since the June holidays began last week, we’ve also had to scramble to put together some semblance of structure to the children’s mostly empty days.But the restrictions that have kicked in have also meant that dining-in is no longer allowed. I do miss that routine of heading downstairs for my teh c xiu dai (tea with evaporated milk and less sugar) and sitting for a while.The days are starting to blend together, and it’s a struggle to focus on getting work done.“I can’t sit down and relax for an extended period of time at home. Some kid always needs me,” commiserates a friend who is a stay-home mother of four young girls.“Being at a cafe means I get to be an adult and read and unwind, journal and eat something nice (which I don’t have to share). It’s also a rare chance for me not to have to meet anyone else’s needs at least for a couple of hours.”For another friend who used to enjoy a spot of me-time at her local coffeeshop when everyone else was still in bed, such mental and physical breaks provide her quiet moments for reflection, setting the tone for the day that she says sometimes helps to improve her relationships at home.PARENTING BURNOUTPsychologist John Duffy, author of Parenting the New Teen in the Age of Anxiety, identifies a hidden form of labour specific to mothers – “emotional labour”.In a CNN commentary, he defines it as “the ability and willingness to gauge the emotional temperature of the home – who is struggling, who may be nearing a boiling point, who needs some time alone, who might need therapy – that has kept our households reasonably sane for the length of the pandemic.”Emotional labour, which stands separately from managing the home, is “esoteric, ongoing and endlessly taxing. And the emotional labour in most every household tends to fall squarely on moms.”In pandemic times, with families stuck in small spaces, caregiving can be a slippery slope to burnout if we don't take sufficient steps to rest.“Taking care of yourself,” according to the American Psychological Association, “helps to keep your mind and body primed to deal with situations that require resilience.”In an interview last year when the circuit breaker was first pulled, Dr Lim Boon Leng, a psychiatrist at Dr BL Lim Centre for Psychological Wellness, suggests that mums carve out time for themselves in the family timetable or establish areas out of bounds to the kids.For many, a short break away from the family could help us feel calmer and more emotionally regulated, at a time when parental stress levels continue to rise and along with it, irritability and resentment within the home.SELF-CARE CAN MAKE US BETTER PARENTSTo be sure, the loss of the kopi pit stop affects everyone, and some essential workers might feel the pain sharply.An affordable and accessible everyday luxury for some, it can be a critical juncture for others taking a break between gigs.People constantly on the move, such as food deliverers, taxi and private car drivers, contractors and insurance agents are going to feel the displacement the most.At the coffeeshop I escaped to each day before these new restrictions, some of them could  be spotted at lunchtime sitting and resting. Now they eat in their vehicles or at a void deck.Thankfully, the Government saw their need and quickly carved out spaces in community centres for them to sit and have their meals at a safe distance. Attention has also been paid to establishing rest places for low-wage workers before the pandemic, with funding to set up such areas available.I would also argue that just as essential workers need a dedicated rest area, so do mums. You may wave this off as self-indulgence, but self-care makes us better parents.Self-care habits can be small, like catching up with a good friend or enjoying a book at bedtime by ourselves. The rest or relaxation helps us stay healthy, emotionally regulated and at the top of our game.The University of Chicago’s Centre for the Study of Social Policy says self-care for parents is a critical resource. Whether it is yoga, quiet journaling, or a coffee with a friend, self-care reduces stress and enhances our sense of wellbeing.These meet our needs, whether physical, emotional, spiritual or social and help us be in a better place to care for those of our spouse and children.For caregivers of children with special needs or elderly parents, the practice of taking regular time-off is all the more crucial.(""Hawkers are not stupid or stubborn."" Find out why KF Seetoh says it will take more than hawkers embracing deliveries and going digital to save Singapore's food culture on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.)PRACTISING GOOD EMOTIONAL HYGIENEI know I shouldn’t lament the loss of dining-in privileges at my local coffeeshop too much, after all the situation in Singapore remains very much under control.We are not in a full lockdown, and we can still step out for a jog, a walk, or to do a grocery run. Malls and shops remain open. My husband also tends to the kids when I need a break.Now, I still go down on some days to grab a takeaway cuppa but instead of sitting at the coffeeshop, I wander off to find an empty park bench.It may just be 15 minutes of stillness, but it is a cocoon of calm in such unsettling times.COVID-19 may have warped our sense of time and shrunk our sense of space. It may have even hampered our ability to look ahead and make plans for the future.But what it has not taken away is our ability to breathe and live within the everyday.As we’re all experts in physical hygiene now, so we should become in emotional hygiene – especially considering the long bumpy road ahead for this pandemic.CHERISHING WHAT WE HAVE NOWWe may have lost a lot in terms of freedom and normalcy, but the good news is we’re adapting and coping alright in our own unique ways.The friend who said she misses her early morning me-time is now compensating with longer trips to the supermarket.Some of us are also making the effort to call our loved ones more often, just to check in and find out if they’re okay.I find myself looking for excuses to make contact, by delivering food to friends, or picking up delicious bakes from them.Our contact with family and friends may be shorter and more transient than before, but even these can make a difference.While we look forward to the day when restrictions are relaxed and we can dine out once again, whether solo, in pairs or in small groups, perhaps there are already small pleasures we can relish now.As a mummy-friend of mine quipped after I dropped by her place last week, “I guess one can go a long time without contact but it only takes a physical meetup to make you realise how precious that is.”The same goes for our first coffee cup once dining in at hawker centres is allowed again.June Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

50,"The Big Read: Taking utmost precautions, Olympics-bound athletes hoping show will go on despite health risks",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tokyo-precautions-olympics-athletes-covid-19-teamsg-14953940,07 Jun 2021 06:03AM,"With fewer than 50 days to go before the sporting extravaganza begins, Singapore’s Olympians are preparing for the first-ever Olympics to be held amid an unprecedented global pandemic.SINGAPORE: When national diver Jonathan Chan attended an international competition last month after a year-long hiatus due to the COVID-19 pandemic, he was greeted by a very different scene.Unlike previous competitions where he could wander freely around the host country, the 24-year-old could only leave his hotel room in Tokyo, Japan, for training or the competition event itself.There was also a five-person limit on the number of divers who could be on the diving board at any one time, where there was none before. Chan also had to keep his mask on until he was at the swimming pool.But despite the best efforts of the organisers, Chan said there were moments of concern at the 2021 Fina Diving World Cup.“On competition day, everybody wants to warm up. So that’s when you see a huge cluster of people rushing up to the board to dive, and you see athletes covering their mouths near the tower,” he said.Similarly, on training days, divers from other countries would also try to cut the queue despite regulations limiting the number of people on the diving board, he added.Despite these hiccups, the fact that protocols and regulations were in place to ensure the safety of athletes at the World Cup, which is seen as a dress rehearsal for the Olympics, has left Chan feeling more confident about his personal safety when he returns to Tokyo next month to compete in the men’s 10m platform Olympic event.That is, if the show will go on at all.“I feel assured safety-wise but I’m not assured about whether the Games will go ahead. I read the news and it says that more Japanese citizens are against it taking place. So I don’t know if that will affect the Games,” said Chan.After being postponed by a year, the Tokyo Olympics is now scheduled to take place from Jul 23 to Aug 8 but a cloud continues to hang over the Games, seen as the pinnacle of sporting events.Calls have mounted in recent months for the Olympics to be cancelled, as Japan battles its fourth wave of the coronavirus.Amid the health concerns and looming uncertainty over the Games, Team Singapore (TeamSG) athletes are hoping that it will proceed as planned.“We can’t worry about what we can’t control. What we can do is to prepare to the fullest and be the best version of (ourselves),” said national swimmer and Olympic gold medallist Joseph Schooling.Over 11,000 athletes from more than 200 countries and territories are expected to converge in Tokyo, which is currently under a state of emergency.Observers worry that the Games, long seen as a celebration of humanity, could turn into a COVID-19 super-spreader event with devastating effects on the international community instead.Fears over risks to public safety and strains on an overwhelmed healthcare system have led to a growing number of Japanese citizens calling for the Games’ cancellation. It also does not help that a mere 2.7 per cent of the Japanese population has been fully vaccinated.Top officials from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have declared that the Games will go on, insisting that the event will be safe for the athletes and the wider community. On top of barring spectators from the event, the IOC has also released a “playbook” of protocols for athletes and officials to follow so that they will remain COVID-19-free during the Games.These protocols, which will be updated again this month, stipulate that athletes must test negative for COVID-19 before and after arriving in Japan, and be quarantined for at least three days upon arrival. Athletes must also have their masks on at all times, and rooms will be ventilated every half an hour.However, these have done little to convince observers — and the Japanese public — of the event’s safety.In an opinion piece for the New England Journal of Medicine on May 25, health experts warned that the IOC’s decision to proceed with the Games is “not informed by the best scientific evidence”.They said that the regulations detailed in the IOC’s playbook do not distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes or recognise the limitations of the measures, such as temperature screening and face coverings.Instead, the IOC should consider the number of infected people, the degree of ventilation in spaces and the type of activity and level of aerosols it generates when planning its safety protocols, said the experts.While most nations remain committed to participating in the Tokyo Olympics for now, North Korea last month became the first country to pull out of the event, citing the need to protect its athletes from COVID-19.In Singapore, 16 athletes have qualified to compete at the Tokyo Olympics, with the final size of the contingent to be finalised closer to the Games once qualification processes for other athletes have concluded. Twenty-five athletes took part in the last Games in Rio.With all this uncertainty surrounding the Olympics, is it still safe for the Singapore contingent to go?Singapore’s Foreign Minister Vivian Balakrishnan said in an interview on May 27 with American media outlet CNN that as of now, the Republic is prepared to send a delegation to the Games.“We will take all the necessary precautions, and obviously, in the case of the Singapore delegation, you know that we will be vaccinated as well,” he said.“In addition to that, we will take all the other necessary precautions. Mask wearing, social distancing, and all the measures you have to take to make sure you are not in high-risk environments.”Dr Balakrishnan added that the Government would “see what the situation is like closer to the date” and expressed confidence in the Japanese government’s efforts to make the Games safe.On the same day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong expressed his well wishes for the Singapore contingent.Writing on Facebook, Mr Lee noted that the country’s sporting community is “one of the groups hard hit by the pandemic”. “Despite the disruptions, (the athletes) have been training hard and making sacrifices, including deferring their studies,” he said.In response to TODAY’s queries, the Singapore National Olympic Council (SNOC), which coordinates the selection of Singapore athletes for competition at major games, said that each National Olympic Committee is obliged to participate in the Games by sending athletes.To this end, SNOC reiterated its commitment to the Olympic Movement, which aims to contribute to building a peaceful and better world by educating youth through sport practised in accordance with Olympism and its values.With fewer than 50 days to go before the sporting extravaganza begins, Singapore’s Olympians are preparing for the first-ever Olympics to be held amid an unprecedented global pandemic.The 10 athletes interviewed said that they are undeterred by safety concerns, and have adapted their training in the face of multiple challenges brought about by COVID-19.But while athletes and members of the sporting fraternity alike said that they are assured of the precautions taken by the Singapore authorities, they recognise that TeamSG’s safety will also depend on external factors, including efforts by the host country and other nations, as well as the nature of the virus itself.TURNING NEGATIVES INTO POSITIVESFor athletes who have spent their entire sporting careers training around the four-year Olympic cycle, last year’s postponement of the Games was too much to bear for some.Among the casualties were badminton legend Lin Dan of China and New Zealand rider and Olympian Eddie Dawkins. They cited their lack of physical fitness and lack of certainty over the Olympics going on as reasons to call time on their career.One Singaporean athlete said she had come close to doing so too.National diver Freida Lim, who is awaiting confirmation of her Olympic berth, said that the postponement almost led to her calling it quits.The 23-year-old had planned to retire after participating in the Tokyo Olympics, but when it was postponed, the long break from training made her feel she was “done with diving”. She eventually changed her mind after deciding that she did not want to have any regrets.Other TeamSG athletes said that they had turned the one-year postponement to their advantage as it gave them more time to prepare for the Games.For Schooling, the extra year gave him time to become physically and mentally stronger.Singapore’s sole Olympic gold medallist said that even though the pools were shut when he returned to Singapore from the United States just before the circuit breaker in April last year, he continued training on land. He also focused on his conditioning and technique work amid the lack of competition practice.“The positives that came out of my time during the circuit breaker gave me a lot of time to think of what I can do to try and get even better. Just because we can’t do the things that we normally do during these strange times, it doesn’t mean that we can’t get better when we return,” said the 26-year-old.Similarly, for sailors Kimberly Lim and Cecilia Low, the one-year break was a “much-needed breather”.Lim, 25, took the time to improve her body strength and conditioning, and improve her mental skills preparation. She also analysed past regattas and worked on improving her knowledge of sailing rules.Her teammate Low, 30, took the opportunity to refresh her mind and work on her range and power.Nevertheless, some of the athletes said they were affected by the lack of international competitions.National shuttler Loh Kean Yew, 24, who will be making his debut at the Olympics, said that the cancellation of most tournaments “dampened (his) spirits somewhat”.These tournaments usually serve as an avenue for him to play against top players in the world and raise his game, said Loh, who is currently ranked 42 in the world.For those who have been able to resume competing internationally, such as Chan, the mandatory stay-home notice period after returning to Singapore has also been disruptive to training.The enforced break means that it takes longer for divers to train and become competition-ready again, said Chan.But when asked how much this would affect his training and subsequent performance at the Olympics, Chan said that he had been through worse situations, such as when he was serving his National Service and had only a day or two to prepare for competitions after booking out.Moreover, the Singapore Swimming Association, the governing body for the sport here, has also supplied athletes in quarantine with weights and mats so that they can continue their training even during quarantine, said Chan.For national rower Joan Poh, who is also a nurse at Tan Tock Seng Hospital, having to juggle her training on top of her career disrupted her training during the circuit breaker period in April last year.“When I go on call, I get woken up in the middle of the night to answer patients’ calls. This disrupts my rest and preparation,” said the 30-year-old, who has been on leave from work since March this year to focus on her Olympics preparation.SAFETY CONCERNSWhile every Olympic Games has its own set of challenges, from the terrorist attack at the 1972 Munich Games to the Zika virus in the 2016 Rio Games, the Tokyo edition this year will be “uncharted territory” with many more unknowns than before, said members of the sporting fraternity.Unlike previous threats, the current one involves an “invisible enemy” with implications for the international community on a far greater scale. Former Olympians and members of the sporting fraternity had mixed views on how safe the Tokyo Olympics would be, and whether it is wise to send a Singapore delegation to the event.At the same time, they concurred that the authorities here will put the health and safety of TeamSG athletes ahead of everything else if the Games proceeds as planned.Oon Jin Teik, the former chief executive officer of Sport Singapore (SportSG), the national sports governing body, called on the IOC and Tokyo Organising Committee to do an open, comprehensive and transparent risk assessment of the Games.Such as assessment would assess various aspects of holding the Games, such as the economic impact of hosting the event, the adequacy of Japan’s national healthcare system to manage a COVID-19 outbreak during this period, and the public relations fallout if the virus overshadows the athletes’ performances, said Mr Oon.Mr Oon had publicly called for the postponement of the Games last year, based on his personal experience co-chairing the first Asian Youth Games in Singapore in 2009.He said that it had been “incredibly difficult and challenging” to run the event during the H1N1 influenza pandemic at that time.“We already had the Tamiflu vaccine, but to run the Games, it was very, very difficult. Fortunately, it was a small Games and the Ministry of Health was completely supportive. So we had the confidence to do a small trial before the Youth Olympic Games in 2010,” recounted Mr Oon, who is also a former national swimmer and Olympian.However, the Olympics in Tokyo would be on a far larger scale featuring more athletes, events, and stakeholders including volunteers, he pointed out.Even if the Japanese authorities and the IOC were to have all protocols in place, the safety of the event could still be compromised by external factors, said other observers.It will be impossible to avoid contact with athletes from other nations during the actual sporting event despite efforts to segregate them, said former national fencer Nicholas Fang.While TeamSG athletes have been fully vaccinated, the virus can still breach the vaccines, added Mr Fang.Currently, the IOC does not require athletes at the Olympics to be vaccinated. Nevertheless, Singapore has prioritised Tokyo-bound athletes for vaccination.To date, about 70 confirmed athletes, coaches and officials from Singapore headed to the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics, which takes place from Aug 24 to Sep 5, have been vaccinated except for those with medical reasons. Overseas-based athletes will also be vaccinated before the upcoming Games.However, the sporting fraternity acknowledged that it would be a huge blow to the Singapore delegation if the Games were cancelled or if the delegation had to pull out.Mr Fang said that any of the two scenarios would have a “devastating impact” on TeamSG, given that many of these athletes have put on hold their education, career or family plans for an opportunity to participate in the Olympics.On the other hand, Mr Fang also pointed out that in terms of “hard implications”, Singapore athletes do not stand to lose as much as some of their counterparts from other countries where sport is professionalised.In these countries, missing out on an opportunity in the Olympics would have greater implications on athletes including on their sponsorship deals.Dr Benedict Tan, Singapore’s Chef de Mission for the Tokyo Olympics, said in response to queries that the support team behind the athletes has taken “great pains” to ensure that COVID-19 does not scuttle the athletes’ training, qualification, and performance on the Olympic stage.“We have been preparing for these Games for years, like at every other major Games, assessing and anticipating all risks and ensuring that we have the right measures and precautions in place to manage them,” he said.SNOC said preparations for the Tokyo Games have been in the works for many years, and that it has worked with stakeholders to ensure that “all grounds (are) covered”.The council explained that risk assessments are carried out prior to any major Games and that it works with many stakeholders, such as government agencies, National Sports Associations (NSAs) and the Singapore foreign mission in the host country, to prepare measures that ensure the health and safety of the contingent.The council added that the Singapore contingent is also committed to abiding and adhering to guidelines set out in the IOC’s playbooks to ensure a safe and successful outing for TeamSG.NSAs approached said that they would respect the decision of their athletes if they choose to give the Games a miss out of health concerns.Fencing Singapore, which will see two of its members competing in the Olympics for the first time, said that it has yet to receive any feedback from its members on going to Tokyo but will address any concerns that arise.The association is also stressing good personal hygiene practices, and increased sanitation of equipment to its members, on top of frequent reminders to them to keep healthy.The Singapore Shooting Association said that since last week, its Tokyo-bound athlete Adele Tan and her coach Song Haiping have been staying at the Singapore Sports School in a training camp bubble for a three-week stint to minimise her exposure to the virus before the Games.The two sporting associations which have produced Olympic medallists in recent times — the Singapore Table Tennis Association (STTA) and Singapore Swimming Association — did not respond to queries from TODAY.Athletes from the STTA were also not authorised to speak to the media without the consent of their association.KEEPING THE DREAM ALIVEMr Mark Chay, a former swimming Olympian and chairman of the SNOC’s Athletes’ Commission, said that in his discussions with athletes here, it was clear that they wanted to participate in the Games if given the opportunity, despite the present circumstances.“They know it’s not like any other Olympic Games where you can walk freely into the city … Athletes are there to compete and celebrate humanity and inspire the world through their performances,” said Mr Chay, who is also a Nominated Member of Parliament.Likewise, TeamSG athletes, many of whom will be making their debut at the Games, said that despite their safety concerns, they wish to fulfil their dream of taking part in the Olympics, no matter how subdued this year’s event may be.Being vaccinated and having observed safe practices in other international events so far have also given them greater confidence.While some expressed worry that the Games could get cancelled, they are doing their best to focus on their training for now.Schooling, who will be aiming to retain his Gold medal in the men’s 100m butterfly swimming event, said that he is wholly focused on his Olympic mission.“I continue to train and prepare for the Olympics and continue to hit the targets that've been set for me,” he said.Likewise for sailor Low, who acknowledged that although this Olympics will be different from past Games, “competing with the best of the best has always been a dream”.For national fencer Amita Berthier, 21, who will be debuting at the Olympics, the excitement of participating in the Games overtakes any fear she may have.Berthier, who is currently training in the US, added that being vaccinated “eases the mind a little” and she will trust the protocols in place.It will take “serious paranoia” for an athlete to forgo his or her Olympic dream, said Lim, who is on track to be Singapore’s first female diver at the Olympics.Some athletes said they are going above and beyond safety protocols to make sure they stay COVID-19-free and on track for the Games.National rower Poh said that she is not afraid to look silly in front of athletes from other nations when taking precautions at international competitions.She and her team manager disinfect the seats of buses that bring athletes from their hotel to the event location, and wipe down the tables of dining areas even though they have already been cleaned by the organisers.“We know it captures attention, but we are focused on what we have to do. The moment you are COVID-19 positive, you are disqualified. So you have to do everything you can (to stay safe).”On top of training in a bubble to prevent being infected by the virus, shooter Tan said that she is also stocking up on disinfectants to bring to the Games.She acknowledged that there are risks involved in going to the Olympics, but the key is to take “a calculated risk” and be extra cautious in one’s hygiene and health measures.WILL SPORTING PERFORMANCE BE COMPROMISED?From Jamaican Usain Bolt smashing the 100m sprint record in the 2008 Beijing Olympics to American swimmer Michael Phelps sweeping 28 medals — the highest for any athlete — over four Olympic Games, the prestigious sporting event is the arena where athletes perform at their peak.But after a year of disrupted training, some members of the sporting fraternity here said that expectations about the athletes’ performances in Tokyo — including that of the Singapore contingent — will have to be lowered.Mr Low Teo Ping, the Chef de Mission for TeamSG at the 2016 Rio Olympics, said that one other consideration apart from safety, when deciding if the Games should go on or if a contingent should be sent there, is whether athletes can perform to their best after the one-year disruption.“If one's expectation (given the pandemic) is that … there is no need (for athletes) to perform to their maximum capability, then I think there’s something fundamentally not correct, because your expectation is that they should be (giving their best),” he said. Agreeing, Mr Chay nevertheless said that he believes that athletes, including the Singapore contingent, are prepared to give their best shot in Tokyo.The postponement of the event has given athletes time to rest and recuperate. They have also been training as far as possible, he added.He acknowledged that the lack of international tournaments may have “blunted” their performances, but athletes have adapted to the situation by simulating competition scenarios.When asked if targets have been lowered for the Singapore athletes in light of the COVID-19 situation, Singapore Sport Institute chief Toh Boon Yi said that SportSG is “largely optimistic and confident” that the Singapore contingent will put on a strong performance at the Olympics.The institute, which comes under SportSG, supports high performing athletes in Singapore.He noted that Singapore has qualified for the diving and fencing events for the very first time, and gymnastics for the second time ever. “This certainly sets a positive momentum leading up to the Games,” said Mr Toh.TeamSG athletes, too, said that their performance expectations have not changed despite the Olympics’ postponement. Many have found ways to continue training with the same rigour and are out to perform their best at the Games.National fencer Berthier said that her goals are set independent of the pandemic, and she has seen minimal disruption to her training in the US.National shuttler Loh said COVID-19 or not, he is still aiming for a medal, even though he may not be one of the favourites at the Games.The Singapore Shooting Association said that it has no other targets for its athletes, except for them to give their best during the Games.National diver Chan reiterated that he is not cutting himself any slack as he has been training as hard as he did during pre-COVID-19 days.“We’ve always had disruptions in training, like school or National Service. So I’m quite used to such disruptions. My expectations are more or less the same,” he said.‘A CELEBRATION OF THE HUMAN SPIRIT’With all the changes to the Olympics, questions have arisen over whether it is an Olympics in name alone.The IOC has said that while athletes will stay at the Olympic Village, physical interactions between them, such as hugging or high-fives will not be allowed.Unlike previous occasions where athletes could stay at the Village for the duration of the Games, they will now have to leave after their competitions conclude.With the Olympic Village deprived of its usual celebratory pomp, Mr Oon questioned if it will be the Olympics as we know it.But with the pandemic showing no signs of ending, Mr Chay believes it is time for the Olympics, and sports in general, to evolve with the times.“If not, we’ll be sitting on our hands for the next few years until it’s safe,” he said.With all the negativity surrounding the pandemic in the last year, it was also time for some positivity, he added.“We need something to celebrate about and that is the whole reason for the Olympics – to celebrate the human spirit and performance of our athletes.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

52,The rise of mental health awareness – and the stigma that remains attached to certain conditions,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-stigma-conditions-depression-14903772,05 Jun 2021 06:01AM,"SINGAPORE: It’s been five years since Sabrina Ooi, 30, attempted suicide - and two since she penned a blog post discussing her attempt.  The blog post, published on October 9, 2019 - one day before World Mental Health Day on October 10 - was the first time Sabrina publicly shared about that dark period in her life.Since that fateful day in 2016, suicide has been decriminalised in Singapore after the committee reviewing the Penal Code acknowledged that treatment, rather than prosecution, was the appropriate response to people who feel they have no choice but to take their own lives. Sabrina has also co-founded a mental health community, Calm Collective Asia, with two friends during the “circuit breaker” period. While she’s been called an advocate for mental health, she prefers the term: “Mental health expert by experience”. “I think this advocacy thing just happened because I’m in my personal journey of processing what I’ve gone through and wanting to help others going through something similar,” she told CNA over the phone.  Occasionally, being open about her anxiety and depression has even led to strangers pouring out their stories to her on social media. “Whenever I share, I go through a vulnerability hangover. It can be really tiring, but I know that sharing my story is helpful, both to others and for myself in getting clarity about my own story,” she said. But Sabrina noted that this candour about anxiety and depression doesn’t always extend to another mental health condition she lives with: Bipolar disorder. This condition causes extreme and unusual shifts in mood, energy, concentration, and activity levels that affect one’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks. “While I've been open with talking about anxiety and depression, I'm still very careful about the term ‘bipolar disorder’ because people tend to freak out and make their own assumptions about the condition,” she said. “I've had friends completely wash their hands of me. They decided they didn’t really understand it and couldn’t support me in this part of my journey.”Like Sabrina, 30-year-old Syazwan Rahmad, who is also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is no stranger to a fear of judgement. This partly stems from his own “shock” when he got the unexpected diagnosis recently, he explained, as he thought he only had depression. “I don’t want people to think that I’m crazy. I’m scared they don’t want to be around me because I have a disorder. Till today, I have this thought in my head,” he told CNA. Syazwan has since disclosed his condition to family, close friends and even to the public in a CNA Insider story that tracked the economic impact of COVID-19 on his dance career. But he admitted that he still struggles with criticism. “About 20 per cent respond with negative comments about my career and me as a Muslim (when I talk about my mental health). But ultimately, I’m so open because I want people to know it’s okay not to be okay. Be true to who you are and that’s where healing will start,” he said. SOME CONDITIONS HARDER TO DISCUSSThe COVID-19 pandemic revealed a need for more mental health support, with an increase in people calling in to mental health helplines. Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore saw an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019.Likewise, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) received an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020. Yet, despite more people seeking help for their mental health over the past year, and the increasing awareness around conditions like anxiety or depression, other conditions remain difficult to disclose, said seven individuals who spoke to CNA. Some of these conditions are bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia. The traits of people with BPD include a feeling of emptiness, fear of abandonment, intense anger and irritability, unstable emotion, idealising and devaluing people, possible psychosis when stressed, and even binge eating, said Dr Roger Ho, an associate professor and senior consultant at the Department of Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore. He added that there is also the possibility of physical self-harm among those with BPD, which is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD). “Another symptom we pick up is they will cut themselves. In the emergency department, when you see someone with a lot of scars on their forearm, the patient might have BPD,” he said. “But society doesn't know much about BPD; they think it’s just depression. The self-laceration is a very unique sign. When you ask someone with BPD why they cut themselves, they usually don't say they want to end their life. They want to experience the emotional pain they’ve had in the past.”Dr Ho, however, reinforced that while some people might possess the traits of BPD, having a personality disorder is more than just checking off these traits.“Having a personality disorder means that the traits become so strong that the person has interpersonal problems. These problems affect their life, whether it’s family, work or study,” he said.  Similarly, the stigma attached to schizophrenia - a psychotic disorder - prevails in Singapore. According to a 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on May 21, about one-third of the population who have been diagnosed with psychotic disorders had a diagnosis of schizophrenia at some point in their lives. This makes schizophrenia the most common psychotic disorder here. The results were part of the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among those living in Singapore aged 18 and above, their associated factors, and the treatment gap of the disorders. Despite the prevalence of schizophrenia, public understanding is lacking, with people with the condition being perceived as “dangerous or as individuals incapable of managing themselves”, said Ms Lim Lay Keow, a senior case manager at the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme at the Department of Psychosis in IMH. “Schizophrenia is still sensationalised by the media. The accessibility to smart phones allow for photo or video taking of a person in distress, subjecting them to be judged online.”This behaviour, Ms Lim noted, doesn’t just make it difficult for those with schizophrenia to disclose their condition for fear of discrimination. It also results in self-stigmatisation, where the person with schizophrenia finds it difficult to “differentiate themselves from the condition”. The deeply entrenched stereotypes about schizophrenia also make it harder for the public to understand that schizophrenia is “not a personality flaw but a disease of the brain”, she added. YOUTH MORE CANDID, BUT STIGMA REMAINSEven before the pandemic last year, younger people were increasingly open about their mental health on social media, with some talking about therapy sessions or situations where their mental health conditions might flare up.But Ron Yap, who was diagnosed with OCD three years ago, said this conversation doesn’t translate into less stigma for all conditions. “While there has been more conversation for disorders like generalised anxiety disorder and depression, there’s still stigma surrounding more uncommon disorders, like OCD,” the 23-year-old said.“Even though non-sufferers (of anxiety disorders and depression) will never experience the depths of pain and discomfort those conditions cause, they can at least get a rough, if imperfect, idea of what it’s like to suffer, by taking the times in which they experienced anxiety or sadness and amplifying the intensity and duration.” But with OCD, the 23-year-old said, “It’s harder to fathom how and why someone would wash their hands 50 times to the point of breaking their skin, go to the bathroom 20 times before bed or dwell on a distressing thought for a whole day to the point of paralysis.” To a non-sufferer, he added, such behaviour is “simply irrational, and even insane, and this impression hinders one’s ability to empathise with the sufferer”. Ron, who runs the Instagram account @mentalhealthceo, believes misconceptions about OCD don’t help, such as that there’s only one type of OCD “exemplified by someone who obsessively washes their hands or clothes over and over again”.“OCD and its rituals can manifest in countless different forms. I know someone who has to eat their food in a certain order, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to consume the meal at all,” he said. Although a huge part of Ron’s life involves breaking the stigma around mental health, he still hesitates to disclose some of the “more personal symptoms” of OCD to people around him, such as going to the bathroom multiple times. “I sometimes mask it by coming up with stories about why I usually spend so much time in the bathroom or through humour, especially when I don’t feel comfortable talking about my OCD in the moment or if I feel like they wouldn’t understand,” he said. ADDRESSING BLINDSPOTS WITH NUANCEThat said, openness about anxiety or depression doesn’t mean a lack of stigma around these conditions, experts observed. “From what we’ve observed, some of the challenges faced by those living with mental illness include being labelled as ‘attention seeking’ when they talk about their mental illness, or that they’re ‘overreacting’,” said Ms Jasmine Chang, a clinical psychologist at IMH.“Even though there’s awareness around mental illnesses, admitting to having a mental illness is actually a different story.”She added that some of her clients fear that their diagnosis might affect their employment and appraisal, while those serving National Service worry about being negatively evaluated by their peers.With increased awareness about mental health, more nuance is now needed to take people's understanding to the next level, advised clinical psychologist Ms Chang. For example, there is a difference between having a couple of bad days and having prolonged periods of bad days that debilitate you and prevent you from doing anything else.“All of us experience varying levels of sadness and anxiety. While we experience sadness and anxiety in our everyday life, depression and anxiety disorders lead to significant impairment and distress in someone’s life. It affects their ability to go to work, to sleep, and for a sustained period of time,” she said.Public education about the diagnosis would also help, she added.“This involves highlighting to people that mental illnesses can be managed with the right treatment and support, and those living with mental illnesses can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.” Besides managing symptoms, Sabrina, who has depression in addition to bipolar disorder, believes it would be better to look deeper at what causes them. “Usually the triggers stem from your childhood trauma, environmental triggers, and even biological factors. So it’s good that we start talking about anxiety and depression, but we need to take it a step further and understand the root cause,” she said. And while media campaigns like Beyond the Label aim to change public perception around mental health conditions, some said labels actually help them make light of what they go through. Sabrina, for example, doesn’t mind that some mental health conditions are more prominent than others, because it helps her “reshape her perspective” on what she’s going through. “I’ve had people tell me they honestly don’t know what bipolar disorder is. And I realise I have to link it to depression or something more familiar to them for them to understand,” she said. “So at least the increasing awareness of anxiety and depression has helped me talk about my condition.” Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

53,"Commentary: Global economic recovery will be stronger in US, China and connected Asian markets",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/global-economic-recovery-2021-output-expansion-us-china-asia-14919526,04 Jun 2021 06:00AM,"World output will recover but the coming expansion will be unevenly distributed, economist Nouriel Roubini elaborates.NEW YORK CITY: After the most severe global recession in decades, private and official forecasters are increasingly optimistic that world output will recover strongly this year and thereafter.But the coming expansion will be unevenly distributed, both across and within economies.Whether the recovery is V-shaped (a strong return to above-potential growth), U-shaped (a more anemic version of the V), or W-shaped (a double-dip recession) will depend on several factors across different economies and regions.STOP-AND-GO OUTBREAKS AND DEEP SCARRINGWith the coronavirus still running rampant in many countries, one key question is whether the emergence of virulent new strains will trigger repeated stop-and-go cycles, as we’ve seen in some cases where economies re-opened too soon.One particularly ominous possibility is that more vaccine-resistant variants appear, heightening the urgency of vaccination efforts that have so far been too slow in many regions.Beyond the virus, there are a number of related economic risks to consider. A recovery that is slow or insufficiently robust could result in permanent scarring if too many firms go bust and labor markets start exhibiting hysteresis (when long-term unemployment renders workers unemployable owing to an erosion of skills).Another question is how much deleveraging there will be among highly indebted firms (small and large) and households, and whether this effect will be fully offset by the release of pent-up demand as consumers spend down pandemic-era savings.SOCIOECONOMIC CONCERNSAnother area of concern is socio-political: Will rising inequality become an even more salient source of instability and depressed aggregate demand?Much will depend on the scale, scope, and inclusiveness of policies to support the income and spending of those left behind.Likewise, it remains to be seen if the macro-policy stimulus (monetary, credit, and fiscal) implemented so far will be sufficient, insufficient, or actually excessive, leading to sharply rising inflation and inflation expectations in some cases.STRONGER RECOVERIES IN US, CHINA AND ASIAN MARKETSKeeping all of these uncertainties in mind, the recovery currently looks like it will be stronger in the United States, China, and the Asian emerging markets that are part of Chinese global supply chains.In the US, a decline in new infections, high vaccination rates, increased consumer and business confidence, and the far-reaching effects of fiscal and monetary expansion will drive a robust recovery this year.Here, the main risk is overheating. The recent increase in inflation could turn out to be more persistent than the US Federal Reserve expected, and today’s frothy financial markets could undergo a correction, thereby weakening confidence.In China and the economies closely linked to it, the recovery owes much of its strength to the authorities’ success in containing the virus early, and to the effects of macro stimulus, all of which allowed for a rapid re-opening and restoration of business confidence.But high levels of debt and leverage in some parts of the Chinese private and public sectors will pose risks as China tries to maintain stronger growth while reining in excessive credit.More broadly, the prospect of an escalating rivalry – a colder war – between the US and China will threaten Chinese and global growth, particularly if it leads to a fuller economic decoupling and renewed protectionism.WEAK RECOVERY IN EUROPEEurope is worse off, having suffered a double-dip recession in the last quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, owing to a new wave of infections and lockdowns.Its recovery will remain weak through the second quarter, but growth could accelerate in the second half of the year if vaccination rates continue to rise and macro policy remains accommodative.But phasing out furlough schemes and various credit guarantees too early could cause more permanent scarring and hysteresis.Moreover, without long-needed structural reforms, parts of the eurozone will continue to register low potential growth and high public debt ratios.As long as the European Central Bank keeps buying assets, sovereign spreads (namely, the difference between German and Italian bond yields) may remain low.But monetary support eventually will need to be phased out, and deficits will need to be reduced. And the spectre of populist Euroskeptic parties looking to exploit the crisis will constantly loom.SLOWER RECOVERY IN JAPANJapan, too, has had a much slower restart. Following a lockdown to control a new wave of infections, it experienced negative growth in the first quarter of this year and is now struggling to keep the summer Olympic Games in Tokyo on track.Japan, too, is in desperate need of structural reforms to increase potential growth and allow for an eventual fiscal consolidation. And its massive public debt may eventually become unsustainable, notwithstanding persistent monetisation by the Bank of Japan.FRAGILE OUTLOOK FOR DEVELOPING ECONOMIESFinally, the outlook is more fragile for many emerging and developing economies, where high population density, weaker healthcare systems, and lower vaccination rates will continue to allow the virus to spread.In many of these countries, business and consumer sentiment is depressed; incomes from tourism and remittances have dried up; debt ratios are already high and possibly unsustainable; and financial conditions are tight, owing to higher borrowing costs and weaker currencies.Moreover, there is only limited space for policy easing, and in some cases policy credibility could be undermined by populist politics.Among the more troubled economies to watch are India, Russia, Turkey, Brazil, South Africa, many parts of Sub-Saharan Africa, and the more fragile, oil-importing parts of the Middle East.Many countries are experiencing a depression, not a recession. More than 200 million people are at risk of falling back into extreme poverty.Compounding these inequities, the countries that are most vulnerable to hunger and disease also tend to face the greatest threat from climate change, and thus will remain potential sources of instability.While overall confidence is recovering, some financial markets are irrationally exuberant, and there is much underlying risk and uncertainty. The COVID-19 crisis likely will lead to an increase in inequality within and across countries. The more that vulnerable cohorts are left behind, the greater the risk of social, political, and geopolitical instability in the future.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit.

54,SG Nasi Lemak Telegram chat group administrator sentenced to mandatory treatment,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sg-nasi-lemak-telegram-leonard-teo-treatment-order-14937948,03 Jun 2021 11:05AM,"SINGAPORE: An administrator behind obscene Telegram chat group SG Nasi Lemak was sentenced on Thursday (Jun 3) to mandatory treatment for a year for major depressive disorder.Leonard Teo Min Xuan, 27, is the last of four people to be sentenced over the chat group, which had more than 44,000 members at its peak accessing sexually explicit materials.Teo pleaded guilty to transmitting obscene objects by sending nude photos to the chat group and possessing 427 obscene images. A third charge of possessing 99 obscene videos was considered in sentencing.The court heard that the chat group was created in November 2018. As the group grew, 29 of its members were given administrator rights.Members of the group discussed sexual matters, circulated obscene materials and promoted vice activities, said the prosecutor.In order to remain in the group, members had to stay active by uploading and sharing pornographic material. Teo did so in October 2019 to keep his account active.Between Mar 15 and Oct 3, 2019, the police received 31 reports against SG Nasi Lemak. They later identified four suspects believed to be administrators or users of the group, including Teo, and arrested them.Teo later admitted being an administrator and police seized his devices. Defence lawyer Ashwin Ganapathy asked for a mandatory treatment order suitability report. Teo was assessed to be suitable for it, and the prosecutor did not object.The Institute of Mental Health report clearly stated that his major depressive disorder contributed to the offences, and his judgment was impaired, said Mr Ganapathy. A mandatory treatment order directs an offender suffering from certain treatable psychiatric conditions to undergo psychiatric treatment.For each charge of transmitting and possessing obscene objects, Teo could have been jailed for up to three months, fined, or both.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

56,Commentary: Tennis star Naomi Osaka showed us athletes are not commodities,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/naomi-osaka-tennis-french-open-quit-media-anxiety-depression-14932088,03 Jun 2021 06:05AM,"Taking a hard line with elite athletes – that they are contractually bound to show up before the media - can backfire when there is anxiety among the best performers, says a psychologist.QUEENSLAND: Japanese tennis star Naomi Osaka took a stand this week that called attention to the mental health of professional athletes. She refused to conduct interviews with the media after her matches at the French Open, citing concerns over her own mental well-being.And, in return, the tennis authorities fined her and threatened her with further action before she ultimately pulled out of the tournament.There are two sides to this story. On the one hand, this is part of the contract, it’s part of the deal. Tennis players get paid millions of dollars and in return they have to do media interviews whether they win or lose.The issue is when you have somebody like Osaka, who is by her own admission an introverted person with high social anxiety. She essentially hates doing this stuff but knows she has to.If there was ever a public cry for help, this is it. She’s talked about suffering bouts of depression since she won the US Open in 2018, how she wears headphones to try to cope with her social anxiety to stay in her own little bubble.She knew that if she lost at the French Open again, there would be a forensic examination of her inability to win on clay that would just reinforce her own self-doubt. So, she decided not put herself through that.I find it disappointing that the sport has adopted the stance it has. The authorities have basically taken a hard line with her — you’re contracted to do this, and you have to do it or risk further fines and possible disqualification.TENNIS HAS BEEN HERE BEFOREDuring the 11 years in which I worked in professional tennis, I was asked to be on a commission that looked at the potential threat to the well-being and mental health of players from turning professional at too young an age.This was in the era when 13- and 14-year-olds like Jennifer Capriati and Tracy Austin were playing in Grand Slams and struggling to cope with the pressures.And the tennis authorities took the mental health of these players so seriously, they established the age eligibility commission with experts from all around the world to meet at Wimbledon for four days to discuss what could be done.They made very fundamental changes to the rules — dictating how many tournaments a player can enter at a certain age — and it proved to be to the enduring benefit of the players.Osaka is asking for a very simple thing in comparison: Can we just review the rules around the interviews that players are contracted to do?Players who have just come off the court after often crushing and demoralising defeats are required within 30 minutes to front up to the media. There’s a sense of voyeurism around how it presently works; perhaps some want to see athletes crumble and break down into tears, having put them on a pedestal.Some athletes are viewed by the public as spoiled and overpaid, but this is an unfair assessment of Osaka. She is a young, introverted, anxious person. We should by now understand that sports stars are not super human, that they have the same doubts and mental health issues as everyone else.But given the reaction Osaka has received from some quarters, this appears not to be the case.DEALING WITH DEPRESSION IN THE SPOTLIGHTSerena Williams expressed in an interview that not everyone relishes the attention of being famous:“Not everyone is the same. I’m thick. Other people are thin […] You just have to let her handle it the way she wants to.”When it comes to the media, some players just don’t think so well on their feet. They’re used to hitting a ball very well, they’re not necessarily great wordsmiths.Some players get very frustrated being asked the same question they’ve already answered many times before. Or questions that are sufficiently intrusive about their own mental approach to the game to challenge their self-confidence.When your natural personality type is such that you’re an introvert and prone to anxiety, it’s an additional challenge when you reach a high point very early in your career. It involves a massive learning curve.For Osaka, there is also the greater issue of struggling with depression, which she alluded to in her statement.The last thing you want when you’re dealing with depression is to be in the spotlight. You want to be with the people who love you unconditionally and with whom you can share your feelings and not be judged. You may need professional support.The media don’t meet those criteria. So trying to deal with serious mental health issues in the glare of publicity is next to impossible.All of this is heaping more and more demands on Osaka. There are considerable forces pushing her toward even greater levels of anxiety. Could you imagine the level of expectations on her at the Tokyo Olympics?We are talking about the mental health of young athletes more now than we used to. It’s true, sports stars are privileged elites, but the prevalence of mental health issues in sports, especially anxiety, is approximately the same as it is in society. And across their careers, between a quarter and a third will have some mental health issue, whether it becomes public or not.We should understand that we can’t treat young vulnerable people as commodities, telling them to just follow the rules and not to express their concerns.What Osaka wants is a dialogue around a small change to how tennis players interact with the media. The tennis authorities will likely agree to that now she has taken a stand, but sadly, it may have come at an enormous cost to her.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit.

57,Commentary: Advanced economies must not drag feet in global vaccination effort,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/vaccinations-vaccine-covax-millions-countries-donate-doses-14903884,02 Jun 2021 06:07AM,"Billions in developing countries remain unprotected, but advanced economies can do more to share vaccines more equitably, says Mohamed A El-Erian.CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts: The proper functioning of any interconnected economic system depends on trust.And a global system that has been designed by advanced economies requires a significant level of buy-in from the developing world. Both become even more important as more developing economies, led by China, gain systemic importance.With the world trying to recover from the massive economic shock brought by COVID-19, the mishandling of the global vaccine rollout has weakened trust in the international system that emerged after World War II.Combined with memories of the 2008 global financial crisis, which originated in the advanced economies, today’s failures are reinforcing suspicions among some countries that the international order may no longer be fit for purpose.The West, in particular, must take these concerns seriously. With no other multilateral system to replace the current one, the only alternative is a scenario of global fragmentation and rising economic, social, and political tensions.BILLIONS REMAIN COMPLETELY UNPROTECTEDAlthough the United Kingdom has been ahead of most other countries in vaccinating its population, its struggle to hold down infections associated with the new B1617 variant from India serves as a timely reminder that no one is safe until everyone is.As former British Prime Minister Gordon Brown notes, whereas “nearly half of US and UK citizens have now received at least one” dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, that figure drops to 11 per cent India. In Sub-Saharan Africa, barely 1 per cent of the population has received a single dose.While country-specific problems have contributed to mismanaged and inefficient vaccine deployment in some developing economies, the real issue has been insufficient supplies.As the United Nations pointed out in March, just “10 rich countries … possess nearly 80 per cent of all COVID-19 vaccines.”That has allowed them to start vaccinating even low-vulnerability segments of their population – including children as young as 12 – while billions of people in the developing world remain totally unprotected.MORE SHARING OF VACCINESThe International Monetary Fund estimates that countries with large vaccine inventories could donate 1 billion doses in 2021 without undermining their domestic vaccination priorities.Moreover, several advanced economies have accumulated massive vaccine surpluses as they plan for a round of boosters in the fall.And insufficient funding for COVAX, the international community’s facility to ensure equitable global access to vaccines, further underscores their hesitancy in helping the rest of the world.But this is not just a moral and ethical failure; it is also a practical one. According to IMF research, an additional US$50 billion in funding for global vaccination efforts would yield US$9 trillion in economic benefits.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.) RESPONSIBLE CONDUCT OF STEWARDSThe longer the global vaccine rollout stumbles, the greater the long-term damage to an already-stressed international system.Designed nearly 80 years ago, that system is centered on advanced economies that historically have provided key “public goods,” such as a stable international reserve currency (the US dollar) and significant funding for multilateral institutions.In exchange for these contributions, advanced economies have enjoyed enormous privileges, including a de facto veto in matters of global governance, currency seigniorage, and lower everyday funding costs (by serving as a destination for others’ savings).Yet while the postwar international system grants the advanced economies disproportionate influence in global affairs, its credibility and basic functioning ultimately depend on whether its stewards conduct themselves responsibly.The 2008 financial crisis suggested that they had not done so, and the rich world’s prolonged and excessive reliance on a policy mix over-dependent on monetary policy has since compounded the damage to their credibility.A CHALLENGE TO THE EXISTING ORDER?Against this backdrop, the unbalanced, unfair, and inefficient vaccine rollout could strike a huge blow to the system’s long-term viability. That would certainly suit China.With its growing economic power and global reach, it has eagerly been challenging the legitimacy and appeal of the Western-dominated order, which it describes as unreliable and dependent on asymmetrical relations vis-à-vis developing countries.But because one cannot replace something with nothing, the result has been the slow but consistent evolution of a kind of hybrid system. The postwar system remains in place, but its dominance is being gradually eroded by the proliferation of arrangements that bypass its core.Examples include new multilateral institutions (such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank and the New Development Bank), new regional plans (notably China’s Belt and Road Initiative), and new bilateral trade and investment deals.Owing to these developments, the overall operation of the global economy has been weakened, with significant consequences for all. And the longer that vaccination lags in many parts of the developing world, the more pressure vaccinated countries will feel to adopt a bunker mindset.As the international system fragments, the less stable it will become, reducing the prospects for the kind of synchronised global growth needed to enhance individual countries’ performance. Moreover, as trust in the system continues to erode, advanced economies will face additional national-security challenges.Trust is a precious commodity: It is hard to establish, easily eroded, and exceedingly difficult to regain.While far from perfect, the current international order is better than any of the alternatives, and still eminently reformable.

58,Commentary: Do we need to do more to protect our community cats?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/community-cats-cruelty-ang-mo-kio-spca-cases-animal-abuse-14926110,02 Jun 2021 06:06AM,"Animal cruelty has no place in our society and nobody should want to see a sentient being experience unnecessary pain or suffering, says SPCA’s Executive Director.SINGAPORE: There has been a recent spate of violence against community cats in Ang Mo Kio with at least 10 cats found with deep linear slash-type wounds on their bodies. Many in the community are deeply troubled and have voiced their concerns, wanting to see quick action taken to find the suspect.This is unfortunately not the first time Singapore has seen serial cruelty enacted against cats. Some of the past perpetrators have been prosecuted, while other cases involving multiple injured cats remain unsolved.COMMUNITY CATS ARE PART OF OUR ENVIRONMENTThese cats are in our communities through no fault of their own. Many have been abandoned or are descendants of abandoned cats.There are extensive efforts by numerous organisations and countless individuals to humanely manage and reduce the cat population in Singapore. This is done via surgical sterilisation of the cats so they can no longer reproduce and the provision of dedicated care for the animals while they live out their lives.The act of feeding sterilised cats does not increase the cat population. It is thus unfair to blame feeders for the presence of the cats. Many a time, when someone complains, there are also efforts to understand their frustrations through mediation so that a compromise can be reached.We know of many feeders who have moved their feeding sites or adjusted their feeding schedules so as to minimise any potential nuisance.Cats are part of our built-up environment and live comfortably alongside humans. Many dedicated caregivers contribute immensely to their care.We have heard many stories of neighbours coming together to care for the cats, developing lifelong friendships and connections in the process.Affinity or not, we have to learn to co-exist with the animals around us.WE CAN’T ACCEPT ANIMAL CRUELTYAnimal cruelty has no place in our society and nobody should want to see a sentient being experience unnecessary pain or suffering.Of course, even if one thinks that an animal is a nuisance, there is just no excuse for violence. Just as there would be no excuse to commit a crime against a person because they have bothered another.This reason alone should be sufficient to cause us great concern and spur fast and strong action in animal cruelty cases. Thankfully we see many people speaking up when a case makes the news, giving us hope that we have a significant part of our society that rejects animal abuse.If we needed another reason to be concerned, it is that studies have long found a link between animal cruelty and violence towards humans. Leaving animal abuse unpunished and otherwise not dealt with, be it in a treatment or correctional facility, may place the people in a society in danger too.The injuries found on the cats in Ang Mo Kio reflect a determined, intentional, and committed pattern to inflict suffering on the animals. The intentional and cruel nature of the abuse and the hunting of multiple cats to commit the violence is disconcerting.This should thus concern all of us.TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ABUSEThere could be a number of reasons why people commit cruelty to an innocent being, though we have to accept that we might never fully understand the motivations.In some of these cases, human mental illness may play a part. In 2006 and 2007, a serial cat abuser in Bedok who had tortured multiple cats by strangling them was reported to have been diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder. In 2016, a man suffocated and then stabbed his pet dog to death. He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder with depressed mood and given a 12-month mandatory treatment order.In other cases, the person may enjoy control over another being or be taking out their frustrations on an animal that cannot retaliate. Individuals may also displace their aggression from a human to an animal, or use cruelty as a means to threaten someone.In 2020, a man was charged with animal cruelty for killing a kitten during an argument with his wife. He flung the animal against a cupboard and then picked it up and told his wife, “Look at this because of you”. He then flung the animal on the floor and said to his wife, “If I can do this (to the cat), you I don’t care”. He later threw the kitten down the rubbish chute.On social media, we also see cases where people post videos that they think are entertaining, seemingly trying to attract attention and obtain “likes” and “shares”. Last year, a series of videos went viral in which youth were seen abusing frogs.Profit has also driven some to commit horrendous acts of cruelty. “Crush” videos where people are seen literally crushing animals to death surface every now and then. These videos, associated with sexual fetishes, are produced overseas for an underground international market.When it comes to community cats, it is also possible that abuse stems from a dislike or hatred of having these animals around.It is not uncommon for us to hear of cases where community cat caregivers have been verbally abused by individuals who have asked them to stop feeding the cats. In some of these cases, the individuals have threatened to hurt the cats if the feeding doesn’t stop.WE NEED TO DO BETTERRegardless of the reason for the abuse, animals rely on us to be their voices and advocates and this places a heavy responsibility on our shoulders.Cruelty cases need to be solved faster so that more animals are not harmed. In the 2006 and 2007 Bedok case mentioned above, the community mobilised in a big way and it was through their efforts of patrols and constant monitoring that the case was solved and the perpetrator brought to justice.Today, with a wide CCTV network and other tools available to enforcement agencies, such cases should be solved much more quickly, similar to how fast many other cases involving crimes against humans are solved.If this means we need to put more resources towards animal cruelty investigations, such as more manpower or the use of technology and forensics, then this should be done.  The cats in Ang Mo Kio and the other animals in our midst deserve better.Dr Jaipal Singh Gill is Executive Director of SPCA in Singapore.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

60,Commentary: Hawkers and food delivery riders deserve more appreciation,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hawkers-food-delivery-riders-rude-kindness-tips-risk-covid-19-14919710,01 Jun 2021 06:07AM,"Now, more than ever, when they are faced with more uncertainty and lower incomes, our gestures and tips can be a meaningful and impactful way to say thank you, says Singapore Kindness Movement’s William Wan.SINGAPORE: We are in the middle of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), and the headlines aren’t good.The bigger economic picture can feel like a bunch of alienating figures and graphs. But the impact has cut deep.To truly see the economic impact of COVID-19 first-hand, take a look at our hawker and the food delivery sectors.Barely recovering from last year, these sectors are struggling to survive, especially since new restrictive measures such as no dining-in and a return to work-from-home were announced in mid-May and will be in place until Jun 13 at the minimum.Over the past three weeks, we have all had to swap eating out for takeaways and food delivery orders.We know we must eliminate those public health risks when eating in close proximity have been singled out as high-risk settings, with coffeeshops and eateries identified as places visited by COVID-19 cases during their infectious period.FEARS OF SHUTTERING FOR GOODThe Government has announced a one-month rental relief for hawkers, with cleaning subsidies to be dispensed to help 6,000 hawkers tide over this period. That will help alleviate some fears and anxieties.But this only papers over the challenges of low footfall. Some hawkers have adapted, turning to technology, but others are in danger of shuttering for good. Non-tech savvy stallholders can only watch helplessly as their businesses plunge, some as high as by 70 per cent.  How painful it must be for these hawkers, who have been in business for decades to envisage giving up their life’s work.For those who have pivoted to digitalise, many still see lower earnings especially eateries not near residential estates.78-year-old Lee Ah Meng isn’t giving up without a fight. He has been selling his handmade sweet potato ondeh ondeh and tapioca kueh at Hong Lim Market & Food Centre for 21 years. In normal times, he sells everything by noon. Not anymore.When an 8Days reporter recently asked him what he would do with his unsold boxes of kueh, he replied stoically: “Never mind lah. I’ll take them to the old folks’ home later.”WORKING AND BRAVING THE RISKSUnlike many of us, those in F&B and food delivery can’t work from home. They have to brave the elements and COVID-19 risks to feed our nation.A delivery driver, Jarrold Tham, recently admitted to the media that he is afraid to work with the recent rise in daily cases. He fears for his wife especially because they are planning for a family.Mr Tham also said that right now, he hardly makes S$100 a week from deliveries as compared to the S$70 to S$100 per day at his peak last year.Even though online orders have increased, some delivery riders like him have not seen an increase in income, when private-hire drivers are picking up food deliveries to supplement a drop in their earnings.  Just as we recognise that our bus, MRT and taxi drivers are more exposed to the heightened risks of the pandemic but continue to do their jobs, we should also remember the grit and sacrifices of our hawkers and food delivery riders.One year since the pandemic, why do users, riders and restaurants alike still have complaints about food delivery apps? A business professor and a ride-hailing app founder weigh in on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast: SNUBS BY UNKIND EATERY STAFF AND CUSTOMERSActor-comedian Hossan Leong appealed on a recent Facebook post for Singaporeans to be “kind and thoughtful” to food delivery riders. He shared the experience of a rider, Jerry Toh, who was snubbed by both restaurant staff and the people he delivered the food to.Mr Toh shared how restaurant staff would treat walk-ins better than delivery riders, how they have to wait, sometimes for an hour without any explanation, and how they would get shouted at when they check in on their orders.  Mr Toh isn’t the only one. I have heard of customers shouting at delivery riders when they bring their food late or get the orders wrong, yet delivery riders aren’t the only ones responsible for sometimes messing it up.The same goes for hawker stall operators too. I have seen people at hawker centres who have lost their cool at stall operators waiting at a long queue.With a surge in take-aways, F&B establishments can sometimes also contribute to delays and oversights. We also know that sometimes food delivery platforms can inadvertently get it wrong and schedule orders despite eateries being closed, so fault-finding and finger-pointing can be a fruitless exercise.A LITTLE KINDNESS GOES A LONG WAYSingapore has gotten together to help elderly hawkers go online. There are Facebook groups like Hawkers United - Dabao 2020, and Can Eat! Hawker Food. On Instagram, where our millennials live, there are accounts like @wheretodapao and @savetheelderlyhawkers that help boost hawkers’ businesses.Those who cannot pivot have their champions too. Makansutra founder KF Seetoh recently called on his followers on Facebook to help these “silent sufferers”.  He has done much to call attention to their plight.Other kind-hearted folks include everyday Singaporeans like Kate Yeo and her family who reportedly bought extra food to bless the residents of a halfway house while supporting hawkers.Equally important is our attitude. It does not cost us anything to be patient and to thank them for their hard work. Most of us thank our doctors, for instance. Why not our hawkers and food deliverers?  Their service is not less important.Contribute.sg, a ground-up movement supported by the Singapore Kindness Movement, is working with Sengkang Community Club and IllustrateSG to make appreciation cards for food delivery riders in the Sengkang area in June. Children from kindergartens will be invited to colour these appreciation cards, which will be part of an appreciation pack (including surgical masks and UV protection arm sleeves) to show our gratitude to delivery riders.A CULTURE OF TIPPINGIs now a good time to relook our tipping culture in Singapore, for those of us who can afford to?Platforms such as GrabFood already have an in-built option to tip delivery riders for their service. This is a useful option to appreciate their work if you find it awkward to hand over a tip in person.But the tipping culture could be made more pervasive in Singapore. As a society, we have debated over it for years now saying that it may be a step in the right direction to improve customer service, incomes and the participation of local workers in such sectors.COVID-19 is a timely opportunity to build this culture of appreciation for our hawkers and food delivery riders.  More broadly, how we respond to each other in this pandemic is a test of our character as a people.Worried as he is, my friend Alfred George who is a food deliverer puts a positive twist to the work he does. ""My job is not about putting food on my table. It is about putting food on yours.""Let’s show some appreciation for these frontline food heroes of Singapore in turn and extend a little kindness.Dr William Wan is General Secretary of the Singapore Kindness Movement.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

61,Commentary: Why do some bosses still want their workers to come back to the office?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/work-from-home-bosses-covid-19-breaches-office-14902724,31 May 2021 06:01AM,"Eleven companies have been taken to task for insisting their employees come back to the office. Adrian Tan gives his take on what's behind this slew of cases.SINGAPORE: As community cases rose worryingly over the last few weeks, putting the brakes on human movement became important. As a result, schools went into full home-based learning mode. Employers were told to ensure their staff resume work-from-home.Yet, despite having experience of ensuring that all but essential workers stay home, we still saw breaches. The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) inspected more than 530 workplaces over May 8 to 21 and issued fines to 11 companies for breaches of Safe Management Measures (SMMs).All 11 had failed to ensure work-from-home (WFH) was the default arrangement for employees able to do so. They were not the first group of companies to be penalised. Since the start of the pandemic, numerous firms have been fined, warned or told to temporarily cease workplace operations following breaches of COVID-19 measures.Ultimately, these breaches happen because business owners and the management team are still stuck in an industrial-age thinking. BAD HABITS START AT THE TOPSometimes, all it takes is one bad egg. When COVID-19 first broke, the wife of a friend related how almost every department in the local enterprise she worked at decided to go remote, except hers. And because her department was not rendering an essential service, staff were not actually required to head into the office either.But the department head could not stand working at home for a range of reasons and ended up ordering the team to the office. It was tough for employees worried of exposing themselves unnecessarily to the virus – in commuting and congregating in a shared office.  Collective complaints to the human resource department did little at first, then a couple of anonymous calls to the MOM hotline helped change things.What’s going on in the minds of such supervisors? In his 1960 book The Human Side of Enterprise, American social psychologist Douglas McGregor proposed his famous X-Y people management theory.McGregor's X-Y theory is a salutary and simple reminder of the natural rules for managing people, which under the pressure of day-to-day business are all too easily forgotten.In Theory X, the average person is assumed to dislike work and will avoid responsibilities if they can. Managers who subscribe to this school of thought assume the threat of punishment is needed for workers to get cracking and work towards organisational objectives.Such micro-management means managers need a physical line of sight of workers, an impossible task when people are working remotely.Many such managers find it impossible to give up the urge to manage their staff in a physical setting.WHAT ACCOUNTS FOR UNENLIGHTENED MANAGEMENT?We have already seen poor management at play even before COVID-19. Arguably, the pandemic has been a bright dose of sunlight, bringing bad managerial habits under the spotlight.Just think about the managers who don’t respect boundaries, where after-work hours emails and messages are a norm, with the expectation that workers operate at the same tempo. It’s little wonder the average Singapore worker is putting in 44 hours per week, according to the figures from the Ministry of Manpower. A separate study by tech company Kisi showed that Singapore was at the bottom 10 for work-life balance and ranked the second most overworked in a study of 40 cities. With WFH as the default, these same managers have to find other means to maintain their old approach of measuring performance. Hence, you get video calls deliberately organised around lunchtime (so employees cannot go for long lunches), expectations of team members hollering “good morning” over WhatsApp greetings (to ensure one is already awake) or having the whole team connected via webcam turned on for the entire day (on the pretext that is brings the people together and become more connected). These are just a handful of the stories I have come across of what some bosses in Singapore expect as part of WFH.Extreme as these are, at least they keep workers at home and safe. Harder are those who have to contend with their bosses asking them to illegally come to work. Hopefully that fine reminds them they need to change their ways.In this WFH world, we should demand more of supervisors. For instance, does your employer provide you with time off to manage pandemic-related events like the quarantine of close family members or even downtime to deal with the vaccination side effects? With the rise of mental fatigue working from home, are these companies providing support for their workers to better manage their stress levels?Parents are especially in the eye of this storm. I have four young children with three sporadically requiring help with their home-based learning while I juggle my work demands and meetings. Employers attuned to the shifting and demanding multiple roles workers play should check in on staff to ensure they are coping and if not, to find ways to ease their difficulties.(Can you say no to returning to the office? We posed this question to Adrian and one CEO in our Heart of the Matter podcast recorded in October 2020.)LOOKING ON THE BRIGHT SIDEBut let’s stop looking at the glass half empty. The 11 companies only amounted to 2 per cent of the companies that MOM inspected.The majority are obeying the law, managing well and have in place clear practices, with clearer communications.One example is Singapore-based Henatenn Holdings, a supply chain solutions provider of beauty and lifestyle brands. They work with training providers to convert classroom training into online learning so employees can continue their WSQ course without disruption.Or Beam Suntory Singapore who started a Growing for Good programme - an enhancement to their healthcare employee assistance programme. They provide their employees with counsellors trained in diverse areas of mental health and wellbeing, advisors on legal, financial and other issues.Another firm, Integral Ad Science Singapore, started hosting virtual happy hours, meditation and yoga sessions, lunches, coffee chats and jam sessions to help their people stay connected. These initiatives are not rocket science but their practices are well worth emulating for the simple reason that they put their people first. They not only understand their employees are their most valuable assets but also know that the longer-term challenges of attracting talent will suffer if they acquire a reputation for being unempathetic or have unrealistic expectations of work in a pandemic setting.

63,Commentary: Worries over COVID-19 situation are taking a mental toll on Singapore,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-singapore-mental-health-hotline-resource-14899148,30 May 2021 06:00AM,"Urgent attention must be paid to the impact of this raging pandemic on our mental health, former NMP and mental health advocate Anthea Ong urges.SINGAPORE: “It feels like deja vu,” a young community worker said, a day after the tightened measures for Phase 2 came into effect.He remembers the stress and manic scramble to support children living in rental flats and transitional shelters for home-based learning. He recalls helping migrant workers with food and essential items during the outbreak in the dormitories at the onset of circuit breaker last year.Just 10 days later, two friends with home-based businesses reliant on clients coming to their homes experienced heart palpitations following the announcement of the two-person cap as part of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).They are not alone in feeling nervous about the COVID-19 situation in Singapore. Calls to some mental health hotlines saw a spike on Sunday (May 16), the first day of the latest phase of COVID-19 restrictions, executives who run these hotlines tell me.COVID-19 HAS TAKEN AN EMOTIONAL TOLL ON USPsychologists have pointed out how stressors released over the uncertainty over livelihoods, routines and catching a deadly virus have created a sense of constant danger and exerted an emotional toll on us.After a year of dealing with a raging pandemic, we have seen signs of increased stress and worry, even when Singapore was doing well in curbing infection numbers. More than nine in 10 Singaporeans (91 per cent) have said that their mental health has declined in the last year, according to a study by AIA last month.The sources are multifold. In the #AreWeOkay poll by SG Mental Health Matters conducted between March and April, 51.2 per cent of respondents said the restrictions on social activities and interactions have negatively impacted their mental health. Forty-four per cent said that changes to work and school had a similar effect.As cases ticked up in recent weeks, fuelling calls for a clean circuit breaker to be pulled, I would argue we should be careful not to do so lightly, not without preparing for the mental health support needed.After all, during the circuit breaker last year, the Samaritans of Singapore received over 10,000 calls in distress, a 36 per cent increase.Over the same period, the non-profit organisation Caregivers’ Alliance supported 11 caregivers, of which six had lost their loved ones to suicide and the remaining five struggling with family members attempting suicide.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.) MANY INITIATIVES SPRINGING UP OVER PAST YEARPeople focus on the financial costs and risk of deep economic scarring when restrictions slow recovery.Just as important but less talked about is the price of loneliness and social withdrawal, domestic violence and unresolved grief, not to mention work-from-home stress and the helplessness over an uncertain, volatile future.There are baby steps to build resilience and support people as this coronavirus persists and should additional restrictions be required. Many government-led and community initiatives have sprung up.A National Care Hotline was set up in April last year manned by officers trained to provide mental health first aid and refer cases to public healthcare institutions and community service providers to follow up if necessary. These benefitted 30,000 calls as of October 2020.The Ministry of Social & Family Development also recently launched a 24-hour National Anti-Violence Helpline for the public to report cases of family violence, abuse and neglect.It is also heartening to see targeted efforts to aid specific groups, like the Seniors Go Digital Programme to help seniors connect online with friends, family and government services.There is also a budding recognition that workplaces must step up where the stressors can come from work. More employers, like the CEOs and leaders I work with at the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, have accelerated plans for employee mental well-being including work-from-home support programmes in the last year.THE BIG CHALLENGES FOR MENTAL HEALTHYet let’s be clear about the enormity of the mental health challenges that lie head.While we are better prepared for a second circuit breaker, we carry more baggage picked up from a year of economic uncertainty, pandemic fatigue and the emotional roller-coaster of on-off restriction measures.The mental health divide has also widened, as pandemic measures have a greater impact on segments requiring more attention.Blue-collar workers and low-income individuals were the hardest hit by the circuit breaker. Incomes at the 20th percentile fell 4.5 per cent in June 2020 compared to the same period in 2019, according to the Ministry of Manpower’s Labour Force report.Last year’s circuit breaker also shone the spotlight on isolation’s ill effects - on victims of family violence trapped with abusers, migrant workers confined to dorms and foreign domestic workers with little space away from their employers.Would people also know how to find help? Less than one in three (29.7 per cent) of respondents to the #AreWeOkay knew how to seek out subsidised mental healthcare.REFRAMING THE CONVERSATIONS OVER MENTAL HEALTHUpdates given by the COVID-19 Multi-Ministry Taskforce (MTF) have rightly been focused on the number and breakdown of infections, the ensuing control measures and economic relief support for those affected.Yet let’s also hope that each MTF incorporates an update on mental health strategies included into our pandemic management approach and provide reminders on the mental health support resources available, as much as reminders to see the doctor if unwell or take a swab test if one has been to an area of infections have become commonplace.“What gets measured gets done” is a maxim that should apply to the rate of infections as much as rates of anxiety, depression, self-harm, suicide and other mental health issues from this pandemic, an urgent call also made by psychiatrists and psychologists in The Lancet.The Government had promised a whole-of-government review of all mental health policies in the Budget 2020 parliamentary debates, an inter-agency mental health task force has been set up last October and three new priorities were announced during the Budget this year. Yet more needs to be done urgently, including improving accessibility, affordability and quality of mental healthcare.Here is also where our national leaders could show compassion to acknowledge the dread and apprehension among those who have been quarantined or received a notification of possible exposure on their TraceTogether app.Leaders can also demonstrate sensitivity to people’s concerns and needs.Each day’s updates brings a sense of fear reflecting uncertainties around elderly relatives who live away by themselves, employment, healthcare and family care for many - even if others may just merely let out another collective sigh and move on.The trauma experienced from COVID-19 also gets repeated in varying degrees with every announcement of more clusters and each round of new restrictions.This persistent COVID-19 crisis is equally a mental health crisis.

64,"Nightlife, karaoke businesses still see a future despite the ongoing COVID-19 challenges",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-entertainment-nightlife-karaoke-club-bar-singapore-14904416,30 May 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: Their businesses may have been hit hard, their dance floors converted to pop-up restaurants and their karaoke rooms turned into work spaces, but operators of nightlife and entertainment businesses say that there remains hope for the industry amid the COVID-19 pandemic. Speaking to CNA, chief executive officer of Zouk Group Andrew Li noted that the demand for the industry remains.“We're a species that needs that social kind of element ... For example, when you saw dining coming out, dining was flying because people just wanted to go out and eat. They wanted to have fun with their friends,” he said.“And I think bars and nightlife are another level of that, where it is even more sociable and I think that's very, very important to us as a society.”HaveFun Karaoke founder Mr Flint Lu echoed such sentiments, pointing out that socialising is an “essential need”.“We are still confident about (the) post-COVID market. So we have no other way but to stick to the plan of how to survive this pandemic,” explained Mr Lu.Ms Jean Teo, who is a director at Teo Heng karaoke, said that karaoke singing is part of the “lifestyle” in Singapore.“We find that there are a lot of people who really love singing,” she told CNA. “It has become a way for us to express ourselves. And it's also very good for our mental health, it helps us to really relieve our emotions and de-stress and all that. I get a lot of feedback from people, that once we are open, they will definitely come and support (us).”Singapore Nightlife Business Association (SNBA) president Joseph Ong noted that many in the industry would like to return.“They need the nightlife to be vibrant, in order for them to do well ... so we definitely have to bring that part of the business back. But in a safe manner, in a careful manner,” he told CNA.Alcohol suppliers had also told him that sales in supermarkets are “higher than ever before”, Mr Li noted.“People are definitely still drinking, they're just not drinking in restaurants and bars - they are drinking at home. So that for me is the indication that people still need that,” he said.“But definitely, I think here in Singapore, people want to (re-)enter the space in a safe way.""But first, business owners will need to grit their teeth through the pain, with the latest challenge being Singapore’s Phase 2 (Heightened Alert).As part of the move, a series of measures have been put into place in order to tackle a spike in COVID-19 community cases. One of these measures has been the prohibiting of dining-in, which is currently forbidden from May 16 through Jun 13.Mr Li noted that the latest measures have been an additional challenge to Zouk, which had already changed its business in a number of ways. Pointing to how it had transformed its Capital lounge space into pop-up restaurant Capital Kitchen, Mr Li said that its atmosphere had been a big draw for customers. With dining in not allowed, there is less of an incentive for customers to order food to go, he pointed out.“People were sitting down and they were enjoying themselves and you could hear the sound and stuff, so it was the closest they could get to what Capital was in the past,” he said.“When you take all that away - that social part and then also the music and vibe and stuff and you're just saying okay we're going to deliver you fish and chips …. That is something that's been very, very tough for us.”Mr Ong noted that the current state of play means that some bars and pubs have moved into an “almost shut down” position.IN THE ‘TRIPLE TARGET ZONE’But even before the newest measures, industry players had already faced a number of struggles, said Mr Ong, who is also founder and managing director of 1-Group, which owns a number of clubs and bars.Karaoke joints, along with pubs and bars without food licences, nightclubs and discotheques, have been shuttered since March 2020 as part of Singapore's measures to stem the COVID-19 pandemic.Even as Singapore gradually reopened its economy and allowed most activities to resume, nightlife venues have remained closed due to the higher risk of coronavirus transmission. In October last year, Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who is the co-chair of the multi-ministry task force on COVID-19, noted that the nightlife industry had to be prepared for “quite a long period of restrictions”. “We know these are higher-risk settings. The nature of the activities themselves, of such activities, means that you have people socialising in close contact, often in a small enclosed space and risk is very much higher,"" said Mr Wong at a multi-ministry task force press conference.“The pandemic frustrates everyone, not just us,"" said Mr Ong. ""Again the problem really for our industry is that we are in that ‘triple target zone’. We are a vibrant place, we are masked down, we basically encourage socialising and all that ... So it is a triple whammy in terms of this is the kind of situation that the authorities want to avoid.”And while some have managed to pivot and reopen as food and beverage outlets, not all have been able to do so successfully.One of SNBA’s goals has been to help businesses pivot as well as exit the market, noted Mr Ong. It had been announced previously that nightlife establishments that wished to pivot to other permissible activities could apply for a grant of up to S$50,000 from Enterprise Singapore (ESG) to defray qualifying costs incurred during the pivoting process, such as equipment and third-party consultancy costs.Nightlife establishments exiting the industry can apply to ESG for an ""ex-gratia"" payment of S$30,000 to defray the costs of the cessation of business.  Both of these support schemes are effective until the end of September.Should they be the recipient of either one of the financial support packages, the business will not be allowed to participate in the pilot programme or any subsequent resumption of nightlife operations for at least 12 months, the Ministry of Home Affairs had announced previously.SNBA has seen over 400 businesses deciding to pivot, while over 300 have exited the market, said Mr Ong.“Right now, none of us can operate the bars and clubs the way we were doing so … Some of them still hold on to the fact that they possibly can re-open. (But) for many of them, they have already terminated their employees, they have already sent back their entertainers, they are in a very dormant mode,” he added.‘LOSING LESS IS EARNING’Pivoting to an F&B business model has been a struggle, said Mr Lu, pointing out that the lack of mechanical and electrical provisions on premises means that it is a struggle to install a full kitchen set-up.“The layout, the furniture - we use sofas and tea tables, which is not suitable for F&B. It is not a good setup for lunch or for dinner,” he added.“As a newcomer, with no professional chef team, no full kitchen and (a) limited variety of food and poor set up for dinner, lunch ... It’s very difficult to catch enough customers.”And despite HaveFun Karaoke pivoting to a F&B model, the revenue generated was not enough to cover operating expenses, and the company’s revenue dropped 90 per cent from pre-COVID times, said Mr Lu.This will be further exacerbated with the current situation, he noted. “As no dine-in (is) allowed under the new restrictions, we can only operate (a) few outlets with take-away services.  Revenue will drop dramatically and cash flow will be even more (of a) challenge,” he added.Teo Heng has closed four out of its 14 outlets, said Ms Teo, but has decided not to pivot to an F&B business model. Instead, it set up co-working spaces and study spaces in some of its karaoke rooms, beginning last month.“There are quite a lot of supporters who come in, but, of course, it won't be the same ... as what we did previously,” she said.“This is more or less to help us to bridge over this difficult period … by losing less it is already an earning for us.”Amid the continued pandemic, Mr Ong stressed the need for trials to test the feasibility of businesses operating.“Moving forward, sandboxes will probably be something that we have to push very hard (for), and I'm hoping that they will start doing that right after we manage the situation on the ground,” he said.“I believe Singapore needs to adopt this attitude, where we should always be trialing or sandboxing certain entertainment, nightlife activities and all that.”Under a small-scale pilot for the nightlife sector, it was announced in December that three bars and pubs would be allowed to reopen for two months. This pilot was later extended till Apr 7.However, another pilot for nightclubs and karaoke outlets to reopen with COVID-19 safety measures in place was deferred until further notice in January. It was slated to start in the same month.Mr Li pointed out that while it was important for nightlight businesses to come back in a safe way, the overall consumer experience would also need to be considered.One of the criteria set by the pilot was that customers entering karaoke lounges and nightclubs would need to test negative for COVID-19 24 hours before the end of the activity at the nightlife establishment. Alcohol also cannot be sold, served or consumed after 10.30pm.“The guests won't come if you tell them you have to have a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test. They're not going to want to do it - I'll just go to a bar, I’ll go to a restaurant, why would I have to go to a club?” asked Mr Li.“It has to be enjoyable as well, because if you're sitting in a group of five, and you can’t listen to music, and you’re going home at 1030 (pm), (you) might as well go to restaurants and do that instead. So how we come back into that space, I think it's definitely going to need to be a discussion between us - the nightlife industry and the authorities.”Mr Lu pointed out that the reopening of licensed entertainment premises with “reasonable” restrictions could help tackle the issue of illegal set ups which he said currently operate in the face of restrictions.“The previous customer base, they do have options for singing and partying. Even during this COVID period, the legal ones are not allowed to open so there are a lot of illegal ones that are outside,” said Mr Lu. Despite the doom and gloom, Mr Ong believes the pandemic presents a “watershed” moment for the industry.“(Now) we can really fully define it and because the slate now is almost clean, we can really redraw what we want and SNBA has a vision - we want Singapore to be the go to lifestyle destination,” he said.“The funny thing about the nightlife businesses is really that you have (the) majority of the operators in the nightlife business being people who view a glass half full rather than half empty. So I believe that ... the nightlife (industry) will come back.""Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

65,Commentary: Our unkindness on social media is a mirror to society,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/mask-woman-man-mbs-mrt-mean-viral-video-online-social-media-14896536,29 May 2021 06:02AM,"The vitriol against people caught doing something questionable in viral videos suggest we can do better, to withhold judgment and put ourselves in people’s shoes, says the Singapore Kindness Movement’s Willian Wan.SINGAPORE: How quickly the worm turns.Bloomberg had declared Singapore the best place to be in during the pandemic in its COVID-19 Resilience Ranking on Apr 27.Now, barely a month later, many in Singapore are wondering if we’re going to go into the next circuit breaker.From thinking about staycations to spending SingapoRediscovers vouchers and looking forward to the Hong Kong-Singapore travel bubble, we are now sitting in our homes, eating takeaway food and watching our children do home-based learning.ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR AND UNKIND REACTIONSAnd how quickly we turn on each other. The positivism of the first few months of 2021 has morphed into a summer of discontent.Online, videos of people who refuse to wear their masks or showing otherwise entitled anti-social behaviour have sprung up. And the comments have not been kind.The recent talk of the town is of the woman who refused to wear a mask at Marina Bay Sands. Phoon Chiu Yoke, 53, came under investigation but this isn’t her first brush with the law over alleged maskless behaviour. She has been charged under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act for a similar act at Newton Hawker Centre in May 2020.Her case is pending but she seems to have been already convicted in the court of public opinion.When the video of her behaviour towards a safe-distancing officer at MBS first emerged, friends of mine were caught in a swirl over her rationale.What’s wrong with her, they asked, devoting long discussions on WhatsApp over what could possibly be her motivation.One conclusion was we simply didn’t know enough to judge and we should let the authorities handle it.Yet online, she was dubbed “MBS Karen”, in a nod to the oft-maligned moniker given to entitled white women and flamed mercilessly.Her details were exposed, doxxing laws notwithstanding, even before her name appeared in court papers. A casual scroll through Facebook would inadvertently see her name pop up, with some cruel comments attached.A WALK OF SHAMEShe’s not the only one. In recent weeks, we’ve had a cruel walk of shame, with online vitriol pouring on the flavour of the week.Before Ms Phoon was an unnamed Caucasian man who refused to wear a mask on the MRT. Before that was a man who accosted an expatriate family at Pasir Ris Park. And before that, we had Beow Tan, whose race-related rants have gone viral.And who can forget the scorn poured on Paramjeet Kaur, the woman who made that comment about being “sovereign” and was recently sentenced to two weeks’ jail and a fine?Irrespective of their behaviours, which the laws will deal with, the brutal comments that have been heaped on them after they were named and shamed should hold up a mirror to society.Whatever happened to empathy? When did our concern for our fellow man turn into fodder for finger-pointing and social media flaming?DOING A DISSERVICE TO THE PEOPLE IN QUESTIONYes, we should call out bad behaviour – and the authorities have reacted accordingly – but before we go all in on condemning others and lashing out, let’s remember that jumping to conclusions and labelling people without adequate information does a disservice on three levels.First, it does a disservice to the person in question.Everyone is fighting a battle that we know not of. We only see what we see, or what they present. Why are we so quick to judge based on so little information?To assume, as the pithy colloquialism goes, is to make a donkey’s relative out of you and me.When reports of Ms Phoon’s case first came out, she was shamed online, doxxed and given the tabloid treatment. And everyone wagged a finger and felt superior.Then a local news outlet interviewed her dad, who said that she was a good child growing up but something happened after she came back from overseas. I hope that made some of us who were quick to condemn her feel some guilt.SIMPLIFYING ISSUES WE DO NOT UNDERSTANDSecond, it does a disservice to the group of people that we label that person with.After videos of Beow Tan, also known as “Hwa Chong woman”, emerged, suddenly alumni of the educational institute had to fend off jokes about their mental state.Similarly, the maskless Caucasian man’s behaviour on the MRT train led to barbed comments about foreigners in Singapore.And with Ms Phoon’s case, several online commentators have now come out to say - without proof - that she has a history of mental illness issues.Some think by attributing some form of challenging mental state to them, we are being empathetic but we are no psychologists. We should stop and think: Was there a doctor’s report that says so? Is your information credible?If not, let’s not speculate. Why? Because this is a disservice to those who are genuinely going through mental health challenges.Imagine this scenario: You have a mental wellness condition that you’re dealing with. You want to share it with your family and close friends, but when you try to open up, all they can talk about is “that woman, must be mentally ill lah” in dismissive tones. Would you now share about your condition, knowing they may inadvertently lump you in with what transpired with Ms Phoon?GIVE PEOPLE A FIRST CHANCESuch nastiness also does a disservice to ourselves.The pushback I often get is what if they really deserve it? Would I be as sanguine if, for example, I am near a maskless person who refuses to comply with the law, putting myself and my family at risk?Maybe it’s time to look at yourself instead. Ask yourself, are you being too quick to judge? Keeping your distance from people, have you done enough to show empathy to others; to walk a mile in their shoes?I’ve chosen to view the world through the lens of kindness, of giving others the benefit of the doubt.Yes, it is not easy giving others the benefit of the doubt when a raging pandemic threatens us all but we must try.I’ve written in the past about rehabilitative and restorative justice. I believe that everyone deserves a second chance.It would be a shame if we didn’t even give them a first.(Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit.

66,Woman who committed suicide with newborn daughter suffered from postpartum depression: Coroner,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/postpartum-depression-suicide-baby-daughter-coroner-14902746,28 May 2021 11:31AM,"SINGAPORE: A 35-year-old woman who was found dead with her five-week-old daughter at the foot of a block last year had been suffering from postpartum depression and was unable to cope with caring for her baby, a coroner's court has found.In findings made available on Friday (May 28), State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam ruled the woman's death a deliberate suicide and the baby's death as an unlawful killing perpetrated by her mother.The coroner highlighted the ""devastating effects of postpartum depression"" and said it is important for new mothers and those around them to recognise and understand the enormity of stressors faced in such situations.The court heard that the deceased woman was an account executive who was married with two daughters, the second of which was born on Sep 20 last year. The family lived in a flat on the 10th floor of a Housing Board block.At about 5pm on Oct 29 last year, a passer-by at the block heard the sound of bamboo poles breaking followed by two loud thuds. He turned and saw the woman and the baby on the ground. He called the police.Officers found the deceased woman lying on the ground next to the rubbish chute and the child nearby. Other items found near them include baby shorts, baby socks, a diaper and a pair of broken spectacles. Investigations found that the mother and her child had fallen from the kitchen window in their home on the 10th floor. A stool was found at the same window, which was left wide open.VOICE RECORDING LEFT TO HER HUSBANDThere were no signs of struggle in the home and a voice recording addressed to her husband was found on the woman's phone. In the recording, the woman said she should not have had the baby as she did not know how to take care of babies or her family. She said she was not a good mother and wife and had let the family down.She asked her husband to take good care of their elder daughter and expressed regret that she would not be around to watch her grow up. She gave her husband the password to her bank account and ended by saying that she has no other way as her mind was not working.Two knives were found on top of the toilet cistern in the master bedroom bathroom, with several bloodstains on the cistern and on one of the blades. The DNA on the bloodstains matched the woman's.Both mother and baby were certified to have died from multiple injuries consistent with a fall from height.MEDICAL REPORTSMedical reports indicated that the woman had gone to Gleneagles Hospital on Sep 20, 2020, to induce labour. She was diagnosed with maternal distress during labour and delivery and had an assisted vaginal delivery.She was discharged well three days later with no obstetrical complication other than gestational diabetes. There was no symptom of postnatal depression and the woman did not mention any suicidal ideation.The woman's husband said they had their first child in 2016 and all was well then. His wife was healthy post-delivery in 2020, he said.WHAT SHE TOLD HER HUSBANDDuring the first month after the baby was born, a confinement nanny cared for the mother and child. About five days after the nanny left, the woman told her husband that she was stressed over having to take care of two children.She said she had forgotten how to take care of children, and her husband reassured her, saying his mother would care for their elder daughter during the day. He told his wife that she did not have to do anything except rest and take care of the infant.During her pregnancy, the woman had told her husband that she wanted to quit her job as she was feeling stressed. He told her that it was normal to feel stressed at work and that she should be thankful to have a job during the COVID-19 period.After the birth, the woman again said she wanted to quit her job, but her husband told her to rest during her maternity leave and not think about work. She did not speak about quitting her job again and her husband thought that everything was alright, the court heard.On Oct 29, 2020, the day began as usual according to the woman's husband, and he left for work at about 7am without noticing anything unusual about his wife. He only found out what happened when the police called him.ACCOUNTS FROM THE WOMAN'S FRIENDSThe deceased woman's colleague said she had not complained of any difficulties in caring for her first child.On the day of the woman's death, the colleague sent her a text message asking if she was well. The woman replied that she was not feeling very good and she did not know how to take care of babies anymore.She added that she did not know what her baby wanted, or why she was crying and could not sleep. Her colleague suspected that she could be suffering from postnatal depression and advised her to get help and employ a maid.The woman replied that she was not inclined to spend money to hire a domestic helper, and did not express any intention to end her life. Her childhood friend also testified in the coroner's inquiry, saying that she did not notice anything unusual when she visited the family at their home. She later heard that the deceased was feeling depressed, and when she asked her friend about it, the latter said she did not know how to take care of babies anymore.A day before the suicide, the friend visited the deceased, who told her that her baby would cry whenever her elder daughter cried. The deceased said she did not know how to make her children stop crying, and her friend consoled her that it is normal for babies to cry and gave her some advice on how to care for infants. She suggested that the woman employ a maid, and observed that the deceased did not seem to have much appetite and did not sleep well. She appeared depressed and kept repeating that she was lost and did not know how to care for her baby. Police investigations found that the deceased was having difficulties in caring for the baby when she no longer had a nanny to assist her. Her friends suspected she was suffering from postnatal depression and suggested that she employ a maid, but she was concerned about the cost. She also appeared anxious about coping with work after her maternity leave, and although her husband reassured her and made alternative care arrangements for their older child, the woman's concerns and anxiety persisted.RECOGNISE POSTPARTUM DEPRESSION: CORONERThe coroner said the woman's death is ""yet another stark reminder of the devastating effects of postpartum depression"".""In acute cases such as (hers), thoughts of self-harm seem almost inevitable,"" she said. ""The pressures from caring for a newborn can be immense. Coupled with the demands from managing the household and family while getting ready to return to work, may all seem insurmountable."" She said it is important for new mothers as well as their spouses, family and friends to recognise and understand the enormity of the stressors.""Often, they may not resolve on their own without the appropriate help, changes or adjustments, and medical therapy if required,"" said the coroner. ""Most of all, a good support network and genuine encouragement from family and friends is essential to help the new mum cope.""She gave her condolences to the family of the woman and her child for their loss.",False,"['court', ""coroner's inquiry"", 'depression', 'mental illness', 'postpartum depression']",Singapore
67,"Commentary: When we call people with strange behaviour mentally ill, we reinforce mental health stigma",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/lady-wearing-mask-people-with-strange-behaviour-mentally-ill-14882128,28 May 2021 06:23AM,"Ridiculing those who disturb public peace or break the law by saying they’re “crazy” assumes mental illnesses will lead to destructive behaviour, to the detriment of people living with mental health conditions.SINGAPORE: There was a silver lining amid the grey cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.Much was reported about how working from home frankly made it hard to separate work from life, causing more burnout among employees. In our private circles, it became increasingly common for friends to share refreshingly honest confessions about having bouts of anxiety and a general sense of ennui. There has been much forthright talk of collective pandemic fatigue and acceptance that such commonplace challenges should lead us to cut each other some slack. Blindsided by a pandemic that changed life as we knew it to be, and the loss of lives and livelihoods globally, we struggled to cope - but that struggle saw a beneficial rise in mental health awareness. The resulting, urgent focus on mental health felt like a tiny but significant win.  (Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.)THEN SOME INCIDENTS HAPPENEDYet, two videos that went viral on social media this year suggest we may still have some way to go in understanding and talking about mental health. The first offensive clip was a woman making race-related comments on the MRT, where she asked commuters about their race. When a commuter responded she was Malay, the woman said, “Malay, is it? Okay, no wonder.” Later in the video, she added that she would “never mix around with you guys because you are so different”. The second and more recent video featured a woman without a mask in Marina Bay Sands. When a safe distancing ambassador asked her to put on her mask, she refused and asked instead for the ambassador’s credentials. In both incidents, several online commenters called these women  “crazy”, “with a hole in the brain” and “confirm mentally ill”. The actions in the videos were problematic, but these comments left an even more bitter aftertaste.MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT A PUNCHLINEWhile some commenters explicitly mocked them, others seemed to have jumped the gun to assume these women had mental illness and urged others to understand. Either way, such assumptions seem to reinforce the dated stereotype that those with mental illness would necessarily behave in “crazy” ways, and cannot be taken seriously - a fundamental reason for the prevailing stigma around mental illness. “I still believe there’s a portion of Singaporeans who are not well-versed or have limited knowledge of mental health. That’s why they’re making such comments,” Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore) said to me. She cautioned against knee-jerk reactions to label others. “Some people might have unpleasant encounters, and they might draw conclusions based on those encounters. They have not attended any talks or workshops or learnt much about mental health issues.”  The comments also implied that mental illness must have caused their disruptive behaviour caught on camera. Yet, psychologists have often pointed out that the symptoms of mental health conditions are more varied, sometimes subtle but serious for the patient - like decreased motivation, poor appetite and fatigue.“Many mental health organisations have been working hard to collaborate with the media to raise awareness. It is a setback every time we come across such negative comments,” added Ms Poh. If all this sounds familiar, recall the case of a woman in Shunfu Market who refused to wear a mask last year, because she was “a sovereign”. The circulating video captured her in a heated argument, and commenters were quick to assume that she, too, had an underlying mental health condition. She was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks with no mental disorder found, and recently sentenced to two weeks jail and a $2,000 fine. Judging by similar reactions to that case a year ago, it seems more awareness has not translated to less stigma. SO WHEN DOES MENTAL ILLNESS FACTOR IN?Thankfully, this complex relationship between criminality and mental illness deserving of delicate, careful treatment is one our courts have recognised. In fact, the criminal justice system in Singapore has a system for situations where criminals potentially have a mental health condition. It enlists the professional advice of psychiatrists in deciding the extent to which a mental health condition plays a role.“Doctors will make an initial assessment on several things. One, what type of psychiatric condition this person has. Two, whether the conditions have anything to do with the offence. And three, does the psychiatric condition allow for this person to understand his plea,” Mr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said. “There are cases where someone’s condition is so advanced or debilitating that they might not understand the nature of the offence or the consequences of his actions.” On the other hand, some might be fit to plead, but still have some form of psychosis, he added. The law takes into account nuances in judgment and sentencing. In less straightforward cases, two people might have the same condition but behave differently, while another two might have a different psychosis yet behave the same way.“Everyone is an individual, so how psychosis affects them is also individualistic. The psychiatrist will make an assessment whether the psychosis affected the ability to make judgement, whether he fully understands the consequences of his act, and whether he’s unable to control his behaviour,” Mr Nathan said.  “As a defence lawyer, we’re relying on someone’s psychosis to mitigate a sentence or explain someone’s actions, so we have to show the court that there is a causal link between the condition and the offence,” he added.For example, a shoplifter with a history of kleptomania would have their condition taken into consideration during sentencing, because kleptomania affects decision-making and has a “direct causal link” to shoplifting, he shared. EVERYDAY ACTIONS MATTEROur laws recognise how anyone living with a mental health condition deserves a closer look based on their unique circumstances and health.Yet our mindsets continue to assume some level of uniformity of people living with mental health conditions - as a group of unpredictable individuals who cause harm, are prone to law-breaking and should be isolated far away from society.For people who struggle with mental health or live with mental illnesses, these comments are a sobering reminder that just because they have found the courage to seek help and speak about their condition does not mean the stigma no longer exists. For all those who think words have little consequences, think again. One in eight in the Singapore resident population have experienced a mental disorder, according to the Singapore Mental Health study 2010. The same study initiated in 2016 saw an increase to one in seven. Your friends or family who are secretly fighting difficult, personal battles might see such comments including yours - and in worst case scenarios, conclude that they have one less person in their corner who they can share their struggles with.  Ultimately, no amount of mental health awareness campaigns or policies can override our daily words and actions. Campaigns and policies might enact widespread shifts within systems, but everyday action is how we ensure the change needed in our mindsets is deep-rooted and authentic that go beyond lip service.And perhaps, we can start by refraining from calling people “crazy” or “confirm mental illness”.Otherwise, this COVID-19 silver lining can very quickly turn grey.Grace Yeoh is a senior journalist with CNA Insider.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

69,Commentary: A pre-planned funeral is the last gift we can leave for our loved ones,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/funeral-manager-parlour-talking-dying-death-rites-process-14748278,26 May 2021 06:13AM,"Talk of death and funerals may be morbid in our culture but they go a long way in helping our loved ones cope, says funeral services professional Ang Ziqian.SINGAPORE: “Nothing is certain except death and taxes”, historic US political leader Benjamin Franklin famously said. A good tax accountant could help you avoid taxes, but death is a certainty no one can avoid.Despite its certainty, few of us talk about death because of the psychological pain that comes with it. It is a natural human response to avoid pain, which makes us want to avoid the topic of dying, death, funerals and funeral planning.These are taboo topics in most family discussions, but there is a serious need to overcome this reluctance.Discussions on death and funerals help us to be informed and to make proper life and after life choices so that we leave behind love, not regrets. If sex education can be taught in school, why not death literacy?Helping us talk about dying, discussing how one would prefer to be sent-off and what the mourning process could look like is important. And not just because it is a matter of life and death. There are many implications too.UNTIL DEATH DO US APARTFirst, many of us underestimate the tremendous pressure and responsibilities our loved ones come under when we pass on and this starts from the moment one takes their last breath.Planning for a loved one’s funeral, for instance, can be quite daunting and, at times, even destructive to the lives of the people you leave behind.One of the funeral cases I handled was of a mother who wanted to discuss her ideal funeral arrangements with her son, who was in his late 40s. Unfortunately, fearing it would be an awkward conversation, he brushed off the topic on every occasion. When she finally passed away, he came to me and chose the best option he thought of.But a couple of weeks after the funeral, he appeared at my office. As we spoke, he began sobbing uncontrollably. The question that kept playing in his mind: Did I do what my mother wanted? He remembered all the times his mother had tried to talk to him about it. His guilt at brushing her off became too much to bear. In another case I managed, the deceased’s three children practised different faiths. Each sibling felt that their father should be sent off based on their respective faith’s practices.As their father lay on the living room floor after suffering a fatal cardiac arrest, his kids bickered over in which of their chosen ways his funeral should be held.It came to a standstill and so I could not bring the deceased to our care centre to prepare for the funeral. It was six painful hours of managing the conflict among the siblings as they argued over issues such as which columbarium to select and what type of funeral rites to adopt.As much as I wanted to resolve this deadlock and give the deceased a respectful send off, it was also hard to witness how an important undiscussed topic could tear a family apart. In this case, the lack of pre-planning simply added to their grief.MAKING IT EASIER TO GRIEVEConversely, when families have discussed this issue and pre-plan the funeral, it is clear they get closure from being able to carry out their loved ones’ last wishes, up to every small detail.How the funeral expenses are apportioned among the children, whether one opts for burial or cremation, the benefits of embalming and the number of wake days are common discussion points families can have.And when families have these discussions, there is a sense of fulfilment from being able to carry out the wishes of their deceased loved one.Grieving is normal, there is no set period for a person to grieve but not being able to do so completely or effectively can have adverse consequences for the lives of those left behind.It is already difficult to accept and cope with the loss of a loved one but having unnecessary stresses in the days after the person’s death can make grieving a lot more difficult.Research has also shown that the inability to grieve properly affects us in our daily lives like at workplaces and within our social circles. Moreover, there is an unexplored and undocumented cost of bereavement grief for the state to pay when we cannot grieve well. These include mental health issues as well as lowered productivity at work. Do your loved ones a favour then – give them the scaffolding for grieving when your time comes. In an already emotional time, certainty can help because they can latch onto it.A conversation like transforming your cremated remains into memorial diamonds, number of days for the wake, which religious ritual to perform, who to contact, and so on can be discussed with a funeral director.GETTING IT RIGHTRecognising the fact that death is the finality of life helps us to think of it in less morbid and in perhaps more practical, yet philosophical, terms. Death is an end to a physical life but it is not an end to the relationships we leave behind, which we will want to ensure remain cherished even after we are long gone.We create wills to bequeath wealth to our loved ones to ensure that they will be financially comfortable after our passing or that it goes to the rightful heir. We buy life and term insurance policies to help our families cope with our financial loss after we pass on. So why not talk about and prepare for our actual ending – how we want to go and what our loved ones should do, so that they are not left second guessing?In fact, I would say, where we take such pain to ensure the financial sustainability of our families and loved ones when we are around, why not even pre-plan and provide for the costs of one’s own funeral before our time is up?Funerals, if not budgeted for, are an extra burden to any household expense and you would be doing your families a huge favour by planning and saving for them.Ang Ziqian is managing director of Ang Chin Moh Funeral Directors and the founder of the Ang Chin Moh Foundation.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

She is also accused of not wearing a mask while at the hotel.On Dec 2 last year, she also allegedly failed to wear a mask while at Clarke Quay Central, according to the charge sheets. On May 15 this year, she did not wear a mask at Marina Bay Sands, and allegedly repeated this action at Bras Basah Complex three days later.The latest charge Phoon received was for failing to wear a mask outside the State Courts on May 24, where she had a trial scheduled for not wearing a mask at a hawker centre last year.The prosecutor on Tuesday asked for Phoon to be remanded at IMH for two weeks. Phoon, who was unrepresented and appeared via video link from her place of remand with her nose showing above her mask, requested for bail.""I am a professional,"" she said. ""I was an ex-Naval officer and I have a good conduct in my history. I have residence in Singapore and I see no reason why I need to be remand(ed).""District Judge Adam Nakhoda replied that the investigating officer had put up a report stating that Phoon had not complied with the requirement to wear a mask in public numerous times. When asked what she had to say to that, Phoon said: ""Well, Your Honour, I am not familiar with this new (requirement) that requires me to wear a mask.""She said she had returned from Scotland from a holiday of six to seven weeks around Jun 24 last year and had never heard of a regulation to put on a mask.""I have never read any information that I have to wear a mask and so that's why I did not do so,"" she said.She said she was informed about the rule only on May 15, without specifying the year, by a police officer who investigated her.""I tried to abide by this regulation, but this is something that is very abnormal,"" she said. ""In defence I'd like to state that none of these breaches was done intentionally, but all because I have very little information of this regulation.""She claimed she had ""almost never seen any campaign advertisement"" asking citizens to wear masks.After the judge ordered her to be remanded at IMH for two weeks, Phoon asked for an exemption, but the judge told her that he had heard her explanation and would be having her remanded.BACKGROUND OF THE CASEPhoon was arrested on Tuesday (May 25), a day after she appeared outside the State Courts for her trial without wearing a mask. She later put one on when asked to do so by a security officer.Phoon arrived in Singapore from the United Kingdom on Jun 28 last year, said the police and the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) in a joint news release. As she was required to serve her stay-home notice at a dedicated facility until Jul 12, she was brought to a hotel in the downtown area after immigration clearance. Phoon failed to wear a mask in public on at least four occasions, including outside the State Courts at 1 Havelock Square on Monday, the authorities said. ""Investigations into the woman’s alleged involvement in the several cases of failing to wear a mask in public places are ongoing,"" said the police and ICA.""Such conduct poses a real risk to public health given the current COVID-19 situation."" The police also said they have consulted the Attorney-General's Chambers and will seek a court order to remand Phoon for psychiatric assessment.PHOON INTERVIEWED BY POLICE ON MAY 15Phoon was interviewed by the police on May 15 in their investigations into these incidents. Despite this, she re-offended, the police said in the news release.If found not wearing a mask or not wearing one properly in public, she faces a fine of up to S$10,000, a jail term of up to six months, or both. If convicted of failing to comply with stay-home notice requirements, she faces similar punishments – a fine of up to S$10,000, a jail term of up to six months, or both. ""Members of the public are advised to take the prevailing safe distancing measures seriously,"" said the police and ICA, adding that people should cooperate with safe distancing ambassadors and enforcement officers and comply with their instructions.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

71,Father sues Debate Association Singapore after his son committed suicide following sexual misconduct allegations,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/father-sues-debate-association-singapore-after-his-son-committed-14880696,25 May 2021 12:23PM,"SINGAPORE: A man whose son committed suicide after being accused of sexual misconduct is suing the Debate Association (Singapore), where his son used to be a programme director, for damages. Mr Lawrence Li See Kit is suing the association as the personal representative of Mr Lucas Li Guangsheng, who died aged 31 on Aug 8, 2018 by suicide.He claims negligence by the association in the way they handled investigations and publication of allegations against Lucas, and alleges that their actions led to Lucas' suicide when the association and its members knew of Lucas' mental condition and risk of suicide. According to court papers obtained by CNA, Lucas represented Singapore in international debate competitions in 2005 and was the founding director of the Debate Development Initiative (DDI) between 2012 and 2014.The initiative was the Debate Association (Singapore)'s in-house training and development programme for young debaters.SERIES OF EVENTS ACCORDING TO LUCAS' FATHEROn Aug 7, 2018, the association's executive committee issued a public statement about Lucas, without naming him. The statement, titled ""Allegations of Misconduct Against A Former Director of the Debate Development Initiative"" was published on the association's website and the Singapore Debaters' Facebook page by then-president of the EXCO, Ms Cherylyn Wee, the statement of claim said.The statement alleged inappropriate behaviour by the former director, who moderated a WhatsApp chat group called DDI Darkness, where he allegedly exchanged sexual comments with chat group participants.According to the statement, the ex-director pressured a member of the chat group to exchange explicit photos, which culminated in a sexual encounter he initiated.The statement added that the EXCO decided to permanently ban the ex-director from all events held by the association, to notify partner organisations to prevent him from entering any competitions or camps he co-organised. The EXCO also said in its statement that it had decided to file a police report against the ex-director.""Although the EXCO statement did not expressly name the deceased, it provided sufficient details for the public to determine that the allegations were directed against the deceased,"" said the plaintiff in his statement of claim.The statement purportedly described Lucas' position and background, and added that identities of parties involved could be disclosed upon request.According to the statement of claim, Lucas was a government scholar employed by statutory board Enterprise Singapore when he committed suicide.The association had also notified Enterprise Singapore of the allegations on Aug 7, 2018, said the statement of claim.It added that there were 10 members in the association's EXCO at the time and they voted on whether to take action against Lucas in light of the findings in an audit report at a meeting around July 2018.CLAIMS ABOUT THE EXCO PRESIDENTThe plaintiff claims that Ms Wee, the president of the EXCO at the time, ""pressured and/or influenced the other members of the EXCO to vote in favour of taking action against the deceased on the basis of the audit report prepared by the appointed auditors"".He further claims that Ms Wee ""instigated, controlled and/or directed"" the investigations against Lucas leading up to the audit report.The plaintiff claimed that Ms Wee had ""a strained relationship"" with Lucas and was ""resentful"" of his role or influence as the former vice-president of the association and founder of the DDI programme.While Lucas was singled out by Ms Wee for investigations and sanctioned by the EXCO, no action was taken against other members who were similarly accused, alleged the plaintiff.After the EXCO statement was released, the allegations were widely reported by national media, said court documents filed by lawyers for Lucas' father.""The publication of the EXCO statement caused severe shock, anxiety and distress to the deceased,"" said the statement of claim.LUCAS' MENTAL CONDITIONBefore the incident, Lucas suffered from cyclothymia, a mental disorder that involves periods of depression and mood swings, and he was a patient at the Institute of Mental Health from October 2017, where he was treated for having suicidal tendencies, court documents said.""As a result of the EXCO statement, the deceased lapsed into an episode of severe depression and committed suicide on 8 August 2018 by jumping from a window in his home,"" said the papers prepared by lawyer Paul Ong.He added that Lucas' depression and/or suicide risk status was ""widely known"" among the members of the association and the debate community, and the EXCO members knew or ought to have suspected at the time that Lucas was mentally vulnerable, or that their statement would likely cause severe psychological harm to Lucas or trigger suicidal thoughts in him.According to the statement of claim, the decision to publish the statement was unlawful as there were no terms in the association's constitution giving it power to conduct disciplinary or investigative proceedings or take disciplinary action against a member.Even if it was empowered to make the decision to publish the statement, this decision was unlawful, as the association had made it either in bad faith; arbitrarily, capriciously and or reasonably; and/or in breach of the rules of natural justice, claimed the plaintiff.The document stated that there were no active complaints against Lucas at the time the association published the statement, and the chat group was intended by Lucas to be ""a safe space"" for members of the programme to discuss topics including personal issues.There was no complaint at the time of the incident by any member of the chat group that the communications were inappropriate or offensive, said the plaintiff.He added that the complaint about a physical sexual encounter between Lucas and a member of the chat group was ""not credible"", as the complainant had admitted to members of the association around March 2015 that there was no inappropriate contact with Lucas.In the circumstances, the association's decision to publish the statement and suggest that Lucas was guilty of an arrestable criminal offence was in bad faith, said the statement of claim.It added that the association had failed, refused or neglected to give Lucas adequate notice of the allegations against him and that it was investigating the allegations and considering disciplinary action.The association also did not give Lucas a reasonable opportunity to respond to the allegations of misconduct and the findings of the audit report, said the plaintiff.He was not shown the report nor interviewed by the auditors and he was not provided an opportunity to defend himself against the allegations as he found out about the statement on the day it was published, said the statement of claim.It added that the auditors were active members of the debate community who knew Lucas and other EXCO members, and were not in a position to conduct an independent, fair and impartial investigation against him.It also said that the association acted negligently in breach of the duty of care it owed Lucas as a member of the association.DAMAGES SOUGHT FOR LUCAS' PARENTSCourt documents did not state a total amount of damages sought by Lucas' father, but stated his estimated future earnings.Lucas had graduated from Brown University with a Bachelor of Arts degree (magna cum laude) in May 2011 and received a Master of Philosophy degree from the University of Cambridge in October 2012. In 2018, he received a Master of Science in Business Analytics from the National University of Singapore.At the time of his death, he was employed as a development partner at Enterprise Singapore for a monthly salary of about S$6,000.As his scholarship bond with Enterprise Singapore was ending in mid-August 2018, he was searching for a new position and had received offers from prospective employers with a minimum starting salary of around S$12,000, said the statement of claim.He had good prospects of further career advancement and his monthly income would have risen in 10 years to at least S$20,000, it added. He made regular financial contributions to household expenses and gave his parents a monthly allowance.Lucas' parents would have been primarily dependent on him for financial support, and by his wrongful death they have lost this means of support and suffered loss, damage and bereavement, court documents added.The plaintiff is also seeking special damages including S$10,526 for funeral expenses, S$850 for a columbarium niche and S$2,030 for a grant of letters of administration.On top of this, Lucas' father seeks an order requiring the association to remove the statement from all locations where it was published, and for it to publish another statement admitting its negligence and unlawful actions. He also seeks an apology to Lucas and his family for the harm and distress caused.At the time of this report, the association, which is represented by Darren Tan and Joshua Tan from Invictus Law, has not filed its defence.In response to CNA's queries, the president of the Debate Association (Singapore) Joel Law said he confirmed the lawsuit had been filed.Mr Law added: ""Given that the matter is currently before the Courts, we do not wish to comment on the matter save that we have appointed Invictus Law Corporation to act in the matter and that we will vigorously defend the lawsuit.""",False,"['court', 'Debate Association Singapore', 'civil law', 'law']",Singapore
73,Commentary: Why South Koreans don’t want to be friends with colleagues on social media,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/south-korea-kakaotalk-kakao-work-life-colleagues-friends-14831372,24 May 2021 06:02AM,"Young South Koreans are pushing back against unhealthy work practices and putting up barriers to seize back work-life balance. That distinction between the private and professional is one worth welcoming, says Steven Borowiec.SEOUL: Much of life in South Korea takes place on KakaoTalk, the country’s most popular instant messaging app.It is the near universal, go-to platform for instant communication that 97.5 per cent of the country uses. It’s free and convenient, cast in attractive colours and features cute emojis. The app can also be used to call taxies, get directions and access online banking, meaning users spend even more time on it. The app is also now at the centre of the evolving nature of South Korean workplaces, as more companies are using it for work-related communication.But a recent survey by research firm Opensurvey found that more than half of younger workers born after 1981 were uncomfortable with the blurring of professional and private lives that results from using Kakao as a work messenger. A majority of those younger respondents (58 per cent) said the melding of work matters with personal life was what they disliked. A quarter of the boomer generation also expressed similar discomfort.WHY SOUTH KOREAN YOUTHS KEEP THEIR SOCIAL LIVES TO THEMSELVESNone of this is surprising when there have been general calls to create a cleaner separation between work and life in South Korea.In recent years, South Koreans have complained of a stressful work environment and being on call 24 hours a day when work-related messages can pop up anytime on their smartphones.Over seven in 10 South Koreans say they received work orders after office hours and the majority feel more stressed because of this situation, according to a study by the Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry in 2016.Young people too tend to be more individualistic, and less keen on the old-fashioned Korean way, where everyone stays late even if they’ve finished their tasks for the day and regularly go drinking together after work. For them, blurring the lines between work and social lives can create potentially awkward situations. Case in point: Older Koreans can be notoriously nosy in their interactions with young adults, taking unwelcome interest in people’s personal lives and career plans.In many cases, young people try to conceal as much personal information as possible so as to reduce the likelihood of piquing anyone’s curiosity at work, to maintain a professional image. There is also something uncomfortable about looking at one’s go-to messenger for personal communication, and seeing a group chat full of colleagues. Many of us, myself included, have made the error of hastily opening Kakao or Whatsapp and sending a message to the wrong group chat.The risk of embarrassment is real if a snarky or romantic message spills into a professional group chat by mistake though it’s usually no big deal.But there’s no walking away from this desire growing among young South Koreans to put up a firewall between work and social lives. Almost half of respondents to a survey by Saramin, a portal for people looking to switch jobs, say they deliberately minimise social interactions at work, the majority of whom are South Korean millennials. It comes as little surprise when South Korea suffers some of the longest working hours among OECD countries and there is a rising consciousness among youths of the need for psychosocial well-being and self-care.SHOULD COMPANIES REGULATE SOCIAL INTERACTIONS?So how can South Koreans rebuild those work-life boundaries? Efforts to pass laws banning employers from sending work-related messages outside work hours have met with resistance, particularly because such bills have tried to tag on extra pay as penalties for such requests.The good news is the Ministry of Employment and Labour said it would review potentially limiting the use of social network services for work-related messages.Where the problem young South Koreans face in wrestling back personal time is global, perhaps some suggestions from around the world are worth companies in the country pouring over. Experts who study these matters agree that companies need to institute and enforce guidelines as to how employees ought to communicate by messenger.COVID-19 too has shone a spotlight on unhealthy work practices and demanded employers better support their staff, when homes became workspaces overnight. A Harvard Business Review article published last year argued: To reap the social benefits of these tools while minimising the risks of employee distraction or diminished mental health, organisations should clearly define expectations for personal messaging.One step towards achieving that is for companies to encourage employees to sign off messaging apps and advise co-workers to refrain from contacting them if offline or away.It seems drastic but could be in the interest of businesses. A 2020 study by researchers in the United Kingdom found that while employers have customarily worried that allowing employees to work remotely would mean workers would be less diligent, evidence shows that telecommuting leads to longer work hours, with impact on mental well-being and productivity.But to maintain remote work as an effective model, a line between time on and off the work clock is important. The UK study found: “Productivity relies on workers being able to both focus at the appropriate time and disengage at other times to recover from work-related stress and maintain a healthy work-life balance.”It is likely to get even more difficult to separate the public and the private. As the pandemic normalises work from home and more people are left juggling various responsibilities, the term “business hours” no longer holds a clear definition. In the South Korean context, one possible solution would be to ask coworkers to use an alternate messaging app, such as Whatsapp or Telegram, for work communication, leaving Kakao for chats with friends and family. It is tempting to lament the fading of the old-style Korean workplace. Early in my time in this country I worked at a major daily newspaper and was treated as one of the family.But ultimately young South Koreans’ resistance towards mixing the professional and the private is a sign of a healthy evolution, and indicates that a more rigid distinction between work and home is desirable.The hope is that this new separation between work and life does not inadvertently cut off chances of friendships between colleagues.Steven Borowiec is a journalist based in Seoul.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

74,"No-fault divorce may benefit couples and children with safeguards in place, say experts",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/no-fault-divorce-benefits-safeguards-experts-msf-14794700,23 May 2021 06:01AM,"SINGAPORE: There may be more benefits to allowing no-fault divorces despite some concerns that it could encourage couples to split up instead of working to save their marriage, said sociologists and counsellors. A no-fault divorce option does not require couples to prove a fault-based fact such as adultery, or show that they have separated for at least three years. It is among the proposals laid out by the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) as it seeks views from the public on measures to better support divorcing couples and their children.Another suggestion is to allow couples to jointly file for divorce, rather than placing them at odds as a plaintiff and defendant.It is a “common and valid concern” that no-fault divorce may reduce the barriers to a split to a point where marriage is devalued, or that divorce would be ""carelessly exercised"", but this is not necessarily the case, said Mr John Shepherd Lim, chief well-being officer of the Singapore Counselling Centre. He pointed out that there are safeguards in place. For instance, the Government intends to keep the requirement for couples to be married for at least three years before they can file for divorce.“It is important to consider that this reduced barrier to divorce is not necessarily undesirable, especially in cases where the couple really struggles to live peacefully together after years of trying to work things out,"" said Mr Lim.“Being trapped in a loveless, unsatisfying relationship can take a serious toll not just on the individual’s mental health, but also on their spouse’s and children’s mental health and well-being,” he said, adding that less confrontation and blame would help children adjust to the divorce better.In addition, having marital counselling for couples ensures that those filing for no-fault divorce have thought through their decision and are given the support they need to improve their marriage during the three-month wait period, said Mr Lim.Forcing couples to linger in unhappy marriages could be “more damaging”, said sociologist Paulin Straughan from the Singapore Management University.Bickering couples would give marriage a bad name and cause their children to suffer, she said. And with longer lifespans, it is unrealistic to expect people to stick with a specific partner for 50 years or more, especially if they made those commitments at a young age, she added.“The fact that those in unhappy unions want to be given the chance to start again, and to have a second chance at marriage is testament to the valorisation of what marriage means to them,” said Professor Straughan. She suggested stepping up marriage preparation programmes and to avoid rushing young couples into marriage.National University of Singapore sociologist Tan Ern Ser noted that no-fault divorce could be undesirable if it means that couples are less likely to commit time to work through their problems.But if they have done their best and staying together means more pain and harm to everyone involved, including their children, then a no-fault divorce would help them “cut losses”, he said.IMPLICATIONS FOR THE FAMILY UNITAn amicable divorce could benefit the family unit as it would give parents a “more positive outlook” on co-parenting and relationships going forward, said Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist from Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic.Current divorce laws can create some semblance of “tunnel vision”, she said, as parties will be more reactionary and “easily caught up in the fault-finding process”.“This makes it more challenging for couples to acknowledge the true extent of the collateral damage and make appropriate decisions in the moment.”Continued tension from a long-drawn divorce process can also cause psychological issues relating to anger management and anxiety, said Dr Lazaroo. She added that if the fault-finding behaviour becomes “habitual” and follows the couple even after they have finalised their divorce, this could have a greater impact on their children.Despite the benefits of no-fault divorce, Assoc Prof Tan noted that this option has implications for the family unit.“It could also mean greater uncertainty and instability, if the family is no longer understood as having permanence resulting from members learning to build strong bonds with one another and develop resilience as a family unit,” he said.As such, no-fault divorce would be “undesirable” if the option is “abused”, he said.Ultimately, when marriage deteriorates to the point where reconciliation is unlikely, both parties will be in “much pain and poor spirit”, said Professor Straughan.“So anything to help them get through this difficult period will certainly make it easier for them to recover their faith in marriage and have the courage to try again,” she said.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

They also allegedly sprayed disinfectant solution in their neighbours' direction.They are also accused of using insulting words against a man at Sengkang General Hospital by uttering: ""This nurse gangster"", ""this nurse no good"" and ""this nurse very bad"" on Jan 8, 2021.Lim is also accused of cursing at her neighbours in November and spraying disinfectant at her neighbours in October and December last year.The judge ordered Lim to be remanded at the Institute of Mental  Health for two weeks for psychiatric assessment at the prosecution's request.He offered Cheang bail of S$5,000 with the condition that he must not contact his neighbours directly or indirectly, nor any of the prosecution's witnesses.Their neighbours, the nurse and his wife, had reported harassment to the police in May last year. They filed more police reports about the alleged harassment between October 2020 and January 2021, even though both sets of neighbours had attended mediation in June 2020.Sengkang General Hospital said in a Facebook post in May last year that the nurse had lodged a police report, noting a video posted about the neighbour's behaviour.The hospital said its medical workers deserve consideration, respect, and a safe environment both at work and at home and called on the public to respect such workers.The police said in an earlier media release that they had remained in contact with all involved parties and advised them to minimise contact and interactions with each other.If convicted of intentionally causing harassment, Cheang and Lim could each be jailed up to six months, fined up to S$5,000, or both per charge.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

On Sunday (May 16), Singapore confirmed 38 COVID-19 infections in the community - the highest number of community cases in more than a year -  with 15 active COVID-19 clusters.Last week the Ministry of Health announced that Singapore would go into what it dubbed as ""Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)"" from May 16 through Jun 13, with gatherings restricted to groups of two and working from home becoming the default for workers here.All primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute also shifted to full home-based learning from May 19, after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19.As the situation in Singapore becomes more challenging almost a year after the country exited from its “circuit breaker” period, how might pandemic fatigue be a factor in stemming the spread of the coronavirus, and what can be done to overcome it? WHAT IS PANDEMIC FATIGUE? Pandemic fatigue is “a feeling of exhaustion from the changes that the pandemic has brought about, as well as feeling a sense of dread and irritation with the constant news of the pandemic”, as described by Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist at private clinic The Therapy Room. People here were already feeling fatigued at the start of 2021 -  about a year since the COVID-19 pandemic hit Singapore - she said, adding that the introduction of further restrictions amid an increase in community cases would only make the exhaustion “more sore and painful”. Associate Professor Tan Ern Ser, a sociologist with the National University of Singapore, noted that people may have been feeling optimistic, thanks to the “vastly improving” situation in recent months, only to experience a sudden disappointment as Phase 2 restrictions were reintroduced.This could lead to anxiety resulting from uncertainty about the future, as well as inconveniences brought about by COVID-19 precautionary measures, he said. “It is a real concern as it can affect our mental health, especially for those in danger of getting a pay-cut or worse, losing their job,” said Assoc Professor Tan. “I am having some fatigue as well,” infectious diseases expert Dr Leong Hoe Nam told CNA.People, especially healthcare workers, are “very tired”, especially with all the bad news and the real risks they face, said Dr Leong.  The inability to travel, even to nearby destinations, could also be worsening the fatigue, said Professor Teo Yik Ying, dean of the National University of Singapore's Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health. Singapore's non-resident population may feel the brunt of the travel restrictions as they are unable to return to their home countries to visit their family and friends, noted Prof Teo. ""For this group of people, I expect the pandemic fatigue will be felt most acutely,"" he added. “I have definitely seen more and more (cases of fatigue) this year and they are not even aware that they are feeling fatigued from it,” said psychologist Dr Tan. Among the signs of pandemic fatigue are irritability, insomnia and lethargy, she said.She added that those suffering from such fatigue may also experience feeling cynical about life and wanting to escape from their family members, as well as a sense of dread towards work. A survey by Microsoft last year found that almost a third of workers in the Asia Pacific region citing increased rates of burnout since the start of the pandemic, stating that the lack of separation between work and personal obligations had negatively impacted their well-being.The tech giant’s annual Work Trend Index - which surveyed more than 6,000 workers across eight countries - found Singapore to be the country with the highest number of workers facing increased burnout, with 29 per cent of respondents experiencing such stress. WHAT CAN HELP?As the current crisis continues, pandemic fatigue could drag on for another six months to a year “at the very least”, said Dr Leong.  “I think we need time out - and more space,” he said. While Dr Leong acknowledged there were no easy answers, he suggested that activities such as exercising, going out for a run, or even baking for some could help ease the sense of fatigue.Dr Tan suggested that those experiencing pandemic fatigue adopt healthier habits with work, by setting clear boundaries between work and family. Despite restrictions on social gatherings, people should still connect with friends, she said, adding that they should also stay physically active and continue doing the things they enjoy. Employers should meanwhile check in regularly with their staff members and provide opportunities for social interactions within safe limits, given the current work-from-home arrangements, said Dr Tan. They should also try to be there for employees who may not be able to articulate their difficulties with the current arrangements, she added.SAFE MANAGEMENT MEASURESA report by the World Health Organization (WHO) in Europe noted that such fatigue leads to “demotivation to follow recommended protective behaviours, emerging gradually over time and affected by a number of emotions, experiences and perceptions”. Still, despite mask wearing and safe distancing having been the norm in Singapore for more than a year now, observers do not expect that people here will abandon these or other COVID-19 safe management measures. Prof Teo of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health said people here have been “exceptionally compliant and tolerant” and appeared to have “accepted (that) these measures are here to stay for a while”. “There will always be a small segment of the population that will be less compliant, but by and large, Singapore and Singaporeans have actually done well with respect to complying with the restrictions put in,” he said. Sociologist Assoc Prof Tan said people understand the need to comply with such regulations - not so much because they are mandatory - but because they matter for the health, life and livelihood of the population. Prof Teo said that despite any fatigue, what can be done to ensure adherence to safe management measures is to continue with “repeated clear and consistent communications” to the public about the importance of keeping to these practices.  The authorities should also maintain enforcement of safe management measures in public spaces and “continue to develop and maintain the trust between Government, employers (and) people, that all possible efforts are in place to ensure that Singapore stays focused on maintaining public health and the economy”, he said. Still, Dr Leong is confident the country will survive the current crisis.""One thing is for sure, Singapore will come out stronger as certain as the sun will rise tomorrow,"" he said.

79,Commentary: Shift to home-based learning welcomed but has its shortcomings,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-hbl-education-school-pri-sec-jc-moe-rule-close-curriculum-14827196,19 May 2021 06:02AM,"Steps have been taken to ready students and teachers but HBL remains an imperfect tool in fulfilling the role of education, says NIE’s Jason Tan.SINGAPORE: The news that all primary schools, secondary schools, junior colleges, Millennia Institute and special education schools will shift to full home-based learning (HBL) from May 19 to May 28, though distressing to many, is probably not unexpected.Worrying signs had already emerged in the first two weeks of May, with the announcements of full home-based learning (HBL) in Edgefield Secondary School, Victoria Junior College and a few others after each of these schools reported that small numbers of their students had tested positive for COVID-19.The latest Ministry of Education announcement about full HBL for all schools came a day after it had ordered so for seven primary schools from May 17 to May 28.In the face of the latest round of disruption to school lessons and activities, it is probably true that most teachers, parents and students are better prepared for this abrupt transition than they were when an equally sudden move to HBL was made in all schools in April last year.A year ago, educators, students and parents scrambled to come to grips with the practicalities of online teaching and learning, along with the implications for co-curricular activities.This time round, at the very least, there will be greater familiarity with the routines and protocols involved in conducting online lessons and the challenges posed by an online medium for instruction.STEPS TAKEN TO BETTER PREPARE FOR HBLIn the intervening year, the Ministry of Education has taken steps to ensure better preparedness for home-based learning.In December 2020, it announced plans for HBL to account for about 10 per cent of curriculum time in secondary schools and between 10 and 20 per cent at junior colleges and Millennia Institute.It also established a professional development programme to enhance teachers’ capabilities in terms of implementing blended learning, or a hybrid model in which regularly scheduled home-based learning days complement face-to-face teaching and learning in schools.At the same time, the Education Ministry announced that it had brought forward its original target of providing every secondary school student with a personal learning device from 2028 to 2021, as part of the National Digital Literacy Programme.The provision of personal learning devices was to take place in two phases, with 86 schools receiving the devices by Term 2 of 2021 and 66 schools receiving the devices by Term 3 of 2021.The Education Ministry also decided to adopt a more cautious approach with primary schools by conducting a small-scale pilot study with personal laptops and tablets involving upper primary students in five schools in 2021.All these steps to ramp up our students’ IT infrastructure and train teachers in an online mode of instruction should put us in better stead for HBL, if another such period is needed beyond the planned couple of days in May.HBL HAS ITS LIMITATIONSWith the benefit of hindsight, five lessons from the experience of full HBL in 2020 can inform our approach to this second round of system-wide school closures and what educators should look out for.First, the Ministry of Education has openly acknowledged that HBL cannot fully replace the benefits that students derive from being physically present in school that impact their learning experience.For one thing, not all students are equally self-motivated to direct their own learning and some require closer supervision that may not be available in their homes.Some students may lack access to Wi-Fi in their homes while others may have special learning needs best addressed within a school setting.Schools also provide a relatively safe and supportive environment for at least part of the day for students facing emotionally trying circumstances at home.For these reasons, the news that schools will remain open for students who need extra support, as they did last year, is to be welcomed.Second, it is largely impractical to conduct hands-on activities such as science experiments within an online setting over a prolonged period of time.No doubt educators could devise experiments that could be easily replicated by students at home using commonly available household materials, or create online simulations.However, there are limits to the feasibility of doing this, for instance, in the case of work involving certain chemicals or scientific apparatus, especially for secondary school or junior college students who will take laboratory-based subjects during their key national examinations.Third, the suspension of co-curricular activities and inter-school competitions has implications for students’ personal growth and development.Not only do these activities allow students to discover their talents and interests, they also aid in the development of social-emotional competencies such as responsible decision-making and self-management. Students may also develop friendships and learn values such as respect and responsibility.For instance, there is probably a great deal of disappointment among athletes about the suspension of the National School Games competitions after they had resumed on a limited scale this year after last year’s hiatus.Encouraging some level of interaction, even collaboration, among students through break-out rooms that teachers, CCA coordinators and coaches can peek into, should be a standard feature of HBL that educators should look into developing and sharing best practices in.Fourth, students in graduating cohorts, along with their teachers and parents, are understandably worried about the adequacy of examination preparation and indeed, preparation for other modes of assessment including the Direct School Admission auditions or interviews, within the setting of HBL, as were those in last year’s cohorts.This is probably why the Education Ministry allowed these students to return to school during last year’s mid-year school holiday period, and will do the same this year too.Fifth, managing parental and educators’ expectations is fundamental to a successful shift to HBL over a prolonged period.The incremental escalation of school closures in the first two weeks of this month is testament to earlier reluctance to opt for the total closure of all schools.This reluctance was likely informed by a recognition of the vital importance of face-to-face schooling, not only for students’ academic learning, but equally importantly, for their non-academic development as well after much consultation.Yet this stage-by-stage closure of schools likely aggravated some parents prior to the announcement, who felt that the safety of all students ought to be the paramount consideration as the number of COVID-19 cases in the wider community continued to rise.There is little pleasing everyone and it was useful that the Education Minister Chan Chun Sing clarified on Sunday how the move was guided by health considerations on top of consultation with stakeholders to secure buy-in.Listen to two parents share their front-row experience to their kids' educational journey of home-based learning during the circuit breaker on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:A LONG JOURNEY AHEAD TO IMPROVE HBL We are not done in our journey to improve the HBL experience and ensure our students do not lose out in this shift towards online learning.As the pandemic shows no signs of abating in the short-term future, the Ministry will have to work in collaboration not only with schools, parents and students, but also with the Health Ministry and others, to minimise the bewilderment, confusion and frustration that has, unfortunately, often characterised the schooling landscape for the past 16 months.In other words, the key task is the resumption of some semblance of normality and stability in the midst of a volatile period.Jason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

81,All in-person private tuition and enrichment for students aged 18 and below to be suspended: MOE,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/in-person-tuition-enrichment-classes-suspended-covid-19-students-14833184,18 May 2021 07:05PM,"SINGAPORE: All in-person private tuition and enrichment - whether academic or non-academic - for younger students will be temporarily suspended from Wednesday (May 19), according to an updated advisory from the Ministry of Education (MOE).The suspension applies to both organisations and individuals who offer lessons to students aged 18 and below.This includes but is not limited to education and development support activities, arts and culture classes and workshops, religious classes, as well as sports and physical activity classes and programmes.“The decision to suspend in-person classes is due to the higher risk of transmission of COVID-19 from the intermingling of students from different schools, and to avoid interactions between tutors and students,” said MOE on Tuesday.From Wednesday until Jun 13, tuition and enrichment activities – including centre-based classes, home-based businesses and one-on-one classes – must either shift their lessons for students aged 18 and below online or suspend lessons altogether, said MOE.The move comes after several primary school students tested positive for COVID-19 in recent days, with most of the infections linked to tuition centres.Singapore on Sunday announced that all primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, would shift to full home-based learning from Wednesday until the end of the term on May 28.All centre-based tuition and enrichment classes should also move activities online until the end of Phase 2 (Heightened Alert), said Minister for Education Chan Chun Sing in a  COVID-19 multi-ministry task force press conference on Sunday.Certain organisations are exempted from the temporary suspension, such as MOE-registered Foreign System Kindergartens and institutions that provide full-time pre-tertiary education to students age 18 and below that leads to a qualification.Student care centres may also continue to remain open.Those providing learning interventions provided by therapists registered with the Allied Health Professions Council, or Early Intervention centres funded by the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA) will also be allowed to keep their doors open, “subject to prevailing safe management measures”, MOE said.These include strict safe distancing, health declarations, frequent disinfection of surfaces, staggering class timings and the wearing of masks.Sport or physical activity classes for students aged 18 and younger may only continue outdoors, with a maximum of one instructor and one student at all times, MOE said.Sport or physical activity classes involving more than one student are to be suspended.FOR STUDENTS ABOVE 18 YEARS OLDClasses catering exclusively to students older than 18 years old may continue in person, subject to prevailing safe management measures.For centres that cater to both school-going children and adults, lessons for those aged 18 and younger should shift online or otherwise be suspended, while lessons for those above 18 years old can continue in person, said MOE. MOE will also introduce further restrictions on indoor gyms and fitness/dance/exercise studios for those aged above 18.Gyms and studios with classes for such students may remain open only if they offer low intensity physical activities.Participants and instructors must be masked at all times and no single room should hold more than 30 persons, including tutors/instructors, the ministry added.Outdoor exercise classes may continue.Voice training and speech and drama classes for students older than age 18 may also continue, although the same restrictions – masks on at all times and a capacity limit of 30 – will be in place.ALL STUDENTSAll in-person singing and wind/brass instrument classes are to be suspended until Jun 13, as this involves a higher risk of virus transmission due to voice projection or intentional expulsion of air, MOE said.All indoor live performances scheduled to take place until Jun 13 are to be deferred/postponed to reduce the risk of transmission.“Tuition and enrichment centres are responsible for ensuring that all safe management measures are implemented in their premises at all times. To ensure compliance, inspectors from MOE will be conducting inspections to check on the proper implementation of the safe management measures,” MOE said.Under the COVID-19 (Temporary Measures) Act, first-time offenders will face a fine of up to S$10,000, imprisonment of up to six months, or both. For subsequent offences, they may face a fine of up to S$20,000, imprisonment of up to twelve months, or both.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

82,Commentary: Some pain even as Singapore rises to the challenge of tighter COVID-19 measures,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/rules-tightened-singapore-circuit-breaker-covid-19-fatigue-14831062,18 May 2021 02:32PM,"The changing rules of this COVID-19 threat could mean on-off restrictions and the need for resilience to get through this pandemic.SINGAPORE: There is something extraordinary in the way Singapore’s national response to a raging pandemic runs like clockwork.Take last week for example. The announcement of tightened restrictions last Friday (May 14) by the multi-ministry task force came as little surprise to many. As daily new infections ticked up over the past two weeks, people were already getting into position for some sort of a coming winter.Close friends WhatsApped me last week to postpone dinner plans until infection numbers die down.My mother instinctively went to see my grandmother, just in case she could no longer do so if rules disallowed visits.And when she dropped by our neighbourhood hair salon to get a trim on Thursday, the owner shared how he had stayed open despite earlier plans to close for the public holiday, anticipating a surge in customers and potentially having to shutter if another circuit breaker was pulled.When Friday’s announcement was made, most people's reactions were marked by readiness rather than alarm. Lines at supermarkets grew but were nowhere near panic-buying levels seen last April and quickly died down. Workplaces shifted into work-from-home mode somewhat seamlessly.In fact, it looked like the pandemic has made us pretty agile and responsive to change. Businesses, workers and people were reading the tea leaves, readying ourselves and taking action to mitigate risks even before we moved into what the Government calls Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). Even Sunday’s announcement of schools moving to home-based learning (HBL) came as little surprise to parents who had discussed that eventuality extensively over the past week as the exam season concluded and after school and tuition centre clusters emerged.WORRIES AND FATIGUE AS THE RULES OF THE COVID-19 GAME KEEP CHANGINGThat preparedness, however, may belie some of the underlying feelings arising from keeping up with the relentless, shifting challenges thrown up by COVID-19. Some frontline healthcare workers have been pushed to their limits. Concerns over livelihoods remain as sectors including F&B, the arts and the construction industry are impacted by restrictions.Such worries may be taking a toll on general well-being. Singaporeans are sleeping worse since the pandemic.More than a third say the pandemic has hiked stress levels and impacted their emotional health. About four in ten reported having troubles falling asleep and waking up at night according to a Philips study of 1,000 surveyed here in end-2020.The most frustrating part of living in a COVID-19 world is the changing rules of the game. Each time we think we have turned a corner, some new development threatens to undermine past efforts.For months, community cases in Singapore were near-zero. We had cruises and concerts. The national conversation was on whether travel restrictions could be relaxed with vaccination. That second shot at an air travel bubble with Hong Kong had looked promising. While not surprising, the shift in Singapore’s posture is a frustrating reminder of our never-ending fight with COVID-19.The operating assumptions and organising principles on which our national response rely on has had to adjust a few times when the scientific consensus on the virus’ characteristics took time to emerge.From the World Health Organization confirming the novel coronavirus spread at the onset of an infection and asymptomatically unlike SARS to the need for mask-wearing, that dynamic was an uncomfortable constant when the virus first reared its head.VARIANTS POSE NEW CHALLENGESThe new spanner in the works is a range of mutated strains. New variants may be harder to control than older strains, being more transmissible, Duke-NUS Medical School Professor Gavin Smith said on CNA’s Heart of the Matter podcast two weeks ago.There is also evidence more antibodies are needed to kill the virus compared to older strains, which could be reflected in reduced efficacy of the vaccines, he added. The bigger challenge posed by mutated strains goes beyond tackling immediate cases and requires a good hard look at how to address fatigue to ensure compliance for the long term, when experts have pointed out the virus is evolving to become endemic. “We can deal with a particular surge but in the long-run, if a variant can bypass measures in place, because people are no longer protecting themselves with masks and distancing ... that’s what I’m most concerned about,” Professor David Matchar highlighted in the same podcast episode.We also know that the announced HBL has been generally accepted because parents are aware it will only last one and a half weeks. But given how the B1617 strain appears to affect children more, what if infections do not let up and schools reopen after the June holidays to require HBL?(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Listen to the full conversation with Profs David Matchar and Gavin Smith on on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) NO STRAIGHT-LINE PATH TO NORMALITYPerhaps to expect Singapore to continue on an uninterrupted path to normality was something we all desired but is an impractical wish.We are in a good place. Our national strategy has evolved to a considered system of safe-distancing, rigorous testing and rapid contract-tracing, underpinned by a fortuitous mix of ripened technology, responsive public policy and general public compliance.Errant lawbreakers are called out and people are generally cooperative. We have also seen 1.3 million people fully vaccinated. But the agonising reality of keeping pace with an evolving virus could mean regular reintroductions of restrictions to curb the spread when cases slip through the cracks or if the virus evolves further, taking a evidence-based approach to calibrate and target measures to avoid impacting people and livelihoods where possible.In this, Health Minister Ong Ye Kung’s response on Sunday cautioning against pulling a circuit breaker and urging for cool heads and the passage of sufficient time to see if removing high-risk settings can tackle the current surge is one to be welcomed.After all, the two-month circuit breaker was hell for vulnerable groups stuck at home and came at a substantial social, economic and emotional cost. Let’s also remember blunt measures, like tightening travel restrictions can scarcely be a sustainable solution. “You can completely shut off Singapore for a few months and feel secured there is no community transmission. But once you reopen borders, there’s always going to be a risk because there are outbreaks elsewhere in the world”, Prof Smith reminded me.Families whose Build-to-Order flats have been delayed and are unable to hire new foreign domestic workers know closing off Singapore can cost them dearly. Construction firms are feeling the pain of entry restrictions on foreign workers.There is some fatigue and some frustration in Singapore. But an overall willingness to stay alert, keep our guards up and do our part is what will get us through this pandemic.

83,Commentary: Home-based learning this time round will be less traumatic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/home-based-learning-singapore-may-2021-schools-parents-feedback-14826376,18 May 2021 06:03AM,"It can feel like a repeat of 2020’s educational moment but things are very different the second time around, says Cherie Tseng.SINGAPORE: We cannot say we did not see the writing on the wall. All signs pointed to the eventuality that parents would need to accept home-based learning (HBL).We have been bombarded with news of the relentlessness of the B1617, a double mutant COVID-19 variant sweeping across India, US, UK and Germany, leaving scores of victims in its wake. Its arrival to our sunny shores is an eventuality.  By May 3, the Ministry of Health (MOH) would find 29 COVID-19 local cases infected with variants of concern or interest. The multi-ministry task force would later announce that these new strains have higher attack rates, are more infectious, and are causing larger clusters than before.And on Sunday (May 16), Singapore was back in Phase 2 (Heightened Alert). Yet unlike the circuit breaker of the previous year when all activities save essential ones were prohibited, this round of public health safety measures offered some wiggle room on heading out but with stricter limits.FROM PIVOTING TO PREPAREDNESSIf my social media feed was a barometer, people did not seem as devastated or caught by surprise as much as they seemed to have a weary sense of “here we go again” and a deep resentment against the virus. There is a sense of ennui, but also a clear-eyed understanding on how this whole shebang works.Schools have prepped students on the possibility of reverting to HBL. Teachers have gone through the drill.My children tell me they have been told that COVID-19 remains a real and present danger and so behaviours at school have been adjusted with new rules even before Sunday’s announcement: No more pack-and-play recess, canteens had designated and classrooms had exam-styled seating. Masks and the washing of hands have long been features of their new normal.If last year’s word was “pivot” — from our usual in-person way of functioning to a hybridised one where the option of virtual meetings for school and work is de rigueur — this year’s word has to be “prepared”.We cannot deny it feels like we are starring in our very own Groundhog Day movie, except we are further along, having already figured some stuff out.As working adults, we have stepped back somewhat seamlessly into split teams and now into work-from-home mode, eased by arrangements like access to the collective work cloud already being in place.We have gone back to transacting online and planning meals, knowing we cannot dine out anymore. Businesses are back to posting online order deals. Even the uncle who makes my favourite noodles reminded me I can order via the Grab app.WHY IT IS DIFFERENT THIS TIMEWhile we were caught with our proverbial pants down when the pandemic first reared its ugly head early in 2020; this time, we seem less timorous and more sure-footed even if this new wave of infections cuts closer to home for most parents.Speculation had been rife for days on parenting chats that this strain seems to impact the young ones more. This was a point confirmed by the new Minister of Education Chan Chun Sing at Sunday’s press briefing when he said that the new mutations of the coronavirus are “much more virulent” and “seem to attack the younger children”. So compared to the last time we had to close schools, this time, the stakes are much higher with more children affected and the spread occurring despite masks, vaccination and a host of existing safety measures.A family friend sent a text to inform us that their nine-year-old son has been issued a Quarantine Order (QO). Gratefully, all is stable and good so far. This is why, when it was announced that all primary and secondary schools, as well as junior colleges and Millennia Institute, will shift to full HBL from Wednesday (May 19) until the end of the term on May 28 – it did not come as a shock.Parents were not only receptive but incredibly relieved in some cases, on the back of fears their children could be infected.I am a lucky parent – there is space and extra pair of hands to help me with my children, with two in primary school and another in kindergarten. I am already working from home so I intend to keep all three home.We have worked it out – who sits where, what to do, and how to give each other space when the other is working. It is not just respecting the need for quiet when mummy or daddy has a virtual meeting, but vice versa when the kids have their activities online.We are also entering a shorter season of HBL with mid-year assessments already concluded and only less than two weeks left to this school term. So, mentally, the ask seems more manageable.School CCAs and sports classes have also mostly sidestepped with an online programme — not ideal but not bad given the circumstances. Our children are also getting into action to make these work. Last night, after the news broke, one of my sons went down to clean the base of his track shoes so he could use it indoors.Enrichment classes have adopted an ongoing hybrid mode already in place having all invested in infrastructure to ensure business-as-usual regardless.No parent likes the prospect of home-bound kids all through the school holidays, but it’s a small price to pay to prevent escalation.For many other parents who don’t have these options, we can’t thank the teachers in school and childcare centres enough – for helping front-liners do their work by taking care of their children.Listen to two parents share their front-row experience to their kids' educational journey of home-based learning during the circuit breaker on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:THE COMMON FIGHTWith all the recent talk about the relevance of PSLE scores and the weighted assessment season that  have just passed in schools, it is a small leap for us to draw the parallel that we are all sitting for a massive, prolonged, collective exam.It is a life-altering, generation-defining one where the rules are murky, the goal posts keep changing and, unfortunately, the points do matter.But unlike taking the surprise examination of 2020, this time, we have revised intensely, done the prescribed stack of past-year papers, and attended all the remedial lessons. Not the chop-plus-guarantee we hoped for, but it’s not too unfamiliar.Dr Mariam Aljunied, adjunct Associate Professor at the National University of Singapore’s Psychology department reminds us, fittingly on a podcast titled The Future, to view emerging COVID-19 landing points as the “next normal”, rather than a new one.The latter divides the world into a pre and post coronavirus one when it’s hardly the case. This former acknowledges how the present is simply the next in the line of new normals — and this too shall pass.I will not downplay the disquiet and fatigue that this long COVID-19 period brings, with its twists and turns. But we are definitely better equipped.As much as we are in a state of heightened alertness, we are also in a heightened state of preparedness and readiness. We have been able to make the transition to tightened measures more smoothly and expediently.We have practised for this — at home, work and school. This is not our first rodeo. We know there are enough toilet rolls to go round. We know this is a marathon, not a sprint. We whine but we also appreciate that we have much to be grateful for.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

He pleaded guilty to eight charges of voyeurism and offences under the Films Act, with another 35 charges considered in sentencing.The court heard that Tang, a China national, was in Singapore on a student pass at the time of the offences. Then 18, he was studying at a private school and living in the school's hostel.Between October 2019 and March 2021, he filmed multiple male students at the hostel during their private moments.One of the victims was in a toilet at the hostel on Jan 19, 2020, when Tang entered the stall next to him. Upon realising there was someone there, Tang placed his phone in recording mode and began filming the victim through the gap at the bottom of the stalls.The victim realised that someone was filming him while he was showering and reported the incident to hostel management. The police came and initially suspected Tang's roommate. In the next few days, Tang continued to film other male students at the school, until his roommate was cleared as nothing incriminating was found on him.A member of the hostel management team tracked down Tang on Jan 22, 2020, and called him into her office. She found a hidden folder in Tang's device containing 39 video clips of male students showering, urinating or masturbating. Another two clips were of Tang himself.Tang admitted to the police that he had been recording videos at the school. He also admitted to an Institute of Mental Health doctor that he filmed male victims at a junior college in 2019 until he was caught. He was not reported to the police then.He said he filmed the male students because it ""aroused him as he could be able to see parts of his victims which they would not reveal"".He also told police that he got ""a thrill from doing something which he knew was wrong and illegal"".Even after he was charged in court and released on bail, Tang continued his crimes, secretly filming a student showering in the hostel in March 2021.ACCUSED IS A RECALCITRANT OFFENDER: PROSECUTORDeputy Public Prosecutor Chong Kee En asked that Tang be fined and jailed for at least three months and two weeks.""This is a case involving a recalcitrant accused who had repeatedly filmed other male students in their private moments whilst showering, urinating, defecating, and even when masturbating,"" he said, adding that Tang did so to gratify himself sexually.""The accused did so whilst reprehensibly violating the privacy of these male victims, whom as foreign students deserved a safe space in the hostel, which would have been their home away from home.""He said Tang has no local roots and cannot be a candidate for probation or reformative training. ""Whilst a term of imprisonment might seem harsh for a young offender such as the accused, it is the only viable option,"" said Mr Chong.The defence said Tang has sought medical treatment of his own volition for a mental condition, but the prosecutor said no contributory link was found to the offences.The judge told Tang to continue his treatment once he is released from jail, as he will be dealt with under the relevant laws if he reoffends.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

85,"The Big Read: Frontline healthcare workers pushed to limits by non-stop, never-ending COVID-19 fight",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-the-big-read-frontline-healthcare-workers-14815630,17 May 2021 06:02AM,"A common refrain among healthcare workers interviewed is that a big part of the psychological toll comes from not knowing what to expect when dealing with an unpredictable disease.SINGAPORE: It has been about eight months since Dr Wong Choo Wai ended his volunteer stint taking care of COVID-19 patients at Singapore Expo, but the 50-year-old sometimes wakes up in panic, thinking that he has overslept and is late for work. The senior family physician is still reeling from his experience of working almost 24/7 from April to September last year - pulling 12-hour volunteering shifts at the community care facility, while also still running his two clinics and seeing his regular patients. Getting only three hours of sleep each day, Dr Wong said that there were days where he almost dozed off at work due to the mental and physical exhaustion. He recalled one particular night in early May last year when he and other volunteers saw patients coming into the facility up until around 4am the next morning. Usually, new cases would stop coming in by midnight.“The next day, we were all so zonked out because each one of us saw at least a few hundred patients for that 12-hour shift,” he said.“I will say that I haven’t had a good break for a long time, and as much as I’m trying to go on every day without thinking too much about the past, I think I’m a bit burned out. And I think most of us (frontliners) are, but what to do?” Like Dr Wong, many healthcare workers on the front line have been in overdrive for over a year fighting a pandemic which has infected over 160 million people and claimed more than 3 million lives globally.Not only are they working longer hours to contain the far-from-tamed outbreak, they also shoulder the mental stressors of being away from loved ones, getting infected or passing on the infection to those around them.These fears became very real for a Tan Tock Seng Hospital (TTSH) nurse, who was among the healthcare workers there served with quarantine orders after a 46-year-old nurse tested positive for the infection last month. The young nurse, who did not want to be identified as she was not authorised to speak to the media, recalled being in a state of disbelief when she got the call from the authorities informing her that she and her colleagues had to be quarantined.“I was just like, ‘No, it can’t be true lah.' I think I was still in shock,” she said.Even though she was about to complete her quarantine in a few days when spoken to, the TTSH nurse said she felt apprehensive about what to expect at the hospital after she was released.“I don’t know how it’s going to be like, how messy or calm the situation will be … it’s not settled yet, it’s all play-by-ear. What if everything changes overnight and they have to implement something new to cope with the situation?” Indeed, a common refrain among the healthcare workers interviewed is that a big part of the psychological toll comes from not knowing what to expect when dealing with an unpredictable disease. The new wave of infections has also served as a cruel reminder that there is still no end in sight to the COVID-19 pandemic.Ms Alice Ng, 59, who manages the 24-hour family clinic at Thomson Medical Centre, said: “I’ve been a nurse for almost 33 years. I’ve been through SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) and H1N1, and this is the toughest pandemic I’ve ever met.”(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem"" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) SERVING THE PUBLIC, SHUNNED BY THE PUBLICAfter months of few community cases, the rising number of local infections in recent weeks - which has Singapore “on the knife-edge”, as Education Minister Lawrence Wong put it - has also seen healthcare workers in several public hospitals coming down with the virus. This, in turn, has once again led to incidents of them being discriminated against by members of the public. Some healthcare workers have shared on social media their experiences of being shunned in public, with some having difficulties booking a taxi or private-hire ride, and others receiving wary looks or unkind comments from strangers.Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) director of medical services, said during a briefing held by the Government’s COVID-19 task force that some TTSH healthcare workers had been kicked out of their accommodation after the landlords learnt that they work at the hospital.The healthcare workers spoken to also had experienced or heard of similar incidents of discrimination against their colleagues in recent weeks.One doctor, who works at a public hospital, said she has not been able to have food delivered lately, as delivery riders have been rejecting orders coming from the hospitals. She declined to be named as she was not authorised to speak to the media.Staff nurse Afidah Aziz, 29, who works at the isolation ward at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, said she has gotten cold looks from taxi drivers after they found out that she works as a nurse at the hospital.“I don’t wear my uniform when I go to work … but (the drivers) will ask because they already know that I’m going to the hospital. They will ask, ‘What are you working as?’ Then whenever I say ‘nurse’, I will get them staring at me,” she said.Ms Jenny Sim Teck Meh, 70, chief nurse at Ren Ci Hospital - which is near TTSH - said a few of her nurses have reported that commuters steer clear of them on MRT trains. “It’s very disappointing to know that some people can behave like that, I don’t think that’s humane,” she said.Posting a screenshot showing drivers on ride-hailing app Grab cancelling rides to TTSH, Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin said on Facebook earlier this week: “All of us can support our folks at the frontlines. It’s the least we can do.” Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong also voiced his concern, saying that it is “distressing to see” the incidents of discrimination against TTSH staff members.“We cannot let setbacks divide us or wear us down, because if we lose our unity, the virus has won,” he wrote on Facebook on May 7.Responding to a question by Jurong Group Representation Constituency Member of Parliament Tan Wu Meng on Tuesday, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in Parliament that the authorities have been working together with hospitals to provide support for the affected workers. The Government is also working with hotel operators to provide alternative accommodation for healthcare workers who have been asked to move out by their landlords. Mr Gan added: “We want to urge Singaporeans to also show their support to these healthcare workers because they are putting themselves in harm’s way to protect us, so let us work together to protect them.”In response to these incidents, ride-hailing firm Gojek said it is working with TTSH to provide a S$10 voucher to all hospital employees.Lien Choong Luen, the firm’s general manager, said Gojek is also stepping up education outreach efforts to its drivers to remind them that trips may include hospital pick-ups, and therefore, they should implement precautions to ensure a safe environment.Mr Tan had updated his Facebook post with a response from Grab, which said that it had met with TTSH recently to see how it can support the hospital during this period.Grab added that it has started recruiting more volunteers for its GrabCare service, which provides round-the-clock rides home for healthcare workers at a lower commission rate.SACRIFICES WEIGH ON FAMILYFor healthcare workers who play dual roles of frontliner in the hospital and caregiver at home, the work does not end even after they have changed out of their scrubs. Dr Brenda Mae Alferez Salada recalled how, during the circuit breaker from April to June last year, she would return home after a long day at work to help her son with his home-based learning. But unlike other parents who played the role of teacher during that period, the 40-year-old resident physician at the National University Hospital’s (NUH) division of infectious diseases could only coach her son through FaceTime and video conferencing app Zoom, even though they were living under the same roof.That was because Dr Salada and her husband, who works at TTSH, had chosen to isolate themselves from their son and helper in order to minimise the risk of spreading the infection to them.At the time, a lot was still unknown about the nature of the disease. They did not want to take any risks since she and her husband worked in the pandemic wards and the emergency department respectively.Though they eventually reunited after a month when they were assured of the safety of hospital protocols and personal protective equipment (PPE), the family has recently been separated again because of the TTSH cluster. Since Dr Salada no longer works in the pandemic wards, the family thought it is safest for her husband to isolate himself at a hotel.“Initially my son was quite okay … but once they announced that (my husband has to stay away) until the end of the month, then it sank in, and he didn’t want to go to school because he didn’t know when daddy would come back,” she said.For Dr Crystal Soh, the most challenging period was during last year’s circuit breaker when she and her husband, who is an emergency specialist at TTSH, had to juggle long and draining shifts at work with coming home to care for their children, who were then one and three years old.As the couple did not want to put their elderly parents at risk of infection, they decided to stagger their work shifts so that either one of them could be with the children while the other was at work.“The most difficult part was it was very intense. At work we were seeing very sick patients, being in the full set of PPE all day, then we had to quickly bathe, rush home, and then do the kiddie stuff - draw, read to them, do home-based learning with them,” Dr Soh said. “It was really a full day of work until they slept,” added the 32-year-old associate consultant at NUH’s department of emergency medicine.Ms Norashinta Mansoor, 39, a clinic assistant and trained nurse with Healthmark Medical Clinic in Punggol, said the long hours mean that sometimes she would have to rush to the infant care centre to pick up her 13-month-old baby. She has gotten used to the fact that Mondays, Tuesdays and Fridays are busiest at the clinic, which is also a Public Health Preparedness Clinic that conducts swab tests. On those days, she would alert her 11-year-old daughter that she would have to be home alone for a while as Ms Norashinta finishes up at the clinic.PHYSICAL AND MENTAL TOLLAfter over a year of fighting an arduous, seemingly unending battle against an invisible enemy, many of the frontliners interviewed admitted that it is hard to keep their chins up at times. Many of them said the frequently changing protocols - that can sometimes happen in the middle of a shift - and the logistical adjustments that come with them, can be overwhelming.For those who work in high-risk wards, the process of gowning up and spending a whole day in PPE is physically draining, especially for someone like Dr Soh, who now has to do this while pregnant with her third child.Then, there is the stress of dealing with patients and their family members, who at times do not understand why these strict protocols have been put in place.Dr Praseetha Nair, 33, an associate consultant at Khoo Teck Puat Hospital’s (KTPH) acute and emergency ward, recalled an incident where a critically ill elderly patient with a lung infection had arrived at the hospital with 10 other family members, and all of them wanted to come in and be with the patient.At the time, the department was not allowing visitors, to curb the COVID-19 spread.“It was particularly difficult explaining to this family (why they couldn’t visit him) … and unfortunately, it got to a stage where they were quite frustrated, and they took out their frustrations on my team and me,” said Dr Nair.Dr Nair said she and her colleagues have encountered a handful of similar cases over the past year, where families would ask the hospital to make an exception to let them see their relatives.“But the responsibility falls on us to make sure that all our patients, and their relatives, are taken care of. Because there just needs to be one slip somewhere, and it can have repercussions down the road, like a domino effect, and we don’t want that to happen.”She added that such incidents can take a toll on her because it leaves her constantly thinking what could have been done better to help patients and their families in the situation.Dr Jansen Koh, chief and senior consultant at Changi General Hospital’s (CGH) respiratory and critical care medicine, said there are times when he and his colleagues struggle to hold back their emotions while caring for patients who are critically ill with COVID-19.“They would not be able to have family members and friends at their bedside. Understandably, this makes the journey to recovery even harder for them. As healthcare workers, we try our best to be with them though we are all fully gowned up and have to minimise unnecessary contact,” he said.For the young TTSH nurse, the gravity of her situation finally sank in halfway into her quarantine, and she found herself breaking down after a video call with her colleagues who were also in isolation. “We weren’t even talking about anything specifically about (the cluster) ... I don’t know why but that was when it dawned on me that, okay, this is really happening to me,” she said. “I think that was when the fear set in. I was thinking, ‘Oh no, what if I have (COVID-19)? What do I do next? What if I have to be hospitalised?’ I don’t think I can deal with being in the hospital on my own,” she added.She had spent the days before trying to remain calm and staying strong for her family, but the isolation and psychological stress eventually became too much to handle on her own.“Because I see that (my family) is so scared, I cannot be scared ... even though I’m the one facing it,” said the nurse.Another frontliner, Filipino staff nurse Princess Joyce Aguas, went through a tumultuous time when her family members, who live in Mexico, Pampanga, in the Philippines, contracted COVID-19 last month. Her father was in critical condition after contracting the disease and her family was in crisis mode going around to different hospitals trying to secure him a bed.“It was 6am and I was sleeping when my sister called me and told me, ‘Papa wants to be rushed to the hospital right now,’” the 33-year-old nurse from Farrer Park Hospital said.“I got so worried that I cried … Over the phone I was telling them it’s going to be okay and to not be scared, but deep in my heart I knew it was bad.”Ms Aguas, who has not seen her family since February last year, said she felt helpless at not being able to be there with them.She had considered flying back then, but the next flight to the Philippines was a month away. That, combined with the lengthy quarantine period there and in Singapore, made it pointless to return home. So she could only assist her family over video calls - giving instructions to her siblings and checking up on her father’s condition virtually. Her father has since stabilised. Asked how she managed her emotions while keeping up with the daily barrage of work, Ms Aguas said that although she sometimes could not stay focused, she tried to remain positive and left her personal problems behind when she tended to her patients.“It motivated me more that whatever care I wanted to give my family, I just gave it to the people who were in front of me. So that’s how I treated our patients here,” she said.WHAT KEEPS THEM GOINGGetting through the tireless, long days can be difficult, but healthcare workers said they find strength in the camaraderie of their fellow frontliners.While all of them expressed endless gratitude for the support from loved ones and friends, the healthcare workers said it is sometimes difficult for others to relate to the unique experiences of being on the frontline. This is especially so when there are parts of the job that have to be kept confidential.Dr Nair said: “I think as a result of this entire experience, I kind of bonded and got close to a few of my colleagues at work. It helped us that we were able to sound off each other and talk to each other.”Similarly, the young TTSH nurse said getting through quarantine has been made easier knowing that all her other colleagues are going through the same experience and rollercoaster of emotions. Her bosses also schedule twice daily Zoom calls to check in with everyone’s mental health. She also has video call sessions with her closer colleagues in the ward three times a day to keep each other company. “Unfortunately, I would say it’s a lucky thing where most of us are quarantined so we do have people who are going through the same thing during this period,” she said.“Sometimes we will just video call to keep each other company, but we would all be doing our own thing.”Dr Soh said at the peak of the pandemic last year, her colleagues would offer to take over her shifts, or offer their days off if she needed more time with family. They also reassured her that it was okay to be late for work if her husband did not come back in time to take over with the kids.Dr Wong, the family physician, said his friends would offer to run errands for him. Some even offered to help him fight gym leaders on the mobile game Pokemon Go on his behalf, he quipped.“It’s good to know that people are holding your back when you need them to,” he said.In response to queries, the hospitals said they have introduced various initiatives to boost morale and take care of the mental well-being of their healthcare workers.For instance, TTSH has introduced a helpline and chatbot for staff who need counselling and emotional support. The hospital is also working with MOH to provide staff who require alternative accommodation with a temporary place to stay. These are staff members who live with elderly parents, young children or immunocompromised individuals.A National University Health System (NUHS) spokesperson said it has offered free counselling sessions for staff members to provide them with emotional support. Resilience workgroups have been formed to strengthen staff wellness and mental health. NUHS staff members have also been provided with meals and refreshments during this period.Mr Stephen Chong, CGH’s chief human resource officer, said it has run virtual health and wellness programmes - such as yoga, piloxing, and qigong exercise classes - to help staff members keep fit and stay emotionally resilient.“Meals were also provided to frontliners whose movements may be restricted for infection control purposes,” he said.Meanwhile, Sengkang General Hospital and KTPH have a dedicated peer support team which staff members can reach out to when they need a listening ear.Some healthcare workers have also pitched in with efforts to cheer up their peers and colleagues.One of them is Ms Azrina Imran Tan, 26, an in-patient pharmacist at TTSH. She is part of the social committee in her department, where she looks after her colleagues' welfare.When the TTSH cluster broke out and her colleagues had to be quarantined, she and the other committee members reached out to those in isolation to check in on their well-being. Over the Mother's Day weekend, they prepared care packages for the children whose mothers were in quarantine to explain to them why the women could not celebrate the day with them.Ms Azrina recalled that one colleague cried after she received a card with messages from their other co-workers.“She said that she’d been feeling quite down… so when she received the card, she cried because she felt that even though she was physically alone, there were people looking out for her,” she said. “That touched me quite a bit.”Ms Sim, the Ren Ci chief nurse, said she would often buy breakfast and snacks for her nurses to give them an energy boost, especially since they cannot dine together during or outside of work.Aside from their colleagues, the frontline healthcare workers said they also felt encouraged by the love shown to them by members of the public and their own patients.For instance, when the COVID-19 outbreak was at its worst last year, the hospitals received many care packages containing food, drinks and notes of encouragement.Remembering that period, Dr Nair said: “I think those gestures were far from small because it’s a reminder that you’re being looked out for and that there are people out there who appreciate what you’re doing.”Dr Wong said his patients, who knew that he had cut back his clinic hours to volunteer at the community care facility, also gave him food, goodies and words of encouragement when they came to see him at the clinic.Some of them would also plan their schedules around his by coming for their appointments earlier so that he could leave on time to make it for his volunteering shift.At the community care facility, the migrant workers were also very appreciative, always expressing gratitude when they were being examined.“It makes us feel good … at least we know that we are making a difference,” he said.GEARING UP FOR WHAT’S NEXTLooking back on his experience, Dr Wong said he found it “quite incredulous” how he managed to survive those six months volunteering and running his two clinics in Bedok and Jurong.Yet, he is now ready to head back to the frontline again. Just last week, he received a call from the National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) to help out at its emergency department. Of course, he said yes.  “I’m very blessed to be given this opportunity to help out, because I know that even among medical professionals, a lot of people want to do something and help, but they may not be given an opportunity, or may not be suitable to do so,” he said. “So even though it’s demanding, I’m also very fortunate that I was picked to help.”This sense of duty was echoed by other healthcare workers interviewed.Though the work can be tough, they are prepared to take on the challenges arising from a crisis, such as the COVID-19 pandemic, as this is what they have signed up for as medical professionals, the frontliners said.Still, like everyone else, they, too, are looking forward to the day when the pandemic will be finally over.When asked what is the first thing they want to do when everything is back to normal - albeit a new one - many of them cited much sought-after pre-pandemic luxuries, such as travelling, and being able to visit relatives living abroad. But for some - such as the frontliners currently in quarantine - what they look forward to can be something as simple as the thought of finally going out to have a nice meal at a restaurant. “Honestly, (I’m looking forward to) going out to places to eat. Or maybe just walking around shopping,” said the young TTSH nurse.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramFor more news like this, visit todayonline.comCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

87,Commentary: Errant cycling gives the rest of us cyclists a bad name,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/errant-cyclists-cyling-jail-fine-penalties-singapore-accidents-14749398,16 May 2021 06:01AM,"Singapore’s cycling journey has had ups and downs but instead of calling for more regulation, we could all stand to exercise more graciousness, says Jeremy Nguee.SINGAPORE: It was that week after Christmas in 2020.The air was a nippy 23 degrees Celsius and there was even a chilly snap. A low mist had risen over the grass, and the roads were moistened black with the torrential rain, without a chance to dry. The sunrise was surreal on those mornings, filtering through old trees, reflecting on the still puddles and enveloping the buildings in a transparent sheet of gold.I had been riding for six consecutive days by then, clocking over 500km. I was a little sore but wasn’t going to pass up the opportunity to experience the magic again.Like many Singaporeans, I haven’t had the chance to travel in 2020. To enjoy this cool weather and beautiful scenery right here at home in Singapore felt like I was discovering a new city.A multitude of cyclists must have thought the same that day, pouring out into the streets and park connectors, joining joggers and hikers to enjoy the cool morning air.THE GOOD: THE EXPLOSION IN CYCLING ENTHUSIASTSCOVID-19 and the subsequent lockdowns have catalysed an explosion in the number of people who have embraced jogging, cycling or simply enjoying the outdoors around the world.We have found new ways to manage our mental health, connect with our families, and become more conscious about sustainable ways of living.For cities globally, this has renewed interest in the environment and in creating safer ways of travelling.Cycling, whether as a form of commute or recreation, has been touted as the answer. It has numerous additional benefits in community building and keeping the general population healthy and active.THE BAD: HIGH-PROFILE ACCIDENTS FUELLINGS CALLS FOR TOUGHER REGULATIONSYet recently, a number of incidents caused by cyclists has raised the old debate of whether cyclists should be allowed on the road and if more limits should be imposed given that they can be a hindrance and cause of accidents. Tales of enforcement officers fining a group of more than 30 errant cyclists over one weekend come to mind too.The Government has been faced with calls to regulate their use. A panel will now review regulations for cyclists on the road and study if tests and licenses should be required, Senior Minister of State for Transport Chee Hong Tat said in April. But is that really the best way to go?There is no excuse for lawless behaviour and errant cyclists should be taken to tasks. Here is where higher penalties for reckless riding harming others raised just last October are welcomed. Perpetrators are looking at a potential jail term not just a fine.Yet when people ask if cyclists should be licensed, I wonder if the comparison with cars and powered bikes is a fair one, where errant and negligent drivers behind the wheel of powerful vehicles can cause more harm. Are government resources not better spent elsewhere?Speed surely cannot be the issue if sport car drivers aren’t treated differently from the average car driver.THE NICE: CYCLING GROUPSLike everyone who follows the rules and tries to keep the peace, I too am annoyed by cyclists who change lanes without consideration, or run double white lines.The errant cyclist does not represent the community in the same way a bad driver does not represent all drivers. So let’s not demonise cyclistsThere are numerous cycling interest groups promoting responsible cycling that better represent the good intentions and law-abiding nature of cyclists in Singapore: Brompton Singapore organises group rides for owners of the iconic folding bicycle, while Women’s Cycling Project gets together women cyclers.There are also groups by geography, whether Eastcyclopedia for riders in the East or West Coast Riders.Within this tight-knit community, we are responsible road users who do our best to help new riders familiarise themselves with road conditions, and encourage them to learn the laws and apply them well. We know deviating risks our own safety.During each outing, ride leaders take care of their pack. They provide a safety briefing. They set expectations that traffic rules will be adhered to, including stopping at all red lights without exception. Leaders also take pains to go over essential etiquette riders should display, in signalling to change lanes, checking back and calling out obstacles.They also teach techniques to deal with practical situations, such as how to ride two-abreast on roads without obstructing traffic, and how to change to single-file on two-way, single-lane carriage roads to allow cars to pass in a safe manner.As an extension of the social nature of cycling groups, a number also organise charity drives to give back to society.Before the circuit breaker last year, Brompton Riders had an annual ride to pack and distribute care packs on their bikes to the needy, while Rapha Cycling Club organised a ride in September 2020 to send coffee care packs sponsored by PPP Coffee to nominated essential worker heroes.THE HOPE: A GRACIOUS SOCIETYIf you are a new cyclist planning on using the road, my advice is you acquaint yourself with the laws on road use. Better yet, get in touch with the many cycling groups in Singapore either out of the local bike shops or online groups. Fellow cyclists will be happy to help you, but we will also not hesitate to tell you off if you run afoul of the law. We are tough on our own because we know deep down inside, solving errant cycling will require weeding out the bad guys.But we could sure use more cooperation from all road users. For one, car drivers and other motorists could be more patient with cyclists as they are with trucks, buses and other slow-moving vehicles.They should also be familiar with the Road Traffic Act and adhere to the rules so as not to endanger cyclists: Stop at stop lines, give way at give way lines, and not be tempted to go above the speed limit just because no one is looking.Our authorities also have much to do to transform our country into one that embraces the future, and this action starts now. Young people should be engaged about safe public path use.Changes in road features should come with public announcements. A public education campaign will clarify how motorists should drive in relation to cyclists and affirm how cyclists should ride on the road.THE FUTURE: WITH CYCLING A BIG PARTEveryone has a part to play in using shared spaces. We have an opportunity to shape a new normal when it comes to cycling. Will we embrace a kinder, more graceful society?A Singapore where we can trust drivers, motorists, cyclists to ensure our children get to school safely, where we can take for granted our elderly will come home safely after an evening walk? Or do we need regulation to help us be better road users?On a human level, each time we read of an accident involving a car driver and his passengers, a rider and the pillion, or cyclists, our hearts ache because it involved one of our own - someone’s dad, somebody’s mother, or a schoolmate.I hope the news of errant cyclists does not discourage you. I hope you will come and discover this amazing phenomenon and be part of Singapore’s wonderful cycling community.You might just discover a new side to Singapore, and fall in love with life all over again.Jeremy Nguee is chef-owner of Dream Shop, Batu Lesung Spice Company and MRS KUEH and a ride leader with Rapha Cycling Club.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

88,Commentary: Here’s why family meals are so important,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/eating-together-family-meal-time-kids-food-diet-obesity-habits-14809250,16 May 2021 06:01AM,"Family mealtimes are great for the bodies, the brains and the mental health of children. But they are also beneficial to adults, says psychologist Anne Fishel.CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts: For all the parents feeling exhausted by the cooking, cleaning and planning of a million meals during the pandemic, there’s some good news. Commensality, or the sharing of food with others, is beneficial for your physical and mental health.Most parents already know that family mealtimes are great for the bodies, the brains and the mental health of children. More than two decades of studies reveal that kids who eat with their families do better in school and have bigger vocabularies. They also have lower rates of depression, anxiety and eating disorders, as well as healthier diets and better cardiovascular health.But what may come as unexpected news to beleaguered parents is that these same shared meals are also good for adults. Across the life span, from young parents eating with toddlers to parents talking about pandemic-coping strategies with their school-age kids and Medicare-eligible adults eating with younger generations, shared meals are associated with healthier eating and better mood.HEALTHY FOR PARENTSFor adults, both with and without children, there are numerous health benefits to eating with others. Even unrelated adults, like firefighters, have enhanced team performance when they cook and eat together as they await the call to action.On the flip side, researchers have found that eating alone is associated with an increased likelihood of skipping meals and the downstream effects – lower intakes of nutrients, reduced energy and poorer nutritional health.Regardless of parental status, adults who eat with others tend to eat more fruits and vegetables and less fast food than those who eat alone. Even when a home cook isn’t particularly focused on healthy cooking, home-cooked meals lower the odds that adults will be obese.Large portion sizes, the embrace of fried foods and a heavy hand with butter are more common at restaurants than in a civilian’s kitchen.Adults who park their dinner plates in front of the television may have a greater chance of weight gain, just as evidence from the US, Sweden, Finland and Portugal supports the connection between obesity and kids’ eating dinner while watching TV.In addition to these benefits of dining with others, there are additional boosts for adults who eat with their children – and they pertain equally to mothers and fathers. When kids are present at mealtime, parents may eat more healthily, perhaps to model good behaviour and provide the best nourishment they can to their kids. When there is plenty of conversation with kids chiming in, the pace of eating slows down, allowing diners’ brains to register fullness and signal that it’s time to stop eating.For kids, eating more family meals is associated with lower rates of obesity. The act of eating with others does not correlate with reduced weight gain in adults, though – unless their dining companions include children. Parents who dine with their kids also tend to report less dieting and binge-eating behaviour. Parents may dial back some of these destructive behaviours when they know their kids are watching and ready to imitate.A BOOST FOR MENTAL HEALTHIt may seem counterintuitive that a process that demands so much time and resources – the energy to plan the meal, shop for it, prepare it, serve it and clean up after – could also lead to boosts in mental health. Much more obvious is how kids would benefit from their parents’ demonstrating their love and care by providing nightly dinners.But researchers have found that having frequent family meals is associated with better mental health for both mothers and fathers, despite mothers’ carrying more of the burden of meal prep. Compared with parents who rarely ate family meals, parents who regularly dined with their kids reported higher levels of family functioning, greater self-esteem and lower levels of depressive symptoms and stress.And mental health benefits don’t depend on a slow-roasted pork shoulder or organic vegetables. Since it’s the atmosphere at the dinner table that contributes most significantly to emotional well-being, takeout or prepared food eaten at home will work nicely too.In an earlier study of parents of infants and toddlers, couples who attached more meaning and importance to family meals were more satisfied with their marital relationship. It’s unclear in which direction the causality goes. Is it that those in more satisfying marriages gravitate toward creating daily rituals? Or that enacting daily rituals leads to more robust relationships? In either case, the establishment of meaningful rituals, like shared mealtime, during the early stages of parenthood may add some predictability and routine at a time of life that can be very busy and fragmented.Just as for children, family dinner is the most reliable time of the day for adults to slow down and talk to others. It’s a time to step away from video calls, emails and to-do lists, and instead connect face to face. Dinnertime often allows for a few laughs, a time to decompress and also to solve logistical problems and talk about the day’s events and what tomorrow holds.FAMILY MEALS ARE A COVID HABIT TO KEEPFor parents taking the long view, there is another perk to family dinner. When adolescents grow up having regular family dinners, they are much more likely to replicate that practice in their own homes when they become parents. Adults who reported having had six to seven family meals a week as a child went on to have frequent family meals with their own children. Family dinner and its benefits may be an heirloom you pass along to future generations.Shared mealtime, however, is not equally accessible to all. Frequent family dinners are more common among white Americans, those with higher levels of education, married people and those with household incomes that are middle class or higher. While family meal frequency in the US remained quite steady overall from 1999 to 2010, it decreased significantly (47 per cent to 39 per cent) for low-income families while increasing (57 per cent to 61 per cent) for high-income families. This gap can be understood in terms of structural disparities: Low-income parents often have less control over their work schedules and may need to juggle more than one job to make ends meet.As people now tiptoe back to living more expansively, many are reflecting on what they learned during the pandemic that might be worth holding on to. There is some evidence that more families ate more meals together during the COVID-19 pandemic than ever before. Some families who didn’t prioritise eating together pre-pandemic may emerge from the past year with a new appreciation of the joys of commensality. Of course, others may already be bookmarking all their favourite restaurants, eager to have chefs cook for them after feeling depleted by so much home labour.But parents may want to remember that the science suggests shared mealtime is good for the mental and physical health of each member of the family. As people start to heal from this past year of loss, disruption and anxiety, why not continue to engage in nourishing practices that are helpful to all? In my family therapy practice, it will be a top recommendation.Dr Anne Fishel is a family therapist, clinical psychologist and Associate Clinical Professor of Psychology at the Harvard Medical School.

89,IN FOCUS: Tackling COVID-19 with targeted measures - the new normal for Singapore?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/in-focus-singapore-covid-19-targeted-measures-phase-2-14809052,15 May 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: It had been a tough year for Singapore.Then, as 2020 came to its close, it looked like the country could see a flicker of light at the end of the long COVID-19 tunnel with its transition on Dec 28 to Phase 3 of its reopening.And in the months that followed, the path to a post-pandemic normality looked to be fairly smooth, with community cases generally running to no more than a few a day. Plans for events which hadn't been possible for months started to gather pace. This was in spite of the pandemic continuing to rage worldwide, with a number of countries forced to introduce and then reintroduce measures to curb the spread of the raging virus.Singapore hadn't needed to. Then, very quickly, things changed. Clusters began to spring up, with one emerging at Tan Tock Seng Hospital - the first in a local hospital since the pandemic began. Community cases began to steadily increase.To tackle the spike, Singapore announced some tighter, targeted measures on May 4. Places that were considered high-risk, such as indoor gyms and fitness studios, were instructed to close unless they offered low-intensity activities, while fewer people would be allowed at attractions, public libraries, funerals and MICE events. Limits for gatherings reverted to five people.But as community cases showed no signs of letting up, measures were further tightened on Friday (May 14) under what the Health Ministry called ""Phase 2 (Heightened Alert)"".Among other initiatives, sizes of group gatherings were further reduced from five to two people, with dining-in at F&B establishments banned. Working from home is also to be the default at workplaces.The new measures will take effect from May 16 through June 13.Speaking at a multi-ministry task force press conference on Friday, Education Minister Lawrence Wong noted in particular that “risk settings” for the spread of the virus were indoor environments where people do not put a mask on.This is why the Government had focused on tightening restrictions in such areas, he noted.“We have already done so earlier for activities in the gyms and fitness centers where you are unable to keep your mask on,” Mr Wong explained.“And now the next step ... is to restrict such activities in F&B establishments, and therefore no more dining in. In other settings - outdoors or when you are in a space but you are able to keep your mask on - we believe with safe distancing, with proper precautions, and safeguards, these activities can still continue.”Health Minister Gan Kim Yong also added that such moves would be part of Singapore’s “journey to recovery”.“This is part of a journey to recovery, because every now and then, when there's (an) outbreak, we have to review our measures, and we need to tighten as we go along. And when infections come under control, then we’ll have (the) opportunity to roll back some of these measures, open up the economy, open up the community, so that people can begin to also socialise and interact with one another.”BREAKING THE CHAINS OF TRANSMISSIONAs the COVID-19 situation continues to evolve globally, infectious disease experts say that targeted sectoral measures, such as the ones introduced by Singapore, are set to be the way forward.“Sectoral lockdowns in a targeted fashion (are) likely the way to go, but the thing is that the decision to do that must be quick and fast,” said Dr Ling Li Min, who is an infectious disease specialist at Rophi Clinic.Dr Ling noted that such an approach requires that community cases are not widespread.“When countries embark on these targeted measures, it is probably at a point in time whereby they feel that they can still control it, meaning that community cases are not widespread, it's only small clusters here and there,” she explained. “Early on, you can't keep waiting for the cases to increase, and that can only happen when the community cases overall are still low. If there are a lot of community cases, then your sectoral lockdown isn’t going to work.”For such measures to bear fruit, the rest of the community must be “clued in”, said Dr Ling.“The testing, the tracing, (the) isolation must be superb and robust. Some of these countries don't quite have that - they're not as swift with that,” she noted.Dr Paul Tambyah, infectious diseases expert and president of the Asia Pacific Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infection, noted that these sectoral measures are likely to remain in place until vaccination rates reach higher levels.“I think that these measures are temporary until the vaccination rates reach levels that have been achieved in countries such as Israel where the measures are being lifted gradually,” he said.“Similar opening up is occurring in other highly vaccinated places such as the UK and US and UAE. If the WTO (World Trade Organisation) waiver on vaccine patents is granted, then this is likely to happen sooner rather than later all over the world.”As Singapore is one of the world’s most globally connected cities, it is likely to need “far higher” levels of vaccination to protect the population than other more ""closed or isolated"" societies such as Israel or New Zealand, added Dr Tambyah.As of May 9, about 1.8 million people had received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine, with 1.2 million of them receiving their second dose, Mr Gan had said in Parliament on Tuesday (May 11).Data compiled by the Our World in Data project at the University of Oxford, shows that close to 60 percent of Israel’s population has received at least one dose of the vaccine. The number currently stands at about 30 per cent for Singapore.FINDING ‘MIDDLE GROUND’One of the reasons why total lockdowns have been implemented in some countries is due to the fact that hospitals are facing the possibility of being inundated, said Dr Teo Yik Ying, who is dean of the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health.“A total lockdown is necessary when the health system is at risk of being overwhelmed. That is when you realize that the situation is getting rapidly out of control. And the definition of out of control here is that the infection is spreading so fast in the community, and resulting in a large number of people entering the hospitals,” said Dr Teo.A total lockdown would serve two main purposes, he noted. The first of which would be to stop interaction so as to cut chains of transmission in the community. And when such chains are cut, this minimises the infections only to households, he added.“What that means is that with time, you actually allow the number of patients in the hospitals to slowly go down ... Your hospitals now have a chance to breathe,” he said.“That is actually very important because once your hospital is overwhelmed, you realise that anyone seeking care at the hospital, whether it is COVID, or non COVID related, they will be compromised because nurses are overwhelmed, doctors are overwhelmed.” And while Singapore had been forced into a circuit-breaker period - similar to a lockdown - last year, there has not been a need to re-impose that because the healthcare system is not at the risk of being overwhelmed, said Dr Teo.For one, in addition to current bed capacity, there was also the setting up of community facilities around the island last year to bolster capacity, he pointed out.“After our initial fear that we saw in April (and) May last year, there is now built in place some additional surge capacity. It is not massive, it is never massive, but at least hospitals now have a better way of coordinating their resources to cope with rising numbers,” he added.Speaking to CNA, Dr Dale Fisher, who is senior consultant at the National University Hospital’s division of infectious disease, noted that many countries have tried to find a compromise as part of their strategy to tackle COVID-19.“Many countries have tried to find this middle ground - particularly Singapore obviously - of targeting specific things for specific reasons. So I don't think it's new,” he said.“Now if you've got good contact tracing, good case isolation, good quarantining, good social distancing, good community buy in, capacity to scale up testing - if all these are in place, then really countries should be less inclined to do the blunt lockdowns.”He noted that aside from countries with a strategy of complete elimination of the virus such as Australia, such a lockdown should not be the first option.“It should have been a place of last resort, when you really had lost control of the situation. Your contact tracing couldn't keep up, your quarantining wasn't effective, or your case isolation was not in place - many countries didn't isolate their cases,” he added.Dr Tambyah noted that such a total lockdown would be “very drastic” and have “numerous adverse consequences”. These include risks of death from falls in older people living alone, mental health problems in individuals who are isolated, as well as increases in domestic violence, among other things, he said.Going back to such lockdowns would be a very “retrograde step”, added Dr Fisher.“I think that would be a very retrograde step because we want to be pushing forward in opening up to achieve this balance of living with the virus and we don't want to have to be locking down regularly,” said Dr Fisher.“I think what Singapore is doing is the right way, which is try and nuance your way through it, bring that number back down.”WIDENING ‘INEQUITIES’Dr Teo that “personal safe management measures” such as mask wearing and social distancing remain important.“Once we started imposing face mask wearing, we never changed our stance on that, we never changed our stance on social distance, and neither our stance on group size restrictions. We have always maintained that there is a need to restrict group sizes, because whether it is for dining, coming together for things, those are the activities that have the highest risk of spreading (the virus),” he added.And Dr Teo noted that acceptance of these measures remain high despite the fact that Singapore has been in this pandemic for over a year.However, there remain disadvantages associated with such a targeted approach, he said. “Sectoral lockdowns actually widen inequities. Effectively, you are saying that certain sectors of the economy have to be shut down in order to allow other sectors of the economy to progress,” Dr Teo added.As such, policies need to be put into place to ensure that these sectors are being looked after, amid the closures, he added.On Friday, it was announced that F&B businesses, which are going to have to deal with the suspension of dine-in business, will get additional financial support.Regardless of whether a total lockdown or targeted sectoral measures are put into place, Dr Ling noted that there is a risk of fatigue among the public.“At this point in time, everyone knows that if we don't do something about it, it's just only going to get worse. And then it ends up being (a) total lockdown for everyone, which is even a lot worse. (It is akin to) choosing between the devil and deep blue sea, it's like there’s no good choice,” she said.Given that safe management measures are not compulsory in some other countries, this could potentially exacerbate fatigue, she noted.“In certain countries, it is very difficult to implement safe management measures and implement masking, to make it compulsory. And so when there are a lot of interactions, and when there is slight breakdown in any of these measures,  the cases will balloon,"" she said.While other countries aim for a strategy which involves a total elimination of the virus, Singapore is trying to find a compromise between allowing economic activity, and some social activities to resume while trying to keep the public health situation under control, noted Dr Teo.“It means that we will start to look at some of this dialing up and dialing down of our measures between phase three, phase two, phase three, phase two, even maybe going back to phase one from time to time. This will be something we have to be mentally prepared for,” he said.At the same time, Dr Ling emphasised the need for Singaporeans to be constantly on their toes.“The community has to be mentally prepared that COVID is going to be here to stay for an indefinite period of time,” she said.“We being part of this community and being part of a global society, we just have to make sure that we try to keep it at bay for as long as we can. And we're going to have to do whatever we can to do that.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",True,['COVID-19'],Singapore
90,Migrant worker who had COVID-19 admits loitering around Changi Airport in bid to take flight home,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-worker-covid-19-admits-loitering-changi-airport-14807868,14 May 2021 11:33AM,"SINGAPORE: A 26-year-old migrant worker who suspected he had COVID-19 failed to stay at the hospital as directed, and instead took public transport to Changi Airport where he loitered for hours hoping to get a flight home.Indian national Parthiban Balachandran pleaded guilty on Friday (May 14) to a charge each of exposing others to the risk of COVID-19 infection and leaving an isolation area without permission. Another two charges of exposing others to the risk of infection and of using insulting words towards a health officer will be considered in sentencing.The court heard that Parthiban stayed at Jurong Penjuru dormitory, which was among the dorms declared in April 2020 to be an isolation area.On May 23 last year, Parthiban reported sick at the dorm, complaining of a fever and sore throat. Based on his symptoms and knowing that other dorm residents had reported positive for COVID-19, Parthiban suspected that he was infected with the virus.He was taken to the Singapore General Hospital (SGH) by ambulance where a swab test was taken from him. He was transferred to a fever-screening area in the hospital's multi-storey car park, where staff nurses briefed him repeatedly in English and Tamil not to leave until his test results were ready, and not to go anywhere unless instructed. He was also told not to leave so that he would not risk infecting others if he did have COVID-19.Swab test results later showed he was a confirmed COVID-19 case.At about 5.30pm the same day, Parthiban left the hospital without informing anyone, intending to go the airport to buy a ticket and return to India immediately. Closed-circuit television footage showed him leaving with two bags, walking towards Kim Tian Road and crossing an overhead bridge. He walked to Yong Siak Street, where he took a bus and later flagged a cab at Lower Delta Road.He took the taxi to Changi Airport Terminal 1, where he spoke to airport staff and tried to buy a ticket to India. He was not sold a ticket, and loitered at the airport for about four hours until the police found him and escorted him back to SGH.The taxi driver who took him to the airport was issued a quarantine order for 14 days and could not work during this time. He tested negative for the virus.Parthiban completed his period of isolation in the hospital on Jun 8 last year and was diagnosed to be no longer infectious. He was sent back to the dormitory and ordered to serve another 14 days' leave of absence, and was not allowed to leave the dorm.HE LEFT THE DORMITORY FOR THE AIRPORT BEFORE TIME WAS UP AGAINOn Jun 16, before the period was up, Parthiban packed two bags of belongings and left the dorm. He intended to leave Singapore as he knew many dorm residents had tested positive for COVID-19.He took a cab to the airport but was told by airport staff that he could not buy a ticket. He loitered at the airport and slept there, before heading to a relative's home in Tampines the next day.He told his relative that he had left the dorm without permission only after entering the flat. His relative called his employer and the police escorted him back to the dormitory.In a charge taken into consideration, Parthiban also used insulting words at a Ministry of Health officer at Harbourfront Centre on Oct 14 last year. When the officer read a charge to him, he said in Tamil: ""Who are you both to charge me? Are you a judge?""  Other things he said were: ""What rights do you have to charge me?"", ""Have you read law? Or do you have proper education to charge me?"".He also said to the officer: ""I have BABL (Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Law). Do you have a law degree in the first place? Do you want to see my degree?""The prosecutor is asking for the maximum six months' jail for Parthiban. Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law, who took the case on pro bono, asked the judge to remand Parthiban at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric observation.DEFENCE ASKS FOR PSYCHIATRIC OBSERVATIONHe tendered a Jun 8, 2020 memo from SGH indicating that Parthiban was suffering from adjustment disorder close to the time of the offences. He said Parthiban was on medication in April this year and was admitted to IMH last month. He said Parthiban was ""limited by his financial means"", explaining why no psychiatric report was obtained earlier. ""As far as we understand, the prosecution is asking for the maximum six-month jail term. Even with the COVID situation now ... we urge the court to exercise some caution and compassion, so we have all the relevant facts before we proceed with sentencing,"" said Mr Wong. He said the remand would be to assess if Parthiban had any mental condition at the time of the offences and if there was any link between this and the offences.The judge initially had reservations, saying the courts usually order IMH remand only at the charging or initial stages of cases.However, after considering further and after the prosecutor said he did not object, the judge ordered Parthiban to be remanded at IMH for psychiatric observation.Parties will return in June for further hearings. The maximum penalties for exposing others to the risk of infection are six months' jail, a S$10,000 fine, or both.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

91,Commentary: Flaring tempers and public incidents – are we losing it because of COVID-19?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/losing-temper-lau-pa-sat-covid-19-coronavirus-mask-wear-mrt-14787258,13 May 2021 06:00AM,"Temperatures are rising as fresh public incidents show both people losing their cool and netizens losing their patience with those who may be flouting the law. A psychology lecturer from SUSS explains what’s behind it.SINGAPORE: COVID-19 has robbed us of our sense of control.We have had to adapt to changes forced upon us. From learning how to spend entire days with family to dealing with not seeing family and friends for entire months, to figuring out how to work from home and avoid working non-stop, work and life norms have swung from one pendulum to another.We also have had to deal with mental health challenges, in tackling Zoom fatigue to finding alone time in a house filled with people and learning how to draw work-life boundaries and redefine rest.Then you step outside your house to find a new set of challenges await. This ranges from the logistical (how to take public transport while touching the least possible number of surfaces) to the behavioural (how to keep your distance from people).RECLAIMING CONTROLPsychologists know this desire to reclaim power over our situations is not new. We have taken actions to manage small incidents of stress in our everyday lives long before the advent of COVID-19.When I come to a traffic light junction, I press the “green man” button. When I am in a hurry, I unconsciously press it more than once. If I am in a great hurry, I tap on it many times.I am not entirely sure if the button works. It is probably a placebo button. But pressing it makes me feel better about my waiting. It gives me a comforting sense of control.But we can’t control the uncle standing too close to us in a hawker centre queue.Neither can commuters on a MRT train control a 39-year-old maskless man who, in a viral video last weekend, was bent on debating strangers and sharing his personal research on the science of COVID-19 rather than mask up.The safe distancing ambassador at Lau Pa Sat might not have predicted how people can lose their cool when he confronted groups he suspected of flouting rules.Online, these two pieces of news have been met with swift condemnation and people calling for harsh punishments – fines, jail and even caning or deportation - to be meted out right away. It seems tempers are flaring all around.Why are people reacting like that? Are we losing our grip?While the police investigate the cases that have come to light, we hope justice will be meted out to show violence and flagrant flouting of rules is not acceptable.  THE SAME BOAT, THE SAME GROUPCOVID-19 has imposed greater uncertainty over most parts of our lives. We have also lost control over our fate and our independent selves so it’s little wonder our tempers have grown short and our patience wearing thin.In order to exit the current COVID-19 measures, return to phase 3 and avoid personal illness, we need others (people, organisations and the Government) to cooperate and make the “right decisions”.This is our shared fate. Everyone in Singapore is now reluctantly in the same boat and in the same group. We are finding out we need the cooperation of others, including our neighbours, domestic helpers, and the general public around us whom we never had to rely on so critically before for our fate.The trouble is people enter COVID-19 with diverse values and tolerance levels. And this could explain why some react badly to being confronted. Our group isn’t from a Hollywood movie script. We are not going to win the basketball tournament or charge forward and overrun the enemy line as one united team.Our group has probably never been this tested on our social cohesion. We may have differences that span age, race, gender and even nationality, when members comprise those from the Merdeka generation aunties to working adults juggling work and family, to migrant workers.Our group also has what psychologists call low task cohesion: We don’t fully agree on what needs to be done and how they should be done. For example, some believe that we should close our borders, while some caution against it.And yet, our group is facing a big challenge in wanting everyone to conform to norms and rules to keep everyone safe. We depend on others to follow the new COVID-19 social norms of mask wearing, maintaining social distance, and avoiding large gatherings.Group members who commit indiscretions must know they are creating an unequal hierarchy, with themselves at the very top. With offences holding the potential of starting another wave of COVID-19 infections, offenders have unequal power over the fates of law abiding, norm-following members of the group.A similar rationale applies to netizens condemning these two incidents and calling for punishments to be meted out before justice has a chance to take its course. We need group members to reciprocate. We might think “I hate wearing a mask but I’ve worn one all day. Why can’t these people wear their masks properly too?”Proponents of harsher actions may see these offenders as group members who violate our social norms and do not match our sacrifices.(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem"" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) AGGRESSIVE CALLS CAN SPIN OUT OF CONTROLIt is no surprise then to see more reports of aggressive reactions to COVID-19 restrictions on one hand, and calls for stiffer punishments for COVID-19 restriction violations on the other. People are desperate to reclaim personal control.And attempts to stop them, such as when they go out for a gathering of more than five at Lau Pau Sat, may be met with anger. “Who are you to ask me to listen to you?” shouted a man when his larger-than-five group is confronted by a safe distancing ambassador. Kudos to the ambassador who strove to keep his cool.Yet let’s not forget sentiments of intolerance can spin out of control quickly. We have witnessed the rise of anti-Asian hate crimes elsewhere in the world. In Singapore, our anger and frustration with COVID-19 and its outcomes and restrictions can easily morph into xenophobia and the formation of group identities based on adherence to rules.While not representative of all Singaporeans, social media comments related to foreigners seemingly violating COVID-19 restrictions or entering into Singapore from high-risks countries reveal a deep sense of anti-foreigner sentiments among some in our community.My research with 280 Singaporeans found that xenophobic fears related to COVID-19, evident through responses to questions such as “If I was in an elevator with a group of foreigners, I’d be worried that they’re infected with the virus”, is only second to danger and contamination fears about COVID-19, evident through responses to questions such as “I am worried that I can’t keep my family safe from the virus”.These two fears were higher among my Singaporean participants than fears about the socio-economic consequences of COVID-19.There is a story of how hot water changes things differently, revealing what one could be made of. In hot water, a hard potato softens, an egg is transformed but it’s the coffee bean that changes the hot water.COVID-19 is that hot water challenging our national character.It would be tragic if one legacy of COVID-19 is fear, discrimination against foreigners and knee-jerk reactions to cases of infractions.Dr Victor Seah is a senior lecturer of psychology at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

93,Commentary: Does Singapore have to resort to 'slapstick and Singlish' to get public messages across?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-phua-chu-kang-advertisement-vaccination-covid-19-14780310,11 May 2021 06:06AM,"Whether you found it tacky or catchy (or both), the Phua Chu Kang-fronted COVID-19 vaccination music video sure got everyone’s attention. Isn’t that half the battle won, asks Tracy Lee.SINGAPORE: By now, you’ve probably seen Get Your Shot, Steady Pom Pi Pi, the colourful, raucous Singlish-inflected rap music video.The video features local 1990s sitcom character Phua Chu Kang (PCK) exhorting all the doubters and stragglers among us to “Faster go and vaccinate” against COVID-19, with his characteristic cheesy lyrics and dance moves.Less than a week after its May 2 release, the video has attracted hundreds of thousands of views. People were divided on its effectiveness and appropriateness.Comments ranged from the mean (“I should have gotten my vaccine before watching this video - because this is viral”) to the downright evil (“If ever there was a prize for being a village idiot, this guy takes it to a whole new level!!!”) and the snobbish (“I guess the Government’s given up on the Speak Good English campaign”).PCK however found traction with his supporter base (“This put a smile on my face. PCK is so classic”), some of whom wanted even more (“If I vaccinate, will we get a season 9 of PCK?”) and were not afraid to use all-caps to show their love (“SO CRINGE THAT I LOVE IT”).Speaker of Parliament Tan Chuan-Jin even cheekily tweeted: “Get vaccinated! Otherwise we will have to keep playing this video ad nauseum”.This time PCK outdid even himself. He was not only best in Singapore, JB (Johor Bahru), and some say, Batam – as his character famously used to say in each episode of the sitcom’s heydays – he made international headlines.The foreign press took note of the viral video. British daily The Guardian favourably described the song as giving “surprisingly detailed medical advice” in the form of “informative disco”.SO EMBARRASSINGI have to admit, I groaned when I first set eyes on it, then quickly forwarded the clip to my friends with the comment “so embarrassing!”Don’t get me wrong.I’ve absolutely adored Gurmit Singh as Phua Chu Kang (and Irene Ang as Rosie) ever since the sitcom about a loveably eccentric ah beng contractor and his garrulous family came into our lives in 1997.That PCK won Best Comedy Programme at the Asian Television Awards for six consecutive years (from 1998 to 2003), that it enjoyed an eight-season run over 10 years, and that its extremely talented lead character still commands instant recognition 24 years on, just go to show what an enduring pop culture icon and national treasure PCK has become.Yet I couldn’t help feeling I was getting a little tired of the fact that every time a public service message needs announcing, PCK is tapped on to deliver it with buckets full of Singlish kitsch.To his credit, he does that incredibly well. But is there no other way to hammer home an important public message?After all, PCK had already done a rap for the 2003 SARS epidemic. Since the COVID-19 pandemic struck in 2020, he has also already appeared in a techno-style music video called Singapore Be Steady, and another video where he speaks about how Singaporeans can protect themselves from COVID-19.Singapore has no shortage of accolades in dealing with the coronavirus, such as when Bloomberg ranked us the best place in the world to be during the pandemic. We seem to be a pretty modern, sophisticated country that can get its act together and run a tight ship in the face of a persistent virus wreaking havoc across the world.But these days, thanks to the Internet and social media, any public message crafted for local consumption can be shared with or accessed by anyone, anywhere. Can we afford to have the rest of the world think Singaporeans have a mental age of five-year-olds, when we’re supposed to be a global centre for innovative technology, with future-ready and world-class talent?And should we accept that cringe-worthy public communications will always be standard fare for public service announcements and government messaging?BUT IT GETS THE JOB DONEFor now, looking at the global scale of the health crisis and its attendant risks, perhaps the practical answer might be: Whatever works to get the job done.Perhaps bare facts are just too boring — who even remembers those sterile mask-wearing or safe distancing campaigns?Moreover, according to Fortune, such serious public health advertising may be counter-effective “because it incites people’s worst fears rather than provide clear steps viewers can take to save lives”.Besides, sometimes celebrities are the most effective way to drum home that message.“For some people, having celebrities who are familiar, seeing their faces, hearing them speaking up and saying they are taking the vaccine, or they can vouch for the safety of it, will be convincing,” Dr Lisa Cooper, director of John Hopkins Centre for Health Equity told CNBC recently.This has held true for decades outside Singapore. After a photo of Elvis Presley getting vaccinated against polio backstage at The Ed Sullivan Show was splashed all over American papers in the 1950s, the polio vaccination rate among youth went from a measly 0.6 per cent to 60 per cent in six months.So then what better way than to use the PCK character - with song, dance, humour and in a way that can be understood by Singaporeans of all ages. Heck, it was even done in rhyming verses.Public health campaigns are not easy to design. They need to influence public knowledge, attitudes and behaviours, urgently so and with high stakes in the case of COVID-19.They can have patchy results. Sometimes, there isn’t a clear or direct relationship between the messages sent to people and the reactions these people have to the messages.In addition to interpreting messages in very unique ways, experts have also pointed out how people respond differently to messages received, and therefore,  the campaign planner must take many different communication variables into account.Is this message clear and compelling for the intended audience? Will the audience pay attention to it? Will they adjust their behaviours in response?Hence, an effective communication campaign must use carefully designed messages that not only match the interests and abilities of the audience, but also channels  the target audience trusts and can easily access.As such, considerations of wide appeal, expediency and other lowest common denominators are more likely to hold sway than refinement or wit.(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem"" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) RAISE OUR BAR FOR PUBLIC CAMPAIGNSPCK’s latest video has certainly got our attention, we’ve talked about it endlessly over this week, and if you still haven’t seen it, you can on YouTube.Perhaps the Singapore Government is wise to stick with Uncle Phua for now. Our leaders are better off fussing over pressing matters in tackling this latest coronavirus wave in Singapore, and worrying how we are going to cope with fewer construction workers and domestic workers.Like him or hate him, you cannot deny PCK is the most recognisable, relatable national personality. He resonates with most of us.That is probably why every time the Singapore Government needs to send an urgent and serious message – be it SARS and COVID-19 - PCK is called upon.Perhaps the bigger question is why we haven’t seen another national television icon rise after 24 years.Still, I would challenge government communicators to do better for the next public education campaign that doesn’t insult our intelligence, nor make us look like a parochial backwater to outsiders.In the meantime, all the young kids in Singapore who’ve heard the song have probably memorised it and are incessantly singing its catchy and rhyming lyrics at home.That could prove the most effective way to remind parents and grandparents that the vaccination is “safe for most including elderly, because the government got check properly”.Tracy Lee is a freelance writer who writes about food, travel, fashion and beauty.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

94,Former recruiter given jail for using NRIC details of 207 people to redeem masks,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/former-recruiter-contact-tracer-jail-nric-redeem-207-masks-14780690,10 May 2021 05:35PM,"SINGAPORE: A contact tracer used NRIC details he had retained from his previous job as a recruiter to illegally redeem 207 reusable face masks given out by the People's Association (PA) at the height of the COVID-19 pandemic.Emerson Goh Shou En, 32, was given seven months and six weeks' jail and a fine of S$3,000 by a court on Monday (May 10).He pleaded guilty to three charges of cheating the PA, retaining the personal information of 384 people, and leaving his house during the ""circuit breaker"" period to redeem the masks. Another two charges were considered in sentencing.The court heard that Goh was a contact tracer with NTUC FairPrice at the time of the offences.Before that, he was a recruiter with five companies between 2013 and 2020, publishing job openings and advertisements online to look for suitable candidates.Individuals would send him resumes with scanned copies of their National Registration Identity Cards (NRIC) as part of their job applications.Throughout his career in recruiting, Goh did not tell the applicants that he would retain and use the scanned copies of their NRICs for purposes beyond the job applications.In May 2020, the PA began a third round of a nationwide mask collection exercise as part of efforts to provide residents with enough face masks during the pandemic.From May 26 to Jun 14 last year, Singapore residents could collect one reusable mask each from designated vending machines across the country.The machines were automated and allowed people to collect face masks by scanning the barcode on their NRIC, birth certificate or any other Government-issued identification containing a barcode.No further verification was required after the barcode was scanned, and one face mask was issued per NRIC number.On May 26, 2020, Goh used his NRIC to collect his mask from a vending machine at Changi Simei Community Club.Goh realised that there was no further verification required beyond scanning the barcode on his NRIC.He then decided to scan the barcodes on the copies of NRICs belonging to job applicants he had in his phone to redeem more masks.Goh returned to the vending machines at the community club three times between 11.37pm on May 26, 2020 and 6.15pm on May 27, 2020, wearing a white cap to hide his face on two of the occasions.He used NRIC details belonging to 207 people and redeemed the corresponding number of face masks worth S$2,049.30 in total.The constituency director of Changi Simei CC lodged a police report on May 28, 2020, saying that an unidentified man was captured on closed-circuit television collecting reusable face masks from the vending machines.Between May 30, 2020 and Jun 3, 2020, six police reports were lodged by victims saying they could not collect their Government-issued face masks as they had already been redeemed by someone else.The prosecutor called for at least seven months and six weeks' jail and a fine of S$3,000, saying that the case involves exploitation of Government-run automated vending machines that were introduced for greater convenience to Singapore residents.""Importantly, these face masks were meant for other Singapore citizens seeking to protect themselves and their loved ones from the COVID-19 pandemic,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Yeow Xuan. ""A deterrent sentence is therefore warranted to deter like-minded persons who may be emboldened to exploit future government distribution exercises that are digitised for the convenience of the community.""THERE WERE ENOUGH MASKS AT THAT TIME: LAWYERGoh's lawyer Riko Isaac said this was an ""opportunistic crime"" and that his client was ""just making use of information that he had with him at that point in time"".He said Goh did not sell or leak the NRIC information for profit or to cause damage, and had withdrawn the face masks ""during a time where there was no shortage of face masks"".Goh did not take the masks to sell at inflated prices, but instead wanted to protect himself from COVID-19, said the lawyer. Mr Isaac also said PA did not suffer a loss as the masks were recovered from Goh's home.He highlighted Goh's obsessive-compulsive disorder, which results in frequent hand-washing, long baths and using inordinate amounts of soap to wash his hands, but accepted that no contributory or causal link was found between his condition and the offences.""I will highlight that only six people lodged police reports,"" said Mr Isaac. ""When he went to withdraw the masks, many Singaporeans already purchased masks of their own and this was part of a later Government exercise. By this time there was no shortage of masks.""The judge said there was a need to deter like-minded offenders who might want to exploit such Government distribution exercises, and noted that an Institute of Mental Health report found that Goh was not of unsound mind.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

Apart from the victim, the couple has two sons.Sometime in December 2017, the victim was watching television in the living room with her brothers when her father called her into the master bedroom. He wanted to punish her as she had failed her year-end examinations. After the door was closed, he asked his daughter to sit on the floor and close her eyes.He began pinching and slapping her all over her body except for her face. When he pulled her shirt up to her armpit, her bra came unhooked, exposing her chest.The man continued his ""punishment"" by pinching and slapping her chest, later admitting that he had the ""desire"" to touch her breasts when he saw them.When the victim asked if the punishment was over, the accused said ""yes"" and let her go.HE WANTED TO MOLEST HER AGAINAfter the incident, the man ""kept on thinking"" about his daughter's chest. As he wanted to molest her again, he called her into the master bedroom again the following day.The girl had been reading a book in her room, but went to her father's bedroom as instructed, while her brothers were in the living room.The offender asked the victim to close her eyes after closing the bedroom door, before unhooking her bra.He then molested her. After waiting for about two minutes, the victim asked her father is the punishment was over, but he replied that it was not over yet.Feeling uncomfortable, the victim opened her eyes and began crying as she was afraid. Her father then told her the punishment was over and she could leave.The crimes came to light in January 2018, after the girl told a friend in school what had happened and the school was alerted to the incident. The victim's mother was informed and the girl was taken to a hospital, where staff members later alerted the authorities about a case of sexual assault.The prosecutor sought at least two years' jail and six strokes of the cane for the man. She said the degree of sexual exploitation was high, with skin-on-skin contact that cannot be described as fleeting.There was also deliberation on the man's part, as he had asked the victim to go into the master bedroom and closed the door so that she was separated from her two brothers.He had perpetuated the ""highest form of abuse of trust"", she added.WIFE HAS DIVORCED HIM: DEFENCEDefence lawyer Shehzhadee Rahman of IRB Law asked that the jail term be no more than 20 months, saying this was her client's first brush with the law.She added that he had an IQ of only 78, which falls within the borderline impaired or delayed range.He is ""deeply contrite"" for his offences, she said. The incidents have caused his family ""to break apart"", which is ""very painful for him"", she said.His wife has since divorced him and his entire family ""torn apart"", said the lawyer, adding that her client feels ""very disgusted"" at himself and will never be able to forgive himself.""Up till this incident he (was) a very loving father,"" she said.In response, the prosecutor said the Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist had found that the offender was lucid and in full control of his faculties at the time of the offences and knew what he wanted and what he was doing, despite his low IQ.On his family being ""torn apart"", she said: ""That's the result of the accused's own actions.""The judge granted the accused his request for a deferment and will hear the case again later on Monday afternoon to decide how to take into account the two weeks he spent in IMH remand.He could have been jailed up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties for molesting a minor.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

97,Commentary: Three weeks of gym closure shouldn’t be a big deal but it is for many,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-covid-cases-phase-2-gyms-closed-reopen-outdoor-fitness-14762146,08 May 2021 06:01AM,"Being upset about gym closures under the tightened COVID-19 measures is not just about staying fit. For some, it is also about the sudden upheaval of an important aspect of life during a pandemic, says Grace Yeoh.SINGAPORE: I hated going to the gym, until it became my safe space over the last six months of the pandemic.Up till my late-twenties, I equated exercise with toxic gym culture, no thanks to the slew of gym bros and fitness influencers who humble-bragged about their physique any chance they could. No way could anyone look like Adonis reincarnate so effortlessly, as they seemingly could, which intimidated regular plebeians like myself. Even when I finally convinced myself to give it a shot and got a gym membership, working out felt performative and obnoxious, as though a lean and fit physical appearance was a reflection that I could indeed be the proverbial woman who had it all.Not to mention, standing out as one of the few women in a testosterone-filled space in most gyms, made it an unbearably self-conscious hour. Then COVID-19 hit and my relationship with gyms changed. With all routine and structure thrown out the window during the circuit breaker, I didn’t have anything more to lose. I needed to reintegrate those elements of order into my life through the quickest way I knew  — exercise. After several outdoor exercise sessions, like running along the park connectors and playing sports with friends, I realised I preferred individual workouts. I could zone out without interacting. When gyms resumed operations in Phase 2 last year, I decided to set aside my reservations about gym culture, while I used physical activity to get my mental health back on track. And so the gym became a regular haunt. I figured I also needed the strength and conditioning training I could do in a gym with the equipment, and could make better use out of my hour-long exercise sessions. I’d been to a couple of gyms in the past where I felt safe and comfortable, so finding another similar space that met my location and budget criteria, and had a culture I appreciated, wasn't impossible. I developed a routine of four gym visits a week — a habit I was really getting fond of until the Government announced tightened COVID-19 measures on Tuesday (May 4).  Under the tightened measures, indoor gyms like mine will be closed from May 8 to May 30, as they have a “tendency to be hotspots for COVID-19 transmission”, said the Health Ministry. It might be just for three weeks and it’s a reasonable restriction as we hunker down to curb the rise in infections. But understanding why gyms need to close didn’t stop me from feeling like I’d been walloped by a new wave of uncertainty after I’d just found my footing.   A SEMBLANCE OF CERTAINTY Admittedly I’m painfully slower than the average person at adapting to change. For at least half a year after the pandemic began, I spent most days languishing at home. Adam Grant, best-selling author and organisational psychologist, described languishing as an experience that’s neither burnout nor depression, but nonetheless feels “somewhat joyless and aimless”. “Languishing is a sense of stagnation and emptiness. It feels as if you’re muddling through your days, looking at your life through a foggy windshield,” he wrote in a New York Times article. But after more than a year of not knowing when we could return to the office regularly, stop wearing masks, or travel again without the fear of disease, I rediscovered a semblance of certainty within the confines of an indoor gym. At the gym, I knew which weights I wanted to lift and machines I wanted to use. I could plan for a certain number of reps in a fixed amount of sets. I even figured out the timings when the gym was emptier, so I could take my time with every equipment. Since the pandemic began, our linear concept of time has been warped. Living in limbo, between the “Old Normal” and the “New Normal”, a month sometimes felt like a week, and other times, like a decade. But in the gym, time was measured in sets. An hour meant a 20-minute run, followed by six sets of 10 to 15 reps, while half an hour meant cutting out my treadmill run. There was a sense of rhythm and autonomy in my life again. A toned body was just a bonus. Looking after my physical health also saved my mental health. WORKING OUT AT HOME NOT THE SAMENaysayers might wonder why not save the money and workout at home. It’s also probably more hygienic than sharing gym equipment with many other sweaty bodies. Just before the circuit breaker kicked in last year, there were photos on social media of long queues and empty shelves at Decathlon. This sparked memes mocking people who seemed to build their personality around going to the gym, a comparatively superficial concern in a pandemic. At the risk of sounding excessively fussy, working out at home isn’t the same — even if you have a Peloton, yoga mat, a set of weights, a pair of overpriced tights, and Chloe Ting’s abs challenge on loop. Working out in the gym isn’t just about having the right equipment. Having a different, dedicated space matters as much. Humans are probably not meant to work, eat, sleep, exercise and live in one space.There is also an unspoken comfort in seeing familiar faces in the gym, even if we never speak. For someone who doesn’t want to interact when I’m working out, I appreciate not being isolated at home or exercising alone in public.I’ve found this quiet camaraderie in a gym to be a pleasant compromise.Having the presence of a like-minded community also surprisingly motivated me and held me accountable on days I was tempted to slack off. The next three weeks won’t be enough time to carve out a new routine lest we can’t return to the gym in June. But a year of living under the pandemic has taught me that even the best laid plans can be upended by a pesky virus.If I could learn to love the gym, maybe I can learn to embrace uncertainty, adapt to change and even workout to a chirpy Blogilates YouTube video at home. It will just take a lot more than three weeks.  Grace Yeoh is a senior journalist with CNA Insider.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

Another five charges including occasions where she failed to wear a mask were considered in sentencing.As Kaur had previously been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks with no mental disorder found, she will not have to serve any additional jail time.Kaur, who had her mask below her nose throughout her time in court, claimed that she suffered from asthma and did not want to wear a mask as she thought it would affect her ability to breathe.Her lawyer also told the court that his client, a physiotherapist who lived for many years in Australia, has been ""humiliated"" as well as ""harassed"" by reporters and commenters on social media.The court heard that Kaur went to the wet market section at the basement of a hawker centre at Blk 320, Shunfu Road on the morning of May 3, 2020, to buy groceries.She deliberately went near the closing time as she wanted to avoid any crowd, her lawyers said.LACK OF MASK DREW ATTENTION FROM ONLOOKERSKaur was not wearing a mask at the time and drew the attention of several people at the market. A woman whose parents owned a stall at the market confronted Kaur and told her she should be wearing a mask.Kaur retorted that she did not need to wear a mask as she was not sick, said the prosecutor.By 12.16pm, the exchange had led to an argument and a commotion, as Kaur was ""defiant and adamant"" on not wearing a mask. The other woman called the police. Hawker stall owners and customers at the wet market were drawn to the scene, with at least seven witnesses listed in court documents.Kaur was shouting loudly and said the police could not do anything to her, and that she was a ""sovereign"". She also said she was not a person, but ""we the people"", the court heard.This behaviour caused annoyance to those there, said Deputy Public Prosecutor V Jesudevan. Kaur also refused to wear a mask that was offered to her by someone in the crowd.PROSECUTOR CALLS FOR JAIL AND MAXIMUM FINEMr Jesudevan asked for two weeks' jail for the mask offence and the maximum fine of S$2,000 for the public nuisance charge. He said Kaur was ""an openly defiant person in the face of law enforcement being present and the glare of the public"".""One must also bear in mind what she uttered here - when she uttered that she was sovereign, we take it to be that she is referring to a movement in the US, which its adherence ... rejects Government, rejects authority and rejects police,"" he said.He said the charges taken into consideration involve Kaur travelling some distance without a mask.Taking aim at the defence's arguments and reliance on private psychiatric reports claiming that Kaur suffers from asthma and depression, Mr Jesudevan said the IMH did not find that Kaur had any mental disorder.Referring to a 2013 medical report the defence tendered indicating acute bronchitis in Kaur, the prosecutor pointed out that Kaur had left the clinic without her medicine or an asthma management plan, which shows it could not have been very serious.Another diagnosis was given by a doctor in Australia in October 2020 while Kaur was in Singapore, and ""it's curious to see how the doctor is able to physically diagnose her"", said Mr Jesudevan.He added that if Kaur had complied with a doctor's order to use an inhaler, he did not see why she could not wear a mask. None of the doctors' notes said she was not in a position to don a mask, he said.""Certainly, she's wearing one now, even though it's not covering her nose,"" he said.He added that reports relied on by the defence showed that Kaur was not eventually diagnosed with depression, even though she had previously been given antidepressants.DEFENCE HIGHLIGHTS DIFFICULT CHILDHOOD, PERSONAL CIRCUMSTANCESDefence lawyer Kertar Singh sought a fine, saying his client had ""a very difficult childhood"", with her father leaving the matrimonial home when she was four or five.Her mother raised her and her younger brother single-handedly, but she was ""motivated to excel"" despite this, he said. She did a course in biotechnology in Ngee Ann Polytechnic and left Singapore in 2001 for Canberra, where she obtained a bachelor's degree in applied science and later took a master's degree.She worked as a physiotherapist in Australia before returning to Singapore in 2008 to be closer to her mother. After her return, she tried to find a job in Singapore, but failed to do so.""In 2020, the COVID-19 situation made things even worse for her,"" said Mr Singh. ""It changed the social and economic landscape, which adversely affected her, and it was during this period sometime in late January 2020, in the midst of a nationwide panic to stock up on masks, where the (multi-ministry taskforce) said to wear a mask only if you are sick and need to see a doctor.""He said this was the first impression that Kaur got, and the Government subsequently changed their stance on the use of masks. The offence was committed days after the Government mandated the wearing of masks when leaving the home, said Mr Singh.He pointed to the ""extent of humiliation"" his client received from the crowd at the market, taking pictures and videos of her and shouting at her. ""Pam felt frightened and terrified,"" he said. He added that she thought wearing a mask would hinder her ability to breathe normally or comfortably.He said the police investigations as well as her remand at IMH amounted to a traumatic experience for her and have left an indelible impression on her.HUMILIATION ON SOCIAL MEDIA""Further, your honour, the matter appears to have attracted an unhealthy level of publicity. Given her fragile state of mind, she is unable to cope with the humiliation from social media, badgering by members of the public,"" said Mr Singh.He added that his client has ""suffered in silence"" and seeks to put this episode behind her, but is worried that the social media bullying will continue even after she has paid the price.She has since been careful to adhere to the measures and ""has been dutifully wearing a mask when she leaves home"", said Mr Singh.When his colleague tried to argue about how the members of the public had chosen to gather around Kaur during the pandemic, the judge pointed out that she had drawn attention to herself by not wearing a mask.District Judge Ronald Gwee said the incidents demonstrate ""an egregious disregard for provisions that were imposed for the safety of everyone during the early days of the most serious aspects of the COVID-19 pandemic"".""Such provisions were made public and there's no reason for anyone to state that they were not aware of such provisions and more so to be in blatant disregard and disobedience of such provisions,"" he said.For not wearing a mask without reasonable excuse, Kaur could have been jailed up to six months, fined up to S$10,000, or both. For public nuisance, she could have been fined up to S$2,000.This is the lowest overall number of total daily cases reported in Singapore since Jun 9 when four infections were identified.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

99,Youth workers to get more support to develop careers in the sector and deal with burnout,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/youth-workers-mentorship-scheme-burnout-msf-14762134,07 May 2021 03:44PM,"SINGAPORE: Youth workers can expect more mentorship and support in developing their careers, with the launch of two pilot schemes on Friday (May 7).Practitioners in the youth work sector deal with a range of issues, from counselling vulnerable or at-risk youth to organising outreach initiatives and having programmes to help them return to schools or employment.The supervision scheme will enable youth workers to receive continuing professional education from experienced practitioners. ""Under the scheme, youth workers who are unable to obtain clinical supervision at their organisations may directly seek out and engage an experienced supervisor from an approved registry maintained by Youth Work Association Singapore (YWAS),"" said the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF).The mentorship scheme, on the other hand, supports youth workers beyond clinical practice. They will be paired with experienced mentors who will provide guidance in their personal and career development.HELPING YOUTH WORKERS COPE WITH BURNOUTSupervision and mentorship from senior youth workers are necessary to solve the issue of “longevity” among younger youth workers, said Mr Wilson Tan, the executive director of Youth Guidance Outreach Services.Working with youth at risk is a key part of the profession, from keeping them out of gangs to lending them a listening ear.“Over the first two to three years (in the profession), youth workers really go all out in engaging youths to the extent that they get disillusioned, burnt out, tired out. Then they leave the youth work sector,” added Mr Tan, who is also one of the appointed mentors for the mentorship scheme.  Speaking from personal experience of being a youth worker for more than a decade, he acknowledged that keeping up the energy and passion to engage youth can be “energy sapping”.“Supervision (and mentorship) is crucial. When we impart our experiences and skillsets to the next group of young youth workers, they can receive proper (guidance) that will help to pace out their youth work journey,” he added.Getting youth workers to stay in the industry for the long haul also benefits the youth they work with.“We don’t want youth workers to be there only for a short period of time, like six months, and then disappear from the youth’s life,” added Mr Tan.“When youths are going through complex issues, it’s a long term struggle, and having significant people who can journey with them for a prolonged period of time will be helpful.”YOUTH WORKERS ‘PIVOTAL’ DURING COVID-19Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, youth workers have been dealing with more cases of high risk, vulnerable young people who need support.This makes youth workers “very susceptible” to burnout, said Ms Lena Teo, director of therapy and mental wellness services at CARE Singapore.She was speaking to CNA at the inaugural Youth Work Day, organised by the Social Service SkillsFuture Tripartite Taskforce (STT) Youth Work Sub-Team, in partnership with the Youth Work Association Singapore and MSF.A survey conducted by the National Youth Council during the COVID-19 ""circuit breaker"" on the impact of COVID-19 on youth found that the top challenges they faced are related to mental health, their ability to cope with studies, as well as job and income security.The impact is more pronounced for those from challenging circumstances and families that are less equipped to deal with the economic disruptions, according to the survey.“Youth workers play a pivotal role in supporting youths who are most affected by the crisis,” said Mr Eric Chua, parliamentary secretary for MSF and the Ministry of Culture, Community and Youth, at the event.“Some went to great lengths to secure IT devices for (youth) to have access to home-based learning. Some equipped youths with skills to secure a job and even accompanied them for interviews. They worked with youths’ families to ensure that wraparound support was provided.”Given the ever-changing youth culture and lingo, supervision and mentorship for youth workers “should be continuous” too, said Ms Teo, who is one of the supervisors under the supervision scheme.“Youth workers should get continuous education to keep up to date. This ongoing process will help them become more effective at helping the youth at risk.”Mr Chua noted that youth work is “a professional practice that requires both hard and heart work”.“I’ve observed that many (youth workers) share similar attributes, such as energy, patience, charisma, creativity, adaptability, positivity and youthfulness at heart. These qualities are critical in meeting the demands of working with youth, who are constantly experiencing changes on many fronts,” he added.“As youth workers adapt to the changing youth landscape, we must ensure adequate support and training is provided to them … We must look at supporting their personal and professional growth.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

100,"Companies seek alternatives as workers from India, Bangladesh dwindle",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/companies-seek-alternatives-as-workers-from-india-bangladesh-14755650,07 May 2021 02:08PM,"SINGAPORE: Companies that have traditionally relied on migrant workers from India and Bangladesh are now looking further afield for labour, several firms told CNA.However, they also said that they are just starting to explore the options, and to expect project delays and disruptions for the time being.From May 2, Singapore barred entry or transit for visitors with recent travel history to Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. This travel ban, which includes long-term pass holders, came amid a series of moves to tighten Singapore borders as the COVID-19 outbreak in India worsens and Singapore clocked more local coronavirus cases in recent weeks.Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the COVID-19 multi-ministry task force, had acknowledged that this will have an impact on industries such as construction, and that many small- and medium-sized enterprises in Singapore and contractors will be affected.The Building and Construction Authority on Apr 26 said that it will grant more flexibility for firms to bring in workers from China, among other support measures. But companies told CNA that this will not make up the shortfall.SHORTAGE OF WORKERS SINCE LAST YEARA manager in the construction industry, who only wanted to be know as Alan, said that the cost of hiring workers from China will ""shoot up"" as demand increases.""As it is, the daily rate for a Chinese worker is about S$200 to S$300 per day. With this move, don't be surprised that the cost will go up 30 per cent to 40 per cent more for each worker,"" he said.""However, I also think many companies will hold back on hiring more Chinese workers, as they don't have the budget to. And this will lead to more project delays.""This daily rate includes costs such as housing, levies and insurance for the worker, which the company has to pay. The daily rate for workers from India or Bangladesh is about S$120 to S$150 now, up from S$70 to S$80 in the past.Mr Kenneth Loo, COO of Straits Construction, said that the situation is ""very tight"", and manpower was short before the travel restrictions kicked in. He estimates that there is a 30 to 40 per cent shortage of workers currently.""There was a net decrease of workers from the system practically the whole of last year ... now with the stoppage from India, that makes the whole scenario even more challenging,"" he said.He added that while workers from China can fill some gaps, fewer are willing to come to Singapore as economic opportunities in China improve.""I think we have no choice, we are still looking,"" he said in response to a question on whether they are sourcing for workers from other countries.The Singapore Contractors Association Limited (SCAL) said on Apr 23 that the labour crunch has already caused delay of construction projects for nine to 12 months, while the cost of labour and materials has escalated by 30 per cent to 50 per cent. ""Some companies may be forced to close and it will adversely impact about 100,000 residents working in the construction sector,"" said the association, adding that there will be project delays.Ms Christine Sun, OrangeTee senior vice president of research & analytics, said that the shortage is likely to be in the short to mid-term. ""The situation may start to stabilise when more people are being vaccinated and travel restrictions are eased again,"" she said. ""Some affected homeowners may need to adjust their wedding or family planning.""LANDSCAPE INDUSTRY AFFECTEDCompanies in the landscape industry also said that they face a lack of workers, with some telling CNA that they have had to turn down projects.Mr Julian Shi of Nature Landscapes said that they have had migrant workers resign or return on leave in the past months but have had difficulty replacing them. The company is now trying to hire about 20 to 40 foreign workers. ""We are not looking at alternatives for the time being. Our present solution is to adapt with the limitation in resources. We are working with service buyers to extend project timelines,"" he said.Mr Edmund Toh, managing director of ET Landscape and Services said that the company has been trying to hire foreign workers since December. They initially tried to get workers from Myanmar but the coup in February put a stop to that. They are now trying to get workers from Vietnam. Last week, the Landscape Industry Association (Singapore) sent out a notice to service buyers to say that it supports the tighter border controls and appealed to them to postpone non-essential work so that their workers will not ""burnout"".Chairman Goh Eng Lam said that their companies will be working with the Ministry of Manpower and other agencies to seek other sources of foreign manpower.Workers from India and Bangladesh do essential work such as grass cutting and tree works, he said. He thinks there will be a 15 to 20 per cent shortage of workers in the coming months.MIND WORKERS' HEALTHAssistant Professor Laavanya Kathiravelu from Nanyang Technological University’s School of Social Sciences, whose work has centred around migrant labour from South Asia, said that a few other industries might be affected. These include the F&B industry, shipyard and manufacturing industries, as well as companies that engage in repairs and maintenance work. ""These are all areas of our economy that rely heavily on South Asian migrant labour,"" she said. She said that migrant workers who are still working in Singapore are being expected to take on heavier workloads and longer working hours as a result of this labour shortage. ""This has caused issues of overwork among some of the population. This, in turn, may lead to deteriorating mental health as well as increasing the desire to return to the home country as a result of being unable to handle increased demands by employers,"" she added. Mr Goh also warned against ""overloading"" landscape workers, asking service buyers to consider the workers' personal and mental health.""We cannot take things for granted (and think) that they are superman,"" he said. ""If they do not have enough rest or fall sick, it's going to make matters worse.""Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

101,Commentary: My harrowing brush with COVID-19 in New Delhi as India is ravaged,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/india-covid-19-coronavirus-cases-treatment-drugs-hospital-oxygen-14754902,07 May 2021 06:01AM,"It was harrowing to be sick from a notoriously unpredictable virus knowing that drugs, hospital beds and oxygen were scarce, says the Financial Times’ New Delhi correspondent Amy Kazmin.NEW DELHI: As a foreign correspondent, my job is to tell India’s stories, not be part of them. But when I started feeling feverish while writing an article about COVID-19 vaccine policy last month, I had a gut feeling that the SARS-CoV-2 virus had found me.I hoped it was exhaustion that I’d sleep off but the next day, still feverish, I was urged to take a COVID-19 test.A leading diagnostic lab chain, which earlier had run an efficient home-testing service, had stopped answering its phones and responding to online requests. But a doctor friend persuaded one of the lab’s phlebotomists to collect my sample.Two days later, the results confirmed I was part of the ferocious coronavirus wave battering India and pushing its healthcare system to breaking point.Over the following days, my physical symptoms remained mild.But it was still harrowing to be sick from a notoriously unpredictable virus knowing that drugs, hospital beds and oxygen were scarce. I suffered constant anxiety knowing I’d struggle to get medical help if I took a turn for the worse.(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem"" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) THE HUNT FOR MEDICATIONI quickly discovered that I’d been so focused on avoiding infection that I had no clue what to do once sick.A friend connected me to a Kolkata-based infectious disease specialist, who felt I was at low risk for severe illness. I’d had the first dose of a COVID-19 vaccine 10 days before my fever started. But the doctor urged me to treat the illness aggressively from the start, given the chaos at hospitals.He prescribed the antiviral drug, favipiravir, now undergoing clinical trials in the UK as a potential COVID-19 therapy but already approved in India for emergency use. Many of his patients had taken it, he said, and none suffered severely, including people in their 90s.Normally, I’m reluctant to medicate. I knew favipiravir’s effectiveness as a coronavirus treatment wasn’t yet scientifically validated. But with hospitals turning away ailing patients, the logic of taking an experimental drug made sense.The challenge, I discovered, was to get hold of it. I called five pharmacies, but all had run out of stock. A friend called six more to no avail.I panicked – the doctor wanted me to start the drug fast and Delhi was hours from the start of a weekend curfew.Then a friend, who’d heard I was COVID-19 positive, called.“I’m looking for this drug,” I told her. “Any idea where I can get it?” She said she’d check.It turned out that people with foresight had prepared small emergency drug stashes. Her friend had such a stash and was willing to share it.I was elated to get the pills to start treatment that night. But it wasn’t enough for the prescribed course.Days later I spent hours calling pharmacies in an unsuccessful hunt for more, before finally begging an industry friend to help.DESPERATION, ANGER, GRIEFMy difficulties pale in comparison with the desperation, anger and grief beyond my sickroom. My Twitter feed was filled with pleas for hospital beds, oxygen cylinders, the antiviral remdesivir, plasma or a place in an intensive care unit. Top hospitals begged on Twitter for refills of dwindling oxygen supplies.Friends and many professional contacts were fighting for their lives. Doctor friends were weeping with impotent rage.There was much grim news of death. A former Indian ambassador died after hours waiting in a hospital parking lot for admission; inpatients whose oxygen ran out; a top politician’s 34-year-old son, young journalists. Crematoriums struggled with an unprecedented flow of bodies.I decided I had to tune out of the unfolding crisis, to ensure my physical recovery and to protect my mental health. I stopped checking Twitter. Newspapers piled up, unread.Once I felt better and tuned back, I saw Narendra Modi’s government had cynically expanded eligibility for vaccination to all over the age of 18, despite an acute shortage of jabs.And with thousands dying daily, often for want of medical help, the health minister was callously citing dubious official data to claim India’s COVID-19 fatality rate was lower than richer countries – hardly consolation to grief-stricken families.Today, I’ve recovered from my encounter with the virus. It will take far longer to get over the trauma of watching this calamity engulf the place I call home.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

102,Commentary: Grief from losing loved ones to COVID-19 will spill into workplaces,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/grief-mental-health-covid-19-pandemic-workers-wellness-13897940,07 May 2021 06:01AM,"There has been great disruption to industries, jobs and the way we work during COVID-19, in addition to personal loss but organisations and leaders may not recognise this grief, say two organisational behavioural experts.DENVER, Colorado: The death, human suffering, and loss stemming from COVID-19 is unprecedented in living memory and may have caused unresolved grief.For those who have lost loved ones, there may be no ceremonies to say final goodbyes and no grieving together.When the scale of the devastation reaches heights that make mass burials a logistical necessity, like in India, the pain can be profound.The pandemic is also fuelling personal losses of all kinds—postponed weddings, missed graduations, painful separations from family and friends, laid-off or furloughed colleagues, shuttered offices. In Singapore, the return to Phase 2 has been welcomed in tackling fears of another new wave, but the announcement has been accompanied by disquiet. Didn’t we conquer COVID-19 last year?These developments can create a lingering sense of grief that seeps into the workplace. If unaddressed, it can harm a leader’s effectiveness and may become debilitating if unaddressed.In our work over two decades with the International Institute for Management Development’s (IMD) High Performance Leadership programme, we have been surprised by how pervasive unresolved grief can be - affecting fully one-third of the 7,000 plus executives we’ve worked with - how likely it is that the symptoms go unnoticed or undiscussed, and how ill-equipped organisations are to handle it.At work, a missed promotion, losing a key customer or client, the end of a project or the disbanding of a team, the retirement of a beloved colleague or boss can all spark feelings of grief that include shock, anger, sadness, and fear. Some of these trigger events have been exacerbated during the pandemic.Our research shows that the pre-pandemic financial cost of grief to organisations appears high: US$75 billion a year for US companies, according to one study.Yet, the loss of leadership capability and potential that results from unresolved grief, as well as the human suffering and pain, is beyond measure.(Are COVID-19 vaccines still effective against new variants? And could these increase the risk of reinfection? Experts explain why COVID-19 could become a “chronic problem"" on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast.) THE COST OF GRIEFIn the case of Sam, a business-unit leader in a large global company, the guilt and pain associated with his mother’s death from COVID-19 and the fact that Sam missed his chance to say goodbye, as he lived in another country and could not get permission to travel in time, morphed into a dull, generalised anger that he directed against his company and its people.He subconsciously blamed work for stopping his relationship with his mother in her final months. Sam had been a star, but after his mother’s death he failed to step up even when he was handpicked to lead an initiative by the company’s global leadership.Sam’s own leadership suffered - he was less inspiring and more withdrawn, while under the surface, he burned with resentment.Even more common during the pandemic have been “ceremonial losses” – the inability to attend landmark life events like births, graduations, weddings and funerals. It is not simply the loss of the events themselves, but the lost opportunities to create memories individuals and families would honour for life. These losses have compounded social isolation during this period.Leaders often fail to recognise that they carry these burdens. Their organisations are ill-equipped to manage the challenge. It looks like we still expect people to leave their emotions at the door when they enter the workplace.The focus of support for workplace grief has generally been helping colleagues after the death of an employee. Yet many sources of loss and grief are different.A recent study of former Lehman Brothers bankers found that after the company collapsed in 2008, many employees went through all the feelings we associate with grief. As one employee described: “I felt I lost one of my beloved . . . even though it might sound [dramatic], still, when I think about those days, I feel I was in a sort of funeral.”A CEO we know revealed the depth of his shock and feelings of loss just hours after the news that his beloved organisation had been acquired, when he asked plaintively, “What do I tell my family?” as he had lost his sense of attachment, territory, structure, and control—central aspects of his very identity.Similarly, during COVID-19 there has been great disruption to industries, jobs and the way we work. How many organisations recognise the grief this may have caused their employees, including leaders, and are taking steps to resolve them?BECOME AWARE AND ACCEPTING REALITYLeaders who want to overcome grief must pass through a three-stage process: Becoming consciously aware of the problem, accepting the pain of the loss and, finally, taking actions that help them let go of the past and find new meaning from the experience.Awareness is the first step to resolving any problem, but our subconscious minds are great at keeping us safely unaware of things that might harm us emotionally.We have found that executives with unresolved grief are seldom able to connect the dots between their past trauma and present behaviour.In Sam’s case, the grief associated with his mother’s death was fresh and top of mind. It wrecked his emotional state. What Sam hadn’t seen was the toll on his behaviour and how much it was diminishing his ability—and indeed his willingness—to lead.For Sam, as with many executives we’ve worked with, it was this combination of connecting the dots and counting the cost of his unresolved grief that proved a breakthrough.Awareness reflects knowledge of reality, but acceptance requires an act of will.We have been surprised to see how otherwise rational human beings persist in irrational denial. However, confronting such raw emotions can be especially challenging for senior executives.Expressing emotion means making yourself vulnerable. Leaders often resist this as they worry it could undercut their status within their teams. In fact, the opposite is true: Leaders who demonstrate vulnerability perform better and have more loyal and engaged teams.RECONSTRUCT YOUR MEMORYScientific research shows that acceptance alone doesn’t bring an end to grieving. To truly move on, an individual must find a way to create personal meaning from the loss.Grief expert David Kessler’s work in repositioning grief describes this process.It begins by raising the loss - and the narrative embedded in it - to one’s conscious emotional experience.We then juxtapose that narrative with a new one that directly confronts the memory with a new possibility - the “mismatch,” in this case - and repeat this multiple times to help the brain reorganise the old memory and experience it in a new way.Organisations can help turn grief around. Leadership teams can start by setting the right tone. Leaders who open themselves to those around them inspire openness and signal an availability and warmth that draws others out.Senior executives should also prompt difficult conversations about grief at times when the source of grief is obvious - and even when it’s not so obvious, such as during a strategic restructuring or an abrupt leadership transition.Organisational cultures should also have their own rituals, which can send powerful signals of recovery and transformation.Japanese organisations are known for their rituals when there are senior-leadership transitions, and help staffers get over failed experiments by celebrating their boldness with food, drinks and reflections on what was learned.Unresolved grief is a quietly destructive force that derails leaders and hurts organisations during the best of times.

104,"Man acquitted of sexually abusing stepson but jailed for stalking his girlfriend, criminal intimidation",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-acquitted-of-sexually-abusing-stepson-jailed-stalking-14742810,04 May 2021 09:11PM,"SINGAPORE: A man accused of sexually grooming his stepson over nine years to the extent that the underage boy asked for sexual acts was acquitted of all sex offences against him on Tuesday (May 4). The 55-year-old man, who cannot be named because of a gag order protecting his stepson's identity, was convicted of two other charges of stalking his stepson's girlfriend and criminal intimidation against his wife and stepson. He was given a year's jail for these two charges. Since he has been in remand for about two years and five months, he will likely be released on Tuesday or Wednesday.The man went on trial for 15 charges including sexual assault by penetration, sexual assault of a minor, outrage of modesty and procuring an indecent act by a child.However, Justice Chua Lee Ming acquitted him of the 13 assorted charges relating to the sexual abuse of his stepson, who is now 22.He convicted the man only of stalking his stepson's girlfriend in 2015 and 2016 by sending harassing messages and loitering near her home, and of criminally intimidating his own wife by pointing a chopper at her and saying he was going to kill her son three days after he told his family about the allegations.THE PROSECUTION'S CASEAccording to the prosecution's case, the man sexually groomed his stepson between 2007 and 2012, when the boy was between eight and 14.They said the boy grew accustomed to the sex acts because of their ""sheer frequency"" and ""even on some occasions, initiated the sexual acts by asking for ... that thing"". He was unaware the acts were wrong and was told by the older man to keep their activities a secret, said prosecutors.When the stepson got a girlfriend in 2015 and introduced her to the offender and his wife, the offender allegedly tried to initiate sex acts again, the prosecution claimed in their case.According to the prosecution, when the stepson resisted him, the older man began to harass the girlfriend until the stepson gave in. On Jan 15, 2016, when the older man tried to enter the shower with him, the stepson broke down and told his mother about what happened.Most of his family pressured him against pursuing the matter, but the stepson filed a police report and gave statements to the police, the court heard during the trial.The stepson's mother testified about her ""anger"" when she first found out about the allegations but said she continued to visit her husband in prison. She also repeatedly asked her son to withdraw the case ""because I felt this was a family problem"" and her husband was ""already old"".The defence had argued that the stepson's versions of events provided in court were different from all the statements he provided to the police, and that none of the prosecution witnesses was able to corroborate the events. Their versions were also inconsistent with the stepson's, they argued. Instead, the accused was consistent throughout in his denial of the sexual assault.THE JUDGE'S FINDINGSIn acquitting the man of the sexual offences, Justice Chua said cases involving such offences require the complainant's evidence to be unusually convincing that the prosecution's case is proven beyond reasonable doubt solely on that basis.He agreed with the defence - Mr Pramnath Vijayakumar and Ms Sadhana Rai from Law Society Pro Bono Services - that the stepson's evidence is not so unusually convincing as to amount to proof beyond reasonable doubt, because of the ""many inconsistencies in his evidence"".""I have come to this conclusion after having considered the evidence in detail, and giving due consideration to, among other things, the lapse of time and the complainant's age at the time of the alleged offences,"" he said. Justice Chua said the inconsistencies relate to the manner that the sexual assault was carried out, and are ""extensive"". He gave specific examples of how the stepson's evidence in court was repeatedly at odds with what he had earlier said in police statements.In one incident, the stepson testified in court that he recalled a particular sex act in the living room of their one-room flat in 2012 because it was the last time that it happened between him and the accused.However, in a statement he gave to the police in 2016, he had said that the older man performed the sex act in 2015. The judge gave several other examples of inconsistencies that are too graphic to detail.""One may argue about the materiality of some of the inconsistencies, viewed in isolation,"" he said. ""However, the inconsistencies have to be viewed in context.""NUMEROUS AND EXTENSIVE INCONSISTENCIESHe said the inconsistencies were both numerous and extensive, and that the prosecution's case was that the stepson was able to pinpoint timeframes of the incidents by relying on his ""episodic memory"" - such as the first incident of sexual intrusion in 2007 and the first incident of penetration before his PSLE in 2010. ""The impactful nature of these incidents makes the numerous and extensive inconsistencies even more significant,"" said Justice Chua. ""The complainant has not given credible explanations for the inconsistencies. Viewed in totality and in context, the inconsistencies give rise to grave doubts about the credibility of the complainant’s evidence as to the alleged offences. I agree with the defence that the complainant’s credit has been impeached.""He pointed to other types of evidence that contribute to doubts about the credibility of the stepson's evidence: He had testified that the sexual acts began in 2007 and continued without any breaks, including incidents from January to March 2010. However, the accused was in prison from May 2009 to March 2010. When reminded of this fact and given a chance to explain, he maintained that he remembered sexual activity in the first three months of 2010 and later said that ""maybe there were"" sexual activities.The offender moved into the one-room flat after marrying his stepson's mother in June 2007. The room was shared by the stepson's sister and her husband, and there were five adults and a baby living in the one-room flat for most of the time.""I accept that not everyone would have been at home at the same time. Nevertheless, I have doubts about the complainant's allegations that the accused frequently engaged in sexual activities with the complainant at the flat,"" said the judge.The stepson had also claimed that he realised the acts were wrong only when he was in Secondary 3 when he began attending science and religious classes. He claimed his religious teacher told him it is sinful for two people of the same gender to have sex.However, his cousin, who also attended the classes, testified that the complainant went only once or twice a month from 2007 and 2010 because he asked him to. The complainant was not a student, he went just to ""hang out"" and he did not go in 2013 when he was in Secondary 3, his cousin said.The judge also noted that while the stepson was diagnosed by the Institute of Mental Health to have panic disorder without agoraphobia, the alleged sexual incidents do not appear to be the stressors.Instead, the stressors are: That the accused did not believe his stepson was not well, that the accused was in jail and the stress of National Service.The man could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years if convicted of sexually assaulting a minor. The penalties for sexual penetration of a minor are a maximum jail term of 10 years, a fine, or both, while molesting a minor draws up to five years' jail, a fine, caning, or any combination of these punishments.If he had been convicted of committing or procuring the commission of any indecent act with a child, he could have been jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000, or both for the first offence.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

105,12 companies recognised for ‘exemplary efforts’ to promote mental health at work,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-silver-ribbon-employers-award-14741218,04 May 2021 01:05PM,"SINGAPORE: Twelve employers were given awards for creating mentally friendly and healthy working environments by mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore), on Tuesday (May 4).The employers are Bizlink Centre Singapore Ltd, FedEx Express, Jardines MINDSET, Jebsen & Jessen Group, Johnson & Johnson Singapore, Otsuka Pharmaceuticals (Singapore) Pte Ltd, Pocari Sweat Singapore, Project X, PSA Corporation Limited, Rio Tinto, Singapore Civil Defence Force and Twitter Asia Pacific.They were commended for promoting positive mental health awareness in their workplace, offering job opportunities to persons with mental health issues, commemorating World Mental Health Day, equipping their staff with knowledge on identifying mental health issues, and providing accommodation for staff with mental health issues.  “(The award winners have made) exemplary efforts in championing mental wellbeing in their workplaces ... This is especially timely, given the rising awareness of mental wellbeing at workplaces,” said Zaqy Mohamad, Senior Minister of State for Manpower and guest-of-honour at the event.“Mental health is just as important as physical health and it can have a significant impact on workers' productivity.”WORKPLACE MENTAL HEALTH IN THE PANDEMICAccording to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 264 million people suffer from depression globally, with many of these people also experiencing symptoms of anxiety, said Ellen Lee, president of Silver Ribbon.She added that a negative working environment can worsen these mental health problems, leading to physical health issues, harmful use of substances or alcohol, absenteeism, and lost productivity.  Working arrangements under the COVID-19 pandemic have resurfaced the importance of looking after employees’ mental wellbeing.In an online survey conducted by Silver Ribbon in April last year, one in four experienced “low mood, anxiety and loneliness more than usual”, said Ms Lee.Clients who attended Silver Ribbon’s complimentary online emotional support shared that they felt “stressed out while working from home, handling household chores and taking care of their loved ones”, she added.Employers also said that their employees requested Silver Ribbon’s assistance to handle crises and conduct talks for them.WALKING THE TALKBeyond seeking help from Silver Ribbon, employers who received the award have their own mental wellbeing initiatives.At Rio Tinto, a global mining company, leaders and employees get mental health training to recognise “psychosocial hazards”, so they can notice a problem and extend help before it develops, said Karina Gistelinck, vice president for minerals sales and marketing.The company also has peer support programmes with “specially-trained” employees playing a pivotal role to support fellow colleagues, as those who are in distress are “more likely to reach out to friends and colleagues than to use more formal support programmes”, she added.In the company’s Singapore office, Rio Tinto has an Employee Assistance Programme that makes it easier for colleagues and their families to access professional psychologists for help.Similarly at Jardines MINDSET, employees are encouraged to use their 24-hour anonymous counselling service.Managers and HR personnel are also trained in “mental health first-aid”, while managers are encouraged to “exercise discretion” in giving team members time off due to mental health related issues, said Jeffery Tan, CEO of Jardines MINDSET.“During these scenarios, it might be difficult for employees to produce an MC (medical certificate), but this shouldn’t stop them from getting a day off. We want to build a safe environment for our employees to speak openly about their troubles and ask for help when necessary,” added Mr Tan.GOOD MENTAL HEALTH IS GOOD BUSINESS SENSEAside from boosting morale, mental health initiatives in the workplace can help the company’s bottom line.  “According to WHO, every $1 put into scaled up treatment for common mental disorders, there is a return-on-investment of $4 in improved health and productivity,” said Mr Tan.“An inclusive and safe workplace culture boosts employee morale, and creates a workplace employees are happy with and thus more inclined to remain at.”While there is “no magic bullet” for workplace mental health, Mr Tan said a large part of mental wellbeing comes down to “creating more human-centered work cultures that put employees first”.Hiring people with mental health conditions is even part of business strategy at companies like Bizlink Centre.“Once (these employees) adapt and perform, they bring stability to the workforce. They tend to be committed to delivering the requirements in their job role and could bring a positive mindset and resilience to the workforce,” said Ang Li May, CEO of Bizlink Centre.“What is typically required is bringing them through a structured process, which also helps the organisation put in place better SOPs and have more structure to their processes.”But to promote better mental health at work, companies like the Singapore International Chamber of Commerce (SICC) recognise that stigma against mental health issues in the workplace is a societal issue.“For too long, mental health issues were seen as character flaws that derailed careers. It’s not just companies that held these views; societies did too, and sadly some still do. But mental health issues don’t define anyone any more than a broken leg does,” said Mr Victor Mills, Chief Executive of SICC, which hopes to encourage more companies to promote mental wellness.To treat mental illness in the workforce, Mr Mills added that companies should begin with “eliminating possible stress triggers”.“Toxic managers should be held accountable and sent for help. Root out purposeless meetings. Don’t call your colleagues after office hours, and certainly not on weekends, unless it’s an emergency. Don’t expect colleagues to respond to an email at some ungodly hour. And don’t treat mental health issues as weaknesses.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

106,Commentary: It is not vanity when you are obsessed about how you look,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/body-dysmorphia-vanity-obsession-mental-health-treatment-14664166,04 May 2021 06:11AM,"A little-known mental health condition affects both men and women and can lead to severe consequences, which is why treatment is important, says an IMH psychologist.SINGAPORE: With the ceaseless bombardment of what is beauty – from skin, hair, clothes and weight – it is no wonder that the global beauty industry is worth US$532 billion (S$706 billion). But what is an acceptable quest to look and feel good and when does it spill over into something that becomes a serious mental health challenge?This can be illustrated with the type of clients I see.I first met with Joseph*, a soft-spoken young man with handsome features just like a Korean celebrity, when he was brought to our hospital’s emergency services after an attempt to end his life.He had undergone multiple cosmetic surgery procedures overseas but yet would be stuck in front of a mirror for several hours watching the “monster” in the reflection.Joseph believed that his appearance was so marred by his ugliness that he was unable to interact with other people, and would put his hands over his face to hide. “Unless my parents allow me to go for the cosmetic surgery, there is no meaning to my life,” he had said. MORE THAN JUST LOOKING GOODBody Dysmorphic Disorder (BDD) is a disabling mental health condition characterised by obsessive ideas that one’s own appearance is severely flawed. People with BDD are often perceived by others as being infatuated with vanity or discontented with their physical appearance.It causes individuals to engage in repetitive or time-consuming behaviours to check, hide, or fix their appearance so as to alleviate distress.In short, like Joseph, nothing is ever good enough and there are constant feelings of inadequacies.It is unfortunate that individuals with this condition are believed to be desperately trying to impress others - they seek validation and hope for flattering comments about their own physical appeal. This lack of understanding of the condition may create feelings of shame on the part of BDD sufferers about disclosing their symptoms to other people or seeking help.BDD is estimated to affect about 2 per cent of adolescents and adults worldwide, and this figure may be underreported. At present, there has been no full-scale study of the disorder in Singapore, but a preliminary study by the National University of Singapore suggests a similar proportion here.It should be noted, however, that not everyone who seeks cosmetic surgery suffers from BDD.Although the exact causes of BDD are debatable, studies suggest a combination of different factors, including environmental and biological reasons.The condition seems to develop in people who are extremely self-conscious and self-focused, who may have been teased or bullied in their childhood or adolescent years and who were unable to overcome it then.Sociocultural factors such as the emphasis on looking attractive and possibly certain personality traits – for example,  perfectionism - may also play a role, with neuroscience research pointing to differences in brain function relating to the processing of visual and perceptual information in them.To put it simply, people with BDD tend to over-focus on details, but are not able to process visual information in a holistic manner or to see the big picture. CHARACTERISTICS AND CONSEQUENCESTypically, the onset of the disorder starts in adolescence, before the age of 18. BDD can affect both men and women, although about 40 per cent of sufferers are men and 60 per cent women.Women tend to report more severe symptoms, and usually have more areas of concern, such as skin imperfections and hair or facial features. Men are often more preoccupied with their build or muscle tone. However, few people with BDD in Singapore seek help because many are unaware of the disorder and most sufferers tend to have limited insight into their condition, and think of it as a physical problem.Because of the belief that their issues are physical in nature, it is unfortunate that most people tend to consult aesthetic practitioners rather than mental health professionals.Without treatment, BDD can cause substantial impairment in psychosocial functioning, and its impact can leave those who have the condition in severe emotional distress. Evidence from global studies has found that 70 per cent of people with BDD suffer from co-morbid depression.Turning frequently to cosmetic surgery to find a quick fix solution to their problem, BDD sufferers either camouflage a perceived defect or try to achieve an unrealistic ideal. Many still feel dissatisfied after multiple cosmetic interventions and this can lead to their social isolation.All these factors may accentuate anxieties, exacerbating the symptoms of their BDD, along with feelings of anger, despair and hopelessness. Many end up loathing themselves for being so vain and self-obsessed.More than 60 per cent have reported having suicidal thoughts, and around 24 per cent to 28 per cent of cases have attempted suicide.In the case of Tammie*, she hated how her eyebrows looked and would spend hours on her eyebrows each day - drawing, then wiping them off and redrawing them again. When they did not look symmetrical or the right shape, she would burst into tears of frustration and continue her attempt to “perfect” the shape of her eyebrows. As she felt ugly, hideous and alienated, she did not want to leave her room or be seen by anyone, even her own family. As a result of this, she had trouble going to classes and stopped hanging out with her friends. She became socially isolated and depressed.BDD affects not just the person, but their family or friends as well. Families who have loved ones with BDD may find themselves burdened financially and psychologically when caring for them.They may end up paying for their cosmetic procedures, feel paralysed to help as their loved ones refuse psychological treatment, or even change their family’s way of doing things so as to accommodate the person’s worries.  It can be excruciating for family members to witness their loved ones suffering from this condition. Family members may experience emotions ranging from fear, to anger, to sadness and profound frustration.Some families may also have to deal with their loved ones’ frequently aggressive behaviour, fuelled by an inability to fix their perceived defects or, as they imagine, the sense of rejection by their friends or other people.

IT WILL NOT GO AWAY BUT CAN BE MANAGEDThe support and understanding of family members and friends, and the willingness of the person to seek help as early as possible, are both critical for better outcomes.One of the evidence-based treatments for BDD is cognitive-behavioural therapy (CBT) – a form of therapy that challenges patients to reframe their unhelpful, negative thoughts about their appearance. It also teaches them to refrain from repetitive compulsive behaviours, and encourages them to face their feared situations in a gradual manner.Through the use of mirrors, patients are also trained to see their entire body rather than just focusing on the disliked details, and to describe themselves in non-judgemental ways.Family education and involvement is highly beneficial, not only for the patient’s recovery but also for the family’s functioning as a whole.Tammie’s family was able to express their concerns to her and give her their support in encouraging her to seek help, after they saw a negative change in behaviour at home and in school.Besides receiving support and encouragement in the recovery process, the person's motivation to change is equally important too. BDD is unlikely to go away by itself. However, with treatment and the right support, the condition can be managed and even improve. * Pseudonyms have been used to protect the identities of people mentioned in this commentary.Dr Jackki Yim is a Senior Clinical Psychologist at the Department of Psychology in the Institute of Mental Health.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

107,Commentary: Training children to support their friends can reduce school bullying,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/school-bully-training-children-parent-support-14617832,03 May 2021 06:09AM,"School bullying is a worldwide problem despite all the measures in place to deal with it. Two professors shed light on the powerful role peers can play.SINGAPORE: The problem of school bullying was in the limelight in recent months, after several highly-publicised incidents such as the case of aggression on an ITE student, and a 14-year-old student who attempted suicide after being bullied by her schoolmates.The latter wrote a personal appeal to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong to look into the issue of school bullying. What makes these cases particularly disturbing is the victimisation of vulnerable children with special needs, which in some cases seem to have persisted over time without any recourse for the victim. Parents weighed in on the issue, prompting a response from the Ministry of Education.The tried and tested method to deal with bullying is to punish the bullies and make them apologise to their victims. Schools and the Ministry of Education reiterated their zero-tolerance stance towards school bullying, and assured students and parents that measures are in place to keep schools safe, such as stating clear negative repercussions for bullies as a form of deterrence, and offering counselling and peer support for the victims. As a preventive measure, MOE also refreshed the Character and Citizenship Education (CCE) Curriculum by emphasising the need for students to forge a kind and caring community in schools.Worldwide, research has shown that school bullying is a pervasive phenomenon, one that affects not just younger children in schools, but also young adults in institutes of higher learning. Hence, bullying is not a problem that children grow out of, or that results from children being immature or weak. Unfortunately, no magic formula exists for eliminating school bullying completely, though there are evidenced-based methods that could mitigate the impact of bullying when it occurs, or decrease the likelihood of bullying from happening in the first place. WHAT CAN BE DONESeveral insights can be gleaned from two recent studies involving primary school children and university students in Singapore, conducted by our research teams at Yale-NUS College and the National University of Singapore. These studies found that a combination of strong parental and peer support, as well as empathy training, might be the way forward to effectively combat school bullying across educational settings.In a study involving 570 primary school children aged 10 to 12, findings showed that children’s attachment to parents helped minimise the incidence of being bullied, while friends’ reliable support in the form of protection and aid reduced the likelihood of children bullying others.With a strong parent-child attachment, which is cultivated through spending time with the child and being responsive to their emotional needs, children are given a safe space to share their troubles at school with a trusted adult. This provides an opportunity for parents to suggest effective strategies on how the child can cope with school bullying, ensuring continuous support at home. For example, parents may role-play with the child appropriate responses towards a bully. Thereafter, regular check-ins with the child would help parents monitor the situation closely, providing emotional support to the child in the process. A strong attachment to parents also allows children to feel secure enough to turn to parents in times of distress, and report bullying early before it escalates further.POWER OF PEERSSimilarly, peers who offer aid and support to one another in school facilitate the development of a positive peer culture, where children learn to engage peers without resorting to dominating strategies. This is especially helpful for children who tend to react aggressively out of anxiety and a fear of rejection, which may turn into acts of bullying. As students approach young adulthood, parents may no longer wield as much influence as peers do. Our study on 835 university students aged 21 to 24 showed that it was attachment to peers, rather than to parents, that buffered the effects of bullying and victimisation. For students who were both a bully and a victim (the “bully-victims”), being highly attached to their peers reduced their anxiety to the same level as those who have not been involved in any bullying relationship. Bully-victims are those students who bully others and at the same time are victims of bullying. Research has shown that this group of students tends to have worse mental health outcomes than those who are pure bullies or pure victims.The importance of peers highlights the need for putting in place a systematic support network of peers specific to school bullying. This goes beyond the usual strategies of merely disciplining or “counselling” bullies, which may not always be viable as the first avenue of support due to the time needed to schedule an appointment with a counsellor. A structured and targeted platform of a peer network where students are trained and equipped to handle issues related to bullying to support their peers who might be facing these challenges will help. Even young children who show the ability to offer support to others can be trained to help victims of bullying.EMPATHY TRAININGApart from peer support, empathy training appears to be a promising route to reducing the effects and incidence of bullying. Our research indicates that high levels of empathy reduced the level of anxiety experienced by bully-victims, such that they were no different from students who were entirely uninvolved in bullying. This insight is backed by other studies, which have shown that structured empathy training programmes are effective in lowering bullying rates among students as young as primary school.These programmes are often conducted over several sessions, and include components such as helping students understand diverse perspectives, role-playing, and modelling empathic responses. These targeted programmes may complement the existing CCE and Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) programmes in schools. However, the responsibility for making schools a safe haven should not rest solely on the schools themselves. Parents and families have a vital role to play in modelling good social behaviours for their children to emulate, and by being more involved in their children’s lives so that the first signs of difficulty are spotted in early stages, for both bullies and victims.Bullying is a vicious and persistent problem. But insights from our studies highlight that a multi-pronged approach is likely to be most effective, where students are constantly exposed to anti-bullying messages at home, within their peer group, in school, and the larger community.

108,Negotiate or break in? How the police handle stand-offs with people who lock themselves in,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/police-handle-stand-offs-people-locked-in-negotiate-14713190,29 Apr 2021 06:00PM,"SINGAPORE: The special operations police instructor, wearing a khaki uniform and black balaclava, showed me how to raise a 16kg door rammer without hurting my back. Bend your knees in a squat and use both hands to hold the rammer, he said. Stand straight without arching your back. My task – to break down a door at a mock HDB unit at the Home Team Tactical Centre so that police can storm the flat and take down a suspect who had locked himself in.It is all part of a hands-on session on Tuesday (Apr 27) for reporters to understand how the police deal with such situations.When the instructor told me to take a good swing and aim for the key hole, my arms went slightly weak. Before this, a real Special Operations Command (SOC) trooper had broken in with one swing.With all that weight, it was tough to generate enough momentum and simultaneously hit right the spot. My first swing was met with a dull thud. Then again, and again. The door was still locked shut.Panting a little, I was not going to embarrass myself in front of the SOC troopers and other reporters. Another three swings and the door finally swung open. The spectators politely applauded.In actual cases, SOC troopers must break in as quickly and safely as possible as the situation in the unit could be serious or life-threatening.For instance, a man who has locked himself in could be trying to escape from the police after a long chase. He could be trying to commit suicide or hurt a hostage. A suspect could also be mentally ill.Neighbourhood police officers, called Ground Response Force (GRF) officers, are often the first to respond. They make the initial attempt to get the subject to open the door. If that is not possible, officers from the Crisis Negotiation Unit (CNU) and SOC are activated.This means that negotiations, including an assessment on the level of imminent danger to the person or others in the unit, could last for hours before a decision is made to break in.In one of the longest cases, a 39-year-old man locked himself in a Sembawang flat with a two-year-old boy in 2016, sparking a 17 hour-stand-off with the police. The man was eventually arrested after SOC officers broke into the unit.Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam told Parliament that the police did not storm the flat earlier as authorities had assessed that the hostage-taker did not pose any immediate danger to the child if he was not provoked.“As a result, the ground decision was taken to de-escalate the situation by deploying the Crisis Negotiation Unit to talk to the hostage-taker to persuade him to surrender,” he said in a written reply then.“When negotiations were not successful, the police had to assess the right timing to break into the flat without putting the child at risk.”The police said on Thursday that they often receive questions from the public on their response to such stand-offs, including why there is a need for so many officers and tactical SOC troopers on the ground.Assistant Commissioner of Police (AC) Gregory Tan, commander Central Division, said multiple boots are needed to clear the surrounding area and help people who might have been in the barricaded unit but managed to escape.“You also require other police resources, like Special Operations Command, because you never know when situations may evolve and they are very unpredictable,” explained AC Tan, who has overseen “quite a lot” of these cases since becoming commander two-and-a-half years ago.“So we don't have the luxury of time to activate resources when we need them. That's why we have a protocol to ensure resources on the ground as quickly possible, so that when they are required, they are ready to act.”STAND-OFF SCENARIOSAC Tan, 37, divided such scenarios into three categories based on increasing level of unpredictability.The first involves those who try to evade arrest. AC Tan said these people have usually committed “major crimes” like housebreaking, rioting and especially drug offences.“They just want to not get caught, but they are rational and that’s a critical difference,” he said.The second involves those who want to commit suicide. AC Tan said these people could be irrational and sometimes act out. “They may be emotional, but they generally can still correspond,” he said.The last category involves those who show signs of being mentally ill or unsound. AC Tan called this group the “most unpredictable”.“They are often incoherent, they may be proclaiming the desire to harm themselves or others, and they tend to act rather erratically,” he added. “That’s the type that draws the largest attention.”This unpredictability means officers have been hurt and stabbed during stand-off situations, with subjects sometimes brandishing knives or threatening to set butane tanks from steamboat stoves on fire.While police intervention has not always been successful in stopping suicide, AC Tan believes there has not been a case where police actions directly set off the act of suicide.This is why, he said, being absolutely certain about breaking in takes “a long time” of tactical planning and engaging the person to know how unsettled he is.“It's never our first option to break in. I think our desired end goal is always to resolve it peacefully and to de-escalate,” he added.“Our preference is never to go in proverbially guns blazing, or baton swinging. We’d rather talk it out, have the person come out.”Officers are trained to find alternative means of entry, including getting keys from other sources and going in through windows.Recalling an incident two months ago, GRF officer Station Inspector (SI) Shahreel Samsudin said it looked like it could have turned into a protracted stand-off when a person refused to let police investigating officers in to ask about a case of criminal intimidation.But the incident ended “quite well” when the subject’s family member came with a key to let officers in, he said.“On the onset, we have to assess the situation and get the layout of the place, because we never know if this kind of incident will escalate,” said SI Shahreel, 40, a deputy team leader with the Rochor Neighbourhood Police Centre under the Central Division.“Of course, we need to gather any information from the subject or witnesses and neighbours. From there, we can create a plan to determine what is the next step to be taken.”STAYING CALMThe police said they will use “all resources available” to see what is going on in the unit, while GRF officers try to talk the subject into letting them in.But if the subject is uncooperative, SI Shahreel said officers “won’t try to gain entry or force open the door in his view, because it will just trigger other actions from the person”.“So we will just talk to him, try to calm him down, things like that,” he added. “But on top of that, we will still think of other possible situations that can arise from there. And then we are thinking of what we need to activate next.”The ground commander will make the decision on what to activate next, and AC Tan said the general guideline is not to take any risks.“So the moment we suspect that it may be (a stand-off incident), rather than it would probably be, we expect frontline officers, both the guys on the ground as well as the guys back at the Police Operations Centre, to activate additional resources,” he stated.ART OF NEGOTIATIONThis is when specially trained CNU officers step in to find out if the subject is facing any issues.“We will need to check whether the subject has any mental health history, any history of suicide or what the suicide risk assessment is like, any history of violence as well to see whether he can pose a threat to anyone,” said CNU principal psychologist Ho Hui Fen, 39.“If there is anyone with him or her in the unit, we may be concerned about the safety of the person inside.”Similar to counselling, Ms Ho said negotiators show genuine care and concern and use active listening skills when engaging subjects. Sometimes, a subject may refuse to talk, so negotiators will try different topics to engage him.“I think utilising active listening skill sets is important because ... in other situations, people may have been quite minimising towards a situation or they dismiss the challenges that he or she is facing,” she said.This could prove useful in situations when storming the barricaded unit is not feasible.Ms Ho recounted an incident in a condominium where a man who was drunk sat naked on his balcony ledge and threatened suicide with his wife and two-year-old daughter at home. Breaking in was not an option due to the unit’s structure, Ms Ho said.“I think we negotiated for a few hours and finally managed to get him to reconsider and come down to safety,” she added.People apprehended under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) Act will be taken to the Institute of Mental Health for examination to see if treatment is required. They may be placed on suicide watch if the risk of killing themselves is high.But when threats of violence are made, Ms Ho said negotiators will use the subject’s medical and behavioural history, as well as live observations like how determined he is in verbalising his threats, to come up with a violent threat assessment.“If the threat is imminent, I'm sure sometimes tactical options may come into play, rather than continuing with negotiations,” she stated.BREAKING IN TAKES TIMEThe police said SOC officers have a “range of tools” to gain entry into a locked unit.Besides the 16kg rammer, officers can use a longer, 23kg rammer to break sturdier doors and locks. The latter is handled by two people instead of one, and is generally used when there is more space.For instance, in narrow HDB corridors, the 16kg rammer will be used.“Officers need to undergo rigorous training on a frequent basis to ensure their skills are maintained,” the police said. “Strength is a given to ensure they can operate the tools effectively.”Nevertheless, AC Tan acknowledged that breaking in can take “some time”, especially as some doors are more reinforced than others. “Unfortunately, it's not like in the movies, where in five seconds you can break open the door,” he said.The police could deploy more than one group of SOC troopers so that it can reconfigure resources to meet tactical needs.Ultimately, the police said their priority in such incidents is ensuring the safety of everyone involved, including the subject, victims, officers and the public.“And to resolve the situation with minimal harm to persons and minimal damage to property, while ensuring that any criminals are apprehended,” they added.Editor's note: An incident that the police dealt with has been removed from this story at the request of the Singapore Police Force as the case is before the courts.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

109,"Myanmar maid's death: Employer hires new lawyer, wants to reduce culpable homicide charge",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myanmar-maid-death-new-lawyer-reduce-charge-piang-ngaih-don-14712386,29 Apr 2021 12:44PM,"SINGAPORE: A woman who killed her 24-year-old domestic helper from Myanmar after beating, burning and starving her to 24kg has hired a new lawyer and is seeking a reduced charge and a gag order on her case.Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 41, pleaded guilty in February to 28 charges, including culpable homicide, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by starvation, voluntarily causing hurt by a heated substance and wrongful restraint. Another 87 charges will be considered in sentencing.The prosecution had said then that it sought life imprisonment for Gaiyathiri's acts.Gaiyathiri was originally charged with murder following a recommendation by the Attorney-General, but this was brought down to culpable homicide due to the evidence that surfaced.Ms Piang Ngaih Don came to Singapore to work for Gaiyathiri in May 2015 in what was her first job overseas.Five months into Ms Piang Ngaih Don's employment, Gaiyathiri began abusing her physically. In the last 35 days of the victim's life, Ms Piang Ngaih Don was given little food, five hours of sleep per night and no privacy as she had to shower or go to the toilet while Gaiyathiri or her mother watched.Ms Piang Ngaih Don lost 15kg in 14 months and was kicked, stamped, punched and hit with objects like a broom and a metal ladle.Gaiyathiri also lifted the maid up by her hair, shook her violently and pulled out a clump of her hair. On one occasion, Gaiyathiri used an iron to burn Ms Piang Ngaih Don's arm.In the 12 nights before her death, Ms Piang Ngaih Don was tied by a string to a window grille at night. She died on the morning of Jul 26, after a combined assault by Gaiyathiri and Gaiyathiri's mother fractured a bone in her throat and caused irreversible brain damage.On Thursday (Apr 29), the remanded woman came to court with her new lawyer Joseph Chen, replacing Ms Diana Ngiam and Mr Sunil Sudheesan who had prepared her mitigation previously.NEW LAWYER WANTS LOWERED CHARGEMr Chen told the court that he would like to ask the prosecution to reconsider proceeding on the charge under 304a, for culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which is punishable by life imprisonment.Instead, he sought a reduced charge without life imprisonment. According to the penal code in force at the time of the offence, the charge of 304b with no intention to cause death carries up to 10 years' jail and a fine. Caning is not applicable for women.After some back-and-forth exchanges, Mr Chen said his client would not retract her plea of guilt. He asked for time to put up a further mitigation plea for Gaiyathiri.""With the court's indulgence, as well as the public prosecutor's facilitation, she will put in further mitigation to highlight those factors to support her case that her culpability is reduced with the focus and emphasis on the stressors that result in her feeling an increased tension due to her worry about the children's health,"" said Mr Chen.This ""increased tension"" is to be seen along with her mental disorders, he said. Gaiyathiri suffered from major depressive disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder, both of which substantially contributed to her offences, the court heard previously.Because of these disorders, she qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility, with her obsessive compulsive personality disorder a significant risk factor for aggravating the severity of depressive symptoms of peripartum onset. It would have worsened her depression to an extent that partially impaired her mental responsibility for her actions, the court heard in the previous hearing.The judge said some of the points relating to Gaiyathiri's children had been raised in her previous mitigation. According to the document prepared by Gaiyathiri's previous defence lawyers, Gaiyathiri was ""overwhelmed"" with caring for her children, who began to fall sick with gastrointestinal issues requiring regular hospital visits.Because the doctor told Gaiyathiri that her children's illnesses were due to poor hygiene, her preoccupation with cleanliness and hygiene was ""triggered"", said lawyers Diana Ngiam and Sunil Sudheesan previously.""Our client attributed the cause of her children's illness to the poor hygiene of the deceased, for example, the deceased's practices of not washing her hands before touching cooking vessels and taking cooked food with unwashed hands,"" the lawyers said.Mr Chen said that Gaiyathiri wanted to amend or remove ""one or two parts"" in the statement of facts that formed her guilty plea.Deputy Chief Prosecutor Mohamed Faizal expressed ""surprise"" at this but said he would respond at an appropriate juncture.Mr Chen also said he ""will have to follow up on (Gaiyathiri's) instructions to apply for a gag order to the best of our ability"". He later told the media she wanted a ""blanket prohibition on further reporting"". The prosecution said they would respond to this at the appropriate stage.Justice See Kee Oon adjourned the case for Mr Chen to make his further mitigation plea by May 28, and for the prosecution to respond. He fixed the next date for the case on Jun 22.Gaiyathiri's husband, suspended police officer Kelvin Chelvam, faces five charges linked to the case for assaulting Ms Piang Ngaih Don and lying to the police that CCTV cameras in his flat had been removed.He is set to return to court next month for a pre-trial conference. His mother-in-law, Prema Naraynasamy, also has pending charges.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['court', 'crime', 'maids', 'culpable homicide']",Singapore
111,"Pre-emptive COVID-19 testing at dormitories, worksites after new cases detected",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-tests-dormitories-worksites-cluster-cases-westlite-14710028,28 Apr 2021 03:11PM,"SINGAPORE: Pre-emptive COVID-19 tests are being conducted in dormitories and worksites following a new cluster of infections at Westlite Woodlands Dormitory.More than 5,500 workers were tested between Apr 23 and Apr 26, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Wednesday (Apr 28).The tests are in addition to the routine tests conducted on dormitory residents every two weeks, and include workers who have recovered from COVID-19 and those who have never been infected.The move comes after 24 workers at Westlite dormitory who had recovered from COVID-19 tested positive for the disease again.Eleven of the cases were assessed to be shedding virus fragments of old infections and five were likely cases of re-infection, said MOM. Two cases were determined to be negative after re-testing and the remaining six are pending assessment.The Ministry of Health announced last week that recovered workers who have passed 270 days from their date of infection will also be subject to rostered routine testing, due to the risk of waning immunity and threat of new coronavirus variants.TESTING OF RECOVERED WORKERSWhen recovered workers are tested, the ministry said it expects a proportion of them to return a positive result on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests.However, this does not necessarily indicate re-infection among recovered workers.""There could be two situations. One is that this person is a prolonged shedder, who is non-infectious and shedding dead viral fragments (which get picked up by) the PCR test,"" said Dr Lam Meng Chon, the director of the medical team at the ministry's Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) unit.In these cases, authorities would ""not be too worried"", he added.But the other situation is that the person may have been re-infected with a different strain, which could be transmissible to others.Dr Lam added: ""Because we are testing recovered workers, we have entered a new phase where a certain time is required for clinical assessments to determine if (patients are prolonged shedders or reinfected).""These assessments typically require several days. ""So there's no need to panic, but to be patient and allow the clinical assessment to take place,"" said Dr Lam.Movement restrictions or quarantines may also be imposed on a dormitory if a few workers there test positive for COVID-19, MOM said.This is a public health measure borne ""out of an abundance of caution"", to ensure that any cases and their close contacts can be quickly isolated, said Dr Lam.The ministry added that this precaution is necessary only for the duration of the assessment and will be lifted when tests have concluded.“If quarantines are imposed in some dormitories, this does not necessarily mean that there are confirmed clusters there,” it said. “Most of the time, it is because cases are being assessed to determine if they are old or current infections.”DORMITORIES STEP UP SAFETY MEASURES, SUPPORT FOR WORKERSPrecautionary steps have been taken in the dormitories to protect workers who are well and to stem the risk of transmission, MOM said.Workers can still access communal facilities and recreation centres in dormitories, with regulations in place to prevent residents from mingling. However, movement between dormitory blocks is not allowed and safe management measures have been stepped up.“Workers have also been advised to cease social interactions with others who do not reside in the same room or floor,” the ministry said. The Building and Construction Authority has also stepped up inspections on safe management measures at construction worksites.This includes conducting more checks on workers' compliance with zoning, or increased inspections at rest areas.The Manpower Ministry assured migrant workers that access to round-the-clock medical assistance remains available. Measures are also in place to look after their mental well-being, including counselling hotlines in their native languages.The ministry is also coordinating support from non-governmental organisations to provide calls and care packs to affected workers.“In addition to protecting their health and safety, these measures seek to assure our migrant worker that their livelihoods will be safeguarded,” MOM said.“Affected workers will continue to be paid their salaries for the duration of the quarantine, and their periods of absence from work will be treated as paid hospitalisation leave as part of workers’ leave eligibility under the Employment of Foreign Manpower Act.” Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

112,Jail and caning for man who sexually abused daughter from the age of 3 and later raped her,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/jail-and-caning-for-man-who-sexually-abused-daughter-from-the-14697734,26 Apr 2021 04:42PM,"SINGAPORE: A man who sexually abused his daughter from when she was 3 years old and subsequently began raping her was given 28 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane on Monday (Apr 26).The 44-year-old man, who cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the victim's identity, had pleaded guilty to three charges of statutory rape in March, with another 19 charges considered in sentencing.The man said he realised he was a paedophile and there was ""no turning back"" after showering with his daughter, who was frightened by scenes of drowning she saw on television.Justice Mavis Chionh said this realisation was ""chillingly"" narrated in court documents.""The greatest tragedy in this case is that she (was) robbed of her childhood innocence by her own father,"" she said.The other great tragedy, she said, was that the victim was preyed upon by the person meant to protect her, and still writes letters to him to tell him that she loves him.The offender moved to Singapore with his wife after the birth of the victim in 2008 and lived in rented condominiums. He began sexually abusing his biological daughter when she was between three and seven years old, when his wife was at work or out of the country.He began molesting the girl and making her perform sex acts on him, showing her adult and child pornography before sexually assaulting her. The offences went on for seven-and-a-half years between December 2011 and June 2019.By his estimation, he raped his daughter more than 10 times but fewer than 20 times.The man also preyed on his daughter's friend, kissing her on the lips and molesting her while they were watching a movie with his daughter.The crimes came to light in 2019, when the victim's friend revealed before her first communion that the accused had behaved inappropriately with her. Her parents took her to lodge a police report, and the authorities went to the accused's home and found his daughter there. She told them that she had also been sexually assaulted.The man was arrested that day and the police found content depicting female minors in his devices, as well as saved links in his phone about ""incest love"" and similar search terms.The victim's mother, who has since divorced the offender, later told the police that she discovered child erotica stories in the man's email inbox.The Institute of Mental Health later found that the man has paedophilic disorder, with recurrent sexual urges or behaviour involving activities with prepubescent children.However, no substantive contributory link was found between his disorder and the offences, as both his cognitive functioning and his volitional or emotional capability to break the law and act on his sexual desires were not significantly impaired.The judge said his paedophilia carried no mitigating weight.Prosecutors had called for at least 30 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, while the defence said such a jail term would be ""too crushing"" and asked for between 24 and 26 years.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

114,Foreign student hanged himself in hotel room after being caught for breaching stay-home notice: Coroner,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sri-lanka-student-shn-breach-hanged-hotel-room-14658882,20 Apr 2021 06:36PM,"SINGAPORE: An incoming foreign student who was serving stay-home notice in a hotel hanged himself in his room in a deliberate act of suicide after being caught breaching quarantine, a coroner found on Tuesday (Apr 20).Sri Lankan national Nishad Manilka De Fonseka, 20, had come to Singapore last year to begin his first year studying at Singapore Management University (SMU).Days before his school term was due to begin in August 2020, Mr De Fonseka was found hanged inside his room at the Hotel Grand Pacific.His Internet history showed searches for breaches for stay-home notice and two news articles about the consequences of breaching the notice.He left notes apologising to his family, calling the world ""a cruel place"" and saying ""sorry if I let you down"". Mr De Fonseka had arrived in Singapore on Aug 1, 2020 with a female friend. They were each briefed on the requirements of their stay-home notice which included prohibition from coming into contact with other people.According to his friend, Mr De Fonseka would leave his hotel room frequently to go to hers, leaving the door ajar with a clothes hanger.However, Mr De Fonseka was caught when he was locked outside his room and staff checked the closed-circuit television footage. He tried asking hotel staff not to report the matter, but was told it was protocol to do so.Mr De Fonseka was worried that his parents would be upset and concerned that his studies would be affected, but his friend told him it might not be so serious, as they had been on the same flight to Singapore.On Aug 11, 2020, the pair went for a COVID-19 swab test. After this, SMU contacted the pair and asked them to submit a statement and explanation for the breach.BOTH OF THEM GOT WORRIED AFTER UNIVERSITY SOUGHT EXPLANATIONAfter they replied SMU, they texted each other, with the friend saying she was trying hard not to kill herself, and Mr De Fonseka said ""same"" and that he was ""trying to find s*** to do"".They discussed their future, and Mr De Fonseka said he did not know if he could take it anymore, to which his friend said she was worried she would be sent back and that she was going to kill herself. Past 1.30am, Mr De Fonseka called his friend to tell her that his mother had not answered his call. He said he was afraid that SMU would suspend them, and that he would fall behind and his scholarship would be revoked. He said he could not imagine how to explain it to his parents.His friend told him to call her if he had an urge to harm himself, and went to bed only after he told her he was really fine. She later woke up and saw multiple text messages from him asking her to call him, but when she tried to call him back, there was no response.She texted him with no response and called the hotel reception to ask them to check on him. He was found hanging from the ceiling and pronounced dead on Aug 12, 2020.MEASURES POST-INCIDENTThe court heard that SMU did not have standard operating procedures for such a situation at the time, and that the email they sent to the students for an explanation included the penalties for stay-home notice breaches so they would be aware of them.SMU had arranged care calls for the two students at their hotel to check on their wellbeing, remind them to take their temperatures and adhere to the stay-home notice.After the incident, the Ministry of Education (MOE) set up guidelines on how to handle such stay-home notice breaches, the coroner noted.Guidelines were also given on how to communicate with those who breach stay-home notices, including communicating directly with them and prepare them mentally with a call before sending an email. They should also be informed of the counselling and support available to them.State Coroner Kamala Ponnampalam found that Mr De Fonseka's death was a deliberate act of suicide, with no foul play suspected. She noted that MOE has since set out clear guidelines for institutes of higher learning on how to handle such situations, and that SMU has also changed its policy for student welfare management.She gave her condolences to Mr De Fonseka's family for their loss.",True,"['court', ""coroner's court"", 'stay-home notice', 'COVID-19', 'coroner findings']",Singapore
115,Commentary: It will be a waste if parents don’t keep flexible work arrangements,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/parents-flexible-work-from-home-remote-working-covid-19-children-14632508,19 Apr 2021 06:03AM,"The year-long work-from-home experiment has shifted family dynamics irreversibly and getting back to a routine will not be easy.SINGAPORE: “Papa, where are you going?” came the small voice of my five-year old daughter as I put on my shoes for work.The accompanied puppy-look made my response even harder, but I told her I had to go to work. “Why do you need to go work? Why can’t you continue to stay at home?” she asked.I had this difficult conversation with my little one a few weeks ago as I returned to the workplace just for a day after working from home for more than a year.This scene must sound familiar to parents, especially in recent days, if you have had to end your work-from-home schedules to return to the office. From Apr 5, up to 75 per cent of employees can be at the office, with no split teams needed. The Government is also encouraging public servants to come into the office three times a week.Some employers, like mine, have allowed staff to start coming back once or twice a week – keeping a commitment to hybrid work arrangements.Whether you were returning for a day or more, after an almost complete absence from the office, the adjustment seems challenging.  And this is especially the case for parents with children – we have been around them and they around us for a year.REMEMBER THE MAD RUSH PRE-COVID?Before COVID-19, parents had to juggle spending full days in the office with parental responsibilities. It was hard to carve out meaningful time with kids after reaching home after a busy day at work, to say little of all the time we missed when young toddlers and babies needed more sleep.All day, we rely on the support of domestic workers, grandparents and day-care centres to do basic tasks: Reading, feeding, learning, homework, and more.Weekends were rare, precious moments with the brood – all while recovering from the tough work week and preparing for the coming one.Then, out of the blue, came the circuit breaker. Suddenly, parents were thrust into all this face time with our children.Admittedly, the initial adjustment wasn’t easy. Maintaining the same semblance of productivity at work, while giving our kids the attention they now expected from us was a skill not many of us had.I know I struggled too. In the initial weeks, I had to shoo the kids away while trying to focus on work. I had to keep reminding them to be quiet because I was on a Zoom meeting and many a time regrettably responded with irritation when they asked me to read them a book, fix a toy or give them permission to watch a cartoon on YouTube.But as routines and boundaries began to be established, I would say, we found a sweet spot.I slowly began to see the dividends of working from home when it came to spending time with my children. For a start, I could do the small things that I could never do sitting in an office all day.I could go and pick them up or send them to school.I was there to tuck them into bed, read a story, prepare meals as soon as my shift was done, rather than wait for someone else to do it while I was heading home, navigating peak-hour traffic.In a recent news report, parents interviewed said they felt the same way. Marcus Wong, 40, told The Straits Times that going back into the office more days of the week means giving up on the flexibility he has come to cherish.“Whenever I’m working from home, I can cook for the family and we can eat earlier. It would be too late by the time I get back from the office,’’ said Mr Wong who takes public transport.KEEPING THE GAINS WE MADEYes, this was quite an unprecedented experiment. So many families adapted and it is time to adapt again, as we transition from home to office. But how do we keep the gains we’ve made?I realised that parenting before COVID-19 was about utility – instructing care-givers to do this and that, arranging schedules for pick-ups and drop-offs.But these past months, it’s been about watching my children smile and hug me when they see me (instead of the helper) as they get out of school. Or snuggle up close as we read a bedtime story. I can take my time knowing that I don’t have to rush through Goodnight Moon because, well, my workspace was in my study.It is an aspect of parenting we don’t want to lose just because work-from-home may end. We know deep down inside this opportunity won’t last forever. Once they head to primary school, especially upper primary, we will not have this luxury again as our kids spend a near full day in school, at extra-curricular activities and hanging out with their friends.We want to maximise the time we have with them so that in the future we don’t lament over the missed opportunity of building these bonds with them when we could.Of course, this also means that as more of us go back to the office more often, our children have to get used to parents not being there for them all day. And this can create some anxiety.Anna Sutherland, then of the Institute of Family Studies in the US, wrote “instability creates stress and can threaten children's sense of security”.“The pandemic led to abrupt and extended changes to families’ routines”, Jill Ehrenreich-May and Dominique A Phillips of the University of Miami wrote in a recent article, “worsening mental health” among the young.Two weeks ago, my wife and I attended a workshop on mindful parenting by Mental ACT, a community-based mental health non-profit, where we learnt that having regular check-ins with our children during the pandemic is a necessary exercise, and one that we may need to initiate through open-ended and leading questions, to help them make sense of the changes.Surveys across the globe have shown that employees have come to enjoy the flexibility, the freedom and the time saved from commuting which working from home offers them. Productivity has not been compromised and families in particular are so much better off.My hope is that employers will provide their staff a flexible and hybrid work arrangement so that they can continue to spend time with their children, while still attending in-person meetings in the office as required.I also expect that we follow the spirit of the law and not the letter – if coming in three times a week is less than ideal for a young parent, then perhaps he or she could be given dispensation to come in less, so long as the work is done.For so long, being a parent and an employee meant that one was impinging on the other. If COVID-19 taught us anything, it was that we are able to do both in a much less frenzied fashion.It would be such a waste if we cannot keep these wonderful gains – especially the delight on your child’s face when they get to see mummy or daddy when they get off the school bus.Malminderjit Singh is editor at CNA Digital News, Commentary section.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

116,Commentary: Hybrid working may change contractual terms and conditions for employees,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/hybrid-working-remote-work-from-home-laws-policies-mom-safety-14635054,19 Apr 2021 06:02AM,"Some countries have already implemented laws to mitigate new risks associated with a hybrid work model and companies here may follow suit, says lawyer Amarjit Kaur.SINGAPORE: Certain countries, such as the Netherlands, have had a head start in putting in place hybrid working legislation, well before COVID-19 brought homeworking to the forefront, to protect the interests of both the employer and its employees. Such legislation typically regulates flexible working arrangements including working hours, working times and places of work. Employers may deny requests for flexible working for compelling business interests such as security issues, work schedules or financial and organisational problems.Such legislation is also intended to ensure that there is no discrimination against those who opt to work from home to overcome the traditional social stigma surrounding those who work from home. This is critical to ensure that equal rights and opportunities are afforded to those opt to work from home.In Singapore, employers are seriously considering such a hybrid model of working as the way forward. For many, this could mean working from home for part of the week and working in the office the rest of the time.Minister in the Prime Minister’s Office Indranee Rajah's exhortation to employers to consider offering staff a hybrid work arrangement beyond COVID-19 to allow them to attend to elderly parents or young children, has also been met with broad support and approval.Banks like DBS Group, Citigroup Inc and Mizuho Financial Holdings News, for example, are paring down office space as they transition to hybrid work - showing that the decentralisation is here to stay, especially given the trend of rapid digitalisation.Can employers keep up with these changes from a legal perspective however and how will that impact employees?PHYSICAL WELL-BEING AND SAFETYAccording to Singapore’s labour laws, employers bear the burden of ensuring a safe workplace. But how are employers meant to protect the health and safety of employees who are not working out of a physical workplace within their control?Minister of State for Manpower Zaqy Mohamad confirmed in Parliament in June 2020 that work from home arrangements do not change an employer's responsibility for work injury compensation. The firm will have to ascertain that the injury arose while the employee was performing work activities at home.This is easier said than done and can have serious ramifications for employers, who find themselves facing a novel situation of potentially being held responsible for injuries that occur in employees' homes, to which employers have no access, and over which employers typically exert no control.An extreme yet entirely plausible example of this is as follows: During office hours, an executive, seated at his desk at home, takes a work-related call on his mobile. He gets up and walks across the room to retrieve a document needed for the call, trips over his toddler’s toys and fractures his foot. It almost seems absurd to even suggest any liability on the part of the employer, but could it be argued that the executive was injured ""on the job""? Since the Workplace Safety and Health Act's application to remote working is untested, responding to complaints and actions for work-related injuries and illnesses will be challenging. When employees are working outside the office, it may be less clear when an act is performed in the course of employment.To limit their liability for such accidents, some companies have started to carry out occupational safety assessments in employees' homes to identify risks and measures to mitigate these risks, whether by way of physical inspections, via Zoom or over an app. This must be balanced against employee's rights to privacy and should be subject to prior notification and agreement. Employers are thus modifying their policies to contractually provide for such potential intrusions.Employers may also follow the example of France, which has rolled out self-assessment forms to be completed by employees in respect of occupational risks related to working from home.In Belgium, legislation has been enacted to ensure that teleworkers are covered by occupational accident insurance if the accident occurs at home, during working hours and in a place listed as a workplace in the contract.In Singapore, companies such as Salesforce and Autodesk are adopting a variety of measures to mitigate their liability, including providing employees with a technology budget to ensure they have proper and ergonomic equipment at home.Employers are also clearly stipulating working hours, rest days, overtime and other terms that remote-working employees must abide by in order to avoid claims of breaches of the Employment Act by employees, given that working times are less defined in a homeworking environment.EMPLOYEES’ MENTAL WELL-BEINGEmployers are potentially facing the reverse challenge of ring-fencing employees' personal and home lives from the increasing encroachment of work – which have led to complaints of depression, anxiety and burnout.A survey by National University Health System's (NUHS) Mind Science Centre on mental health resilience revealed that 61 per cent of those working from home reported feeling stressed, more than the 53 per cent of front liners in the pandemic feeling likewise.This could also be due to the higher incidence of domestic issues employees may face while working from home. AWARE saw a drastic 116 per cent increase in domestic violence helpline calls by April 2020 from a year ago while the police reported a 22 per cent jump in monthly average cases of family violence during the circuit breaker.Remote working poses a significant and unique challenge to employers seeking to support and promote mental health in their workforce given that it is much harder to assess how their employees are coping from a distance. It has been suggested that companies consider investing in wearable tech to collect data on the mental health of their workforce and measure stress responses, subject to data protection of sensitive health data.The Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-Being at Workplaces, introduced in November 2020, educates employers on progressive ways in which they can support employees’ mental health, such as providing access to external counselling services. While laudable, the advisory lacks bite and doesn't compel employers to adopt the suggestions.A more concrete commitment would be to expand the list of Occupational Diseases under the Work Injury Compensation Act (WICA), to include mental health illnesses related to work stress, which would have the effect of holding employers accountable. It would also be a positive step forward to recognise certain mental health issues as being a form of disability, which should be a protected characteristic when it comes to discrimination.Countries such as Italy, Ireland, and the Philippines, have promulgated ""right to disconnect"" laws on answering work calls and emails outside of office hours to prevent employee exhaustion and burnout.Member of Parliament Melvin Yong also mooted this in Parliament in October 2020, given that employee burnout complaints have heightened during the pandemic. However, would it be practical across different industries, or be seen as overly prescriptive?In the interim, it is crucial that companies put in place measures, benefits, and policies to safeguard their employees' long-term mental health, taking into account the unique stressors posed by hybrid working.Companies such as LinkedIn, Cisco, Google and Thomson Reuters offer firm-wide mental health holidays for staff to unplug and recharge in the face of soaring burnout rates. Companies have also offered resilience training, guided meditation and well-being sessions, including for remote employees.INFORMATION SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITYBesides the people challenges, there’s also the technology-related issues. Remote working questions how employers can protect their data and confidential information as the ingress and egress of third parties to such remote locations isn't secure and tightly controlled by the company.When the circuit breaker hit, companies scrambled to provide employees with the necessary technology and equipment to facilitate remote work with little time to deep dive into the security implications of remote working.So, companies may have allowed employees access to customer and other data, heightening the risk of leakage of such sensitive information, whether by shoulder surfing or eavesdropping of spouses or visitors to the house, employees leaving physical copies of documents lying around and viewed by unauthorised parties.Allowing remote workers to access company networks through homeworking environments also introduces vulnerabilities to cyberattacks.In a paper released by the MAS and the Association of Banks in March, risks in areas such operations, technology and information security, fraud and staff misconduct and legal and regulatory risks were flagged for attention and recommended preventive and detective measures, including staff surveillance for high-risk activities.Companies may thus introduce new policies to safeguard their data privacy and cyber-security by regulating staff remote working behaviour, including prescribing locations where staff are not permitted to work remotely such as in shared public working spaces like cafes and hotel lobbies.Otherwise, they risk facing complaints and actions for breaches of confidential information, under the Personal Data Protection Act, and other requirements on the use, disclosure, retention and processing of personal data.Given that our working landscape is changing, companies will need to put in place the necessary policies and procedures to mitigate new risks. Workers need to be ready for that.Listen to EngageRocket CEO Leong Chee Tung and HR strategist Adrian Tan debate the merits of returning to the office on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast published in 2020:Amarjit Kaur is a Partner at Withers KhattarWong in its litigation and arbitration team.

118,IN FOCUS: Thinking out of the cubicle - what lies ahead for hybrid working?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/office-home-future-hybrid-work-flexible-wfh-in-focus-14627258,17 Apr 2021 06:00AM,"While more workers can return to the office as COVID-19 workplace safety rules are relaxed, many people still prefer to work remotely for at least part of the time. CNA takes a deeper look at how offices could evolve in a way that accommodates personal preferences and business needs.SINGAPORE: Like most office workers, economist Song Seng Wun used to spend his workdays behind a desk at his bank and never questioned it. Now, after being forced to work from home during the “circuit breaker” period last year, he has adjusted to a new rhythm.His mornings are spent at the office, then he may have meetings outside or travel around the island to check on any economic developments that piqued his interest - taking him to a manufacturing plant in Tuas or an airfield in Seletar. Later in the afternoon, he settles down at a pub near his home in Tanjong Pagar to go through reports and other reading material – washed down with a gin and tonic or a beer. He thinks he gets more done now, with the flexibility to structure his own time.“Technology essentially allows us to be more mobile … then the mindsets of companies and bosses were forced to change. If not for the pandemic and workers being stuck at home, most employers would have been reluctant to let workers out of their sight,” said the 61-year-old analyst from CIMB.It’s one example of how workers have become creative with their work routines after the COVID-19 pandemic hit - and if the majority of workers have their way, this hybrid way of working will be here to stay.A YouGov survey conducted this week for CNA found that 60 per cent of the workers who took part want a mix of working remotely and at the office. In addition, 17 per cent want to work entirely from home.The percentage of those preferring hybrid work has increased from a similar survey done in early April last year, when the circuit breaker started and the great remote work experiment began in Singapore. Then, 48 per cent said they would mix working from home and from the office, if given a choice. Meanwhile, the proportion of people who would choose to return to the traditional nine-to-five routine has shrunk from 38 per cent last April to 24 per cent. More than 1,000 people responded to each survey.Most of those who prefer hybrid work arrangements said that they want to return to the office two or three days a week. A number of other surveys corroborate this trend. ""WE NEVER THOUGHT TO RECREATE THE WAY WE WORK""""The wish for people to be less tied to a nine-to-five job existed before the pandemic, it was only because of the pandemic, that suddenly, employers needed to make changes to the way people work,” the founder of HRTechRadar Anita Lettink told CNA.Digital tools for video calls and remote work such as Zoom, Microsoft Teams and Slack were not “invented last year”, she said.“All these applications to collaborate were there, we just still made people come to the office because we never thought to recreate the way that we work,” she added.After a year of mostly working from home for many, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) allowed more employees back to the workplace from Apr 5. While working from home is still encouraged, up to 75 per cent of staff can be in the office at a time. Split teams are also no longer mandatory.A week after that change, the YouGov survey found that 39 per cent of respondents said they were still working from home.  Numbers from the Land Transport Authority (LTA) indicate that there hasn’t been an immediate rush back to offices.For the week of Apr 5 to 9, morning peak ridership on public transport was at about 68 per cent of pre-COVID levels, said the Land Transport Authority. The number of commuters who exited MRT stations in the CBD on a weekday morning remained at about 40 per cent of pre-COVID levels.Since many office workers need only a laptop, a connection and a mobile phone to do the majority of their work, the office as a space to sit at a desk and type – the norm just a year ago – may seem outdated to some. And while the workplace is still useful for those who do not have conducive work environments at home, some have decided that the daily commute is not necessary or desirable.But the physical office lives on, even though some companies no longer see it as the default option.This is what law firm Allen & Overy has seen at their office at Collyer Quay, where about 30 to 40 per cent of their 170 workers are back.While they were beginning to implement remote working options before COVID-19, such that employees could choose to work from home when required, the firm is now looking to expand their flexible working policy, said COO Emiley Yeow.“I get the sense (that) when I reach my own steady state, it might be Monday and Friday at home and three days … in the office, and then I will build my meetings around that,” she said. “I think our (flexible work) policy will actually need to adapt and be changed over time.”ENTICING WORKERS BACK TO THE OFFICEAs it is, most of their employees are choosing to continue to work part of the time at home. Mr Benjamin Moult, who works in the HR department there, prefers to work in the office but still chooses to work one day from home.“I like the idea that I could be flexible, if I had a delivery, if there was something that needs to be done in my flat, or if I went to the gym,” he said.But he also likes going back to the office and having the chance to talk to people in person, and have chance meetings at the pantry.To entice workers to return, Allen & Overy is supplying free lunches for the month of April and hired a barista to come in at teatime.In a project that was already in the works before COVID-19, but which Ms Yeow said came together just in time, the office has been redesigned to expand open spaces for interaction and discussions, and increase the natural light in the office.It now has a large, airy pantry as well as a café area where people can eat and drink, as well as hold discussions and training sessions. This seems to be the way forward, for larger firms at least.DBS Bank, for instance, said last November that it will give employees the flexibility to work remotely up to 40 per cent of the time. It also started a job-sharing scheme that allows two employees to share the responsibilities of one full-time role.DBS further said that it will modify its workspaces to enable “greater collaboration and ideation”, launching a 5,000 sq ft “Living Lab” to test different work space configurations.“To support these new norms of working DBS has been redesigning workspaces to create a more balanced hybrid work environment,” said a spokesperson from the bank. “This will take into consideration DBS’ shift to a more distributed, flexible workforce model by blending the best of physical and virtual workspace configurations to provide a seamless employee experience.”Ms Narita Cheah, co-founder and director of Paperspace Asia, which Allen & Overy consulted for its redesign, said that more clients are coming to them to rethink how their office space is used and how to draw workers back.In the past, the priority when it came to designing offices was the number of desks the company needed, while other spaces were sometimes seen as “frills”, but this will no longer be the case, she said.“The desk will no longer be the cornerstone of the office. That's going to have to give, to make space for amenities, human connections that they cannot get at home. What are you doing to draw them back? That will be the new focus.”Besides a need for more collaborative spaces, companies are also installing creature comforts people can’t get at home, ranging from hammocks and massage chairs to meditation rooms.WORK FROM ANYWHERE?But it’s not just the offices that are being renovated, many workers are now revamping their work life to build in more flexibility - what Ms Lettink called a ""work from anywhere"" model.Ms Olivia Ang, 25, joined technology firm Arcstone in January, and has been going to the office once a week. This will increase to two days a week from May. She is quite sure she doesn’t want to go back to an office-bound, nine-to-five working life.The 25-year-old has tried working from different spaces, and even experimented with working at Sentosa from the beach (Tip: It's tricky as sand can get into your laptop).“I feel like when you're tied to your office, then you don't get to do other stuff that you could have done if you were at home,” she said. “I basically have more time to live my life.”Assumptions that flexi-work would lead to lower productivity have generally been upended. Most respondents to the YouGov survey (85 per cent) said that they were more productive or as productive working from home as they were from the office.Seven in 10 managers responding to the survey also said that they felt their teams were more productive or as productive.Instead, companies have warmed up to the idea as they think that it can help them weather future crises and help save fixed costs, according to a Future of Talent Whitepaper commissioned by LinkedIn. MOM’s Job Vacancies Report 2020, which tracked job opportunities for remote work for the first time last year, found that 35 per cent of job vacancies last year involved work that could be done remotely. These were mainly jobs for PMETs or Professional, Managers, Executives and Technicians.HYBRID WORK WILL EVOLVEWhile the COVID-19 situation in Singapore has improved and many aspects of life are returning to a normal state, hybrid work-life models seem set to continue to evolve. What would this transition involve?Human resources professionals and experts CNA spoke to said that due to the lack of face-to-face contact, consulting closely with employees is crucial, as is making sure guidelines and expected outcomes are explicit and communicated.Mr Mayank Parekh, CEO of the Institute for Human Resource Professionals in Singapore, predicts that only a small percentage of companies here will revert to traditional office-based work practices.He thinks that new skills and behaviours are required of leaders to create a culture of openness and trust. “Organisations that engaged in frequent touchpoints with employees - both formal and informal - were better able to maintain high levels of employee satisfaction,” he said. “Employees are often suspicious and can become unmotivated when decisions are made in a 'black box' with inputs and outputs obscure and inconsistent. Moving people's decisions closer to supervisors is another opportunity to build trust and buy-in.”Ms Lettink said that managers should manage workers’ output and results, while letting them “figure out” for themselves how to organise their work – within certain limits, such as making sure they attend meetings, meet deadlines and are contactable at certain times.“Just because you don't see them, or they're not coming to the office doesn't mean that you don't set the rules, you still have to provide people with guidelines,” she said.But she added that employers can also consider setting hours where employees can disconnect and not send or answer emails, as the flip side of flexible working is that some people end up working much more.FOCUS ON MENTAL WELL-BEINGA Microsoft report, the 2021 Work Trend Index, has found that workers are having longer meetings on Microsoft Teams and sending more work chat messages. More than 50 per cent reported feeling overworked.All the experts said that with hybrid work, organisations will need to focus on new areas like mental well-being and building up rapport that used to come about naturally at the water cooler.One example is how HR tech startup EngageRocket has been using bots to randomly pair up people in teams for non-work, virtual “coffee chats”. This is to promote interactions across teams and replicate opportunities for “serendipitous connections”, through video calls, said co-founder and CEO Leong Chee Tung.“The blurring boundaries between personal and professional life have increased the need for line managers to pick up skills in detecting and addressing mental health issues like burnout within their teams,” said Mr Leong.“Demonstrating genuine care for their team was seen to be one of the most important drivers of employee engagement and motivation.”Regular meetings, in teams or one-on-one, are still important to build rapport and engagement, he said. On the other hand, he also recommends blocking out time without meetings, Zoom calls, or other interruptions for “deep work” that requires greater concentration and creativity.Mr Asif Upadhye, Director at work culture consultancy Never Grow Up, recommends sensitising managers to acknowledge that employees need to divert their time for wellness, family and relaxation. One option is to have employee calls once or twice a month where there’s no work talk, but is used as a time to unwind, he said. “This can be spent chatting, playing fun and easy online games or even just do a session of charades while you speak about anything under the sun, except work.”Ms Dion Thai, global employer services tax partner at Deloitte Singapore, said that the high productivity in the past year for many companies tends to have a hidden, human cost attached.“It has been especially challenging for those that are early in their careers and those that are just starting out; to start their careers in a completely remote environment,” she said, as she recommends a “rethink” of how to improve wellness programmes and the onboarding process.Ms Thai, and other experts, emphasised that there is no “one-size-fits-all” model for any workplace. A transition to remote or hybrid work is not just about changing where we physically work, but will require a rethink about how we do our work, she said.“The core values, corporate culture, and the circumstance surrounding each company must be taken into consideration,” she said. “Given the challenges and uncertainties ahead, an experimental and flexible approach at this point would be a necessary attribute to a company’s success.”Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

119,"Man admits stalking young woman from JC to university, hired private eyes to film her",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-stalked-woman-from-jc-to-university-private-investigators-14621004,14 Apr 2021 09:31PM,"SINGAPORE: Over a year and four months, a man stalked a young woman he had seen in school, through junior college and university, creating 17 Instagram accounts to harass her, emailing her father and hiring private investigators to film her.Toh Wen Jie, 20, pleaded guilty midway through a trial on Wednesday (Apr 14) to one count of stalking the victim between October 2018 and February 2020.He sent her sexually explicit messages, calling her his fiancee, girlfriend and wife. According to court documents, he used ""burner phones"" and accounts when she blocked or ignored him.Toh waited for her outside her university for three to four hours a time over about a week, and wrote on his own question-and-answer Tellonym account that he had ""a lot of time to kill"" and that ""I will literally strangle you if (it's) not against the law"".The court heard that Toh first began eyeing the victim in 2016 when she was taking part in an event that is unnamed to protect her identity. She is now 21.He noticed her again when he was a student at Ngee Ann Polytechnic in 2017, at the Singapore Youth Olympic Festival. The victim never interacted with him and did not know he was watching her.In 2018, Toh was a student in Anderson Serangoon Junior College and began stalking other girls when he found the victim on Instagram.From Jun 8, 2018, he began sending her dozens of messages from his Instagram account, addressing her by name and indicating that he had been watching her.He wished her luck for her A-Level exams and included his name and phone number, saying things like ""you don't seem like your usual self today"", and ""make the sensible choice today, we are friends for life"".VICTIM CONCERNED WHEN SHE SAW MESSAGESThe victim saw his messages on Oct 15, 2018 when she opened her Instagram inbox and was concerned as she did not know who Toh was.She asked him to stop messaging her as it amounted to harassment. When he replied, she blocked him, which made Toh upset.In December 2018, the victim was training for a sports team when Toh approached her and said ""sorry"" before revealing his identity. When the victim realised he was her stalker, she became afraid and ignored him before returning to her training.Toh got a job where she was training despite not being part of the sports team and tried to speak to the victim whenever she was alone. She gave one-word replies and walked away as she did not want to interact with him.In early 2019, Toh found the victim's home address.On one occasion in June 2019, he visited her home insisting that he wanted to meet her. The victim hid in the living room while her sister answered the door. Toh insisted on staying when he was told that the family wanted him to leave.The family shut the windows and doors, but Toh stayed there for about an hour. He continued shouting outside the door and insisted to the police who arrived that he had a right to be there as it was a public road. After another 45 minutes, he left.Toh found the email address the victim's father used for work and began emailing him in early September 2019. The man did not reply but told his daughter what happened.Toh got a third party to tell the victim that he had ""ample resources and time to find out everything about her"" and ""the means to appear everywhere she goes"", frightening the victim.On Sep 10, 2019, the victim and her mother filed a police report to launch a magistrate's complaint against Toh. Mediation was suggested during the process, but the victim did not wish to meet Toh at all, and so the magistrate's complaint was closed in November 2019.PROMISED POLICE HE WOULD NOT CONTACT VICTIMOn Oct 2, 2019, Toh made a written statement to the police that he would not contact the victim or her father, but continued to harass the victim and her family. He looked for the victim's father at his workplace and created a new Instagram account to harass the victim again, insisting that they meet.Outraged at the victim's rejection, Toh began to send emails degrading the victim. He visited her home again on Dec 12, 2019, and told the victim's mother that he had gone to the Institute of Mental Health but was assessed to only have behavioural problems.Between Dec 16, 2019 and Jan 7, 2020, Toh sent the victim hundreds of messages on Instagram using 16 Instagram accounts, creating a new one each time the victim blocked him.According to court documents, the messages were degrading, sexually intrusive and implied threats of violence to anyone who was in a relationship with the victim, alternating between anger and possessiveness towards her.Some of the messages read ""(you're) not getting out ... this is the story we created together months ago"", ""people touch you they will suffer"" and ""if it's sexual activities you will reap what you sow"".HE HIRED PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS TO FOLLOW HEROn Jan 7, 2020, Toh hired private investigators to establish the victim's daily activities, movements and circle of friends. He instructed them to follow the victim and film her from 7am to 11am each day from Jan 13 and Jan 17 last year.He then sent the victim the videos of her.When the victim went overseas for an exchange programme, Toh found out and asked when she would return for Chinese New Year, providing flight details tracking possible flights she might be on.He indicated that he would see her outside her house on Jan 23, 2020, and visited her a week later demanding to see her.In February 2020, Toh continued to stalk the victim, waiting for her for hours at her university. On Jul 18, 2020, he wrote on his Tellonym account addressing the victim, threatening her if he were to see her with someone else.He was eventually charged and wanted to claim trial, but pleaded guilty on the first day. The judge called for reports to assess Toh's suitability for probation and reformative training. Toh will return to court next week.For engaging in a course of conduct involving stalking acts, Toh could be jailed for up to a year and fined up to S$5,000.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

120,Commentary: Managing personal finances is a minefield when you start 'adulting',https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/managing-personal-finance-money-advice-millennials-14496136,12 Apr 2021 06:21AM,"The problem goes beyond a lack of financial literacy taught in school. The world of financial planning has transformed since our parents’ generation, making our relationship with money more complicated, says Grace Yeoh.SINGAPORE: As a young working adult starting out more than half a decade ago, financial advisors were the bane of my existence — or at least my journey home from the MRT station. They would bombard me with hard-sell tactics and financial jargon, in hopes of evangelising the importance of insurance and planning for the future. Even though they meant well, the topic of personal finance felt like an overwhelming beast. It was a reminder that somehow I wasn’t a “proper” adult since my money was sitting in an ordinary savings account with barely-there interest rates. Even now among my friends, there seems to be little middle ground when it comes to financial literacy. On one end of the spectrum are diehard bitcoin bros who know exactly which stock to place bets on and what products yielded good returns.On the other end were extreme spendthrifts who lived from paycheck to paycheck, believing they’d magically get their act together when they hit a certain age. They had no investments or insurance, and whatever savings they had was used to pay for short-term goals.I fall somewhat in the middle – a fairly good saver but financially illiterate so much so that I would barely pass a basic jargon test. The question for folks like me is: Why did we get to this state and where do we start?LACK OF FINANCIAL LITERACY IN SCHOOLS The first port of call is school. Even though I enjoyed mathematics lessons, my penchant for solving complicated problems didn’t translate into smartly managing my money. I don’t remember being exposed to personal finance, aside from creating a savings account during primary school. Instead, what would’ve been useful would be topics that would be relevant as we got older. For example, the concept of saving 20 per cent of one’s allowance could already be taught in kindergarten or lower primary, whereas managing debt and how loans or interests work could be delved into at the upper secondary or junior college level. Looking back, I would have appreciated if the subject Principles of Accounts (POA) was compulsory for all students. Unless we had parents whose financial savviness made them talk openly about managing money at home, it was par for the course that many young people knew next to nothing about money by the time they graduated.It’s something Chew Tee-Ming, co-founder of Seedly, a Singaporean personal finance community, sees. “Young adults don't know what they don't know,"" he says. “Insurance and financial products are also not easy to understand due to their complex structure. It can cause anxiety among beginners, especially when they’re approaching major life stages like entering the workforce or starting a family.”Fortunately, a few financial literacy programmes have been launched within the last decade to help young adults, such as the Citi-SMU Financial Literacy Programme for Young Adults, and a financial education curriculum piloted at polytechnics and the Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges.  Even outside Singapore, financial literacy has only just begun to make its way into schools. According to a CNBC report last year, 45 states in the US “now include personal finance education in their curriculum standards for kindergarten through 12 grades, although only 37 states require those standards to be implemented by local school districts”. But teaching financial literacy in schools isn’t enough, we need to get around the stigma of talking about money. STIGMA IN MONEY TALK“Money can be such a sensitive thing to discuss because many people confuse their net worth with their self-worth. As a result, a lot of uncomfortable emotions are tied to it – shame, anxiety and arrogance are just some examples,” He Ruiming, co-founder of The Woke Salaryman, tells me. Often, these uncomfortable emotions don’t originate from tackling big finance concepts, like cryptocurrency, or deciding which stocks to buy. They stem from everyday scenarios related to money, such as figuring out the the amount to give for a wedding when you’re not close to the couple, trying to suss out how much salary your colleagues with the same experience get, and navigating the landmine of whether it’s reasonable for parents to expect allowance as part of filial piety.Even when seeking advice from trusted friends and family, we might hesitate to go into details about our personal finances because it’s a touchy topic. Despite there being more than 20,000 financial planners in Singapore, many of us have had an experience with those who only sell products from certain companies, without truly understanding what we need. But getting a grasp on financial literacy isn’t a skill we can develop overnight if we spend our lives burying our heads in the sand. It must be consciously learnt through avenues where you can address your doubts without judgement.PERSONAL FINANCE BLOGS A HUGE HELPThis is where personal finance bloggers come into the picture. With the quickly evolving local personal finance landscape over the last few years, personal finance blogs and personal finance communities, like Seedly, have managed to create more avenues for people to talk about money much more openly, in the comfort of their phones and in privacy.From The Woke Salaryman to The Simple Sum, and even OG personal finance creators, like SG Budget Babe, these blogs fill the gap between stuffy financial institutions and financial advisors, and friends and family with no financial planning expertise. These platforms often break down complex financial issues into relatable comics and stories, appealing to the self-starter who is willing to learn but feels put off by aggressive and pushy sales tactics. When I discovered The Woke Salaryman from their first post about saving S$100,000 by 30, which began with an anecdote about the author’s mom having suffered a stroke, I could relate to the singular determination from his personal story that propelled him to start taking his finances extra seriously. But even the most simple or relatable personal finance blog can’t truly help you manage your money if you haven’t first understood your fundamental relationship with it. WHAT MONEY MEANS TO YOUA financial planner who managed high networth clients once told me that even though his clients were wealthy now, those who grew up poor were more risk averse when it came to investments, because they were afraid they could lose it all and be poor again. Likewise, a friend who dabbles in the arts says managing her personal finances well is exceptionally important so she has the mental freedom to pursue creative work. In my case, money directly impacts my mental health – and a critical factor of my mental well-being is about not being financially tied to any situation, from relationships to jobs.Aside from my regular savings for a home or emergency medical illnesses, I found it necessary to set aside a separate Freedom Fund, which I could tap on to escape non-ideal situations. For instance, if I wanted to take an indefinite sabbatical from work or if I needed to leave a relationship that I was financially dependent on, I could afford to choose my freedom thanks to this extra cash. I saw my Freedom Fund as a way to take newfound control over my life. In turn, unlocking what money meant to me meant I began taking my personal finances seriously, such as finding a financial advisor I trust. Like me, most people don’t want to become an investment guru; neither are they absolutely hopeless with money. But all of us have to navigate a life path that involves money – perhaps saving for a child after marriage or preparing yourself for a stretch of uncertainty when you embark on an entrepreneurial journey. In most cases, financial freedom might not buy you happiness, but it could buy you extra time to mull over important decisions, a more comfortable parenting journey, or even peace of mind from knowing you won’t starve without a job for six months. Like all healthy relationships, your relationship with money should be mutually beneficial. After you work for it, it has to work for you – and understanding how to better value your money begins with first realising its value to you.

121,"Commentary: Harry and Meghan are made for Hollywood, not royalty",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/harry-and-meghan-markle-british-royalty-netflix-spotify-deals-14588414,12 Apr 2021 06:19AM,"The Duke and Duchess of Sussex made themselves out to be hapless victims of The Firm, but it all seems part of their game plan towards next-level stardom, says writer Tracy Lee.SINGAPORE: I’m as much of a royal watcher as the average pop culture hobbyist. I watched the wedding of Charles and Diana and then of William and Kate Middleton. Otherwise, I have barely any interest in what the British royal family get up to.But then Netflix’s The Crown came by and it was fantastic.Even though the British royal family has steadfastly maintained that it’s all fiction, the highly-acclaimed series did a pretty good job delving into the complicated machinations — all that tradition, protocol, diplomacy, country before self, stiff upper lip, sacrifice, loss of privacy and freedom — that’s all part and parcel of being a British royalty.And at the back of my mind, I would think: If they’re costing British taxpayers more than 67 million pounds (US$92million) a year, the least they can do is dress well, behave impeccably, and be grateful ordinary folk are still willing to pay for their extravagant lifestyles in the name of heritage.Will and Kate have done exceedingly well on that front.Then Harry met Meghan.What was supposed to be a fairytale romance about a handsome prince who fell in love with, and married a beautiful American commoner has, within a few short years, devolved into the biggest blow to the monarchy’s image since Princess Diana’s death.By now, you’re probably familiar with what transpired during the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s bombshell interview with Oprah Winfrey, which drew 49.1 million viewers worldwide.Just this past week, they’ve announced their first Netflix project — Heart of Invictus, a docu-series from their production company Archewell Productions.This will follow ""a group of extraordinary competitors from around the globe, all service members who have suffered life-changing injuries or illnesses on their road to the Invictus Games The Hague 2020, now set to take place in 2022”.The couple had signed a multi-year production deal with Netflix last September, which includes scripted series, docuseries, features and children's programming.BITS AND PIECES THAT DON’T ADD UPNow, some say there’s nothing wrong with a young couple needing to make a living since they no longer receive any income from the palace after renouncing their royal duties. They have to raise baby Archie, and are expecting a daughter as well.But does it all just sound a little too calculated, maybe even distasteful?Online commentators have pointed out that the Oprah interview was filmed in February, when Prince Philip was admitted to hospital for feeling unwell, then aired when he was still recovering. He has since passed on.Was that insensitive? Or there’s no space for feelings when the ambition train simply has to get cracking?British host, Piers Morgan had been so incensed with the interview that he declared on his show that he felt Meghan was lying, stormed off his own set, then resigned from his job.He has since appeared on Tucker Carlson’s show, calling her “a delusional duchess who wants to make millions off the royals while trashing family”, and claiming Meghan and Harry lied or exaggerated 17 times during the Oprah interview.Indeed, Meghan’s claim that there had been a secret wedding three days before the actual one, has been debunked. It was nothing more than an informal ceremony, said officials.She also claimed she “didn’t grow up knowing much about the royal family”, but in previous blog posts, had written about her dream of becoming a princess seven years ago, then discussed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s wedding four years ago.According to her former best friend (yes, there’s such a thing) Ninaki Priddy, who had posed beside Meghan for a photo in front of Buckingham Palace when they visited London in 1996 when they were 10, Meghan’s avowed ambition was to become “Princess Diana 2.0”.As for that famous statement that a senior member of the royal family had raised concerns about how dark baby Archie’s skin would be, Harry’s version was that the conversation had happened “right at the beginning”, presumably at the start of their relationship. That was in 2016, years before baby Archie was even a twinkle in anyone’s eye.BEHAVING LIKE A SPOILT PRINCESSMeghan was apparently “left gutted” when the Queen would not let her and Harry live in a wing at Windsor Castle — but isn’t that like being annoyed at not being given the room of your choice, when you’re a guest at someone’s home?It’s not as if the Queen’s counter-offer was insignificant— she’d gifted them the 10-bedroom Frogmore Cottage!I’m also sceptical about poor little rich prince Harry saying his lucrative media deals from Netflix and Spotify were necessitated by the fact his family had “literally cut (him) off financially"" in the first quarter of 2020 — to me, the couple appeared to be quite the savvy money-makers from the outset.Right after they announced in January 2020 that they were stepping back from their royal duties, they started up Sussex Royal with the plan to hawk merchandise such as sweatshirts and mugs, but were stymied when told they had to remove the word “royal” from any of their enterprises.They weren’t exactly broke at that point— according to some reports, Harry had a US$10 million inheritance from his late mum, while Meghan was estimated to be worth US$2 million based on her earnings from TV series Suits.By any stretch, US$12 million be enough for a couple to set up shop in the US and raise their family in peace and quiet.But not if you buy a US$14.6 million Santa Barbara mansion which comes with a library, gym, separate wet and dry saunas, an elevator, arcade, game room and home theatre, a children’s cottage, a tea house, a full-size tennis court, a lap pool, a detached guesthouse with two bedrooms and bathrooms.Altogether, the estate boasts nearly 19,000 sq ft of living space with a nine bedrooms and 16 bathrooms. Neighbours include A-list celebs such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Ellen DeGeneres, Ariana Grande, and — drum roll, please  — Oprah Winfrey herself.That certainly shows aspirations to become Hollywood royalty.INKING DEALS LEFT AND RIGHTThen, Harry and Meghan quickly went about inking a three-year podcasting deal with Spotify, said to be worth between US$15 million to US$18 million. There’s also a deal with Harry Walker Agency, which also represents the Obamas, for public speaking engagements.According to The New York Times, fees are estimated at US$1 million per speech, and the Duke is expected to discuss topics like mental health and grieving.Perhaps they should expand their topics to self-entitlement, boundless avarice, unbridled ambition, fame-seeking, with a special section on victim politics.It is also ironic that Harry has always railed at the press and yet courted exactly the kind of curated media coverage when they spoke to Oprah.One can’t help but compare how these two have lived their lives to that of Queen Elizabeth II. She has been on the throne for 70 years and seen major political changes such as the devolution in the United Kingdom, the accession of the United Kingdom to the European communities, Brexit, Canadian patriation and the decolonisation of Africa.She also lived through family issues such as the death of Princess Diana and the marriage breakdowns and sex scandals of her children. In the face of so much scrutiny and criticism, she’s remained stoic.Harry and Meghan, on the other hand, stepped back from their royal duties after just two years. And this despite the fact they couldn’t have that many duties seeing as how far down the line of succession they were.They’re the complete opposite of what the Queen and royalty have always represented: Elegance, restraint, respect, stoicism, resilience, sacrifice, duty, and class.Come to think of it, Hollywood can have them.Tracy Lee is a freelance writer who writes about food, travel, fashion and beauty.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

123,Singapore residents travelling during COVID-19 – the risks and payoffs of reuniting with loved ones,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-residents-travelling-during-covid-19-family-14538740,11 Apr 2021 06:01AM,"SINGAPORE: Pre-pandemic, 45-year-old Marilyn Ng would fly from Singapore to Bangkok every weekend to see her three children, who live in the Thai capital.When she strapped in for a flight to the country last December, she had not seen her kids in 10 months.The trip was the culmination of months of research and administrative processes.“You’re required to pay for the air tickets in advance, regardless of knowing whether you can fly.“Then you have to book a quarantine hotel … pay all of it upfront … then you put in an application with all your reasons to fly,” said Ms Ng, who works for an IT software company.She also had to submit documents to the Thai embassy to prove her family lives in Thailand.After navigating processes that changed “on a monthly or weekly basis”, she finally received special permission to enter Bangkok, which was in a COVID-19 lockdown.She was allowed up to 90 days in the country, which she fully utilised.Ms Ng is among the Singapore residents who, despite the pandemic, have travelled abroad, triggered by the desire to see their loved ones.Within Thailand, she took multiple trips with her two sons and a daughter, but with safety as a priority, she said.“There must be a conscious decision on how to plan a trip every time we go out,” said Ms Ng.She counts a trip to Hua Hin with her daughter as one of the favourites of her stay. They went horseback riding, golfing and swimming.“(Reuniting with family) is bittersweet,” said Ms Ng with a sigh.“It’s so exciting to see them, but you know you have to leave them – and you don’t know when you’re going to come back. That was the hardest part.“My little girl spent three weeks crying. Every time the sun set, she would ask: ‘How many more days will you be with me and when are you coming back?’”Ms Ng returned safely to Singapore in February, with five COVID-19 swabs under her belt for the trip.To those who may criticise her decision to travel, she said: “The responsibility is on ourselves to know, to social distance, and be prepared ... I know there is a risk, but every day there is a risk. You cross the road, you get hit by a bus, that’s another risk.“So COVID-19 is just a thing we live with now in this situation and you have to plan it out, be careful, be aware,” said Ms Ng.Singapore's travel advisory, last updated on Feb 9, states that citizens and residents may travel if it is for academic studies, employment, business under fast lane arrangements, compassionate reasons, medical treatment, or legal obligations.Otherwise, all Singaporeans and residents are advised to defer all other forms of overseas travel.The advisory also said that all travellers will be subject to prevailing border measures upon entering Singapore, including payment for their stay at dedicated stay-home notice facilities and swab tests.THE COST OF TRAVELLING DURING A PANDEMICAnother Singaporean, Pauline Yoong, flew to Italy last December to see her partner, who is based in the country’s eastern region of Marche.After being apart for 11 months, she took the plunge to see him despite uncertainties over restrictions.It did not help that websites lacked updated information about entry requirements and the rules varied across different regions, said Ms Yoong, who works in digital marketing.On the flight itself, she was fraught with worry.“I was definitely paranoid. The flight wasn’t full … (but I could) hear people coughing. I prepared like three masks,” she said.During the three months she spent in Italy, they took several trips to nearby regions. One of the most memorable parts, Ms Yoong said, was getting to visit the highest point of a medieval fortress in Assisi, Umbria, nestled in fog atop a hill.But their time together came at no small cost.Ms Yoong spent close to S$1,000 on travel insurance covering herself for COVID-19, S$2,000 on her quarantine stay upon returning to Singapore, and nearly S$300 for two COVID-19 swab tests.“But it was definitely worth it as I got to see him. After so long, all these costs are really nothing,” said Ms Yoong, who has blogged about her experience to help others who may be in the same situation.For a traveller who only wanted to be known as Ms Y, plans to reunite with her Hong Kong-based partner were initially scuppered by the suspension of the Singapore-Hong Kong air travel bubble.After spending seven months apart, they decided to meet elsewhere - making one trip to Turkey in October and another to the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in December.Their criteria for the destination - no quarantine requirements and low COVID-19 infection rates, among other factors, said 26-year-old Ms Y, who works in architecture.Dubai caught their eye because short-term visitors have been allowed to enter the city since July last year. Visitors must have valid medical insurance and a negative COVID-19 test result.“(In Dubai), the people in the tourism sector were already vaccinated – every taxi driver we met was already vaccinated,"" Ms Y said.She added that in both the UAE and Turkey, authorities had put in place measures like mask-wearing and social distancing, which reassured them. “It was actually the best thing I have done for my mental health,” she told CNA.“But of course, we were both aware of the risks we were taking and were prepared to undergo quarantine when we got back,” said Ms Y. She added that they have healthy lifestyles and no pre-existing health conditions.“Whether you're infected or not, it’s you who has to bear the consequences … You have to be quarantined, you have to get treated at the hospital, you have to pay for (the medical expenses) yourself.”“So you’re taking responsibility for whatever risk you incur when you travel ... It’s a very self-contained process from the moment you travel out and come back,” she said.TRAVELLING FOR EMERGENCIESTravelling is trickier for people who are not Singaporeans or permanent residents. A 38-year-old Employment Pass holder, who only wanted to be known as Madam, had to make an emergency trip to the Philippines in October after her father died.Leaving Singapore was no issue – returning was the problem, said Madam, who works in the tech sector.Work pass holders need their employers to apply for re-entry approval on their behalf. Singaporeans and permanent residents do not require such approvals.Madam said she tried to get permission to return to Singapore within a month, but ended up having to stay in the Philippines for six to seven weeks.“Even if we tried to appeal that the reason for flying out was due to a family emergency, I still had a long time doing an appeal and requesting for approval.“It was very difficult and stressful, given all of the personal stuff going on,” Madam said, emphasising that she had not travelled for leisure.STAYING SAFEDr Thomas Soo, the head of health and wellness at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital said that the general advice is not to travel abroad to places that are experiencing major outbreaks of any disease.“The risk of getting infected and falling ill is high and your treatment may be delayed as the healthcare system there may be overwhelmed.“There is also the risk of bringing back the infection and infecting others after you return,” he cautioned.He also said that when travelling, whether locally on overseas on public transport, people should wear a mask, avoid speaking, observe safe distancing and sanitise their hands after touching common surfaces.In addition, Dr Soo warned that in cases where going overseas is unavoidable, travellers must note that some travel insurance may not cover medical expenses incurred if the person contracts the disease while travelling.“Do also note that travel advisories and travel restrictions vary amongst countries and may change rather quickly,"" he said.“There is a risk that you may be stranded in a particular country for a prolonged period of time, hence the need to be prepared financially to ride it out in a foreign country.""Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

124,IN FOCUS: From ‘devastated’ land to many long trails: Singapore’s path to becoming a hiker’s paradise,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-nature-paths-trail-hiking-paradise-14581440,10 Apr 2021 06:00AM,"While the hiking scene is thriving today, such an activity was largely unheard of in Singapore's early days. CNA retraces the country's journey in cultivating a haven for outdoor lovers.SINGAPORE: The soft crunch of footsteps on fallen leaves, the twitter of birds and the occasional rustling of branches as long-tailed macaques hop from tree to tree.This is the soundtrack of 74-year-old Mathias Chay’s regular morning hikes around MacRitchie Reservoir.“I appreciate the natural voices of nature. It calms you down,” said the veteran hiker, who walks 12km to 13km several times a week.These sounds have remained largely unchanged since Mr Chay fell in love with hiking more than 40 years ago.But heading into nature these days has otherwise become a “tremendously” different experience for him.What used to be narrow, rugged paths – sometimes overrun with vegetation – have turned into wider, more well-formed trails, he said.Over the decades, he has also found himself jostling with a growing number of visitors on these routes.He added: ""There were also not many signboards (in the past), so it was very easy (to get lost) if you were not careful.""The transformation in hiking infrastructure he has witnessed continues to take place across the country today.Just a few weeks ago, a central stretch of the 24km Rail Corridor reopened with improved accessibility.Shortly before that, the National Parks Board (NParks) announced it would be curating four more island wide routes, including a 62km route from Changi to Tuas that will be Singapore’s longest cross-island trail.Overall, there will be about 360km of island wide recreational routes by 2030.This complements Singapore’s ambitious goals of establishing 500km of park connectors by then too.Such moves, in line with the country’s vision to be a “City in Nature”, are fertile ground for an interest in hiking to flourish.Yet, given how commonplace the activity has already become, it might be hard to imagine that hiking on the island was once unheard of.THE ROOTS OF THE STORYSingapore has long prized its greenery but this was not always the case.“A key story is that in the first 50 years of colonial rule, (nearly) the entirety of Singapore was deforested,” said Associate Professor Timothy Barnard from the National University of Singapore’s history department.“The rural areas of Singapore or the non-urbanised areas … were nature and forests that needed to be used for the purposes of progress and modernity,” he said.In this case, large-scale deforestation made way for cash crops such as gambier and pepper.This “devastated” the land, Assoc Prof Barnard said. An 1883 survey showed that only 7 per cent of the island remained forested, according to a site under the National Library.Shortly after, to mitigate the severity of the situation, one of the first nature reserves was established in Bukit Timah.Reservoirs were also created with protected nature areas around them, Assoc Prof Barnard said.But even then, these nature spots were not popular.“No one really would go: ‘Oh let's go for a walk in the forest’,” joked Assoc Prof Barnard.“People might go to the forest to go hunting, looking to shoot birds or deer or a tiger … But it was a place you went into with a gun … You didn't go there seeking peace and serenity.”“So this idea of going in and enjoying nature by observing it for spiritual reasons, or your own mental health – we would say that's a new modern idea,” he said.Such a change in attitudes only began budding in the century that followed.THE BEGINNING OF AN ERAThe 1960s marked a key milestone, when greening the island received more attention amid then Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew’s vision of creating a “Garden City”.By the mid-1970s, the creation of parks had become an additional focus, with a park development programme aiming to provide more recreational spaces and “green lungs” in built-up areas.The result: between 1975 to March 2014, the area of parks and green spaces grew from 879 ha to 9,707ha, while the number of parks rose from 13 to 330, according to HistorySG.All this happened in tandem with increasing urbanisation.“(Green spaces) became an area you went to go to get away from (urban life). It's a place of respite, it’s a getaway,” said Assoc Prof Barnard.Though this trend began growing around the world after World War II, in Singapore, it “really only took off in the last 20 or 30 years”, he said.KEY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LANDSCAPEToday, Singapore has four nature reserves: the ones in Bukit Timah and Central Catchment were declared nature reserves in 1990, while the ones at Sungei Buloh and Labrador were gazetted in 2002.To safeguard them, NParks has converted more than 350ha of forested area around the reserves into nature parks.They act as complementary habitats and buffers to protect the nature reserves against the impact of urbanisation and human activities, NParks told CNA.These parks also help “relieve visitorship pressure”, while allowing visitors to enjoy nature with “minimal disturbance to the more sensitive biodiversity areas” within the reserves, it said.Other nature experts cited the creation of the Park Connector Network (PCN) as a key development in Singapore’s long-distance hiking scene.The concept of a PCN, adopted in 1991, aims to link up green areas by capitalising on underused spaces along roads, canals and railway corridors. Today, there are 360km of park connectors.Surveys by the National Parks Board (NParks) show that the proportion of people visiting the PCN rose from 4 per cent in 2007 to 21.2 per cent in 2017, the agency told CNA.Another big win for hikers was the establishment of the 24km-long Rail Corridor, a former railway line that was returned to Singapore in 2011.Experts welcomed having a continuous trail through the island – both for recreation and to support biodiversity.In 2011, NParks also introduced Singapore's vision to become a ""City in a Garden"".This goal would evolve to become a ""City in Nature"" in 2020, entailing a slew of targets to beef up nature parks, park connectors, nature ways and species recovery plans.Prominent conservationist Dr Ho Hua Chew attested to the changes in the hiking landscape.The 75-year-old said that in the past, hikes were usually done within nature reserves, non-urbanised areas like Pulau Ubin, or along cross-country routes – such as from Buangkok to Jalan Kayu, following the Punggol River.“If you wanted to go on a hike, you had to join (adventurers’ clubs) because these places were rather forested with hardly any humans to be encountered in some stretches.“You can get lost wandering along these trails or even along the country roads, in areas where farming was being phased out and things can look quite depopulated.”“But nowadays, the situation is rather different,” he said.More people are going it alone, without the need for experienced guides due to the accessibility of parks, connectors and green corridors, he said.Many of these are along or near roads, and pass through some built-up areas so “there is less fear of getting lost or helpless if an accident occurred”, added Dr Ho.GROWING INTERESTHaving more green spaces may not be the only reason people are taking up hiking.Pandian Parthasarathy, who heads Nature Ramblers under the Nature Society, says he’s seen a marked increase in interest in hiking over the past decade, owing to social media.“People get interested when their friends start to advertise. They have handphones with cameras, they take pictures, send here, send there - it becomes very popular,” said the 59-year-old.But perhaps the largest factor that has fuelled interest in hiking as of late: the COVID-19 pandemic.A Facebook group, Singapore Hikers, had about 2,000 members before Singapore’s Circuit Breaker started last April.One year on, it now has 72,000 members, said the group’s administrator Joven Chiew.This parallels the boom in visitors to green spaces.“Today, weekdays are crowded, weekends are overcrowded,” said Mr Pandian.NParks told CNA it has seen at least a 50 per cent increase in visitorship across gardens, parks and nature reserves since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.In 2020, Bukit Timah Nature Reserve saw more than 700,000 visitors, compared to an annual average of 400,000.The Sungei Buloh Wetland Reserve received more than 220,000 visitors, up from the annual average of 110,000, it said.Last week, social media images showed throngs of hikers along multiple trails, including the newly-reopened Rail Corridor (Central).Some netizens even likened the crowds to pre-pandemic traffic along the causeway to Johor Bahru.Authorities responded by deploying over 500 NParks staff to patrol parks, nature reserves and green spaces, said Lim Liang Jim from the National Biodiversity Centre under NParks. He was speaking in a Facebook video posted by MP Sim Ann (PAP-Holland Bukit Timah).Mr Lim added that NParks would consider closing off sections of the green space if crowds there become too dense.CASUAL VISITORS CREATING PROBLEMS FOR NATUREThe boom in newly-inducted hikers is worrying long-time enthusiasts.Issues like littering have worsened, according to Mr Pandian, who said he has seen diapers strewn about in nature reserves.“That is really a painful thing … I can show you all kinds of treasures from cigarette butts, which you should not be seeing: water bottles, sweet wrappers, tissues,” he said.“I feel a bit sad because those people who go there - I don't think they love nature, but they go there for the purpose of saying: ‘I've been to a nature walk.’”Seasoned hiker Mr Chay says another big problem is the noise pollution – be it from someone blasting music on a trail, or large groups talking loudly.“Having more (hikers) is actually okay, but it’s the habits they bring with them. They treat it like a mall,” he said.Many are also unaware of proper hiking etiquette, Mr Chay noted.“It’s just like traffic rules. You should keep to your left all the time. And when you want to overtake, make sure it’s clear, then you say, ‘On your right.’”In addition, some called out the irony in how many visitors appear to only be interested in hiking on man-made trails.“We are so urbanised, we don’t want to get dirty. Singaporeans like palatable nature, not real nature,” said Mr Pandian.This could contribute to a lack of understanding about the sanctity of natural spaces, he reasoned.At the same time, adventure seekers who go off curated trails could be causing trouble.This is so especially in nature reserves – where forest floors next to paths could be damaged, while human activity could affect animal movement or lead to plant saplings being trampled on, NParks said.“Each visitor has a part to play in ensuring that the areas beside the paths or trails are not impacted by them.“While the damage may not be immediately obvious, the incremental effects will result in the failure of vegetation leaving behind heavily compacted ground which may take a long time to recover, if at all,” NParks said.But it notes that while there have been more visitors to green spaces, “most continue to practice good trail etiquette”, including staying on designated trails.NParks encouraged visitors to adhere to rules and signs, while egging on others to do the same.TO CULTIVATE THIS INTEREST, OR PRUNE IT?Nature enthusiasts are now grappling with the tension between promoting an interest in nature and protecting it.On one hand, Assoc Prof Barnard suggests: “The best thing that can be done to these areas is that we don't go in there.""He added that park facilities can be seen as a ""manifestation of Singapore's larger love of infrastructure and progress placed upon nature”.Yet, there is good that comes out of having more people interact with nature.“Im half-half on this,” said Mr Pandian. “The more people there are walking, the more people tend to appreciate so at least we can protect (the forests).”“Out of 10 who goes in there, one is just mischievous and just wants to be different from the nine.“Whatever we can do is educate them,” he said.Mr Chay echoed this, suggesting a national campaign on park etiquette.MORE TRAILS ON THE CARDSSocial graces will have to keep up, especially as Singapore charges ahead with plans to achieve its ""City in Nature"" vision, experts said.Four more island wide trails and corridors will be done by 2030.Looking ahead to how and where more trails could be built in future, NParks said that in planning, it “tries to incorporate existing trails into the development instead of creating new ones so as to minimise disturbance to wildlife and their habitats”.Other considerations include developing trails that will allow visitors to learn more about our native flora and fauna, it said.It also considers vegetation types. “To avoid human-wildlife conflicts, trails will be located away from vegetation or native trees that are food sources to wildlife,” it said.Narrower trails measuring 1.2m, could be used to encourage people to walk in a single file, also leading them to keep their noise levels down.On the other hand, broader nature trails double the width are better-suited for urban areas or for emergency access, it added.Ultimately, experts welcome the addition of more hiking trails.“This will definitely help Singaporeans to get to know their country more in their leisure times and enjoy the remote corners of our lovely countryside.“(It will also) perhaps quell, to some extent, the hankering for the exotic landscapes in other countries and instill a greater love for their own country,” said Dr Ho.He added that there is plenty of untapped potential and space for more trails, but offered some advice.To make long-distance trails and park connectors “more interesting and exciting”, Dr Ho believes they should be routed away from roads, highways or along canals running alongside an HDB estate.Such routes do not provide an escape from concrete urban settings or noise and pollution from vehicles, he said, adding that some also lack greenery for shade or nature appreciation.He raised examples of the long Coastal Park Connector from the Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal to the Changi Ferry Terminal.There would be a lot more potential for exciting cross-island routes, Dr Ho said, “if land-owning authorities like the military or the (Singapore Land Authority) can open up and share their space in non-sensitive zones, which usually have extensive wooded landscape and hills and uncanalised streams with the presence of many wildlife”.“The trails don’t have to intrude too much into these officially prohibited areas but can just be routed along the boundary zone, but within areas that are wooded that can provide shade, as well as crossing hills and natural streams or ponds for opportunities for interesting contact with wildlife.”He also suggested providing camping facilities for those making long-distance trips, preferably in established parks where there are also toilets.“This will be an added incentive to the hiking and cycling adventure created by these long-distance park-connectors,” he said.While these will be exciting additions, nature lovers like Mr Pandian say they’re still enamoured by current routes.“Every time I walk the same trail over and over again, I see something different … Sometimes the insects will appear differently, or I’ll see some animal I've not seen before.“I love the trails. I feel part of it,” said Mr Pandian.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['Hiking', 'Nature', 'NParks']",Singapore
126,Jail for 21-year-old man who molested two teenage boys,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-molested-two-teenage-boys-in-lift-bus-jailed-14539384,01 Apr 2021 09:23PM,"SINGAPORE: For molesting two teenage boys in separate incidents last year, a 21-year-old man was on Thursday (Apr 1) sentenced to 18 months in jail. The court heard that Malaysian Clement Tan Jun Yan noticed his first victim at Yishun Bus Interchange at about 9pm on Aug 2 last year.  He boarded the same bus as the boy, who was 15 at the time, and sat next to him. Tan alighted at the same bus stop as the victim, then followed him to his block and took the same lift as him. The 15-year-old was about to step out of the lift when Tan blocked his way. He touched the victim's penis over his shorts, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Niranjan Ranjakunalan, adding that the offence was captured on CCTV footage.The boy, who tried to push Tan away, asked him what he was doing and he apologised. The victim told his parents what had happened and his mother lodged a police report the next day. Tan was arrested on Aug 5 and was released on bail. On Oct 23 at about 6.50am, Tan boarded the same bus as his second victim, who was on the way to school, and sat next to him. Tan placed his hand on the 13-year-old boy’s hand. When the teenager pushed his hand away, Tan put his left arm around the victim’s shoulder instead. Ignoring Tan’s questions, the teenager stood up to leave his seat when the accused squeezed the victim’s buttocks over his clothes.Tan did this again as the boy was walking away.The victim stood near the rear door of the bus and Tan followed him, eventually alighting while the boy remained on the bus. The 13-year-old told his form teacher what happened and a police report was lodged that morning.The prosecution noted that a medical report by a doctor from the Institute of Mental Health stated that Tan had admitted to having sexual interest towards young males of secondary school-going age, and had viewed pornographic material involving young males above the age of 13. The report noted that Tan did not have a mental illness, but he did have a sexual interest in pubescent children in their early adolescence, otherwise known as hebephilia.  It also stated that Tan was not of unsound mind during the time of the offences and was fit to plead in court, the prosecution noted. Tan told the court that he was unable to control his sexual desires due to ""stress"" at work. Two similar charges linked to other victims, also teenagers, were considered during Tan's sentencing.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

127,'The biggest challenge ... is to relay bad news': How the Traffic Police investigates fatal accidents,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fatal-accident-traffic-police-bad-news-14523874,31 Mar 2021 06:28AM,"SINGAPORE: Traffic Police (TP) investigation officer Saleha Mohd Sani, 37, clearly remembers her first case after joining the Fatal Accident Investigation Team (FAIT) two years ago.“It was the fear of attending to my first case,” Station Inspector (SI) Saleha told reporters on Monday (Mar 29) at the TP headquarters in Ubi.This was not the usual new job jitters – SI Saleha has been with the TP for 15 years – but anxiety about an extremely heavy responsibility.“The biggest challenge for me, of course, is to relay bad news to the next-of-kin,” she added.While SI Saleha previously did general investigations, FAIT investigation officers are specifically trained to handle fatal accidents and are experienced enough to specialise in them. When a person injured in a serious accident later dies, these officers will take over the case.FAIT investigation officers gather on-scene evidence like dashboard camera footage, tyre skid marks and vehicle damage, with the main aim of reconstructing the accident and establishing the facts of the case.They get help from crime scene specialists, who take photos of the scene and use 3D scanners to create accurate and detailed models of it. These specialists also collect forensic evidence like DNA, fingerprints and paint scratches arising from the crash.These details can help bring justice for the deceased and closure for their loved ones.BREAKING THE BAD NEWSSI Saleha said her first case involved a bus that ran over a motorcyclist who tried overtaking from the left. “(The body) was beyond recognition, and we had to relay the news to the family member and prepare them for the condition of the body,” she said.At the scene, SI Saleha found the victim’s phone and called his wife, who was surprised to hear another woman on the line. It later emerged that the victim was on his way home from work. SI Saleha told the woman that her husband had got into an accident, and to quickly head down.“We informed her about how the accident happened, and of course we had to tell her that the condition was quite bad,” SI Saleha said, adding that she advised the woman to bring along another family member.At this point, many would start to question if their loved ones had died, but SI Saleha said officers try to offer as few details as possible and not reveal this over the phone.“We do it face to face because we don’t want them to get emotional, and then they get themselves (in danger) by rushing to the scene,” she explained.SI Saleha said officers are trained to relay the heartbreaking news, although she highlighted that this was “not an easy task to do” as officers too can get emotional.“You need to have the composure and be professional in your dealings with them,” she said, adding that some next-of-kin will refuse to believe the horrific news. “But once the reality sets in, they will eventually start to accept the news.”When SI Saleha finally told the woman about her husband, she said the woman blanked out and did not know what to do.“Maybe they had just seen the person a few hours ago, so they don’t believe that it really happened to their loved ones,” she said, noting that next-of-kin are given the choice of seeing the body or not.“It’s normal that they are a bit helpless, so we have to constantly remind them and assure them that we are doing our best to bring justice to the deceased.”At fatal accident scenes, police officers would have already been deployed to help manage distraught next-of-kin who might want to hold or hug the deceased for the last time.“We have to tell them that we need to do our job and hopefully bring closure to the case,” SI Saleha added. “We will give them some time to be with the deceased, but of course not to touch any of the evidence at the scene.”WHAT DO OFFICERS LOOK OUT FOR?This evidence includes the position of the deceased, and more general observations like weather and road conditions as well as the first point of impact.The investigation officer will be briefed by a colleague who was the first to arrive on scene. This includes getting information on the parties involved, the location of the deceased and whether there were witnesses or footage of the accident.The officer will record the statements of the parties involved, before conducting fuller interviews back at the station at a later stage.Some witnesses could wait for the investigation officer to arrive, while others who need to go might leave behind the memory stick from their dashboard camera and get in touch later.In the absence of dashcam clips, footage from Land Transport Authority cameras in the vicinity could help illustrate events leading up to the accident, SI Saleha said.A fatal accident sign with a police hotline will be placed at the scene in case other witnesses want to share information.All this has to be done under considerable time pressure. SI Saleha pointed out the need to clear the scene “as soon as possible”, especially during conditions like bad weather and heavy traffic.“We don't want to delay the commuters, and so that is the challenge,” she said. “We need to clear the scene fast, gather evidence and of course find as much evidence as we can at the scene.”RECREATING THE ACCIDENTThis is when a virtual 3D model of the scene comes in handy, allowing investigators to revisit the site multiple times without disrupting traffic flow.The model also acts as a permanent record of the physical evidence on site, reducing the possibility of missing out on some evidence in a messy scene, for instance.Depending on the scale of the accident, this model can be created in minutes by a single crime scene specialist using a tripod mounted terrestrial 3D scanner. Multiple scanners can be used to produce different perspectives of the scene.The spinning scanner, which works both day and night, projects a laser beam on the surface of objects at the scene to accurately measure distances and spatial positioning, factors that are crucial in reconstructing the accident.“3D scan data can also help FAIT investigation officers refresh the memory of witnesses and the accused during their interview,” said senior crime scene specialist Madeleine Bong, 29.Ms Bong, who has been with the TP since 2019, showed a virtual model of an actual accident involving a truck that had run over and killed a motorcyclist.The partially coloured 3D model was so detailed that it captured the motorcyclist’s food delivery bag and blood on the road. Using interactive 3D software, investigators can simply drag a line across the model to determine distance.A lighter and more portable 3D scanner can be used in tighter spaces such as vehicle interiors, when more details of a specific area of interest are required.GETTING FINGERPRINTS FROM BODIES“Some cases sound very simple, but it can be very complicated when there's limited physical evidence at the scene,” Ms Bong said, noting that this could be the case in a fatal accident when the body’s condition makes it unidentifiable.“We will try our best to find any physical or forensic evidence that can help to identify the person.”Ms Bong said she has obtained fingerprints from victims of fatal accidents, and did not bat an eyelid when asked how that made her feel.“I think it’s normal,” she said with a laugh. “Before I attend a scene, I will actually prepare myself for the most gruesome sight. So when I go to the scene, I can remain calm and composed.”Ms Bong said she feels fulfilled when the evidence she collected sheds more light on a case.“I feel that the victim or the deceased could not speak for themselves at that moment of time,” she added. “So, I’m the only who can give this information to the investigation officer for them to solve the case.”WORKING WITH DEATHBesides using the 3D models, investigation officers could also engage the Health Sciences Authority to calculate a vehicle’s speed before it crashed. These details will “definitely help” in any potential prosecution in court, SI Saleha said.Despite that, there have been fatal accidents with a lack of physical evidence showing how they happened, such as those that happen in secluded areas with no cameras or passing vehicles, SI Saleha said.In one such accident involving a vehicle crashing into a centre divider and finally hitting a tree, SI Saleha concluded that it was a case of self-skidding based on marks on the road.“If we don’t have enough evidence, then of course we can’t prosecute anyone,” she stated. “If there are no cameras to prove the party at fault, we will have to take no further action pending further developments.”On a more human side, SI Saleha acknowledged that it has sometimes been difficult dealing with the morbid nature of her job.“At times I get carried away and have difficulty sleeping, but over time it made me realise the importance of family ties as well as to appreciate your loved ones,” she said.When things get too “taxing”, SI Saleha said she takes a hot shower after getting home to “dislodge” herself from the case and not think about it.“That's usually how I distract myself,” she said. “Because if you get too emotional, at times it can also affect your mental health.”Ultimately, SI Saleha said the greatest satisfaction in her job is when she brings closure to victim’s family members and successfully prosecutes any alleged perpetrators.“We want to bring justice to the deceased,” she added.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

129,"The Big Read: A year after the first COVID-19 outbreak in dorms, how has life changed for foreign workers?",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-covid-19-outbreak-dormitories-foreign-workers-14504974,29 Mar 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: On most days, Mr Al Amin, a foreign worker who hails from Bangladesh, leaves for work at 7am and returns to his dormitory room at around 8pm.He spends his remaining waking hours doing chores such as laundry and cooking dinner. He then catches up with his family back home over the phone before calling it a night.The 27-year-old’s routine is a far cry from his “independent” lifestyle in pre-pandemic days.“Before COVID-19, we could go out to the shops or the field and spend our time there ... But now, we come back from work and just stay in our rooms.”“That’s why I say nowadays staying in a dormitory is like being in jail and does not feel like a resident,” said the technician who stays at ASPRI-Westlite Papan dormitory in Jurong East.For others, such as fellow Bangladeshi Mr Miraz (not his real name) who stays in Jurong Penjuru dormitory, it is the boredom that is hard to beat.“We cannot use the gym or go downstairs. I cannot meet my friends to talk. Even though there is a lake just in front of the dormitory, we cannot even go there to sit,” said the 29-year-old site supervisor who did not want to give his real name for fear of getting into trouble with his employer and dormitory operator.With the COVID-19 situation improving in Singapore, he suggested that the Government allow foreign workers to go out into the community. The number of people who can leave the dormitories at any one time can be staggered, he said.Mr Miraz may not have to wait long, with the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) saying that dormitory residents will be able to visit the community in “controlled numbers” once a month in the near future. “When a large majority of dorm residents are recovered workers or vaccinated and the risk of transmission in dormitories is greatly reduced, we can ease restrictions further,” said an MOM spokesperson in response to TODAY’s queries.Foreign workers have been mostly confined to their dormitories ever since the first dormitory cluster at S11 @ Punggol was identified on Mar 30 last year.At that time, the virus spread quickly among the workers who lived in densely-packed rooms which could house up to 20 people each. At the peak of the outbreak in April last year — when Singapore entered the circuit breaker period  —  more than 1,000 new COVID-19 cases were identified in dormitories daily. The rate of infection forced the Government to impose strict curbs on the movement of foreign workers, confining them to their rooms.It also activated a team to support dormitory operators in managing the pandemic. This included providing food to workers, moving some to temporary accommodation to reduce the density of dormitories, and rolling out a mass swabbing exercise to identify COVID-19 cases. Employers were told to house workers from the same worksites or companies in the same rooms as much as possible.To date, the pandemic has infected tens of thousands of foreign workers living in dormitories, with two workers succumbing to COVID-19 complications. As of Friday (Mar 26), Singapore has reported 60,265 cases of COVID-19 infections. In total, nearly half of the more than 320,000 foreign workers living in dormitories have tested positive for COVID-19 in polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or serology tests. Serology tests look for the presence of antibodies and can detect previous infections in people who had few or no symptoms. However, the situation has eased in the past few months. In August, all dormitories were declared clear of the virus and workers gradually returned to work. The last case detected in a dormitory was on Feb 28. The workers are also allowed to use communal facilities such as kitchens and minimarts in their dormitories in staggered timings, provided their dormitory operator has received the green light from MOM.Foreign workers can also visit one of the eight recreation centres, which house facilities such as supermarkets and food centres, thrice a week for four hours each visit, which they must book through MOM’s SGWorkPass mobile application in advance.Despite the relaxation in rules, foreign workers told TODAY they continue to feel confined to their dormitories one year on, and look forward to returning to the community as they did pre-COVID.On Wednesday, the multi-ministry COVID-19 task force was asked at a press conference why migrant workers are still subjected to more stringent measures compared to the rest of the community even though cases have fallen considerably among the population. Education Minister Lawrence Wong, who co-chairs the task force, reiterated that the migrant worker dormitories “remain places where one single case can easily spread to many other workers” because of the high-risk nature of their living and work environments. “In construction, for example, despite our best efforts with having different zones and avoiding intermingling of workers, it’s very hard to really make sure that there is that kind of segregation taking place all the time,” he said. While going back to their lives as they knew it is their immediate wish, the future for the foreign workers in a post-pandemic Singapore remains a subject of national conversation. The COVID-19 outbreak in the dorms has raised questions about Singapore’s treatment of its migrant workers, and there is widespread acknowledgment that their living conditions have to be improved. The Government has since looked into the matter and introduced new specifications to give each resident more living space. The specifications are being piloted in several temporary dorms which have been built to reduce the density in existing dorms. The finalised specifications will be announced later this year. Aimed at making dormitories pandemic-proof and preventing a recurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak, these specifications will be incorporated into the 11 new purpose-built dormitories that the Government plans to build over the next one to two years.While some of these changes bode well for the workers’ welfare, they will come at a cost to consumers and taxpayers, industry players told TODAY.DEALING WITH STRESS AND BOREDOMAt the height of the COVID-19 outbreak in dormitories, reports of migrant workers suffering from mental health issues or attempting suicide due to prolonged isolation emerged.One year on, the restrictions placed on dormitories have had varying impacts on their residents. While some foreign workers told TODAY that they no longer felt as worried as they did before, others continued to feel stressed over being cooped up with other residents.Mr Veeraiyan Hariprasath, a 28-year-old maintenance worker staying at The Leo Dormitory at Kaki Bukit, said that during the circuit breaker, he felt greatly disturbed after hearing about deaths from COVID-19. Unable to go to work, he was also concerned about his financial security. However, these fears abated in August after the dorm outbreak came under control and the Indian national was able to resume work.Mr Hariprasath said that as his job requires him to travel around the island, he does not feel as restricted or stressed as other foreign workers who can only travel between their rooms and work sites.At the other end of the spectrum is Mr Al Amin, who said that his stress level had only reduced “from 100 per cent to 90 per cent” now.Initially anxious about whether he would survive the pandemic (he did not contract the virus), he is now stressed about having no avenue to relieve the pressures he faces at work.“Sometimes the boss will order you around or the supervisor will shout. There’s so much pressure and you cannot refresh your mind at the workplace,” Mr Al Amin said.Having to return from work to a room full of 16 people engaging in various activities, such as cooking or watching a video on loudspeaker, means that it is difficult to find a peaceful moment for mental rejuvenation, he added. Squabbles among his roommates are also common as the activity of one could disturb another, said Mr Al Amin.While he could opt to go to a recreation centre on his rest days, he prefers not to as “everywhere (in the centre) is queue, queue, queue”, given the crowds.Other workers said that living conditions had not improved much, one year after dormitory standards came under the national spotlight.Mr Miraz, who moved into Jurong Penjuru Dormitory three months ago, said that with 16 people sharing “a very small space”, the living situation still felt the same as it did before COVID-19.He was previously staying at Kranji Lodge 1 where there were 12 people in a room.The double-decker beds in his current room are so near to one another that they do not meet the 1m safe distancing requirement. The room is also hot, with workers having to buy their own fans, he added.Migrant worker groups have questioned the necessity for restrictions on foreign workers as the Covid-19 situation in Singapore has improved.In a statement last September, migrant worker group Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2) argued that the Government should allow workers out of their dormitories, given the low number of COVID-19 cases detected among them and efforts to isolate positive cases.Medical experts, too, agreed that there is now little reason to impose restrictions on these workers.With almost half of dormitory residents having tested positive for COVID-19, these workers have already achieved herd immunity, said experts. Herd immunity means that a large part of the population has become immune to the disease, providing protection to non-immune individuals.Associate Professor Alex Cook, from the National University of Singapore’s Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, said that of the three factors keeping COVID-19 under control in dormitories — herd immunity, regular testing and restrictions on workers’ movement — herd immunity is the most important.“I am unsure whether it’s really necessary to maintain these restrictions. As noted, there are other brakes on transmission, such as the herd immunity and frequent testing, and for the residents’ mental well-being, we should aim to release as many of these restrictions as possible,” said Assoc Prof Cook.Once fully vaccinated or recovered, dormitory residents can be subject to the same restrictions as others in the community who have been vaccinated, he added.However, in an interview with media outlet BBC on Mar 14, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong noted that half of foreign workers in dormitories are still vulnerable to infection. He said it will be too much of a risk for them to mix freely with the general population as COVID-19 is still circulating in Singapore.""To have them living in a communal setting like this, and at the same time be able to mingle completely unrestrained with the rest of our population outside of the work setting, is risking going back to where we were,"" said PM Lee.He added that he was mindful of the mental pressure of being cooped up, and that the Government is working out arrangements to ensure that they do not remain in their rooms all the time.COMING SOON: MORE SPACE, BETTER LIVINGAfter COVID-19 threw into sharp relief the plight of migrant workers here, the authorities announced last June that it would take steps to improve their living standards in dormitories. The new dormitories to be built in the coming years will house up to 100,000 workers and have amenities such as minimarts, barber services and indoor recreation facilities. Blocks will be spaced out to ensure good ventilation while workers in these dormitories will have ready access to medical care. Existing dormitories will also be upgraded to meet the new standards.All dormitories will be designed to be more resilient to public health risks, and have improved living standards benchmarked both domestically and internationally, said MOM in June last year.The Government had already constructed seven Quick Build Dormitories last year to reduce the density of residents in current dormitories. A further eight are expected to be completed this year, with all 15 dormitories housing about 25,000 workers.These dormitories, which are temporary structures meant to last for two to three years, will act as a testbed for new and improved standards in future dormitories.For example, they will be roomier, providing 6 sqm or more per resident, excluding shared facilities. The number of residents will also be capped at 10 to reduce inter-mixing among residents.Current laws require dormitories to provide at least 4.5 sqm, including shared facilities, for each resident. There is no cap on the number of residents.Each room in a Quick Build Dormitory is also fitted with an ensuite toilet to minimise transmission risks from shared facilities. There will also be at least one toilet for every five residents, instead of the current 15 residents.“The principle basis is to de-densify all the rooms, to facilitate the segregation of residents, so that during a pandemic we can quickly impose lockdowns in a very targeted and precise manner,” explained Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng in Parliament earlier this month.When TODAY visited the Quick Build Dormitory managed by Westlite Accommodation at Tuas Avenue 2 last week, it observed that each room in the dormitory has just five single-decked beds, with each bed situated 1m apart from each other. There is also an ensuite toilet in every room.There are also two communal kitchens for every block of 60 to 80 residents, with staggered timings for residents to use them. Other communal facilities, such as the minimart and gym, also limit the number of residents who could enter at any one time.Mr Mathiyalagan Alagarsamy, a foreign worker staying at the Tuas dormitory, said that he preferred the Quick Build Dormitory to previous dormitories he had stayed in as there was more space and safe-distancing between beds. This has reduced his fears of getting infected by COVID-19. His previous room at Toh Guan Dormitory, also managed by Westlite Accommodation, had 10 residents.The 27-year-old, who is a maintenance worker with Westlite, said that while it may be inconvenient to follow all the rules and regulations, he knows that they are necessary for his own safety during the pandemic.Mr Alagarsamy hopes that future dormitories would also be limited to five people to a room. He would also prefer dormitories to have ensuite kitchens to reduce the hassle of having to carry the food back to his room.TURNING DORMITORIES INTO BETTER ""HOMES""The planned improvements on future dormitories will alter the way foreign workers live in a post-pandemic Singapore, said observers and industry players. Mr Johnathan Cheah, the managing director of S11 Dormitories, said that the new standards for dormitories will “really improve the landscape” and raise the standard of living for workers.   With the Government focused on making the living space in dormitories more spacious, there will be fewer occupants in each room and more communal facilities for residents. For example, instead of one large gym, there could be three smaller gyms for residents to use, said Mr Cheah.With fewer residents using the same number of facilities, workers will better enjoy the facilities and see an improvement in their living space and conditions, he added.Mr Kong Chee Min, chief executive officer of Centurion Corporation, which is the parent company of Westlite Accomodation, said that ensuite kitchens, toilets and showers will “make a difference” in future dormitories.As these areas are used by residents daily, the risk of contact and contagion increases when a larger number of residents across different rooms use these amenities.Having ensuite communal facilities will reduce the risk of contracting a virus through contact, said Mr Kong. Currently, not all dorms have such facilities. Some, including Westlite’s existing dormitories, already do. Mr Kong said that his company will continue building them in any future dorms. Apart from the layout of rooms, Mr Kong said that the design of dormitory estates, as well as systems to manage the movement of foreign workers, will be important.With the use of communal facilities resuming in dormitories, these aspects of a dormitory will allow operators to control the inter-mingling of residents between different blocks and rooms.When asked if changes to Westlite’s current dormitories are adequate to meet the next wave of a similar pandemic, Mr Kong noted that the risk factor of pandemics lies not only in the number of residents in each room, but how they mingle across rooms, floors and blocks of dormitories.“Whether there are five or 12 persons living in an apartment unit, if the residents of apartment units freely socialise or mingle with residents of other units or blocks within the dormitory, there will be wide-scale contact risks,” he said.As such, on top of other government measures, such as Rostered Routine Testing where workers are tested for COVID-19 every two weeks, Westlite has also implemented additional measures to reduce the risk of potential transmission, he added.This includes segregating residents of each dormitory into smaller sub-communities, or “bubbles” of about 100 to 150 residents, to reduce contact and the risk of spread to smaller numbers of residents. Each bubble has dedicated walking paths to ensure that residents remain segregated from other bubbles.Westlite has also developed and invested in physical installations and technology applications to manage the movement of residents and restrict inter-mixing between these segregated bubbles, said Mr Kong.For example, it has introduced QR code-activated electromagnetic (EM) locks to the entrances of every floor in the existing dormitories to keep residents from different floors and blocks from mixing during the pandemic. These locks will also be included in future dormitories to reduce inter-mixing among residents, said Mr Kong.However, Mr Cheah of S11 cautioned that changes to dormitories will not guarantee that they are resistant to future pandemics.“Frankly, I don’t think a change in hardware will simply future-proof dormitories to pandemics because future pandemics can exist in different forms, spread in a different way and affect humans differently,” he said.Mr Cheah, who is also the president of the Dormitory Association of Singapore, said that there should also be a focus on changing the habits of dormitory residents so that they are more conscious about issues such as hygiene and social distancing.WHO’S FOOTING THE BILL?Better dormitories and living conditions for foreign workers will come at a cost, with consumers and taxpayers ultimately having to foot the bill, said industry players.For one, more space for each worker means the cost will naturally go up, much like buying a higher-priced four-room Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat instead of a three-room flat, said Mr Cheah.He estimated that dormitories based on new standards set by the Government would cost about S$50 to S$100 more per person monthly, up from the current market price range of S$280 to S$350.The increase is necessary as dormitory operators will need to recover the cost of constructing new dorms or retrofitting existing ones. They will also need to hike up rents to make a profit from rentals, said Mr Cheah.The estimated increase includes extra maintenance costs related to safe-living measures, which Mr Cheah said could come up to about S$40 a month. The extra costs would cover, among other things, the hiring of security personnel to do additional duties such as  temperature screening, said Mr Cheah.Employers of foreign workers said that they will factor the price increase of dormitories into future contracts.“So let’s say in another six months, the prices of dormitory rental go up, then we must be careful to price tenders accordingly due to the higher overheads at that time,” said Mr Nelson Tee, managing director of CHH Construction System.When asked if there is any way to cut costs in other areas such that contract prices do not go up, Mr Tee said: “I don’t know what to cut. We are running very thin on everything now.”He said that the construction sector is currently “bleeding” due to a rise in material and labour costs. The sector will eventually have to find a way to increase its productivity, but certain overheads, such as perks for staff, may be cut to keep contract costs low, he added.Speaking during his ministry’s budget debate in March, Dr Tan, the Second Minister for Manpower, said that the Government recognises that employers and dormitory operators may have to bear higher costs for dormitories in future.“Many businesses would have locked in their costs in their existing projects and will now need time to adjust to higher migrant worker housing costs.“Dormitory operators may also be more cautious in bidding to build and own new dormitories, given the current uncertain demand for migrant worker housing, alongside with the evolving COVID-19 situation,” he said.Hence, the Government is studying the possibility of developing upcoming purpose-built dormitories on a different operating model, said Dr Tan.Under the current system, land is released for commercial operators to bid, build and operate the dormitories.One such new model, which has been floated by the authorities, is the “build, own and lease model” where the Government builds the dormitory. A separate entity, such as a private company or non-governmental organisation, can then lease and operate it, said Mr Wong, the Education Minister and task force co-chair, in June last year.This model has been piloted with Quick Build Dormitories. For instance, the Quick Build Dormitory at Tuas Avenue 2 is developed by JTC Corporation and leased and managed by Westlite Accommodation.Mr Cheah said that such a model will put the Government in a better position to make changes to dormitories if it needs to, such as during another pandemic.The Government can also fix the rental rates of dormitory rooms when it requests for tenders, said Mr Cheah.However, this may make it harder for dormitory operators to make a profit as it will have to work around the budget set by the Government.With this model, entities running the dormitories will also adopt the role of a managing agent who ensures that the property is well kept and residents are looked after. This means that managing agents from other industries which handle residents, such as hotel operators, may also want to enter the market, increasing the competition for existing dormitory operators, said Mr Cheah.Mr Cheah felt that the current model is still the best as the operator has a vested interest in the asset, having spent money to acquire the land and construct the dormitory.“So naturally, they will want to ensure that the dormitory is operated properly. Laws such as FEDA will help make sure that dormitories comply with regulations,” said Mr Cheah, referring to the Foreign Employee Dormitories Act which regulates among other things, the provision of facilities and services, health and safety in dormitories housing 1,000 or more residents.Regardless of which model is finally adopted, one thing is certain: There can be no return to the status quo ante — many people in Singapore had spoken out on behalf of the foreign workers, who have helped to keep the city-state humming all these years.In the meantime, foreign workers are waiting for the day they can go out and about as they used to.Said Mr Miraz: “It’s my prayer that I don’t want to see anymore COVID-19 in Singapore. This is good for us, the workers, and Singaporeans. We just don’t want to see any more cases and hopefully, the Government will let us go out,” said Mr Miraz.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

130,MOM unveils onboarding centre for new migrant workers; COVID-19 jabs to begin at 30 dorms,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/migrant-workers-onboarding-centre-covid-19-vaccination-mom-14498834,26 Mar 2021 08:46PM,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) unveiled on Friday (Mar 26) a one-stop centre in Punggol for new migrant workers to complete their stay-home notice, get the necessary medical examination as well as the support to settle in.Located at a quick build dormitory, the pilot onboarding centre in Punggol has been operational since Mar 15, receiving incoming migrant workers from the construction, marine and process sector. There are three other centres in Eunos and Tengah.Authorities plan to offer COVID-19 vaccinations in future for new arrivals at these onboarding centres, said Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng.For now, about 30,000 workers in 30 dormitories are scheduled to get their jabs in the coming weeks, as the vaccination exercise for migrant workers moved into its second phase.In the first phase, 97 per cent of about 9,000 eligible workers have received their first dose, said Dr Tan on the sidelines of a visit to the Punggol onboarding centre.The centres were announced at the Committee of Supply debates earlier in March.A fifth onboarding centre will be set up at a quick-build dormitory in Choa Chu Kang soon, said MOM in a factsheet. In total, the five sites can accommodate 7,000 workers. Previously, new migrant workers from the sector need to serve a 14-day stay-home notice at hotels before moving to a designated facility for an additional seven-day isolation period.With the onboarding centre, those who test negative after four days at a hotel can move on to complete their stay-home notice at the facility. They stay in rooms of five and take another COVID-19 test on days seven and 15. After completing their 14-day stay-home notice, workers from ""higher risk"" regions including India and Bangladesh have to serve an additional seven-day stay-home notice at another block in the facility. If their serology test is positive, indicating a past infection, they are classified as recovered workers and will be housed in separate blocks in the onboarding centre.""We do need foreign workers coming in to support the construction of our economy and continue the growth path that we have been used to over the last few years. And there are significant construction projects, there is also a significant uptick in terms of the economic growth that's needed in the manufacturing and marine as well as processing industry,"" said Dr Tan.""And because of that need, we thought that it would be actually most expedient for us to centralise this into one common database, whereby you ensure that when they come in, they're onboarded appropriately. And at the same time, screening is done to ensure that care is delivered to the point where they need it.” Workers will also undergo an enhanced medical examination that will help to identify health risks like diabetes and high cholesterol early, said MOM.In addition, they go through an expanded settling-in programme, which now includes topics like mental health education, help-seeking channels and safe living measures amid the pandemic, said the ministry.At the Punggol quick build dormitory, workers can even register their biometric information to speed up the work pass application process. Previously, each employer would need to arrange for the medical screening and the settling-in programme on their own after workers complete their stay-home notice.With the onboarding centres, the total cost for employers is about S$2,400 per worker, about S$300 less than before. Adding that it would be ""better"" if some of these processes can be started in the home countries of the migrant workers, Dr Tan said the ultimate plan is to move some parts of this process to the source countries, for workers to go through them before they arrive in Singapore. The pilot, which will last for a year, will allow authorities to study how to implement some overseas facilities as well, he added. ""By about six to nine months, when we have gotten the numbers, we can then size up and specify what kind of facility, how big (it is) and where we can set up the facility,"" said Dr Tan. ""We hope that it will be one to two centralised facilities to cater to those that fly in and to cater to those that come in by land. I don't envisage that there'll be a lot of people coming by sea."" Mr Chan Eng Yew, CEO of shipbuilding company Strategic Marine, estimates that he has saved about 10 to 15 per cent of the cost of bringing a migrant worker in with the onboarding centre. ""Cost savings are definitely there, and not only savings in terms of actual monetary value but also time, in terms of the resources that the company is looking to coordinate,"" he said. There are currently two migrant workers with the company who arrived from Bangladesh and staying in the Punggol onboarding centre. Mr Chan said the company has also received in-principle approval to bring in 16 more. ""With the onboarding centre, it's also a very good area for us to continue to learn, to predict, and to preempt. It also allows us to take very proactive and preventive, as well as pre-emptive steps towards any future outbreak,"" said Dr Tan. When asked whether there are plans to allow migrant workers to go back out into the community, Dr Tan said the Manpower Ministry plans to increase the visits to recreational centres, and slowly open up for them to enter the community. ""This is going to be a graduated calibrated process, and we are also simultaneously starting our vaccination programme for the migrant workers as well. So with a confluence of all that, I think you can expect to see some announcements,"" he added. ""The caveat is, we should not see any uptick in cases, we're holding it very very tightly ... So keep your fingers crossed, let's continue to maintain it that way, then (we are) actually beginning to see light at the end of the tunnel.""

131,"Man admits raping daughter, sexually assaulted her from the age of 3 and showed her porn",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-rape-daughter-age-three-porn-paedophile-14497278,26 Mar 2021 04:11PM,"SINGAPORE: After taking a shower with his young daughter as she was scared by television scenes of drowning, a man realised he was a paedophile and there was ""no turning back"".He began sexually abusing her when she was three and continued to do so for seven-and-a-half years, with the offences escalating to rape. He also showed her pornography.The crimes, which the prosecution slammed as ""heinous"", came to light only when his daughter's friend talked about his inappropriate behaviour during a confession at her first communion.The 44-year-old man, who cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the victim's identity, pleaded guilty on Friday (Mar 26) to three charges of statutory rape. Another 19 charges, including aggravated sexual assault by penetration, molestation and showing obscene objects to a young person, will be considered in sentencing, which was adjourned to a later date.The court heard that the man's wife, who is now 42, gave birth to the victim in 2008. They moved to Singapore subsequently and lived in rented condominiums.When the girl was between three and seven years old, she watched scenes on television of people drowning while swimming and became afraid of taking showers alone.Her father began showering with her, but ""developed a sexual desire for the victim"" in the process. According to him, it was at this point that he realised he was a paedophile and there was ""no turning back"".SEXUALLY ABUSED HER WHEN HIS WIFE WAS NOT AROUNDThe man began molesting his daughter and making her perform sex acts on him. The sexual abuse increased in frequency after they moved to a new home, and took place when his wife was at work, out of the country or not at home.He would show his daughter adult and child pornography before sexually assaulting her. This went on for seven-and-a-half years between December 2011 and June 2019.The girl did not tell anyone about the assault as she did not want her parents to divorce. Her father knew that she was not a willing party, as she would avoid looking at him when he assaulted her.The man also sexually assaulted a friend of his daughter, a girl who is now 13 and who was named in court documents only as V2. When his daughter was elsewhere in the house, the man would kiss V2 on the lips and tell her to keep it a secret.On one occasion, he sat between his daughter and V2 as they watched a movie and molested both of them. Eventually, V2 stopped going to their home to avoid him.Between April and May 2019, the man was home with his daughter, his infant son and a maid. The victim was in her bedroom reading a novel when her father entered the room.He showed her pornography on his phone before molesting his daughter, who was about 11 at the time. He then raped her even though she said: ""I don't want to.""By the accused's estimation, he raped his daughter more than 10 times but fewer than 20 times in all.DAUGHTER'S FRIEND EXPOSES HIS CRIMESIn June 2019, V2 was preparing to undergo her first communion overseas when she was asked to confess her sins. She revealed that the accused had behaved inappropriately with her in 2017. Her parents took her to lodge a police report when she returned to Singapore.The police began investigating the crimes committed against V2 and went to the accused's home in July 2019 and found his daughter alone at home.When they spoke to her, they discovered that she had also been sexually assaulted and arrested her father later that evening.Police found content related to young and prepubescent female children in his seized devices, and links found saved in his phone contained material pertaining to terms like ""incest love"" and ""lewd posts"".The victim's mother, who has since divorced the offender, later informed investigators that she discovered three child erotica stories in his email inbox.A psychiatric report from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) found that the offender has paedophilic disorder, where he has recurrent sexual urges or behaviour involving sexual activities with prepubescent children.From January to June 2018, he had ""a period of distress"" due to work stress, the court heard.However, IMH found no substantive contributory link between his disorder and the offences, as both his cognitive functioning and his volitional or emotional capability to break the law and act on his sexual desires were not significantly impaired.HE FELL UTTERLY SHORT OF ROLES AS A FATHER: PROSECUTIONProsecutors called for at least 30 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, saying that every young girl looks up to her father as her protector, guardian and provider, but the accused ""fell utterly short of these roles"".He robbed her of her childhood and innocence, and she ""tolerated years of abuse despite knowing what the accused did to her was wrong, and disliking it"", they said.She obeyed him each time he ""wheedled her into compliance"" and she continues to write him letters in remand to tell him that she loves and misses him, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Yvonne Poon and Lim Ying Min.""For the bulk of her life, every single home in Singapore that the victim resided in has been the site of some odious sexual activity with the accused. She was not safe from him even in her own bedroom,"" they said.""Throughout this period of up to seven-and-a-half years, the accused made the victim choose, time and time again, between the sanctity of her person versus her affection for her father and the wholeness of her family.""They added that no one should be made to shoulder such a terrible burden, much less a child as young as the victim.The offender was also ""deliberate and systematic"" in his crimes, planning his assault for when his wife was not home. He also exposed his daughter to child pornography, which the victim perceived as videos of ""a child having sex with her father"".The repeated showing of such videos demonstrates that the accused ""had clearly sought to corrupt the victim's innocence and to normalise and desensitise the victim to the heinous nature of his incestuous acts"", said prosecutors.Defence lawyer Amarjit Singh said 30 years would be ""too crushing a sentence"", asking instead for between 24 and 26 years. He said his client's wife has since divorced him and he has left everything to her.Parties will return next month for sentencing. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

133,Back to the office: 7 things you need to know as Singapore shifts to more flexible way of working amid COVID-19,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-returning-to-office-april-what-you-need-to-know-14480750,24 Mar 2021 09:08PM,"SINGAPORE: After more than a year with working from home as the default, employees may face changes yet again as Singapore announced on Wednesday (Mar 24) a shift towards a more “flexible and hybrid” way of working.More employees will be permitted to return to the workplace from Apr 5, with split team arrangements no longer mandatory.There will also be no limit on the proportion of an employee’s working time that can be spent at the workplace.Updated requirements for safe management measures at the workplace were also issued by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM). Here’s what you need to know:1. STAGGERED START TIMES, FLEXIBLE WORK HOURSEmployers must ensure staggered start times to ensure that staff members are spread out and reduce possible congregation of personnel at office entrances or lobbies. This will also reduce congestion of people in public places, including public transport, said MOM.Flexible work hours should also be permitted for employees who may choose to split their working hours between the office and home.These new measures apply to general workplace settings where more employees may return to better support business operations and in-person collaboration. Specific workplaces like construction worksites and shipyards may have to fulfil additional requirements and should refer to sector-specific requirements.2. WORKING FROM HOME STILL ENCOURAGEDAs the risk of COVID-19 transmission still remains, employers must ensure that no more than 75 per cent of employees - up from 50 per cent currently - who are able to work from home are at the workplace at any point in time.Employers are encouraged to support as many employees in working from home as possible as this will help to limit the number of people exposed at the workplace at any point in time, and reduce crowding in common areas.Companies should also continue to conduct virtual meetings as far as possible, added MOM.3. MAINTAIN “WORK-LIFE HARMONY”The MOM advisory said work from home measures should enable employees to “maintain work-life harmony” while continuing to meet business needs.According to the Tripartite Advisory on mental well-being at workplaces, employers can support employees by appointing “mental wellness champions” to raise awareness on mental health. They can do so through talks on stress management, emotional regulation and relaxation techniques.Employers can also provide access to counselling services such as through Employee Assistance Programmes. These services allow employees to speak to a professional about their work and non-work related challenges.4. SPECIAL ATTENTION FOR VULNERABLE EMPLOYEESCompanies are urged to pay special attention to vulnerable employees, such as those aged 60 and above, and patients who are immunocompromised or have concurrent medical conditions.Employers are encouraged to take appropriate measures to reduce their exposure to infection risk, such as enabling these employees to work-from-home or allow them to commute at off-peak timings. These individuals may also be temporarily redeployed to another role within the company.5. UP TO 50 PEOPLE AT WORK EVENTSWork-related events must adhere to a 50-person limit to minimise the risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection, with a minimum of 1m safe distancing maintained between all individual attendees.Meals should also not be the main feature of the event and employers should avoid hosting events over mealtimes as far as possible.MOM said food or drinks should only be served if “incidental” to the workplace event - for example, if the meeting extends across lunchtime. The food must also be served individually with the participants seated while consuming and the time that these people are unmasked while eating should be minimised.6. SOCIAL GATHERINGS REMAIN LIMITED TO 8While up to 50 people are allowed at work-related events, that farewell lunch still counts as a “social and recreational gathering” , which means an eight-person party is the limit, as per prevailing guidelines. This goes for things like team bonding activities as well, within or outside the workplace. Gatherings involving more than a single group of eight people are not allowed, said MOM.7. EMPLOYERS TO ENSURE SUFFICIENT FACE MASKS, DISINFECTANTSNeed to change your face mask at work? Your employer must ensure it has enough masks for all employees. This includes any need to replace masks more frequently due to workplace conditions such as in humid environments or call centres where the nature of work may necessitate frequent mask changing.“Where possible, employers should consider improving the working environment for employees to enable them to sustain wearing the masks,” said MOM.Employers must also provide cleaning agents such as liquid soap and toilet paper, as well as disinfecting agents like hand sanitisers, sprays, paper towels or wipes.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

134,'A lot easier to overdose ... and die': Experts send warning after first seizure of fentanyl in Singapore,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/fentanyl-singapore-cnb-overdose-die-drug-addiction-14471884,24 Mar 2021 06:30AM,"SINGAPORE: A drug 50 times more potent than heroin that has caused hundreds of thousands of deaths in North America has reached Singapore's shores for the first time.The Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) announced on Mar 6 that it had seized 200 vials of fentanyl after anomalies were detected in a parcel from Vietnam that was declared as medicine.Immigration and Checkpoints Authority officers had uncovered the vials containing a total of about 20mg of fentanyl, a Class A controlled drug in Singapore.The intended recipient of the parcel, a 30-year-old female Singapore permanent resident, was arrested with two Singaporean men, aged 62 and 65, for suspected drug-related offences.In response to queries from CNA, a CNB spokesperson confirmed that this was the ""first detection of the importation of fentanyl into Singapore"".The National Addictions Management Service, at the Institute of Mental Health, said it has seen one case of fentanyl addiction in Singapore a few years ago, although nationwide data is not available.Farther from home, fentanyl and its derivatives have caused more than 130,000 overdose deaths in the United States and Canada in the past five years, Reuters reported in May last year, citing government agencies.Opioids like fentanyl, heroin, codeine and morphine can be deadly when abused, as their sedative effects might cause a person to stop breathing. Fentanyl can be 50 times more potent than heroin and 100 times more potent than morphine, doctors told CNA.""The abuse of fentanyl results in similar effects to other opioids, such as nausea, drowsiness and respiratory depression,"" the CNB spokesperson said.""Due to its potency, fentanyl abuse brings with it a heightened risk of death as a result of overdosing.""This is compounded by the involvement of organised crime groups in mispresenting fentanyl as other illicit opioids or adulterating fentanyl with other illicit opioids such as heroin, and trafficking the substance to unsuspecting users.""According to CNB statistics, 68.25kg of heroin was seized in Singapore last year, making it the most common drug seized by weight, after methamphetamine (44.87kg) and cannabis (43.12kg).FENTANYL AS AN ADULTERANTDr Munidasa Winslow, senior consultant psychiatrist at Promises Healthcare, said drug dealers sometimes cut heroin with fentanyl to add potency.Like all opioids, fentanyl is addictive as it gives a ""euphoric rush"", he said, although he warned that it is ""a lot easier to overdose and have respiratory depression and die"".Dr Gomathinayagam Kandasami, senior consultant at the National Addictions Management Service, said fentanyl abusers commonly inject the drug, but in the process can frequently overdose and die due to its high potency.""High incidents of reported deaths related to fentanyl abuse in the US have been linked to illegally made fentanyl which can be adulterated with other illegal drugs,"" he said.THE SPREAD OF ILLEGAL FENTANTYLWhile there have been no reports of widespread abuse of fentanyl in the region, Reuters reported that Myanmar had seized a huge haul of liquid fentanyl last May.This was the first time the drug had been found in Asia's Golden Triangle drug-producing region, the report stated.With the fentanyl seized in Singapore arriving from Vietnam, CNB was asked about the flow of illicit drugs from the region.""The worrying regional drug situation, coupled with Singapore’s close geographical proximity to increased trafficking activities in the region, has adverse downstream implications for our local drug situation,"" the spokesperson stated.""CNB will continue to partner our foreign law enforcement counterparts to conduct joint operations targeted at drug trafficking and manufacturing activities overseas, and work closely with the other Home Team departments on border control measures to detect and prevent the flow of drugs into Singapore.""MEDICAL USESNevertheless, Dr Winslow highlighted that fentanyl has medical uses, noting that it could be used by pain specialists as patches for breakthrough chronic pain.Dr Ong Say Yang, pain service lead at Alexandra Hospital, said doctors may add opioids to existing painkillers for severe pain that is ""difficult to control"", like cancer pain.While morphine is more commonly used to treat severe pain, Dr Ong said fentanyl, in the form of a slow-releasing skin patch, can be prescribed if the patient's pain does not respond well to more commonly used opioids.""Fentanyl can also be given in an injectable form by trained medical professionals for pain relief and sedation during procedures such as colonoscopy, or together with other sedatives to induce general anaesthesia for surgery,"" he said.POTENTIAL ABUSEIn 2018, Australian news channel 60 Minutes published a segment on the dangers of fentanyl in the country, highlighting that addicts looking for their fix simply had to get a prescription for fentanyl patches from their general practitioner.In Singapore, Dr Winslow said pain specialists here ""are pretty aware (about fentanyl) and keep a tight reign on the prescribing patterns, with supervision"".The Pain Association of Singapore had in 2013 published guidelines on how to prescribe opioids, including monitoring patients regularly through urine and blood tests to ensure they are taking the right doses.Doctors should also look out for tell-tale signs of addiction, including the forging of prescriptions and requests for higher dosages.Dr Ong said patients are carefully assessed on suitability before being started on opioids, and are given follow-up appointments at shorter intervals so that smaller quantities of opioids can be prescribed each time.""We look out for signs that could suggest drug misuse, such as obtaining addictive medication from multiple healthcare providers or frequently asking for early refills of such medication, and refer such patients to our colleagues in addiction medicine for further management,"" he said.The doctors said that fentanyl addiction is treated same way as any other substance use disorder.""The person with fentanyl addiction would need to go through an inpatient detox programme to give up their dependence on the drug, followed by either community or residential-based long-term rehabilitation interventions to stay clean,"" Dr Kandasami said.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

135,Man admits trespassing into NUS hall to steal student's sex toy after following her on Instagram,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-admits-trespassing-nus-hall-steal-woman-student-sex-toy-14471988,23 Mar 2021 06:11PM,"SINGAPORE: About a year after graduating from university, a man trespassed into a residence hall and stole a vibrator belonging to a woman he was following on Instagram.Chua Chang Rong, 27, pleaded guilty on Tuesday (Mar 23) to three charges of theft, criminal trespass and sending insulting communication intending to cause alarm. A fourth charge of criminal trespass will be considered in sentencing.The court heard that Chua committed the offences in 2019, about a year after he graduated from the National University of Singapore (NUS).He came to know of the victim, a 22-year-old student at the university, through Instagram during his time at the school. He found her attractive and began following her public Instagram account, according to court documents. He also found out through her profile that she lived in a residence hall.The woman, whose identity is protected by gag order, did not know Chua.TAILGATED STUDENT TO GET INDuring the time of the incident, Chua was working as a product specialist.He knew from the woman's posts on Instagram that she was travelling overseas in early January 2019, and decided to look for her room in the university hall.He entered the hall by tailgating a student. Based on his previous experience at the university, he knew that most students did not lock their room doors and often left their names on their doors.He looked around the hostel and found the victim's room with her name on the door. He entered the room, which was unlocked, and looked through her personal belongings, including her lingerie.When he found a S$40 vibrator in a drawer, he felt sexually aroused and took it with him, the court documents said.When the woman returned from her travels, she was unable to find her vibrator but assumed that she had misplaced it. On Jul 18, 2019, Chua decided to return the sex toy. After watching the victim's Instagram story that showed she was at work, he entered the hall again by closely following behind another student.When he got to the victim's room, he rummaged through her belongings again and saw two new sex toys in a box. He fiddled around with them and took a photo of the items, and returned the first vibrator he had stolen.He also took a photo of the victim's resume that he found, before leaving.HE DECIDED TO CONTACT HERA few days later on Jul 22, 2019, Chua felt sexually aroused while thinking about how he had entered the victim's room and looked through her belongings, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Li Yihong.He decided to message the victim and found her on Telegram by searching for her Instagram handle.He did not reveal his phone number and messaged her under the username ""Bobby"" in a secret chat.He told her that he had returned her sex toy as he ""wanted to surprise"" her, and said he noticed that she had bought new sex toys.The woman replied to ask who he was, but he did not reveal his identity. Instead, he sent her messages asking her if she wanted to be friends with benefits ""since I already know your dirty little secret"".He offered to be available whenever she wanted to be ""satisfied"" and said they could ""get to know each other real well"".The victim did not reply these messages and was alarmed and very scared, as Chua had suggested that he had entered her room without her knowledge, court documents said.When she got to her room later that night, she found her missing sex toy and informed NUS campus security, who reviewed closed-circuit television footage and spotted a man entering her room.The victim later lodged a police report and he was identified by the police.The prosecutor, Ms Li, asked for at least four weeks' jail. She objected to the defence's request to call for a report assessing Chua's suitability for a mandatory treatment order.PROSECUTION OBJECTS TO MTO SUITABILITY REPORTShe said the current Institute of Mental Health (IMH) report did not support the defence's private psychiatrist's diagnosis of a fetishistic disorder.IMH had diagnosed Chua with an adjustment disorder with depressed mood and high sexual drive, along with possible paraphilia. However, this would not deprive him of his impulse control, said Ms Li.Lawyer Raphael Louis said his client was ""very ashamed of what he did"" and has gone for counselling to address his issues. He is now on medication and has written a letter of apology to the victim.The judge called for a report to assess if Chua is suitable for a mandatory treatment order, highlighting that issues on his cognitive control and ability to control his actions must be addressed.Chua will return to court in May for sentencing.For criminal trespass, he could be jailed up to three months, fined up to S$1,500, or both. For using insulting words intending to cause alarm, he could be jailed for up to six months, fined up to S$5,000, or both.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

137,"Man jailed for assaulting mother's private parts, new details of 'abhorrent' abuse emerge",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jailed-assaulting-mother-private-part-padlock-new-details-14469834,23 Mar 2021 12:06PM,"SINGAPORE: A 30-year-old man who physically abused his mother over several years, hitting her private parts with a metal padlock and starving her when he was stressed with his master's degree studies, was sentenced to 56 weeks' jail on Tuesday (Mar 23).The prosecutor on Tuesday told the court new details of Andy Koh Ju Hua's abuse, surfaced from new reports. In one incident, after punching his 68-year-old mother's face, Koh demanded that she stand by the sink holding an ice pack to her face from 6.30pm to 6.30am.He kept watch over her from his room, threatening to hit her if she lowered her hands. He also hit her on the head once with a remote control, leaving a scar.Over the years, Koh also took steps to evade detection - not allowing his mother to answer the door or be seen by neighbours, and mandating that she hide at a staircase or retreat if neighbours came around. He dictated that she wear only old, torn clothes so it would be difficult for her to escape and seek help.Koh's mother said she believed that her son targeted her private region as injuries in that area could be concealed, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Magdalene Huang.Ms Huang shared those details as her basis for seeking 50 weeks' jail, an increase from the original sentence sought of 30 weeks' jail.In response, Koh asked if he could be given the 30 weeks' jail instead, as he had ""plans to continue school and complete my candidature"". He added that he was half a year away from completing his master's degree.The National University of Singapore (NUS) previously said that Koh was no longer with the university. He went on leave of absence in August 2019 and did not return to his studies after the leave expired. As a result, his master's candidature was terminated in January, said NUS.I HOPE TO BE REUNITED WITH MY MOTHER: KOHKoh, who is in remand, on Tuesday said he is undergoing psychological treatment and wishes to be reunited with his mother in future.""Regarding all the silly things I did to her - I plead guilty. I also don't understand why I did all those silly things to her. I need to undergo psychotic treatment,"" said Koh from remand.""The IMH doctor has given me anti-psychotic drugs so I need to cure myself. After curing myself I hope to be reunited with my mother. I want to live happily with her and I want to take care of her in the remaining days.""Koh had pleaded guilty last week to four counts of voluntarily causing hurt, one of which is under the newly enhanced provisions for victims in close relationships with the accused.District Judge Kessler Soh explained that a mandatory treatment order was not an available sentencing option for one of Koh's charges, as such orders are generally suitable only for offences that carry a punishment not exceeding three years.He agreed with the prosecutor that a substantial jail term was called for, in view of the aggravating factors of the case.The total term must reflect the extent of pain, suffering and harm that Koh caused his mother, said Judge Soh.He also took into account the assessment of a psychiatrist at the Institute of Mental Health that Koh's offences were likely to have been substantially influenced by psychotic symptoms at the time of the offences.""This is a case that has caused much public disquiet,"" said the judge.""We cannot understand how (Koh) could bring himself to attack his own mother in such a cruel manner.""He added that the way Koh attacked his mother was ""abhorrent"" and that he had to be punished in accordance with the law. He also stressed that it was necessary for Koh to receive treatment to minimise the risk of reoffending after his release.He said a community court conference with a court counsellor would be convened after the hearing to consider what measures might be taken to protect the victim, as well as what treatment Koh might receive to minimise his risk of offending.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

138,Commentary: Thousands of emails in your inbox? You may be a digital hoarder,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/email-file-storage-delete-hoarding-productivity-work-tips-inbox-14445314,22 Mar 2021 06:01AM,"Research has begun to recognise that hoarding can be a problem in the digital world, says a psychology professor.NEWCASTLE, England: How many emails are in your inbox? If the answer is thousands, or if you often struggle to find a file on your computer among its cluttered hard drive, then you might be classed as a digital hoarder.In the physical world, hoarding disorder has been recognised as a distinct psychiatric condition among people who accumulate excessive amounts of objects to the point that it prevents them living a normal life.Now, research has begun to recognise that hoarding can be a problem in the digital world, too.A case study published in the British Medical Journal in 2015 described a 47-year-old man who, as well as hoarding physical objects, took around 1,000 digital photographs every day. He would then spend many hours editing, categorising and copying the pictures onto various external hard drives.He was autistic, and may have been a collector rather than a hoarder – but his digital OCD tendencies caused him much distress and anxiety.The authors of this research paper defined digital hoarding as “the accumulation of digital files to the point of loss of perspective which eventually results in stress and disorganisation”.By surveying hundreds of people, my colleagues and I found that digital hoarding is common in the workplace.In a follow-up study, in which we interviewed employees in two large organisations who exhibited lots of digital hoarding behaviours, we identified four types of digital hoarder.“Collectors” are organised, systematic and in control of their data. “Accidental hoarders” are disorganised, don’t know what they have, and don’t have control over it.The “hoarder by instruction” keeps data on behalf of their company (even when they could delete much of it). Finally, “anxious hoarders” have strong emotional ties to their data – and are worried about deleting it.COSTS OF DIGITAL HOARDING ON WORKING LIFEAlthough digital hoarding doesn’t interfere with personal living space, it can clearly have a negative impact upon daily life. Research also suggests digital hoarding poses a serious problem to businesses and other organisations, and even has a negative impact on the environment.To assess the extent of digital hoarding, we initially surveyed more than 400 people, many of whom admitted to hoarding behaviour. Some people reported that they kept many thousands of emails in inboxes and archived folders and never deleted their messages.This was especially true of work emails, which were seen as potentially useful as evidence of work undertaken, a reminder of outstanding tasks, or were simply kept “just in case”.Interestingly, when asked to consider the potentially damaging consequences of not deleting digital information – such as the cybersecurity threat to confidential business information – people were clearly aware of the risks. Yet the respondents still showed a great reluctance to hit the delete button.At first glance, digital hoarding may not appear much of a problem – especially if digital hoarders work for large organisations. Storage is cheap and effectively limitless thanks to internet “cloud” storage systems.But digital hoarding may still lead to negative consequences.First, storing thousands of files or emails is inefficient. Wasting large amounts of time looking for the right file can reduce productivity.Second, the more data is kept, the greater the risk that a cyberattack could lead to the loss or theft of information covered by data protection legislation. In the EU, new GDPR rules mean companies that lose customer data to hacking could be hit with hefty fines.The final consequence of digital hoarding – in the home or at work – is an environmental one. Hoarded data has to be stored somewhere. The reluctance to have a digital clear-out can contribute to the development of increasingly large servers that use considerable amounts of energy to cool and maintain them.TACKLING DIGITAL HOARDINGResearch has shown that physical hoarders can develop strategies to reduce their accumulation behaviours.While people can be helped to stop accumulating, they are more resistant when it comes to actually getting rid of their cherished possessions – perhaps because they “anthropomorphise” them, treating inanimate objects as if they had thoughts and feelings.We don’t yet know enough about digital hoarding to see whether similar difficulties apply, or whether existing coping strategies will work in the digital world, too.But we have found that asking people how many files they think they have often surprises and alarms them, forcing them to reflect on their digital accumulation and storing behaviours.As hoarding is often associated with anxiety and insecurity, addressing the source of these negative emotions may alleviate hoarding behaviours.Workplaces can do more here, by reducing non-essential email traffic, making it very clear what information should be retained or discarded, and by delivering training on workplace data responsibilities.In doing so, companies can reduce the anxiety and insecurity related to getting rid of obsolete or unnecessary information, helping workers to avoid the compulsion to obsessively save and store the bulk of their digital data.Nick Neave is Associate Professor in Psychology at Northumbria University.

139,Commentary: Teachers have 12 weeks of holiday each year – fact or myth?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/teachers-what-do-they-do-school-holidays-leave-annual-pay-14436064,21 Mar 2021 06:02AM,"With packed semester schedules, school holidays are the only real time teachers get to step back to prepare for the next term, undergo training and focus on co-curricular activities, says Jason Tan.SINGAPORE: The March holidays have just concluded.As an educator, one thing I do hear during the school holidays is this: “Teachers are so fortunate. They get 12 weeks off work each year. What a great deal!”This all-too-common perception of teachers has persisted in the face of mounting evidence to the contrary.On the face of it, it is all too easy to believe teachers enjoy among the most generous paid leave schemes. After all, since students are off from school during the holiday periods, teachers are getting a break, right?Not entirely.PROTECTED DOWNTIME AND FLEXIBILITYIn practice, teachers may be called upon for duty at any time during the school holidays. In fact, concerns that teachers are not getting enough of a break even during such periods were raised in Parliament in August 2016.The Ministry of Education’s reply referred to guidelines that include the idea of protected holiday time to help teachers manage workloads and enjoy sufficient rest and bond with their families. This time comprises at least two days in March, two weeks in June, two days in September and three weeks during the year-end break.At the same time, the Ministry allows individual schools flexibility with teacher deployment during school holidays in order to meet their specific needs.For instance, it is common practice for schools to conduct remedial or enrichment classes for specific groups of students. In some schools, teachers may offer small group remediation for students in order to address learning gaps identified during lessons and tests.CHALLENGING DEMANDS SINCE PANDEMIC HITTeachers have experienced more challenging demands since the coronavirus hit our shores. During the mid-year school break in May 2020, then Education Minister Ong Ye Kung announced that schools would be inviting students in the graduating cohorts to return for coaching and consultations with their teachers.Ong mentioned that this support was customary for graduating students during the mid-year break, but had taken on added urgency because of the anxiety brought about by school closures earlier in the year.Furthermore, some students taking subjects with coursework or practical components – in the sciences, design and technology, and food and consumer education for example - needed to use school facilities and equipment in order to make up for lost time.HIGH TEMPO OF CO-CURRICULAR ACTIVITIESBesides academic lessons, some teachers are busy during school holiday periods with co-curricular activities. Some activities like camps or leadership courses are less easily conducted during term time when there is a high tempo of teaching and formal curriculum.Holiday periods in fact provide students preparing for competitions a chance to step up training under the guidance of teachers and external coaches. For instance, the resumption of the National School Games this year after a brief hiatus in 2020 meant that sports teams can make use of the March or June breaks for more intensive training.Pre-coronavirus, school holidays were also a prime time for schools to organise overseas learning experiences.These trips, which centred around such matters as cultural exchanges, adventure learning or service learning, provided students a chance to develop key Character and Citizenship Education skills and competencies such as leadership. Quite naturally, some teachers would find their school breaks occupied with these trips.PREPARING FOR THE NEXT TERM, TACKLING NEW CHALLENGESAnother form of work that occupies some teachers during school breaks is lesson preparation.Amid a dynamic environment in which schools continue to introduce a variety of teaching methodologies such as differentiated instruction, many teachers need that brief let-up from the relentless press of the school day.The school holidays are an invaluable time to step back to refresh their lesson plans and teaching techniques to better meet their students’ diverse learning needs.In addition to all of the points that have already been mentioned, school breaks are sometimes used for teacher professional development activities.For instance, schools may organise whole-school strategic planning meetings in order to chart key directions for the future. Teachers may also meet colleagues teaching the same cohort or the same subject.There, they discuss topics and fresh challenges facing teachers, in a bid to figure out how to deal with changing social mores and challenges wrought by an increasingly digital, fast paced world -  including cyberbullying, mental health or efforts to foster a student peer support culture.12 WEEKS OF HOLIDAYS – IT’S JUST A MYTHIt should be clear by now that the myth of teachers enjoying the luxury of 12 weeks of paid holidays is nothing more than fiction.The reality of teachers’ lives is that attending to their students’ developmental needs, whether academic or non-academic, often takes precedence for at least part of the school holiday periods over spending time on their families or leisure activities.Their own professional development needs are also often addressed during school breaks, on top of the workshops or meetings that they normally attend during term time.You might ask, why the Ministry of Education cannot mandate that school holidays be left completely free of school activities in order for both teachers and students to enjoy more restful breaks.The fact appears to be that the 40 weeks of school within each calendar year are insufficient for schools to fully carry out the myriad of tasks and programmes with which they have been entrusted. We see this for instance in the case of overseas learning experiences, preparation for inter-school competitions and extra academic lessons.The Ministry has to maintain a balance between maximising rest time for teachers and students during school holidays and addressing the learning and developmental needs of both. School leaders have an important responsibility too in terms of ensuring that their teachers have sufficient downtime during school holidays in order to recharge themselves for the challenges of the next school term.It is also important to remember that in lieu of annual holiday leave, school teachers are eligible for full-pay leave for up to 10 working days in a calendar year to attend to urgent private affairs such as marriage, the selection of an HDB flat or serious illness of family members, or up to 12 days if examination leave is included.Thus, for most teachers the school holidays represent the only opportunity for a brief respite from the frenetic pace of school life.Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:Jason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

142,"Man gets jail, caning for raping 13-year-old girl at a park in 'harrowing two-hour ordeal'",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jail-caning-rape-13-year-old-kallang-riverside-park-14444318,19 Mar 2021 01:59PM,"SINGAPORE: After talking to a teenage girl about his relationship problems at a park, a 35-year-old man sat on top of her, forced vodka down her throat and raped her over two hours.The 13-year-old girl cried for help and was in great pain, eventually managing to crawl near a toilet where she sent voice messages to her loved ones pleading for help.Muhammad Alif AB Rahim was sentenced on Friday (Mar 19) to 28 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane for what the judge called ""a harrowing two-hour ordeal of rape and repeated sexual assault"".The court heard that the victim knew the man ""peripherally"" through a friend but was not close to him and did not know his name.On the evening of Oct 24, 2017, the victim went to deliver items to a friend and went to Kallang Riverside Park to get some air. She ran into Alif, who suggested that they buy drinks and go to the park to chat.Trusting him, the victim followed Alif to a provision shop where he bought a bottle of cola and plastic cups.They sat at the end of the jetty in the park in front of the river between 9pm and 11pm, and Alif removed a bottle of vodka from his bag, asking the victim if she wanted some.As she declined, he poured cola for her and a mixture of vodka and cola for himself. They drank from their cups as Alif talked about his relationship problems with his girlfriend.Suddenly, Alif leaned forward and kissed the victim, shocking her. When she moved away and tried to use her phone, he snatched it away from her before sitting on top of her and molesting her.When the victim cried and shouted, Alif put the bottle of vodka to her mouth, pressed her cheeks to force it open and poured the alcohol in.FORCED ALCOHOL DOWN HER MOUTHThe girl could not close her mouth and tried to spit the liquid out but was forced to swallow it, with some vodka sloshing onto her face and stinging her eyes.Alif began sexually assaulting the girl, pushing her against a fence when she tried to run. After slapping the girl when she resisted, Alif raped and sodomised the girl.He then forced her to perform oral sex on him, and she felt like vomiting from the assault. Throughout the assault, the girl struggled and cried but no one heard her as they were in a secluded area of the park.After telling the victim not to inform anyone about what happened, Alif left the area. The girl cried and tried to wipe herself down and stand up, but was too dizzy and in pain to do so.GIRL CRAWLED AWAY, CALLED FOR HELPEventually, she managed to crawl from the jetty to a grass patch near the toilet, where she sent audio clips to her aunt, friend and other relatives.Audio clips of the girl sobbing and pleading were played in court. She told her loved ones that she had been raped but could not explain herself clearly and did not know where she was.She hoped a passer-by would rescue her, but Alif returned on a bicycle and threatened her, warning her not to tell anyone before leaving again.The girl was finally found by her friends lying on top of a drain and she had difficulty walking. Alif's girlfriend found out that the victim had pinpointed Alif as the rapist, and she asked Alif about this, but he denied seeing the victim.He changed his clothes and went to the park where the victim was with her friends and family. He denied raping her, and said he would run away if the police came as he had other pending cases.He threatened the victim's 54-year-old grandmother and said that if anything happened to him, he would find the victim's family and ""harm you"". When police officers approached, he fled the scene.The police went to Alif's girlfriend's home to search for him, but he locked himself inside her bedroom. When the officers broke in, they found him hiding in a wooden cupboard.After his arrest, Alif misled the police by claiming he was wearing different clothes, so that they would be unable to conduct closed-circuit television footage screenings and forensic testing of his clothes.He spun a story that he was looking for his girlfriend at the park and had never met the victim that night. A year later, he changed his story to say the victim had come onto him and requested sex.The victim was taken to a hospital with lacerations on her elbow, abrasions on her knee and tears in her hymen.She was assessed to have clear symptoms of trauma and had to be treated two to three times a month. Her trauma was triggered whenever she saw other men, and she has flashbacks when she watches movies with rape scenes. She said she did not want to see Alif in court as it would hurt her too much, but she had to relive the incident when preparing for the trial that Alif originally intended to have.PREVIOUS CONVICTIONSA February 2019 report stated that she still woke up crying from nightmares of Alif and was afraid of going out alone and seeing male strangers. She had to receive counselling to overcome this fear and is reminded of the incident whenever she sees television scenes of drunken men trying to go on top of girls.Alif was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and found to have no mental illness at the time of the offences. His intelligence is in the borderline range, but he does not suffer from an intellectual disability as he has good adaptive functioning.Alif pleaded guilty to one count of raping a minor and two counts of sexual assault by penetration of a minor. Another seven charges were considered in sentencing.Deputy Public Prosecutor Gregory Gan called for at least 28 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane, saying that Alif ""callously robbed the victim of her virginity, inflicting grave suffering and distress on her"".""The audio clips as she cried to the various maternal figures in her life make absolutely clear the heart-wrenching trauma she was undergoing as she struggled to make sense of the senseless violence that had just been inflicted upon her,"" he said, adding that Alif's cruel actions have haunted her since.Alif has multiple previous convictions starting from 2001, including cheating, robbery and sexual assault. His most recent conviction in 2014 involved snatch theft and sexual assault by penetration. He was given 42 months' jail and three strokes of the cane, but he was not deterred, said Mr Gan.HE HAS LOW IQ: DEFENCEDefence lawyer Gloria James-Civetta said she cannot run away from the fact that the offences committed were violent crimes against a young victim, but urged the court to consider 20 years' jail and 24 strokes of the cane.She said her client has a low IQ and was previously diagnosed with anti-social personality disorder. He had difficulty with complex social situations and making appropriate choices, she said.""Another factor to consider is - he has been assaulted twice in prison while being remanded and since then he is put in isolation,"" she said.In reply, Mr Gan said Alif has no mental illness and knew it was wrong to sexually assault an underage girl. His borderline intelligence did not stop him from committing offences that required guile, such as his previous cheating offences, and he was cunning enough to mislead investigators, he said.On the assault in remand, Mr Gan said Alif was assaulted by two men in 2017, but emphasised that while the victim's grandmother had written to one of the men, she never told him or anyone to assault Alif.""So neither the victim nor her grandmother had anything to do with the assault,"" said Mr Gan, adding that the latest assault on Alif in 2020 was after the two men were no longer there and the assault is ""not connected to the present case"".Justice See Kee Oon said Alif had ""no discernible indication of remorse all along"" but gave him some credit for his plea of guilt, even though he noted that Alif was not cooperative in investigations and tried to frustrate them.While Alif has a low IQ, he had good adaptive functioning and was able to remain in the school system until he left and gained employment and started a family, said Justice See.For aggravated rape, the man could have been jailed for between eight and 20 years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane. The maximum penalties for aggravated sexual assault by penetration are the same.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['court', 'crime', 'rape']",Singapore
143,Man admits posing as agent for 'sugar daddies' to lure 11 women into sex acts,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/sugar-daddies-babes-sex-blackmail-de-beers-wong-14436704,18 Mar 2021 04:37PM,"SINGAPORE: Over 10 months, a man who could not afford paid sex posed as an agent for wealthy ""sugar daddies"" and tricked 11 women into sex acts with him on the premise of ""testing"" them out for clients.De Beers Wong Tian Jun, 39, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Mar 18) to 10 charges including cheating, criminal intimidation and possession of obscene photos for circulation. Another 26 charges will be considered in sentencing.The court heard that Wong wanted to have paid sex in 2015 but could not afford the prices he saw listed in online advertisements. He devised a scheme to advertise for ""sugar babes"", or paid escorts who provided sexual services to ""sugar daddies"" in exchange for money.In the ad, Wong lied that he was a freelance agent who connected such escorts to his well-to-do clients and sought people who were ""serious about earning good money"".Between April 2015 and January 2016, at least 11 women aged between 18 and 24 responded to Wong's advertisement on Locanto. Wong said he had clients who would pay them S$8,000 to S$20,000 per month, but said they had to first send their nude photos to Wong or engage in sexual acts with him.He claimed this was necessary for the women to be ""evaluated"" by his clients to assess if they were suitable for a ""sugar daddy"" arrangement.In truth, he had no such clients and had lied so that he could have sex with women without needing to pay them. After obtaining nude photos of the women or filming his sex acts with them, Wong would threaten them with dissemination if they did not engage in sexual activity with him again.All the women suffered mental anguish after their encounters with Wong, with some having recurring nightmares and others experiencing fear, anxiety and paranoia that he would leak their intimate pictures or videos.ONE VICTIM PLAGUED BY ANXIETY ATTACKS AFTER ENCOUNTEROne victim was 24 when she came across Wong's advertisement in October 2015. He lied to her that she could earn S$10,000 to S$20,000 per month from his ""sugar daddy"" clients, and asked for nude photos of herself.The woman was reluctant, but Wong convinced her into doing so by saying that ""all my girls take skimpy pics so you will be on a losing end"".After viewing the photos, Wong said before introducing the woman to any clients, he needed to meet her for a photoshoot and to engage in sexual activity so he could rate her performance for his clients.He claimed that ""sugar babes"" who did not engage in sexual activity with him would have to settle for lower-paying clients. The woman was again reluctant, but Wong coaxed her by saying he had a client who was keen to meet her when he arrived in Singapore and had last paid a ""sugar babe"" S$16,000.The woman met Wong at a hotel where he took topless photos of her. When she wanted to leave, Wong convinced her into having unprotected sex, again lying about having to ""test"" her.He did not introduce the woman to any clients after that, and she experienced anxiety attacks in the following days. She would be triggered by memories of the encounter with Wong and start crying, experiencing symptoms such as shortness of breath, headaches, nausea and giddiness.She also began having sleeping problems and nightmares and avoided going to the area where the hotel was situated. She was later diagnosed with adjustment disorder with anxiety.However, Wong continued contacting her in a bid to meet her again. When she did not respond within 12 hours, he told her he would introduce another ""sugar babe"" to his purported client instead.He also forwarded screenshots of what he claimed to be conversations with his clients, and said he was unable to answer their questions about her performance.When the woman asked Wong to delete nude photos of her in October 2015, he lied that he had done so. She continued begging him to delete the photos until January 2016, when Wong told her he had retrieved backups of her nude photos and would delete them only if she agreed to provide him with sexual services.When the woman told Wong that she was doing him a favour by not going to the police, he replied: ""Now I have to pass your photos to my friends in case anything happen(s) to me they will use the photos as they wish.""The woman felt afraid and lodged a police report against him a few days later.The prosecution called for at least 30 months' jail for Wong's ""sustained and egregious offending against multiple victims"" over 10 months, highlighting the premeditation and planning involved in his ""systematic approach"".He made up conversations with his ""clients"" and manipulated the victims, devising excuses to justify soliciting sex from them and causing mental harm to them.The defence said Wong had been diagnosed with adjustment disorder that affected his capability to make decisions, and that he is remorseful and has stayed clear of trouble.He still has anxiety due to the proceedings, with investigations starting six years ago and weighing ""heavily on his mind"", said the lawyer. He suffered ill health and had a stroke earlier this year.He will return to court for sentencing next month.This is the lowest overall number of total daily cases reported in Singapore since Jun 9 when four infections were identified.SINGAPORE: Singapore will reduce entry approvals for travellers from Indonesia who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents with immediate effect, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Jul 10).SINGAPORE: Like many newlyweds, Elizabeth hopes to have a home of her own, where she can start a family with her husband.

144,Man on trial for raping social escort after posing as police officer,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/rape-social-escort-hotel-man-pose-police-officer-14419578,16 Mar 2021 03:32PM,"SINGAPORE: After arranging to meet a social escort in a hotel room for a fee, a man allegedly impersonated a police officer and raped the woman after brandishing a knife.Ng Yi Yao, 32, went on trial on Tuesday (Mar 16) for two counts of aggravated rape and two counts of aggravated sexual assault by penetration. He faces a fifth charge of impersonating a police officer, which he intends to plead guilty to.The court heard that Ng had hired the services of a 25-year-old woman, whose identity is protected by gag order. She worked as a part-time social escort in February 2019 and provided sexual services to clients while holding a separate full-time job and studying for a degree.Her agent, a person she knew as ""Kelvin"" and whom she had never met, arranged appointments with clients for her.On Feb 21, 2019, Kelvin told the woman that he had a job for her at Harbour Ville Hotel at 8.15pm that night and asked her to check in to the room. He said the client would pay her S$450, adding that she might have a second client at 9pm that night, said the prosecution.The woman went to the hotel and booked a room for two hours at about 8pm that night, paying S$40 for the accommodation. She waited in the room and Ng appeared, identifying himself as Ivan.According to the prosecution's case, Ng showered and came out of the toilet naked. However, when the woman asked him for payment, he put his clothes back on and identified himself as a police officer, flashing what the woman thought was a flip-card holder at her.He asked her for her phone and NRIC, and the woman complied as she was afraid, said prosecutors.Ng purportedly began an audio recording and told the woman there was a police operation. When the woman told him she had another client that night, Ng used her phone to tell Kelvin that she was not feeling well and to cancel the subsequent job. He did not answer subsequent calls from Kelvin.Ng called the receptionist for a change of rooms, and continued to pretend to be a police officer, said the prosecutors. He allegedly made remarks that the woman understood to mean that she had to perform sex acts on him to leave freely.She rejected him and asked for his police ID as she suspected that Ng was not who he said he was, but he refused to show it to her.At about 10pm, the woman sent a message to her friend: ""Bro I can't make it tonight have smth on."" This was a signal that something was amiss, and that she was in trouble.Ng allegedly changed his tone after refusing to show his police ID to the woman, and told her to switch off the room lights or he would hurt her. The woman saw him holding a red Swiss Army knife and switched off the lights, before complying with his request to remove her clothes.THE ALLEGED RAPEAccording to the prosecution's case, Ng raped the victim after this. She complied as she was afraid of the knife she had seen. She was also forced to perform sex acts on Ng, and did not consent to any of the acts throughout, the prosecution said.After the alleged sexual assault, Ng admitted that he was not a police officer, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Mohamed Faizal, Selene Yap and Tessa Tan.He proposed moving in to stay with her, but the woman tried to end the conversation by saying she needed to return home for assignments. After Ng got her phone number and took photos of the woman's NRIC, he paid S$20 for the room and gave the woman another S$40.He insisted on taking a cab home with her, said the prosecutors. After paying the taxi driver, he walked the woman to her flat and kissed her outside.Immediately after entering her home past midnight, the woman called her friend and told him she was raped. Her friend went over quickly and the woman called the police.Ng was arrested later that day. The woman's DNA was found on his underwear, and he was assessed at the Institute of Mental Health and found to be fit to plead.A medical report issued in October 2019 found no strong evidence to suggest a diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.The prosecution will lead evidence from 38 witnesses to prove the charges against Ng. The trial opened on Wednesday with the woman testifying in-camera.If convicted of aggravated rape, he could be jailed for between eight and 20 years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane.Editor's note: An earlier version of the story said the accused was a RedMart delivery driver at the time of the alleged offences; RedMart has clarified that he only worked for them five days before the alleged incidents.This is the lowest overall number of total daily cases reported in Singapore since Jun 9 when four infections were identified.SINGAPORE: Singapore will reduce entry approvals for travellers from Indonesia who are not Singapore citizens or permanent residents with immediate effect, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said on Saturday (Jul 10).Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

He starved her and did not allow her to shower or make noise when he was stressed with his studies.In the early years of the abuse, the victim refused to file police reports because she did not want to jeopardise her son's future, and sought refuge intermittently with her nephew and niece.She was hospitalised three times and placed in a safe house but insisted each time on returning to her family, and decided to reveal the offences to the police only in June 2020.In January 2018, Koh used his kneecap to hit his mother's vaginal area, intending to cause hurt. She was found by her niece in an unkept state and complaining of pain in her lower regions. Her niece wanted to call the police, but the victim told her not to do so. When she went to the hospital, she said she had fallen down, in order not to implicate her son.A medical report noted extensive bruising over the victim's abdomen, buttocks, lower limbs and external genitalia. She was started on intravenous antibiotics and discharged later that month.Koh assaulted his mother again in December 2018 by hitting her face with his hands at their family home. He also hit her vaginal area multiple times with a metal padlock, hooking the item around his finger to strike her.His mother did not retaliate and just let him take out his frustrations on her, as he felt angry over certain issues. She was found with swelling on her body and bloodstains on her gown over her vaginal area.MOTHER DID NOT WANT TO IMPLICATE HER SONShe went to the hospital, which alerted the police about the victim being abused, but she told the police that her injuries were the result of a fall she had sustained in the toilet, in order not to implicate her son.A medical report found bruising on her nose, lower lip, jaw, chin and pubic region, with post-menopausal vaginal bleeding.In June last year, Koh called his mother over in their flat before suddenly punching her mouth thrice. She began bleeding and ran out of the house ""out of desperation"".She sought help from her relatives, who described her as sunken, thin, frail and very dirty. Bruises were observed on her face, and her nephew called the police to say his aunt was abused by her son and she was distraught.When she went to the hospital this time, she said her son had punched her face and said she felt pain in her chin and lip.Deputy Public Prosecutor Magdalene Huang said Koh has no previous convictions. She sought at least 30 weeks' jail, saying the victim was not only elderly and vulnerable, but was also Koh's mother.His manner of attacking his mother with the metal padlock ""is especially vicious and cruel"", said Ms Huang.A COMPLETE LACK OF REMORSE: PROSECUTOR""Although the accused has ultimately chosen to plead guilty, he had denied his offences to the police. Throughout investigations, he denied the offences,"" she said. She pointed out that a report by the Institute of Mental Health said he ""displays a complete lack of remorse"". ""The only one mitigating factor is his mental condition as supported by the IMH report,"" said Ms Huang, without identifying what condition this is.Koh, who had no lawyer, sniffled as he asked for a mandatory treatment order (MTO).""I love my mother a lot and I do not know why I committed all those silly things to her. I need to undergo treatment to overcome my psychotic disorder,"" he said.""I hope to undergo treatment and cure myself so that I can live happily ever after with my mother. She is not young anymore and I certainly wish to take care of her in her remaining days.""The prosecution objected to the calling of an MTO report, saying Koh ought to be punished for his egregious offences, but the judge said it is appropriate to at least consider such a report.""It's appropriate for us to at least consider an MTO report before we consider. What is critical is for the offender to receive treatment if it's something that had any causal or contributory link, but we should get a report to ascertain if that's the case,"" said District Judge Kessler Soh.He initially called for a report to assess Koh's suitability for an MTO and adjourned the case to a later date. However, court records later showed the decision to call for an MTO suitability report was retracted, and the case will be heard again on Mar 23 for mitigation and sentencing.In response to CNA queries, NUS said Koh was no longer with the university. He had been on leave of absence since August 2019 and as he did not return to his studies after his leave of absence ended, NUS said it terminated his master's candidature in January this year.

147,Jail for woman who asked maid to punch herself and strike her teeth with meat pounder,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-who-asked-maid-to-punch-herself-mun-sau-yeng-jailed-14418034,16 Mar 2021 11:04AM,"SINGAPORE: A woman who abused her maid over eight months, making her punch herself and use a meat pounder to hit her mouth, was jailed for 15 months on Tuesday (Mar 16).Mun Sau Yeng, 41, was suffering from depression and obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) at the time, the court heard.She pleaded guilty to one charge of voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means to a domestic helper and two charges of voluntarily causing hurt. Another four charges were considered.The victim began working for Mun, a housewife, in April 2018. Mun's lawyer said she was prone to ""excessive cleaning"" and felt the victim could not match her own cleaning standards.About two months into the 25-year-old Indonesian maid's employment, Mun struck her shoulder with the floor nozzle of a vacuum cleaner, and struck her head with her fist weeks later.In November 2018, when the victim ate a can of sardines for lunch as she was hungry, Mun grew angry and punched her several times on both cheeks. She then instructed the maid to punch her own cheeks for about 50 times, because she felt the domestic helper would remember the pain better if she punched herself.Although reluctant, the victim complied, counting until she hit 50. Her cheeks swelled and became bruised, but she was not taken to a doctor.In February 2019, when Mun noticed fingerprints on the kitchen windows, she shouted at the victim: ""I want your teeth drop one.""She refused to accept suggested compensation and insisted that she wanted the victim's teeth to ""drop"". She instructed her to pull down her lower lip and punch her own teeth, and the maid did this until her lips swelled.When Mun saw that the victim's teeth did not drop, she instructed her to take a meat pounder from the kitchen and forced her to use it to strike her own teeth.The victim struck her mouth with the tool 50 times, but her teeth did not drop, although three of her lower teeth grew loose. Seeing that no teeth had dropped, Mun took the meat pounder, pulled down the maid's lower lip and struck it once, chipping off one of her teeth.The abuse continued that month, with Mun punching the victim's mouth about 10 times until her teeth became loose and she began bleeding, over some dust she found in the flat.The victim eventually called the Centre for Domestic Employees to seek help for the physical abuse, and the police were called in.The prosecution asked for at least 15 months' jail, noting that Mun suffered from depression and OCD at the time of the offences but highlighting that the Institute of Mental Health report was ""open-ended"" on any causal link between the disorders and the offences.The defence asked for a year's jail, saying that Mun heard an inner voice telling her to hit the victim, and she was a first-time offender who had pleaded guilty.For voluntarily causing hurt by dangerous means, Mun could have been jailed for up to seven years and fined. She cannot be caned as she is a woman. As the victim was a domestic helper, she could have received up to one-and-a-half times' the maximum punishment.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

148,"The Big Read: Amid societal changes, how will the link between family formation and housing policies evolve?",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-amid-societal-changes-how-will-the-link-between-14398642,15 Mar 2021 06:12AM,"For single Singaporeans, the road to securing a roof over their heads has been more challenging than some others, when for the longest time, a Singaporean’s marital status is a key factor in determining their eligibility for public housing.SINGAPORE: The first thing that Ms Rahayu Natalya did after her newborn was allowed to go home -  she was born premature and had to remain in hospital for a month - was to bring her along to see their Member of Parliament (MP), Mr Christopher de Souza, to seek help in getting a rental flat from the Housing and Development Board (HDB).The single unwed mother started her quest for a rental flat when she was about four months pregnant in 2016, and was still without a home after giving birth. “When I brought my daughter to him (the MP) …  I said, ‘Why do I feel like my government has turned its back on me?’. Because I am here literally homeless with my daughter,” said Ms Rahayu, who works part-time at non-profit organisation Daughters of Tomorrow. About a year after she first started her search for a home, the 39-year-old eventually got her one-room rental flat — after “a lot of letters” and much help from Mr de Souza, who looks after the Ulu Pandan ward in the Holland-Bukit Timah Group Representation Constituency (GRC). Then there is Mr Fadhil Azmi, who was renting for 10 years before he finally bought his own HDB flat in 2019 when he reached the minimum eligible age of 35 years old. He moved out of his parents’ home as he wanted his own space, given that he comes from a big family living in a small flat. “The amount I spent on rent in the last 10 years, I could have paid for the house (if I was allowed to buy it) back then… I would have been debt-free by now,” said the 36-year-old who works in marketing. For single Singaporeans such as Ms Rahayu and Mr Fadhil, the road to securing a roof over their heads has been more challenging than some others. That’s because for the longest time, a Singaporean’s marital status is a key factor in determining whether he or she is eligible for public housing. According to experts, linking housing eligibility to matrimony is meant to help the Government, among other things, achieve its wider national objective of encouraging couples to get married and have children, so as to boost the local population growth. It also helps to prioritise housing resources in land-scarce Singapore. Married couples or those intending to get married do not face age limitations and get higher housing grants. Singles, on the other hand, can buy an HDB flat only when they turn 35, and are limited to only smaller units in newer estates when they buy flats that are built and sold at subsidised rates by the Government. In recent years, in a nod to societal changes and intense lobbying by MPs, there have been moves by the authorities to alleviate the plight of some groups of singles, including single unwed parents and divorcees. Most recently, the Ministry of National Development (MND) announced on March 4 that it would be piloting a new scheme, where low-income singles looking to apply for public rental flats will soon no longer have to find a flatmate first. Currently, only two or more singles can apply for a public rental flat together under the Joint Singles Scheme (JSS). Individuals who are not able to find a flatmate would typically have to approach the housing agency for help to source for one. This latest change comes amid anecdotal evidence that some co-tenants could not get along with each other and ended up in an acrimonious living environment. Still, the general sentiment among singles in Singapore - which was also borne out by interviews with this group - is that the policy changes do not go far enough and more can be done. Mr Abhishek Ravikrishnan, who is currently renting a room as he is not old enough under HDB rules to buy a public flat, said he understands the wider objective of designing policies that prioritise the nucleus family, which is understood to refer to a heterosexual married couple with children. However, the 31-year-old who produces sports content said the Government should look at other ways of catering to the increasing number of Singaporeans who do not wish to form such a nucleus family. “At the end of the day, if your objective is just to give birth and have babies, perhaps then we don’t fit in the country. Is that what you are trying to say? … What kind of message are you sending to people who don’t conform to that?” said Mr Abhishek.The tweaks in housing policies in recent years are also taking place in the wider context of demographic shifts in Singapore’s population.According to data from the Department of Statistics, marriage rates have been on the downtrend as fewer couples got married in 2019 compared to 2018 and the number of divorces has gone up. Over a longer-term period, it also showed that Singaporeans are marrying later. Singapore’s total fertility rate, which refers to the average number of children born to a woman over her lifetime, has also been trending downwards over the last few decades. The total fertility rate in 2020 is 1.1, far below the replacement level of 2.1. Given such trends, can or should Singapore continue to incorporate incentives for family formation in its housing policies? And bearing in mind the complexities of the housing market, what are the possible implications and knock-on effects of any changes?PRESERVING THE FAMILY UNITCalls for the Government to relax public housing eligibility requirements for singles are not new. Before 1991, the only option for singles was to buy from the private market or apply for a Housing and Urban Development Company unit, which typically came with a higher price tag. HDB had said in the 1980s that its priority was to provide a home for every Singaporean family and relaxing the rules for singles would lengthen the waiting period for families. Former National Development Minister S Dhanabalan said in 1988 that allowing singles to buy their own flats and live alone would also be in direct conflict with the Government’s efforts to preserve the traditional family unit. Housing rules for singles were finally relaxed in 1991, when singles aged 35 and above were allowed to buy HDB resale flats, but only limited to three-room flats in selected locations. Then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, who had just taken over the helm from founding Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew a year earlier, announced the new scheme during the 1991 National Day Rally. Then in 1998, housing grants from the Central Provident Fund were extended to singles. When Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong took over the reins from Mr Goh in 2004, he announced that singles could buy four-room and five-room HDB resale flats at any location. In 2013, the rules were further relaxed when singles above 35 were allowed to buy Build-to-Order (BTO) flats - which are heavily subsidised by the Government - directly from HDB, but only limited to two-room flats. Experts interviewed noted that in spite of the changes over the decades, those forming families continue to have priority among the many different Singaporean profiles that are looking for public housing.  Professor Paulin Tay Straughan, a sociologist at the Singapore Management University (SMU), said that the policy is designed this way in the interest of national stability. “The national agenda has always been they will promote home ownership in line with the family ideology that supports our nation-building,” she said. Mr Nicholas Mak, the head of research and consultancy department at real estate firm ERA, said that the agenda of promoting marriage and children, and ensuring that there is the next generation of Singaporeans, is ultimately about the survival of Singapore. “I don’t think the Government will drop the objective ... to encourage family formation and encourage families to have more children … because there is no substitute,” he said. Speaking during the debate on the MND’s budget for the upcoming financial year, National Development Minister Desmond Lee said that the Government will still offer generous grants to young families to help them afford their first flats. Nevertheless, the Government recognises the demographic shifts.  When Mr Lee was Second Minister for National Development in 2018, he had also said that Singapore needs to keep reviewing its policies to accommodate people and families in different circumstances, such as those coming from single-parent homes and never-married singles.National University of Singapore (NUS) sociology professor Tan Ern Ser noted that it’s about balancing the need to form families, as well as ensuring singles of all backgrounds are also being taken care of.CALLS FOR CHANGE But singles spoken to feel that this balancing act is tilted too far in favour of those with growing and intact families.Take the case of Ms Leila, a divorced mother with two children, who declined to give her full name. After moving out of her matrimonial home in 2015 and filing for divorce after her then-husband abused her, she obtained a court order requiring him, who still lives in the flat, to sell it. However, he has refused to budge. This means Ms Leila is unable to secure another HDB flat for her and her two children as she still has one flat under her name. She was only able to get a rental flat in June 2020 after Mr Louis Ng, an MP for Nee Soon GRC, helped her appeal to HDB. Even then, the whole waiting process was fraught with anxiety as she was initially rejected multiple times. “For many months, I called HDB and begged … I feel that anybody who is family, regardless whether you are an unwed mum, single mum or divorcee or whatever, should be entitled to a flat and to have a proper roof over their head,” said the 51-year-old trainer in self-development.Having a home would provide people like her the stability and security to get back on their feet, such as finding a job, noted Ms Leila.  “Once you don’t feel stable, there are a lot of mental issues, health issues, because you are not grounded. Once you have a safe place, your whole body just relaxes… The Government doesn't have to actually help or give more money or financial assistance because we feel empowered to do things because we are safe,” she added. Ms Kanak Muchhal, who oversees women strategic development at Daughters of Tomorrow, said one policy change that could ease the difficulties for low-income women going through divorce is for the Government to provide a rental flat while they are in the midst of settling the paperwork. This is because a lot of these women, while going through the divorce process, end up leaving their matrimonial home and they face a lot of difficulties in planning their next step for themselves and their children due to the uncertainty. Currently, HDB allows divorced parents with children under 18 to apply for a two- or three-room BTO flat in a non-mature estate after obtaining a provisional order for divorce and resolving matters relating to their matrimonial home and children custody.Those who have full care and control over their children may also be able to retain their home even if they are under 35.While most women do manage to get a HDB flat eventually, Ms Kanak said: “But the timeline is long, and there is no visibility as to how long, which leads to uncertainty”.  The hurdles single and divorced parents face in securing a flat have also led to some criticism that the housing policies have been designed to favour a very narrow idea of what constitutes a nucleus family. Mr Ian Lee, who is in a same-sex relationship with his partner for the past 14 years, said that as the couple are still not seen as a family unit, they were unable to buy an HDB flat before reaching the age of 35. After renting for one year together, Mr Lee finally bought his HDB resale flat when he turned 35 last year through the singles’ scheme. “HDB has always been about trying to provide homes for Singaporeans but we are denied access to homes (even though we are) at the same stage of life as our heterosexual counterparts,” said the 35-year-old public relations professional. Like Mr Abhishek and Mr Fadhil, Mr Lee said he supports the Government’s policy of giving priority to married heterosexual couples in the form of greater subsidies and other benefits, which is one half of what he considers a “carrot and stick” approach. But he takes issue with what he calls the “anti-single penalties”. One way the Government can tweak the policy is to give more subsidies and benefits to heterosexual couples, but reduce the restrictions for those who fall outside the nucleus family definition, said Mr Lee. “I’m a taxpayer and a Singaporean … But just because I don’t fit the exact mould you would like me to, that doesn’t make me any less of a Singaporean, and therefore I should not be treated less than any of my Singaporean counterparts,” he added. Mr Fadhil suggested that while all other advantages for married couples could remain, lowering the age eligibility for singles to buy a HDB flat from 35 to 25 would be appropriate as that is the age when most young Singaporeans start working and earn an income. SUGGESTIONS AND POTENTIAL TRADE-OFFSA long-time advocate for single unwed mothers, Mr Ng, the Nee Soon GRC MP, said it is time to review the housing policy for never-married singles, although he believes that the prioritisation of family formation should still remain. He said that giving the young some freedom to live on their own might help to increase their desire for dating. While he acknowledged that there is no evidence yet to prove that link, he said the added responsibilities that comes with having one’s own place may lead one to consider settling down. “A lot are getting married later now, a lot would like to move out of their parents’ house but the current 35-year-old age limit might restrict that. It’s time to review that,” Mr Ng said. For a start, he said the Government can consider reducing the age limit to 33 or 34 for BTO flats. In response to queries, a spokesperson from the Workers’ Party reiterated its proposal to lower the minimum age requirement to apply for a BTO flat to 28, and create a new class of rental units — a recommendation which the opposition party made in its manifesto released during last year’s General Election. “We in the Workers' Party acknowledge the successes of Singapore's public housing policy to date, but also see a need for reform, difficult as that may be,” said the spokesperson. “Singaporeans hope to see HDB flats remain a livable home that every Singaporean can afford, while also ensuring that retirement adequacy is not damaged by a precipitous resale price collapse.” Most experts said policy tweaks to ease requirements for singles could be considered, but a ""free-for-all"" situation would not be possible. The crux of the issue is that while HDB has to cater to various types of housing needs, it only has limited land and financial resources.Associate Professor Sing Tien Foo, Director of the Institute of Real Estate Studies at NUS, pointed out that there won’t be an issue meeting everyone’s demands if there are unlimited resources. However, the very real resource constraints mean that the Government has to prioritise who to allocate them to. For example, lowering the age eligibility for singles to buy HDB flats would mean that more subsidies would have to be given to them, in addition to land and building costs. “How does this impose on the Government budget and fiscal constraints?” he asked. Another factor complicating how the Government should set the eligibility requirements is the fact that HDB flats are highly subsidised, noted Professor Straughan.“So, it’s taxpayers’ money and the reason the Government can tie it to national interests to justify the high subsidies,” she said. “Herein lies the difficulty. If a person is not married, should taxpayers’ money be going into subsidising their homeownership? I think it’s very hard to get around that… Unless there are exigencies and this person just cannot find a place to live and rentals are so exorbitantly high. Then it becomes a welfare situation.” For the Government to make a policy change, there must be a social problem that requires state intervention, Mr Mak pointed out.  “Is (the group of singles under 35) facing any housing shortage of their own, meaning they really have no place to live? If there is no housing problem, then why fix something that is not broken?” he said. However, this is not to say that there is absolutely no room for the rules on singles to be reviewed. One way to make the case for singles below 35 to get a HDB flat is for them to buy it from the resale market, as they would then be buying the unit at market value and not be relying on government subsidies, said Prof Straughan. To ensure that the market is not distorted, she suggested three criteria that could accompany this lowering of age eligibility: There must be enough supply of HDB resale flats; singles are only restricted to buying smaller three-room flats; and they have extenuating circumstances, such as not having a place to stay. These regulations could help limit demand and prevent the prices of resale flats from soaring, which, if it does happen, would attract a fresh round of criticisms of the Government’s housing policies. “Every time you lift the restrictions, it increases the number of people who will go into the market … The Government has to make sure that every shift is carefully deliberated because they have to justify every time they lift the eligibility criteria as it opens up the market for more competition,” said Prof Straughan. Mr Mak also noted that any move to lower the age limit for singles to buy HDB flats would definitely lead to price increases, and this would generally be more advantageous to the high-income segments of the population, while low-income households get priced out. Safeguards would have to be put in place to prevent any abuse, he said, such as imposing income ceilings on resale flats, just like for BTOs. Mr Mak also pointed out that the supply for flats is inelastic as it takes years for them to be built and an additional five years before resale flats can be sold in the market. Demand, however, can change the very next day depending on policy moves. Hence, there is a need for the Government to moderate demand. Another suggestion that could ease the housing frustration for singles is for HDB to build better-quality rental housing for young singles to rent from the age of 30 before they can buy their own flat at 35, said Assoc Prof Tan, the NUS sociologist. While the bigger priority is still to encourage family formation, he said that the policy could be more inclusive and seek to cater to the housing needs of a wider group of people. These rental studios would be cheaper than those in the private rental market and come with a short lease of a maximum of five years. Assoc Prof Tan suggested that HDB could launch it as a pilot in a few blocks first to see if it works out. Listen to Prof Sing Tien Foo discuss developments in the property market since COVID-19 hit on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:PRIORITISING CERTAIN GROUPS OF SINGLES Since it is unlikely for the HDB to completely relax these restrictions, experts and MPs interviewed said any policy adjustment should first cater to the plight of vulnerable singles, which would typically include low-income individuals, single or divorced parents. For Prof Straughan and Mountbatten MP Lim Biow Chuan, more attention should be given to elderly singles — not only because they are the most vulnerable segment but also because they would increase in numbers with Singapore’s ageing population. Mr Lim, who has been advocating for HDB to cater more to the needs of this group, welcomes the board’s latest policy shift in allowing singles to apply for public rental flats without having to find a flatmate beforehand. “We do have more and more elderly singles. Along the way, we also have divorced parents, they also need housing, we need to adapt. Some flexibility would be helpful instead of a blunt policy of requiring two persons to be living in a rental flat and that’s it,” he said. Assoc Prof Tan believes that families with children, whether from single unwed parents or divorced parents, should be prioritised. “Not only because we want higher fertility. It’s also a moral issue. Children are actually innocent. Why should they be punished because of what their parents did or didn’t do,” he said. Another group of people whom he believes deserve help are those who leave their homes due to domestic violence issues. Assoc Prof Tan said his concept of rental studios could be used to accommodate singles in such situations as well. “Why can't we use whatever we have? What I do know is that there are flats that are empty at any one time. Those can be used for this kind of purposes,” he said. Assoc Prof Sing felt that the level of income — and not family type — should be the first measure of assessing whether an individual and his or her family requires government assistance for housing. In the context of limited resources, a low-income single parent should get priority over another single parent who has a higher income, for example. In the case of a low-income single parent versus a low-income single, the single parent’s housing needs would be more urgent. However, he acknowledged that making such decisions is a complex issue, with the Government having to consider many factors. “It’s very difficult to measure properly, difficult to draw the line on who you should help if you have resources,” he said. INCREMENTAL STEPS NEEDED Meeting the public housing needs of every Singaporean has been a mammoth task from the start, and it is likely to become more complicated in the future. As the make-up of Singapore society becomes more diverse, so would be their housing needs, which may even be competing against each other. As the current demographic trends continue, Mr Alan Cheong, executive director of research and consultancy at real estate service provider Savills, believes that HDB could eventually return to being a builder of homes for the needy, while the rest of Singapore would, over time, settle their housing needs through the private market.With Singaporeans increasingly more educated and influenced by cultural practices overseas, he argues that incentivising family formation through housing policies is a “lost cause”. “The nucleus family is passe. Whether you like it or not, more and more people would not have the traditional idea of marriage and having kids,” he said. While Singaporeans who believe in the institution of marriage still form a majority, there is a growing number of sub-groups consisting of singles of various backgrounds “eating away at its edges”, he added. However, Mr Ng, the Nee Soon GRC MP, believes change can still happen incrementally while retaining the status quo, which is why he suggested to lower the age limit by one or two years before making further adjustments if necessary. While recognising that resources are limited, he believes that tweaking housing policy levers is not about “restricting one and helping the other”.“Married people will still get their bigger HDB flats and more subsidies, but I think singles should also get their fair share of the pie,” said the MP. Mr Lim, the Mountbatten MP, echoed similar sentiments, adding that small steps should be taken in finding the right balance on how to apportion resources. Cognisant of the complexities behind Singapore’s housing policies, Mr Abhishek acknowledged that there will always be a segment of the population that will be left out no matter how much policymakers adjust the rules. However, he still believes that something needs to be done. “We have a growing number of people who don’t want to get married… all kinds of people living together in one country under one citizenship, you cannot ignore that,” he said.

149,"Commentary: We’re sleeping more since the pandemic, but we aren’t feeling rested",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/sleep-quality-hours-rest-mental-health-wellbeing-tips-covid-work-14392578,15 Mar 2021 06:11AM,"Good sleep is not just about quantity, but also quality, say sleep scientists.LONDON: As the pandemic spread in 2020 and nations entered lockdown, many people noticed their sleep patterns changing. On social media celebrities started recording bedtime stories to help people fall asleep, while on Twitter #cantsleep was trending regularly.A year into the pandemic, sleep scientists are beginning to understand how our sleep has changed, and what the implications may be for people’s wellbeing.Two recent studies tracked sleep patterns of volunteers in Europe and South America in the first months of lockdown. The results told a consistent story: People are sleeping more during lockdown than before it and the timing of their sleep had changed.Both studies found that lockdown has reduced “social jetlag” – the difference between weekday and weekend bedtimes. Normally, most people go to bed earlier and wake up earlier on weekdays than they would on weekends.Under lockdown, though, sleep patterns make every day look more like the weekend.QUALITY ABOVE QUANTITYGood sleep is not just about quantity, but also quality. Sleep quality takes into account how long it takes to fall asleep, how many times or how easily you wake up during the night, how hard it is to fall back asleep and how refreshed you feel in the morning.The surprising finding from new studies looking at lockdown sleep is while people are getting more of it, the quality of sleep is worse.A recent UK survey from King’s College London backs up these findings. Half of the UK population said their sleep is more disturbed during lockdown and three in ten said they sleep longer but feel less rested.It’s not just about feeling tired, there are many possible consequences of declining sleep quality. Good-quality sleep is crucial for the body’s immune system to fight off infectious illness.In a landmark study in 2009 researchers monitored 153 volunteers’ sleep patterns for two weeks, and then exposed them to a virus causing the common cold. Participants who had poor-quality sleep during the two weeks were six times more likely to develop a cold.The link between sleep quality and health was bolstered by a large-scale study where 30,000 volunteers provided data on their physical and mental health and sleep patterns over four years. The results showed positive changes in sleep quality over four years were associated with better health and wellbeing.LINKS BETWEEN SLEEP, LEARNING AND DECISION-MAKINGGood-quality sleep not only helps you stay healthy, but also helps your mind stay sharp.In a 2019 study university students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were given a Fitbit to wear for one term. The Fitbit recorded their sleep patterns while the researchers tracked their academic performance.Those who slept for longer and got better-quality sleep over the month before an exam – not just on the night before an exam – achieved better grades than other students.One explanation for the link between sleep quality and the students’ success could be while sleep strengthens memories formed during the day, poor-quality sleep might jeopardise this process.One study in 2012 demonstrated this by teaching good and bad sleepers to tap a specific sequence of buttons before a night’s sleep and again when they awoke.The good sleepers’ finger tapping skills improved overnight by 15 per cent while the bad sleepers improved by just 1 per cent. Sleep does not benefit learning when the quality is poor.From pandemic puppies to late-night online shopping sprees, impulsive behaviour has been a hallmark of lockdowns. While this is partly due to boredom, sleep plays a role too.One study in 2013 investigated decision-making in adolescents, an age group known for impulsive behaviour. Adolescents with poor sleep quality had poorer decision-making skills and made riskier decisions in a gambling game compared to their peers with good-quality sleep.STRATEGIES TO SLEEP BETTERThe good news is there are effective strategies for improving your sleep quality. A consortium of sleep scientists has published a list of recommendations.These include keeping a regular sleep schedule, avoiding using the bed for activities other than sleep (including Zoom meetings), avoiding electronic devices before bedtime, taking regular exercise and getting as much daylight as possible, especially in the mornings.Before lockdown, only 44 per cent of UK adults were satisfied with their sleep. For some, lockdown held the promise of more sleep as we were released from the shackles of office hours and a daily commute.While this dream of more sleep has come true for some, it might not be the kind of sleep they were expecting. Investing in the quality of your sleep is important – you might find yourself smarter and leading a healthier life.Intermittent fasting could help you lose weight but at what cost? And doesn’t it ignore conventional wisdom on not skipping breakfast?

150,"Better mental health awareness among seniors, but more can be done, say experts",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-elderly-seniors-dementia-14271078,12 Mar 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: When Mr Ng Kok Sing’s mother started showing signs of poor memory and became bad-tempered six years ago, the eldest of four sons noticed the changes. His mother, Madam Lee Lye Kuen, ran a hawker stall and could remember her customers’ orders, but she was misplacing things, and forgetting to brush her teeth. She had a group of friends at the local community centre, but her bad temper drove them away, he told CNA in a phone interview. Mr Ng’s daughter took Madam Lee to the doctor, and the elderly woman was diagnosed with dementia at Singapore General Hospital (SGH). “I didn’t know much about dementia. After getting the report from SGH, I just could not understand. I was a bit shocked,” Mr Ng said.Mr Ng said his knowledge of dementia was initially minimal, but he made an effort to find out more so he would be equipped to take care of his mother. He did not understand why his mother had the condition as there was no history of it in his family, he said. “After I found some articles and attended some talks, slowly I understood what dementia is. I had to face it,” he said.On the other hand, Madam Lee is aware of what dementia is from media articles and talks at the Fei Yue Retirees Centre where she goes, Mr Ng said. But she does not know that she has the condition. MORE MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS AMONG SENIORS AND FAMILIESA spokesperson for Fei Yue Community Services said that in recent years there has been more mental healthcare screening at polyclinics.“We do see more diagnosed with dementia,” she said, noting that seniors are more aware of dementia and depression because of communications though various media channels. “Their family members, friends, peers and neighbours who may be diagnosed with similar mental health conditions have also made them more aware,” she said. She added that the elderly are also more open to finding about mental health issues by attending talks and workshops on mental health.  The COVID-19 pandemic has also “surfaced many mental health cases within the community”, she said.“There is now more prominence and light given to mental health wellness,” she said.“Together with some of the Government initiatives, the community has become more aware and embraces (the fact) that mental health issues and mental well-being are important to one’s health. The younger generations like the baby boomers help to detect early symptoms and signs amongst the elderly, to seek intervention and treatment.”The Samaritans of Singapore (SOS), which provides emotional support to those in crisis or are thinking about suicide or affected by suicide, also said that awareness of mental health has “generally increased in the past few years”.The organisation has observed an increasing number of community initiatives to support the elderly and their caregivers as well as to increase awareness around mental health conditions, said its chief executive Gasper Tan.“Specifically, we have seen a greater understanding of dementia,” he said.SOS noted that agencies such as Lien Foundation, Khoo Teck Phuat Hospital and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC) have been fronting educational campaigns.“(They) had played a vital role in equipping and training more with the necessary knowledge and skills to identify symptoms of dementia as well as how to support affected people in the community,” he said.Mental health among seniors came into the spotlight in Parliament last month, after MP Mohd Fahmi Aliman (PAP-Marine Parade) asked about the effectiveness of Government initiatives in reducing elderly suicide and the support mechanisms for old people who are socially isolated.Senior Minister of State for Health Janil Puthucheary said that there were 400 reported cases of suicide in 2019. Of these, 122 cases, or 30.5 per cent, involved persons 60 years and above.  “The causes of suicide are complex and multi-faceted, often involving family, social and mental health issues,” he said.“Therefore, the Government works closely with Ministry of Social and Family Development and community partners on multi-pronged approaches, comprising promoting mental health and well-being, raising awareness on suicide prevention, and providing professional support and crisis interventions to at-risk groups, including targeted support for older adults.”MORE WORK NEEDED While awareness among seniors is improving, more can still be done so they and their families are more familiar with mental health issues, eldercare groups said.“In our counselling experience, a lot of times older people don’t feel comfortable sharing and talking about their mental health issues,” said Ms Wang Jing, assistant director of Hua Mei Counselling and Coaching at Tsao Foundation. Even when they do share openly, their families sometimes might not understand their challenges, she said.People may come to the wrong conclusions that seniors who are depressed or anxious “think too much or simply forgetful or careless” and that their mental state is a normal aspect of ageing, she said.“Mental health issues can be invisible and be misunderstood,” she said.She added that the behaviour of older people that can hint at a sense of anxiety or distress can be seen by others as being unreasonable or insecure.  “More can be done to promote awareness and understanding that these are not necessarily part of ageing but a mental health issue which we can all solve together,” she said.Fei Yue Community Services also said that there is still much work that can be done. “The stigma and misconception, and lack of knowledge still exists. Many prefer to not talk about it or dismiss the idea if they should share with someone their emotional state of being,” a spokesperson said. She added that family members and friends are “critical” to getting seniors to attend workshops or talks to get themselves more acquainted with managing their mental health. Given that dementia and depression are common mental health issues among seniors, the AIC said that families should look out for signs of these conditions. A spokesperson said that signs of dementia include difficulty performing daily activities like cooking and dressing, changes in behaviour like becoming socially withdrawn and more easily upset, and issues with cognition such as difficulty remembering things and having problems with language and calculations.For depression, signs include thoughts of suicide, a change in sleeping patterns, and irritability and outbursts of anger, she said. SUICIDE PREVENTIONMr Tan said that among those who called the 24-hour SOS hotline and disclosed their age, about 20 per cent of calls between April 2019 and March last year were from people aged 60 and above.While some call to reach out for a listening ear or vent their daily frustrations, “others may call SOS when they are in crisis, and in need of emotional support to cope with their negative thoughts and suicidal ideations”, said Mr Tan.“In such calls, our priority is to ensure the safety of the caller. In general, we strive to give clients a safe space where they can share their thoughts and feelings openly as we may be their only resource for support, he said.He said that suicide is an “inherently complex issue”, with no single cause.“It is often due to culmination of a variety of factors. When one experience feelings of hopelessness for a prolonged period of time, one may contemplate and even attempt suicide,” he said. Loneliness, physical illness, loss of independence and loss of loved ones can contribute to seniors’ sense of despair, he said.“The process of growing old is inevitably accompanied with physical and social changes. It can be difficult to cope and adapt to these transitions, there may be fear and feelings of loss with their physical deterioration, and even concern that they are putting on burden to the people around them,” he said.He added that guilt is another emotion that they may encounter. “When one is in such a situation, especially with a weak social support and no one to turn to, feelings of loneliness and alienation may be amplified,” he said. SOS views education as key for suicide prevention, he said.“The community must take an proactive commitment to destigmatise suicide and create more open and constructive conversations on how we can empower the elderly, such that they can sustain meaning especially in their late age,” he said.“Furthermore, we believe that the onus should not lie only on the elderly, but the community at large to empathize and support these individuals.”HOW FAMILIES CAN HELPAIC echoed the view that it is important for the community to continue to come together, be aware of the various mental health conditions as well as their signs and symptoms, in order to be supportive of those living with such challenges. They suggested that families supporting elderly loved ones at-risk of, or living with, mental health conditions should be aware of signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and know who to turn to for information, treatment or support. The families should also learn about the condition and what to expect of those living with it, treatment options and how to manage their medication, and take time out from caregiving to practise self-care. “This is important for caregivers so as to manage their own mental wellness and prevent burnout,” a spokesperson for AIC said. Fei Yue Community Services said that families can support their elderly by being more patient and showing empathy when they display symptoms. “The family’s willingness to adjust their own living lifestyle to fit the elderly’s needs and not the other way round will help and goes a long way too,” its spokesperson said.",False,"['mental health', 'seniors']",Singapore

The couple had three daughters – now 13, 22 and 26 – and a 17-year-old son.He began sexually assaulting his eldest daughter when she was 11, in 2005, after watching pornography and ""developing urges"", prosecutors said.He forced his eldest daughter into the acts while she was doing her homework, even though he knew it was wrong and she was unwilling.The girl began crying but he did not heed her cries. He continued to rape her multiple times before stopping between 2010 and 2011 when she turned 16 or 17.He then began preying on his second daughter, who was 12. He raped her and sexually assaulted her for nine years, sometimes a few times a week, until 2019.In his last rape offence against his second daughter a week before his arrest, he assaulted her in the kitchen while his wife was sleeping in the living room.In October 2019, the man targeted his youngest daughter, who was 12. She knew what he wanted to do, as she had seen him sexually assaulting her sister twice before and had forced her to touch him a year ago.The girl began shaking her head and crying, which made her father angry and frustrated, but he did not pursue it further.The next day, she confided in her friends about what happened as she did not want her father to continue these acts against her.On their advice, she told her teacher what happened, and her teacher took her to a police station to lodge a report.The ensuing investigations brought to light the offences the man committed against his three daughters.IMH REPORTS ON ALL THOSE INVOLVEDThe man was remanded for psychiatric observation and evaluation. He was diagnosed by IMH to have paedophilic disorder in view of his repeated sexual acts against his daughters. He also has a high risk of sexual reoffending, but he was found fit to plead and not of unsound mind.The eldest daughter did not tell anyone about the assault she suffered, as her father warned her against it and she was very scared of him. Her younger sister was similarly scared of the man as he was fierce to her.Reports from the Institute of Mental Health later found that the eldest daughter suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result and harboured suicidal thoughts during the time of the assault.The second daughter reported depressive symptoms, feeling hopeless and having thoughts that life was not worth living. She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder and PTSD and will need treatment with possible psychological therapy in future.Prosecutors called for at least 35 years and four months' jail, calling the case an ""egregious and long-drawn"" one with a ""sordid series of acts"".They said the man abused his position and severely violated the trust placed in him, and raped vulnerable victims, exposing his daughters to the risk of pregnancies and sexually transmitted diseases.""The abuse perpetrated by the accused in this case can only be described as horrific,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutors Mohamed Faizal and Norine Tan. ""Three different daughters were sexually abused for over a decade, with two of the daughters raped repeatedly and one of them being sexually groomed in order to arrive at that outcome.""Two of the daughters understandably now suffer marked and permanent psychological scars from such actions. It would be fair to say that this case represents one of the worst of its kind when it relates to sexual offending.""Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

Another five charges, including showing pornography to his daughter, were considered in sentencing.The court heard that the offender and the victim's mother were married in 2009, but their marriage broke down a few years later.The girl and her mother moved out sometime between 2012 and 2013, but the girl would stay over at her father's on weekends.The man first sexually assaulted his daughter in March 2015. He continued to do so between April and May that year in his bedroom.Each time before he molested the girl, the offender would show her pornographic videos that he was watching. On one occasion, he asked her to ""follow the video"", and the victim complied.Sometime in 2015, the victim's mother noticed that the girl was emotional and not her usual self after she returned home from a weekend at her father's place.She questioned her daughter, who said her father had asked her to lick ""below that thing"", and demonstrated actions suggestive of oral sex.The girl's mother was shocked and confronted the accused over the phone. He initially denied it but later admitted his acts, promising not to do it again and imploring her not to report the matter to the police.The victim's mother decided not to make a police report at first, after considering the accused's promise and the fact that her daughter appeared distressed and would not be able to see her father in jail.She tried to prevent her daughter from seeing her father, but eventually relented as the girl asked to do so.The offences came to light only in July 2019, when the girl's mother sought help at a family service centre for the victim's behavioural issues.While discussing the child's background, the victim's mother revealed that the accused had sexually assaulted the victim, and a police report was lodged.The accused was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health after his arrest and was found to be of sound mind, with no psychiatric disorder.The victim was examined in a hospital and found to have an old hymenal tear.A report showed that she had undergone surgery in October 2015 to remove a plastic toy shoe and another item from her vagina. The victim said she had inserted the items herself.MORAL CORRUPTION AN AGGRAVATING FACTOR: PROSECUTORSThe offender has no previous convictions. Deputy Public Prosecutors Daphne Lim and Lim Shin Hui sought the sentence that was eventually meted out, saying that he had robbed his biological daughter of her innocence by exploiting her for his own sexual gratification.One of the aggravating factors is ""moral corruption"", as the man would show his daughter porn before each incident. There was also an escalation in his acts - beginning with molest and proceeding to sexual assault on the third occasion.The molestation was of a ""very intrusive nature"", with skin-on-skin contact, said the prosecutors.Responding to the defence's point that the girl has forgiven her father, the prosecution said this is not relevant in sentencing considerations.Defence lawyer Chong Xin Yi said her client had ""stopped himself"" before his ex-wife intervened, and continued to have ""a good father and daughter relationship"" with the victim for four years before his arrest.""The accused has to live with the knowledge of what he has done, and we would submit that that in itself is retribution enough,"" said Ms Chong.""To date he cannot forgive himself for what he has done. His daughter still misses him,"" she said, adding that the offender is ""committed to being the best father he can"".Justice Valerie Thean said the accused ""really needs to think about it and consider his actions in relation to his child"".Age and vulnerability are especially serious issues in this case, she said, adding that the accused is the biological father of the victim and in a position of trust and authority.She highlighted the victim's ""extreme youth"" and said the man had abused his position of parental responsibility in the sanctity of his home.For molesting a minor, the man could have been jailed for up to five years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties.For sexual assault by penetration of a minor, he could have been jailed between eight and 20 years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

154,MOM may require employment agencies to check in on foreign domestic workers: Gan Siow Huang,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mom-employment-agencies-check-foreign-domestic-workers-abuse-14359660,08 Mar 2021 12:59PM,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Manpower (MOM) could make it compulsory for employment agencies to check in on their foreign domestic workers during their period of employment, Minister of State for Manpower Gan Siow Huang said in Parliament on Monday (Mar 8).“Although it’s not mandated for (employment agencies) to check in on the foreign domestic workers, we do know of some employment agencies that take the extra step in checking with the employers as well as the foreign domestic workers … we think this is a good practice, and there is scope for us to look at institutionalising it so that there is one more touch point ... for foreign domestic workers to raise concerns,” she said in response to MP Zhulkarnain Abdul Rahim’s (PAP-Chua Chu Kang) suggestions to improve the welfare of foreign domestic workers. He recommended that the ministry makes it mandatory for “employment agencies to have some responsibility” while the worker is under contract and if mental health support could be offered to them during this period as well, to which Ms Gan said that it was an area the ministry would be ""interested to pursue"".  MP Gerald Giam (WP-Aljunied) had asked in a parliamentary question how the ministry plans to protect foreign domestic workers from abuse.Ms Gan said the Government is reviewing its measures including enhancing the one-on-one interviews after newly arrived workers start work with their employers and compulsory days off so that workers have a better chance at seeking help. These plans were previously announced in her Committee of Supply speech last Wednesday. Right now, workers are given a weekly rest day, but they can agree to work on their rest day if the employer compensates them. Following up from Ms Gan’s reply, Mr Giam asked if there are professional or legal consequences for doctors who fail to report suspected abuse, and if officials will raise the penalties on such doctors. He also asked if there are plans to screen employers, and how can workers report their situation if they do not have a phone or a day off.Ms Gan said they are working with the medical community on improving the ways doctors detect and report abuse cases.“Currently it is in the form where doctors are required to report if they detect signs of distress or abuse … I think the main issue now is that it may not be so easy and discernible for doctors to detect abuse cases and it does require some objectivity,” she said. Foreign domestic workers have to undergo a medical examination every six months. Since 2017, doctors are required to report to the police or to MOM immediately if they spot signs of abuse.As for screening employers, Ms Gan said the Government notes employers with a history of complaints against them, as well as those that change workers frequently. And for workers without a rest day or mobile phones, the Centre for Domestic Employees reaches out to them through interviews, she said. Currently, the organisation conducts interviews with first-time workers in their native language within the first few months of their employment.MP Lim Biow Chuan (PAP-Mountbatten) asked how the ministry will balance the interest of both employers and workers, as there are employers who have been falsely accused by foreign domestic workers trying to secure a transfer. Ms Gan said the ministry has officers that investigate such cases. Most of them stem from miscommunication, she said. “Some employers may have certain special requirements or may have standards that are higher than the others. Some foreign domestic workers may have more capacity than others when it comes to work,” said Ms Gan. She added: “If there is a poor fit … I think it is best that we try to adjust to redeploy the foreign domestic worker to other households instead of forcefully and prolonging the problem for both parties.""Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

156,"The Big Read: As Singapore society ages, who will care for the caregivers?",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ageing-society-caregiving-parents-demential-elderly-health-14348272,08 Mar 2021 06:02AM,"Caring for an invalid elderly demands a lot from the caregivers even in the best of times; in perilous times it gets worse.SINGAPORE: At his wits’ end, Mr Danny Raven Tan, 53, once threatened his dementia-stricken mother with a chopper because she was “driving him nuts”.Since she was diagnosed with the illness that causes impaired intellectual functions and personality changes in 2015, his mother, who is now 88, would tiresomely ask him about his father and godmother, both of whom had died, frequently raise her voice at him and accuse their helper of stealing her money.“At that time, I didn’t know anything about dementia and it was eating me up,” said Mr Tan, who quit his full-time job in marketing to be the primary caregiver for his mother and now runs an art gallery.In 2018, Mr Tan founded Enable Asia, a platform that focuses on dementia awareness and respite for caregivers. While Mr Tan has found support through the platform, homemaker Fadilah, who declined to give her full name, was pushed to the brink caring for her 86-year-old mother-in-law with Alzheimer’s disease during the circuit breaker period from April to June last year.Alzheimer’s disease is a progressive form of dementia that destroys memory, thinking skills and the ability to carry out simple tasks.One day, already drained from cleaning up after her mother-in-law had just soiled herself, Madam Fadilah was about to feed her lunch when the elderly woman swiped the bowl of porridge from her hand and called her “stupid and useless”.“I controlled myself because I didn’t want to cry in front of my children (who were working at home at that time). I keep telling myself that I am not stupid and useless and that she would not say those words to me if she was well,” said the 57-year-old. The mother of four children aged between 27 and 38, then impulsively swallowed a handful of her mother-in-law’s Alzheimer’s medication that was used to temporarily ease symptoms and keep her calm. “I ended up sleeping from 4pm that day till the next morning,” recalled Mdm Fadilah. “I felt so tired and I was just ‘gone’ all night. My husband thought I had fainted and almost called for an ambulance.”Mdm Fadilah and Mr Tan are not the only ones in such a predicament. In greying Singapore, it is estimated that there are more than 210,000 caregivers — many of whom have had to compromise their careers, finances and even their own health to look after their ill or disabled loved ones. Caring for an invalid elderly demands a lot from the caregivers even in the best of times; in perilous times it gets worse. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, confining many to their homes for long periods, caregivers have seen their stress levels climb to an all-time high — from having to manage difficult behaviours of their aged parents to thinking of ways to keep them occupied.But the caregivers’ plight has not been forgotten, emerging as a recurring theme during Parliamentary sittings in recent years, including during the Budget debate last week and the Ministry of Health’s (MOH) Committee of Supply (COS) debate on Friday (Mar 5).During the Budget debate for example, five Members of Parliament (MPs) spoke on how caregivers here often experience burnout and struggle with mental and physical health issues due to the stress incurred from their responsibilities. They also pointed out the significant gaps in community-based eldercare, despite the Government’s big push for it in recent years amid the rapidly ageing population. Likewise, during MOH’s COS debate, several MPs called on the Government to do more to support caregivers in the time of COVID-19, including reviewing and updating its Caregiver Support Action Plan unveiled in 2019. Earlier last month, MP Carrie Tan (PAP-Nee Soon) also asked in Parliament if the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) would consider introducing a new financial scheme for full-time caregivers to supplement their income and retirement savings.She said that this is especially important because more caregivers — most of whom are women — will be displaced from the workforce due to the ageing population here and the rising needs of eldercare.Indeed, the pandemic has starkly revealed significant gaps in community-based eldercare, according to caregivers and industry players interviewed. They singled out three key pressing issues in the caregiving ecosystem: Accessibility, affordability and lack of awareness.STRUGGLING WITH INCOME LOSS, HIGHER EXPENSESMany caregivers are often unprepared to take on the responsibilities as they are usually forced to assume the role overnight. Some struggle with the loss of income as they leave their jobs to become full-time caregivers or the pay cut that comes with working fewer hours as they opt for a more flexible work arrangement. After her father died of cancer in 2017, Ms Jasmine Chua thought she could strike a balance between caring for her 84-year-old dementia-stricken mother and working part-time as a clinic assistant, even though she was often running low on sleep as the elderly woman kept waking her up at night to chat. But it was not her mother’s nocturnal habit or the lack of sleep that prompted Ms Chua, 49, to quit her job soon after; it was the toll that caregiving had on her former domestic helper.“Once I caught her almost throwing a stool at my mother because she was so frustrated. That’s when I knew I needed to step in. I told myself either I earn money and watch my mother’s condition worsen or I don’t earn money but I help her get better,” she said.Since she quit her job, her five married siblings currently provide financial support for her and their mother.  Ms Chua, who was also the primary caregiver for her father before he died, said she previously also struggled with having to take unpaid leave whenever her parents were sick as she had limited annual leave. The loss or big drop in income is not the only financial headache for caregivers; the other one being the hefty price for respite care that they must pay, literally, if they want to take a break from their elderly charges. Ms Belinda Seet, whose 89-year-old mother is afflicted with Alzheimer’s, said even as a part-time early childhood studies lecturer, she could not afford to pay between S$20 and S$40 per hour for someone else to take over her caregiving duties so that she can rest. “Respite care is actually quite expensive for someone who is not working or working part-time,” said the 63-year-old.Although there are grants to help caregivers who wish to hire foreign domestic workers, Ms Seet said she was spooked by media reports on the mistreatment of the elderly. Caregivers in the middle-income bracket are not spared from financial worries as well, especially those living in landed property since they may not be eligible for subsidised elderly care. One such caregiver is Mr Henry Koh, 43, who had taken a significant pay cut when he quit his decade-long job as a behavioural therapist and opted for a flexible work arrangement as a consultant.The primary caregiver to his 76-year-old mother and 95-year-old grandmother – both suffering from dementia – said the pandemic took a big toll on his finances as patients were cutting back.The father of two children, aged eight and 10, added: “In my case, because we live in a landed property, the subsidy we get for daycare would be affected.”Among the grants that he tapped to ease his financial burden is the S$200 Caregivers Training Grant, administered by the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC), to offset the cost of caregiving training courses each year.There are also other grants available, such as the Home Caregiving Grant (HCG), which provides caregivers with a S$200 monthly cash payout to defray caregiving expenses, such as the costs of eldercare services or hiring of a foreign domestic worker. To be eligible for the HCG, the care recipient must be means-tested to have per capita household monthly income that is S$2,800 or less, or belong to a household with no income and living in a residence with an annual value of S$13,000 or less.STRIDES MADE IN RECENT YEARSIn 2019, MOH and partner agencies rolled out a Caregiver Support Action Plan.Some of the initiatives include expanding Medisave funds to cover the healthcare expenses of siblings who are Singaporeans or permanent residents, and growing caregiver support networks across dementia-friendly communities to provide platforms for caregivers and their loved ones to stay active. There is also the Community Mental Health Masterplan, introduced by the AIC and MOH, which aims to make it easier for persons with mental health to seek early treatment and to promote early identification of mental health conditions, among others.As Singapore ages at a faster pace and people live longer, the Government has over the years strengthened support for caregivers through its policies, tapping technology and beefing up community resources, noted industry players. The Government’s efforts are complemented by social service agencies and other organisations on the ground. Other key touchpoints for caregivers to access resources are through the respective healthcare providers and community care facilities.Mr Teo Koon Cho, chief executive officer of Active Global Home and Community Care, said about 56 per cent of its clients across home and centre-based services have benefited from grants, with their eligibility based on household means-testing.For example, at its senior daycare centres in Ghim Moh and Telok Blangah, a client who comes five days a week would get a bill of about S$170 per month after subsidy — which can be fully covered by the S$200 monthly HCG.Mr Teo added that those who take up their home personal care services and are eligible for the subsidy would pay about S$130 for 48 hours of home care per month, which can also be offset using the HCG. Eligible clients get up to 80 per cent subsidy.  Mr Alvin Lee, deputy head of the community case management department at Fei Yue Community Services, said that there has also been more awareness around caregiver support in recent years, such as support groups and respite care.The most notable support groups are the ones run by the Alzheimer’s Diseases Association (ADA), he said. Organisations have also come up with a variety of initiatives for caregivers.The Caregivers Alliance has a fully-funded 12-week programme for caregivers to learn new skills, perspectives and find support in one another. Similarly, social service agency Montfort Care offers such services under their GoodLife! Programme. Touch Community Services actively connects residents with one another, equipping them with skills and giving them the confidence to approach and support a neighbour who might be suffering from caregiver stress or depression.Helplines are also a common offering among agencies and organisations. Mr Kavin Seow, senior director of the elderly group at Touch Community Services, said the needs of caregivers have deepened and become more complex.Noting that the demographics of caregivers have evolved, Ms Pee Lay Lay, the lead social worker at Montfort Care, added: “They now have higher literacy, are more internet savvy and are willing to learn and make changes.” This means caregivers require greater support, resources and accessibility to services that equip them with the knowledge and skill sets to enhance the quality of life for both themselves and their care recipients. GAPS REMAIN While strides have been made to help caregivers here, there remains an urgent need to address the “3As” — accessibility, affordability and awareness, said industry players and MPs interviewed. Mr Teo, from Active Global Home and Community Care, pointed out that there is a segment of people who might not have access to subsidies due to the type of property they live in. “For example, people living in private properties may not be eligible for subsidised care but in reality, they may be asset rich but cash poor and could also be requiring long-term care,” he said.There are also caregivers on the fringes who do not know how or where to seek support as they are not exposed to the system, said industry players. Mr Teo said these caregivers’ charges may not have been hospitalised before and referred to community care, or attended regular check-ups at the polyclinics. Thus, the caregivers may not come into contact with social workers who can help them.“In such cases, they may not have any exposure or awareness about their eligibility and available care options,” he added. Echoing the same sentiments, Ms Tan said many stay-home caregivers also do not step out of their homes often, except to do grocery shopping or taking their loved ones for medical appointments.“They tend to have quite limited social circles and little time outside their homes for social interaction with others. This renders them rather hard to reach, or (makes it difficult) for information about support to reach them,” she added.Ms Pee from Montfort Care said that when seeking support, caregivers will also learn about the other options they have, such as respite care if they need a break from caregiving.But industry players and MPs pointed out that respite care is not affordable for many, especially for caregivers who have no income.Mr Lee from Fei Yue said the cost of respite care is similar to the cost of putting dependents in a nursing home.According to the AIC website, respite options are available to caregivers at senior care centres, nursing homes and at night for sundowning patients — where persons with dementia experience behavioural difficulties towards the end of the day.Prices for night respite varies according to the provider but the estimated cost is about S$80 to S$130 per night before subsidy. Meanwhile, respite options at nursing homes range from S$100 to S$150 a day while those at daycare centres, depending on the care recipient's condition and services required, range from S$400 to S$1,700 per month before subsidy. The rate at nursing homes is calculated daily, with the option available for a minimum of seven days per stay, and up to 30 days per year. Those with a household income of less than S$2,600 per capita may qualify for subsidies.Ms Yeo Wan Ling (PAP-Pasir Ris-Punggol), who was previously the chief executive of social enterprise Caregiver Asia, said that while there are efforts by the Government to increase the support to caregivers, many still find the cost and availability of respite services an issue.“For many sandwiched middle-income families, unsubsidised respite care is a significant cost, and information regarding the support available can be confusing as well,” she said.Ms Shailey Hingorani, head of advocacy and research for the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE), noted that family caregivers incur two types of costs: Direct cost related to caregiving, and cost from having to quit their jobs or take on less demanding and lower-paying work.In 2019, AWARE released its Make Care Count report which investigated the financial toll that eldercare took on family caregivers. It found that respondents who experienced a change in work situation because of caregiving suffered a 63 per cent loss in income. This translated to an average loss of S$582,572 over four years, or an average annual loss of S$56,877, said Ms Hingorani.  While there has been some progress in addressing the direct costs incurred, there is still no guarantee that caregivers are compensated for their loss of work. The Home Caregiving Grant introduced in 2019, for instance, comes with an option for the money to be granted to family caregivers but the decision to compensate the caregiver lies with the care recipient, she said. According to the AIC website, a care recipient who lacks the mental capacity to make decisions can appoint an individual — called the donee — to make decisions on his or her behalf. If the care recipient does not have a donee, the caregiver may make the application on the care recipient’s behalf. Industry players reiterated the need for more awareness of the support available for caregivers, especially when the various schemes offered by the Government and different agencies get constantly updated.  Ms Hingorani said the lack of clear information is one reason why many still face barriers in accessing formal care services. Pointing to AWARE's report, she added that caregivers often shared their frustrations navigating the current landscape of services, which was found to be “extremely fragmented”.“For a caregiver trying to find the best service for their care recipient, the onus is on them to seek out all available services and try to do a cost-benefit analysis on what works best for their situation — but there is no existing platform that compiles information on all types of services and providers,” said Ms Hingorani. She noted that AIC only provides information on subsidised services.While these gaps in the caregiving ecosystem have been a perennial problem, the pandemic has also brought to fore the issue of availability.Mr Seow said some of the concerns raised by caregivers include the difficulty in employing domestic helpers due to higher costs and travel restrictions.“They also shared about the long waiting list for subsidised elder sitting services, daycare centres and nursing homes. In such situations, caregivers looked to employers to grant more flexible working arrangements or support access to services,” he added.MP Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) noted that the capacity constraint in nursing homes and daycare centres, due to the placement of residents over an extended period, can make it difficult for caregivers to leave their family members there for a short-care period. A ""WIN-WIN"": TAPPING THE COMMUNITY NETWORK To increase accessibility, more resource centres could be set up islandwide, proposed Ms Ng Ling Ling (PAP-Ang Mo Kio). She had earlier also asked if the Government would consider expanding the new Alliance for Action, meant for caregivers who look after people with disabilities, so that it covers all female caregivers.To increase outreach, the referral process for caregivers across care nodes can also be strengthened, especially between acute hospitals and primary care providers, Ms Ng said.“If doctors or nurses notice that caregivers are struggling with the care of their loved ones, there should be a process that allows them to refer the case to AIC so that the care consultants can advise and work with relevant social service agencies to develop a care plan that best suits the needs of caregivers,” she said. On affordability of support for caregivers, Ms Tan proposed having a broader set of care options available within the community, at different price points, and exploring co-living options between different household types. To increase the availability of respite care, Ms Chan suggested that neighbours living nearby can volunteer their time to care for individuals at their homes if they are unable to or unwilling to go to another person's house. A residents’ network facility could also be opened to allow caregivers to send their elderly family members there for a few hours, she added. In a similar vein, Ms Yeo called for the creation of a community network of respite care providers. “For example, providing in-community micro-jobs to allow women, who are looking for jobs near their homes, to provide respite care services and thus, be able to earn extra income, thereby creating a win-win situation for all,” she said.Through such a network, caregivers can have easier and quicker access to the service without having to go through the typical formal applications which tend to require a longer lead time for approval, added Ms Yeo.EMPLOYERS PLAY A PART TOO Even as the community can seek to provide some solutions to the conundrum, there is a significant role that employers can play too — including integrating caregivers back into the workforce. Mr Teo noted that a scheme in South Korea trains and pays family members to deliver care to their own family.This could be implemented in Singapore as a scheme to professionalise caregiving as a career and tackle the manpower challenge that the sector has been battling, he said.This also allows the caregiver to remain in the workforce after the ward dies. Employers can also do their part to offer more support for working caregivers. AWARE's Hingorani said that there are currently no statutory requirements for companies to provide paid leave for caregiving for family members who are not the employee’s children. She noted that according to the MOM, only 20.3 per cent of companies offered paid family care leave in 2018. She also welcomed initiatives such as the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme, which can help caregivers attain retirement adequacy. Under the scheme, a contribution must first be made by CPF members or their family members before the Government matches it. But family members who are poor may not be able to contribute to one another’s accounts to benefit from the scheme, Ms Hingorani added. Labour MP Melvin Yong said prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, caregivers with young children or elderly parents often had to make the difficult decision to choose between caring for their loved ones and to outsource these caregiving duties and continue working.“Those that choose to become informal caregivers are often disadvantaged in their retirement adequacy as they are unpaid, or face immense challenges returning to the workforce once their caregiving needs end, as they have a long gap in their resume,” he added.However, the pandemic has caused a fundamental shift in the workplace culture, with many companies committing to make working-from-home and flexible work arrangements a permanent policy post-pandemic.This acceleration in the working from home phenomenon presents an opportunity to tackle these key issues that informal caregivers face and encourage more employers to adopt flexible work arrangements, said Mr Yong, who is also the MP for Radin Mas. “This will allow caregivers to concurrently work and care for their loved ones, without having to make the difficult decision to choose one over the other,” he added.For more news like this, visit todayonline.com.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

157,"'We are a misunderstood place': New MP Carrie Tan on Yishun, politics and her tattoos",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/carrie-tan-yishun-nee-soon-grc-mp-interview-14331782,07 Mar 2021 06:00AM,"In the second of an occasional series of interviews with new MPs who entered Parliament after the 2020 General Election, the PAP's Carrie Tan speaks about her journey from founding an NGO that helps lower-income women to entering mainstream politics.SINGAPORE: Nee Soon GRC Member of Parliament Carrie Tan was surprised to be invited in 2018 for tea sessions with the People’s Action Party (PAP) - a precursor to becoming a candidate for the party.The founder of Daughters of Tomorrow (DOT), a non-governmental organisation that helps lower-income women, felt that she had been quite critical of the Government. But she thought this would be a good opportunity to speak out for the underprivileged to the ruling party.“I feel like I need to help them understand certain things that I'm seeing, and certain issues that they may not have had the opportunity to deep dive into,” she said. “Every single tea session for me was an advocacy moment.”Along the way, she met different ministers and MPs, and became convinced of “their conviction and their intention to really do good by Singaporeans”, she said.One deciding factor was that when she spoke her mind, she felt that people listened.
 
“I think one of the key considerations I had was ... Do I have to be not myself? Do I have to kind of fit into a certain box in order to get onto this process? I was a bit sceptical,” she said. “But it was very encouraging, because every step of the way, I was very honest. I shared my views, and people listened, and they were receptive to what I had to share … (and) I guess in the end, I felt like: Can lah!”She said that in her years of trying to solve the issue of poverty, she had seen that the challenges low-income families face are “multi-faceted”.“Being in politics gives me a wider platform to take a more holistic approach to looking at some of the things that society needs to probably shift or change in order to provide better scaffolding and stepping stones for the poor among us,” she said.“WE ARE A MISUNDERSTOOD PLACE”Seven months on from the 2020 General Election, the Nee Soon South representative seemed quite at home at an Yishun Ring Road coffee shop having crispy prata and a barley drink. Sitting along a busy thoroughfare flanked by two coffee shops, the interview was interrupted a few times by residents saying “hi” to their MP.When Yishun’s reputation as a magnet for cat killers, murders, petty crime and bad news in general is brought up, she bristled: “I love Yishun, I love the people here. We are a misunderstood place, okay.“We have the most charming, loveliest people. So many do-gooders,” she effused, gesturing at the people having their dinner or drinks.“You see the coffee shop uncles. They will like from here shout across to there. It's very kampong, I love it.”She admits that there are residents who compare her to former MP Lee Bee Wah, who was MP there for 14 years, and was affectionately known as “Hua Jie” or “Sister Flower” among Yishun residents.“I think there's only natural and normal. There are different kinds of residents, some of them will compare and say: Hey, you know, last time Dr Lee used to do this this this, that that that ... I can learn from that,” she said.“Then there'll be other residents who say: Don't worry, just be yourself. We support you, just to do what you do.”A NEW SOCIAL ENTERPRISEThe little changes that Ms Tan has started to make can be seen in a banner with bright pink lettering advertising her weekly house visits. It reads “Bringing care to you on …” followed by the days and times, and the hashtag #Carriecares.At her division, Nee Soon South, she has changed the language of the reminder notices for residents that fall into arrears for conservancy charges.“We've adopted a much more supportive stance to say that if you're meeting any kind of financial hardship that's causing you to not be able to pay your bills, please reach out to us ... Don’t bear this alone,” she said. The town council is also making an effort to reach out to these residents to ask them if they need support, and referring them to support agencies, she said.Ms Tan, who has stepped down as the head of DOT, also plans to pilot a new social enterprise, called RISE Community, at Yishun. While she’s known as an advocate for women’s issues and gender equality, she now wants to reach out to men.“I spent five, six years of my life building up an engine to enable the women. This is like the next step where I'm looking to do more work to enable men,” she said.The details are under wraps, but she said the NGO will reach out to men who have lost their jobs or are in danger of losing them, to help them develop better coping mechanisms and create a supportive community for them.There are many initiatives for people to gain new skills and match them to jobs, but she thinks that the ability to embrace such opportunities requires a mindset change. “I think we underestimate the extent of mental emotional toil that poverty has on people. We expect them to just pick their feet and then ... find a job the next day.”More would be shared later this month when the initiative is launched, she said.When asked about her thoughts on the 2021 Budget that was delivered on Feb 16, she expressed concern about the fast pace at which Singapore’s economy is transforming.“Although it is necessary, I do find that we should consider putting more resources into helping those who are further behind at the lowest or lower income groups, who may find it harder to catch up,” she said.“I think that the cost of not mitigating the crisis that the lowest income groups are facing, that may come to bite us in the future, because then it will create consequences in terms of their mental, emotional and physical health.”ACTIVIST OR MP?With her salt-and-pepper hair, activist background and tattoos, Ms Tan is not in the usual mould of a PAP MP.When asked about her tattoos (there are three), she shared that the kite tattooed on her wrist symbolises “letting go”, and was inked in 2013, when she pivoted her social enterprise to a charity.“That was the best decision I made - to really scale up the work. Kite - you have to let go to fly further,” she said.Does she still see herself as activist or is she more of an MP these days?“These are just job titles,” she said as she listed her various roles these days as grassroots adviser, parliamentarian, Nee Soon town council vice-chair and continued involvement in her social enterprises.“At the end of the day, I'm serving the people, and I'm passionate about moving certain causes.”In the course of the conversation, she reflects that her views have evolved in the process of being initiated into politics and after talking to more people from different age groups, and with various cultural backgrounds and beliefs.“Being an activist, I can also sometimes have certain rather idealistic views about certain topics,” she said.“I definitely grew in my understanding and perspective of the diversity of opinions people have about different issues … having understanding and mutual respect in society is very important, and I think I have faith that in Singapore, we are a society where we can agree to disagree on things.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

Nearly one-quarter of these opportunities will be for people with disabilities.“Together, these will put us in good position to actively build resilience in our people and enable them to bounce back from the (COVID-19) crisis even stronger,” said Mr Masagos during the Ministry of Social and Family Development’s (MSF) Committee of Supply debate.The opportunities will be available for fresh graduates and mid-career job seekers.Of the 4,500 opportunities, 1,200 will be in the social service sector. It will include roles such as volunteer managers and traineeships as corporate service executives, social service assistants and programme executives.There will also be 1,100 opportunities within MSF, the National Council of Social Service and the Early Childhood Development Agency (ECDA). These include short-term job opportunities and social service traineeship opportunities. Some long-term job opportunities include volunteer management and outreach for Community Link.There will be nearly 1,000 job opportunities in the early childhood sector, including short-term jobs as safe management assistants in pre-schools. Longer-term jobs for mid-career workers include certified early child educators through the Professional Conversion Programme or Place-and-Train Programme for Early Childhood Care and Education.Job seekers can also apply for KidSTART-related positions such as home visitors and child enabling executives, as part of its expansion.KidSTART is a programme led by ECDA to help young children from low-income families have a good start in life. The programme supports parents with child development, coordinates support for families where needed, and monitors the developmental progress of children from birth onwards.INCLUSIVE SOCIETYFor people with disabilities, MSF and SG Enable aim to create 1,200 employment, traineeship and skills upgrading opportunities. Three new programmes will support 150 opportunities for a start. They are Place-and-Train programmes, Attach-and-Train programmes and Skills Development Programmes.People with disabilities who participate in these programmes will receive a 90 per cent course fee subsidy, which will provide between six and 12 months of support.ENCOURAGING CHARITABLE GIVINGMeanwhile, Mr Masagos also noted a five-year initiative called Change for Charity, which aims to encourage individuals to donate through their everyday consumption habits.The S$20 million Change for Charity grant was announced during this year’s Budget by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat. Under the initiative, the Government will fork out S$0.50 for every dollar customers donate through participating businesses’ payment platforms.Customers can donate via conversion of loyalty points to donations, or even direct donations at the point of payment, said Mr Masagos.And for every dollar that businesses match, the Government will give an additional S$0.50.Both types of matching will be capped at S$25,000 per business per year. Donations by businesses and customers will be eligible for three years of matching, starting from the year of implementation.A one-off Enabler grant will subsidise 50 per cent of the cost incurred by businesses when they adopt and enhance the giving capabilities on their payment platforms. This will be capped at S$10,000 per business.More details on the application process will be provided later.The Government will also extend the SHARE as One programme until FY2023 to “encourage greater giving”, said Mr Masagos. This programme provides dollar-for-dollar matching for any additional donations to Community Chest’s monthly SHARE programme.All donations through the SHARE programme go to social service agencies that provide “key social services and programmes” for children with special needs, youth at risk, adults with disabilities, people with mental health conditions, seniors and families, said MSF in a press release.INDUSTRY DIGITAL PLANTo help the early childhood and social service sectors digitalise, MSF and the National Council of Social Service are developing Industry Digital Plans for both sectors.“They will provide structured frameworks to help pre-schools and Social Service Agencies optimise resources and business processes. This will improve efficiency, support professionals in their work, and raise the quality of services,” said Mr Masagos.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

160,New workgroup set up to improve health of minority ethnic groups,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-workgroup-set-up-improve-health-minority-ethnic-groups-14341066,05 Mar 2021 05:47PM,"SINGAPORE: A new workgroup was set up last month to improve the health of minority ethnic groups, the Ministry of Health announced on Friday (Mar 5).The workgroup will first focus its efforts on the Malay community, before expanding to other minority ethnic groups.Speaking in Parliament during MOH’s Committee of Supply debate, Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam said: “We see significant disparities in health behaviours and outcomes across ethnicities and will be ramping up efforts in this area.”Last year, the proportion of Malays and Indians with diabetes was higher than that of Chinese, she said. For cancers, the Chinese consistently have the highest age-standardised cancer incidence rates, but the proportion of Malays among all cases of cancer has gradually increased over the decades, she added.MOH said in a fact sheet that Malays have the highest obesity rates, were more likely to be daily smokers compared to Chinese and Indians and have the lowest screening rates for chronic conditions or cancers.""This suggests that there may be cultural differences influencing lifestyles and health behaviours,” said MOH.Efforts will be focused on designing “culturally relevant” programmes and rallying the community against poor health habits, said MOH, adding that this will involve year-round healthy living activities.“We want the best approach to do things. It is not an attempt to single out anyone or any group. Our objective is to make sure that we encourage health for all,” MOH said.RATIONALE BEHIND ETHNIC FOCUSThe Health Promotion Board (HPB) said separately that over the years, the authorities have taken a “very much national approach, generally looking at health issues from the typical Singaporean’s point of view”.“We have made much progress in that, but (we) think that the approach has certain limitations and we recognised over time that there are specific, and especially cultural differences, even market differences in the way that, for example, that people consume their food,” HPB said.For the Malay community, HPB noted that one of the issues is the availability of healthy halal food.“You can imagine that if you work on the large-scale commercial providers for food, you’ll hit the majority population. You’re going to ignore the availability, for example, of healthy halal alternatives for the Malay population,” HPB said.Over the past two to three years, however, there has been “tremendous progress” in getting halal food sellers to offer healthier options, HPB noted, adding that this shows the benefit of a targeted approach for specific ethnic groups.The workgroup will be led by Ms Rahayu and Members of Parliament Dr Wan Rizal and Ms Mariam Jaafar.MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL-BEINGMOH on Friday also announced that a COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce set up by the ministry and the Institute of Mental Health in October last year will transit into an inter-agency platform by middle of this year. This task force will coordinate mental health and well-being strategies beyond COVID-19.“The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased stressors on individuals, such as fear of infection and loss of employment, and a greater need for mental health and well-being support,” MOH said.The task force was originally set up to look into the psychosocial impact of the pandemic on people, take stock of the mental health and well-being initiatives introduced across agencies to address the impact of COVID-19, and identify gaps that would need to be addressed to better meet the mental health needs of the population during this period.Following a review of the psychosocial impact of COVID-19 on the population, the task force recommended three areas to be addressed: Developing a national mental health well-being strategy to align and guide the work of various agencies; developing a national mental health resources webpage; and establishing a national mental health competency training framework to align and standardise training curricula on mental health in the community.The new inter-agency platform will oversee those three areas, as well as the development and implementation of mental health and well-being efforts, said MOH.MOTHERS AND CHILDRENMOH also announced it is developing a Child and Maternal Health and Well-being Strategy to “provide holistic and comprehensive support to women and their children to attain good health and well-being”.“The Strategy and Action Plan span the pre-conception phase to adolescents aged 18 years old and will help to support our young achieve their maximum human development potential,” said MOH.Mothers and children have been identified as a “key segment”, and the health of a child is “inextricably linked” to the health of the mother, MOH said.“The impetus for this is a shift towards a more population segment approach,” said MOH.“We decided in recent years that we need to look at (health issues) along population segments because different population segments have different needs.”An inter-agency task force has been set up to oversee the development and implementation of the five-year Strategy and Action Plan. It is chaired by Minister for Social and Family Development (MSF) Masagos Zulkifli, who is also Second Minister for Health.Speaking about this initiative in Parliament, Mr Masagos said that international research shows that the early years of life are a critical window for development, with lasting impact on later life outcomes.“This extends to even before the child is born, during the antenatal stage,” he said, adding that a local study found evidence that a mother’s health can directly influence her child’s development.These findings underscore the importance of intervening early in life, to prevent disadvantages from “snowballing”, and that parents play a key role to a child’s long-term development, he said.The task force will focus on issues that require multiple agencies to collaborate and address decisively, to achieve a common goal of better health, social and education outcomes for our young, he said.“We will review our service delivery processes to integrate our services better, across the domains,” he said.One of the issues the task force will tackle is enhancing upstream preventive health efforts for women and children, said MOH. This includes preparing young couples for parenthood and equipping mothers with skills and knowledge to foster good physical and emotional health for themselves and their children.The task force includes representatives from various Government agencies such as MOH, MSF, the Education Ministry, HPB as well as the three public healthcare clusters.The Strategy and Action Plan will be implemented in phases over the next three years. The first phase of the Action Plan is expected to be ready by early next year. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['MOH', 'HPB', 'Malays']",Singapore
161,New OneService app feature allows users to request social assistance for neighbours in need,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/oneservice-app-feature-help-neighbours-in-need-chatbot-14332508,04 Mar 2021 06:19PM,"SINGAPORE: Residents will be able to alert social service agencies to people in their neighbourhood who may require social assistance, using a new feature in the OneService app that is being piloted from the second half of this year, said the Municipal Services Office (MSO) on Thursday (Mar 4).The new Help Neighbour feature will enable residents to “be additional ‘eyes’ and ‘ears’ on the ground”, flagging cases of residents who may need social assistance, MSO said.The trial is a collaboration between the Ministry for Social and Family Development (MSF), MSO and the Agency for Integrated Care (AIC).Announcing the initiative in Parliament, Senior Minister of State for National Development Sim Ann said: “This is especially important during this pandemic, where residents may find themselves having fewer interactions with their usual social networks.”The feature will also allow AIC, MSF and their partners to reach out and locate these people more quickly, through geotagged data.There are four main groups who were selected for the pilot: Seniors in need, rough sleepers, cardboard collectors and tissue sellers.“These four groups were chosen as they are commonly highlighted by residents as requiring some assistance,” said MSO.Users submitting such requests will have to specify their concerns, which include the health, mental state, mobility, or living conditions of the person in need.They must also select the type of help they are requesting for, such as a welfare check, housing support or financial assistance.Users of the feature can also add other concerns or remarks, such as details of the person in need. After that, the feedback will be channelled to the relevant social agencies.This is among the latest improvements to the OneService app, which now has more than 340,000 users, up from fewer than 200,000 in 2019, said MSO.FASTER FEEDBACK OPTIONSAdditionally, the OneService Chatbot, which will be available on messaging platforms WhatsApp and Telegram from the second half of this year, will make it more convenient for residents to report municipal issues.The bot, which is currently on trial until Mar 28, will allow residents to submit feedback in a “conversational” way, MSO said.The chatbot will respond to users’ messages, guiding them along to identify the issue and prompting them to provide the required information in real-time.It will then automatically route the case to the agency in charge of the issue, using text, geolocations and images provided by the user.Ms Sim said that the OneService Chatbot, which is powered by artificial intelligence, can currently predict the case type and agency-in-charge with 80 per cent accuracy, and this is expected to improve as public trials continue.“This conversational reporting format complements the OneService App’s more structured reporting format,” Ms Sim said.In addition, MSO will also expand the pilot for OneService Lite, a QR-code reporting tool, to more neighbourhoods and in the vernacular languages. Residents can simply scan the QR code to submit feedback, without downloading the OneService app.It has been piloted with Aljunied-Hougang Town Council and Jurong-Clementi Town Council since February last year.This year, it will be rolled out in Mandarin with Holland-Bukit Panjang and Sembawang Town Councils at selected blocks with a higher proportion of Chinese residents.“We will study the outcomes before commencing subsequent pilots in Malay and Tamil,” MSO said.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

She pleaded guilty to three counts of receiving criminal proceeds, with another 16 charges taken into consideration.The defence said the mother of two wanted only to help others out as she is a devout Catholic, and did not take a single cent of the criminal proceeds. She also gave away large sums of her own money to the scammers and has had to take up two jobs despite retiring from a bank years ago and being given a golden handshake.Aw, who sobbed repeatedly throughout the hearing, befriended ""Vincent"" on Facebook in 2016. She later agreed to receive and remit money to him on his instructions.In December 2016, the police received a report against Aw's POSB account, as a victim alleged that they had transferred money to that account as a deposit for a loan that never materialised.When Aw was called up by the police for an interview, she was told that Vincent was a scammer and advised against helping him any further. The police also issued her a letter of advisory containing these instructions.However, Aw continued to help Vincent over 19 occasions, setting up an OCBC bank account to do so. The victims include people who had turned to loan sharks and were instructed to make repayments to Aw's account.One victim transferred S$100,000 in total to Aw after being scammed by a man who claimed he needed money to start a business. The prosecutor asked for nine months' jail, saying that the total amount involved across all charges was S$300,000, with at least six victims involved.Defence lawyer Cory Wong of Invictus Law asked instead for probation or a fine on his client's instructions, citing a medical report that said Aw had mild neurocognitive disorder and may be experiencing the onset of senile dementia.Mr Wong said Aw is ""gullible and suggestible"" and that the scammers used this to ""condition her into their unwitting money mule"".""There is no evidence to suggest that she pocketed a single dollar and lined her own pockets ... instead, the reality is - she herself lost a lot of money,"" said Mr Wong.He said she had received a golden handshake from her previous job for her retirement but has lost all the money. He said his client is ""a very pious Catholic"" who cannot bear to see people suffer in poverty.She has no previous convictions and now holds two jobs - at a restaurant and a hotel - to stay afloat, said Mr Wong.The prosecutor said the Institute of Mental Health had indicated issues with the medical report relied on by the defence, and added that it is not clear that Aw suffered from dementia at the time of the offence.She added that the prisons have indicated that ""they are able to care for any persons with medical and psychological conditions"".The judge said she had considered all facts including the plea of guilt, Aw's age and medical conditions, and her lack of financial benefit from the crimes. Nevertheless, the offences are serious ones, said the judge. She allowed Aw to defer her jail term till after Good Friday and to surrender on Apr 5.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

164,Mental wellness curriculum launched at polytechnics and ITE colleges,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-health-curriculum-polytechnics-ite-schools-moe-14322204,03 Mar 2021 05:29PM,"SINGAPORE: Polytechnics and Institute of Technical Education (ITE) colleges have launched a new mental wellness curriculum for all Year 1 students to raise awareness of mental health and encourage people to seek help early. Making the announcement at the Ministry of Education’s (MOE) Committee of Supply debate in Parliament, Minister of State for Education Sun Xueling said the institutes of higher learning are enhancing mental health support by strengthening programmes on mental wellness literacy and awareness. The polytechnics and ITE worked with the Health Promotion Board to launch the new curriculum for all Year 1 students from 2020 and 2021 respectively, she added. “The (autonomous universities) are also promoting mental wellness through briefings during freshmen orientation and university-wide programmes,” said Ms Sun. NEW CENTRE FOR CCEA new centre for character and citizenship education (CCE) will be established in the National Institute of Education, said Minister for Education Lawrence Wong in his speech on Wednesday. “This centre will work with schools to strengthen CCE learning, conduct relevant research and provide thought leadership. Our goal is for every teacher to be a CCE teacher, and we will provide them full support to achieve this,” he added. The centre for CCE will be launched by the end of 2022, Ms Sun said in her speech. MOE will also launch a second Centre for Teaching and Learning Excellence to allow teachers to train on site, “strengthening the nexus between research, theory and practice”, said Mr Wong. The first centre is currently located at Yusof Ishak Secondary School, and the new one will be established at New Town Primary School from this year, he added. ROLLOUT OF NEW CCE CURRICULUMBuilding on Mr Wong’s announcements, Ms Sun noted that the refreshed CCE curriculum has been implemented from this year, starting with secondary schools. The new curriculum, also announced at the 2020 Committee of Supply debate, has a stronger emphasis on mental health and cyber wellness education, she added. “Students will learn about topics like differentiating signs of stress and distress, and healthy habits for positive well-being,” said Ms Sun. “We recognise the nexus between increasing digital usage and mental health concerns, even more so amongst our young who may not know how to regulate their use of social media.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

This includes a dedicated website that provides resources and tools for caregivers.For families who need more assistance, an online counselling service was set up in April last year by the ministry and the Community Psychology Hub.This service helped more than 1,200 clients last year, Mr Chua noted.“We will continue to work together with other agencies and community partners to help parents better support their children’s mental health and well-being,” he said.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

166,Commentary: Phonecalls make some anxious but practice can give you confidence,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/phone-call-anxiety-social-disorder-mental-health-tips-therapy-14314604,03 Mar 2021 06:02AM,"The fear and avoidance of phone conversations is common among those with social anxiety disorder, says a psychologist.LONDON: Staying in touch with loved ones without seeing them in person has become even more important during the pandemic.But for some people, making or receiving calls is a stressful experience. Phone anxiety – or telephobia – is the fear and avoidance of phone conversations and it’s common among those with social anxiety disorder.Having a hatred of your phone doesn’t necessarily mean you have phone anxiety, although the two can be related. There are, of course, many people who dislike making or receiving calls.But if this dislike causes you to experience certain symptoms, you may have phone anxiety.Some emotional symptoms of phone anxiety include delaying or avoiding making calls because of heightened anxiety, feeling extremely nervous or anxious before, during and after the call and obsessing or worrying about what you’ll say.Physical symptoms include nausea, increase in heart rate, shortness of breath, dizziness and muscular tension.If you feel like this, you’re not alone. A 2019 survey of UK office workers found 76 per cent of millennials and 40 per cent of baby boomers have anxious thoughts when their phone rings.Because of this, 61 per cent of millennials would completely avoid calls, compared with 42 per cent of baby boomers. If you suffer from these symptoms, there are some things you can do to make it easier.AVOIDING PHONE CALLSTalking on the phone can be daunting because we’re limited to just the sounds of our voices. In the absence of all other social cues – including gestures, body language and eye contact – we can often feel self-conscious of the sound of our own voices and our choice of words.Thanks to technology, we can often go days, weeks or even months without directly speaking to others on the phone. One study found anxious people prefer texting over phone calls, rating it a superior medium for expressive and intimate contact.Some people opt for texting because it gives them time to think about the wording of their messages, providing the opportunity to be informal. In some cases, they develop a different personality separate and in contrast to their real-life, more reticent, self.Research also suggests phone anxiety is related to a preoccupation with what the other person thinks of them. By eliminating the immediate reaction of others in spoken conversations, text messaging may offer those with phone anxiety a way of making social contact without the fear of rejection or disapproval.Another reason phone calls can sometimes feel overwhelming is the pressure that comes with being someone else’s focus.In face-to-face conversations, we have several distractions in our environment; like gazing out of the window or, ironically, checking the missed call notifications on our phones. This can make the interaction feel more casual and the conversation flow naturally.On a call, there are no external distractions, so it can feel like the spotlight is on us to answer questions straight away.Pauses can feel extremely uncomfortable too. In person, you can see when someone is distracted or thinking but on the phone brief silences can feel awkward.We’re also becoming accustomed to being able to review emails, texts and social media posts before hitting the send button, so a phone conversation can feel impulsive and risky.PICK UP THE PHONEIt’s easy to put off or completely avoid calls when you’re feeling anxious, but the more you procrastinate, the worse the anxiety is likely to get.The good news is you don’t need to suffer in silence, or over text messages. There are several useful techniques that may help you break the pattern.One of the most effective ways to overcome phone anxiety is to expose yourself to more phone calls. The more you do it, the less overwhelming it becomes.It’s also likely that your phone anxiety is linked to a lack of experience. The more practice you have, the less anxious and more confident you’ll feel.You can start this process by making a list of the people you need to speak to on the phone, such as friends or colleagues, and go through each one by reflecting on what it is about the call that makes you anxious. For example, it might be making a mistake or feeling judged.When the call is over, acknowledging your success will help you stay motivated for the next call.If you’ve tried to combat your phone anxiety or you think you might benefit from seeking professional help, counselling is a great option and there are a number of talking therapies available.Cognitive behavioural therapy is a very effective treatment for social anxiety, and there’s an online option that might be a suitable alternative if you feel a bit nervous about speaking to someone in person.Ilham Sebah is Teaching Fellow in Psychology at Royal Holloway.

167,Commentary: Millennials aren’t the only ‘burnout generation’. Just ask the rest of us,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/millennial-burnout-work-stress-tech-social-media-mental-health-14287968,28 Feb 2021 06:44AM,"To frame frustration, anxiety and malaise as a “millennial problem” would be a disservice to other generational groups, says a business lecturer.SYDNEY: In her new book, Can’t Even, American journalist Anne Helen Petersen writes of how millennials have become “the burnout generation”.[It’s] feeling that you’ve hit the wall exhaustion-wise, but then have to scale the wall and just keep going. There’s no catharsis, no lasting rest, just this background hum of exhaustion.The book, recently released in Australia, builds on the viral essay Petersen wrote in 2019. At its heart, the book is a critique about the nature of modern workplaces and the modern economy.As Petersen recently told Vox, “There’s a feeling of instability that’s the baseline economic condition for many, many millennials, and it’s enhanced by these other components of our lives that make it harder to turn away from.”Petersen argues millennials, born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s, have come of age in a world where more and more of their time is being demanded by not just work, but by life.Technology means work follows us everywhere, at all hours, while leisure time happens (or is “performed”) on social media. Meanwhile, homes are turned into Airbnb rentals, cars become rideshare services.WHAT’S AGE GOT TO DO WITH IT?Peterson tells real and important stories about the frustration, anxiety, and malaise of herself and her contemporaries. However, she does us all a disservice by framing this as particularly “millennial problem”.While Petersen does acknowledge burnout impacts everyone, she assumes millennials are a concrete group of people whose experience of burnout is exceptional.The idea of clear generational groups, each possessing defining characteristics seems intuitive. It makes sense a group of contemporaries who had similar experiences in their formative years, would come to have similar attitudes, values, and beliefs.But many scholars are uncertain that the generational groups as we know them – such as millennials, Gen X or Baby Boomers – are as real or useful as we might think.Empirical research to prove generational groupings has produced “highly mixed and contradictory results”. So, many academics aren’t convinced birth-year groups even exist – there are too many variables.For example, if a 20-year-old today doesn’t follow office etiquette, is this a product of them being Generation Z? Or because this person is new to the workforce?More broadly, the majority of research about generations have been undertaken across Europe, North America, and Australia/Oceania. Given these three regions combined make up less than 18 per cent of the world’s population, it becomes clear how little we know.So, while the frustrations of Petersen and her contemporaries are real – it is important to emphasise they are something everyone is facing.BURNOUT A SOCIETY-WIDE ISSUEBurnout has historically been studied in relation to workplace stress, particularly where employees are in a caring role.It is defined by World Health Organization as(a) feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion; (b) increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job; and (c) reduced professional efficacy.But medical experts are starting to see burnout as a society-wide issue, particularly as people find themselves overwhelmed and fatigued by COVID-19.Similarly, mental health groups have identified burnout as a product of long-term, or chronic, stress.That is to say, scientists and support services are coming to understand burnout is not necessarily a product of the workplace specifically – but everything going on in someone’s life – from how much technology they use, to how many commitments they have.EVERYONE IS OVER ITIn 2020, who of us can say they aren’t feeling burned out?After a summer of bushfires, Australia had (and still have) a pandemic. For many, the boundaries between work and life have collapsed as we have needed to work, care, and relax at home – sometimes in the same room.COVID-19 has been accompanied by a seemingly permanent state of angst, as we all found ourselves doomscrolling for the latest updates. Many people have also lost income and job security.And more than 2 million people around the world have lost their lives.But it is not “just 2020”. The past several decades have seen huge changes to the way that we live, and engage with those around us.For example, social media has had a profound effect – and not always for the better in terms of our mental health.In the workplace, an “overtime culture” has blossomed. As of 2019, about 13 per cent of Australia’s workforce was working more than 50 hours a week.The rise in casual employment may have allowed for more flexibility, but it has increased insecurity – with no paid leave, and unstable work schedules.Here it is important to note, in 2020, those aged 15 to 24 made up less than 40 per cent of all casual jobs. While the casual workforce is skewed towards younger workers, the casualisation of the workforce impacts all of us.On top of all of this, we have seen rising levels of student and household debt, skyrocketing house prices, and the increasing effects of climate change.We all have plenty of reasons to feel bombarded by life.(One year since the pandemic, why do users, riders and restaurants alike still have complaints about food delivery apps? A business professor and a ride-hailing app founder weigh in on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:) SOLUTIONS TO BURNOUTSo, what do we do? It goes without saying, widespread burnout due to social, economic, and political forces in the middle of a pandemic is a complex problem to solve.At an individual level, resources do exist to help us address our mental health and support those around us.However, systemic change is far more complex. Academics and world leaders have suggested reducing the work week might be an important step. Though, as noted by Peterson, it’s no longer just work demanding our time, energy, and attention.As Peterson points out, one area that may need reimagining is how much and how often we consume information. Scholars in the 1960s were already raising concerns about the impact so much information could have on people, and in turn, society.We as humans are social and curious creatures, but how much news, connection and information is good for us?As Slate journalist Shannon Palus observes, Petersen deserves credit for identifying big problems about a culture that constantly asks for more access to every aspect of our lives.However, framing this issue as one belonging to, or uniquely impacting millennials is a trap. It encourages us to compare different generations to see who is the least or most burned out.Really, our attention should be devoted to working together to reduce burnout for everyone.Steven David Hitchcock is Lecturer in Work-Integrated Learning at the University of Sydney Business School.

168,Commentary: Conflict in families has more negative outcomes on children than divorce does,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/conflict-families-support-divorce-children-outcomes-14145216,27 Feb 2021 06:00AM,"There are no fixed formulas on how children are impacted by their parents’ marriages but there are common fault lines says social worker Cindy Ng.SINGAPORE: In our line of work, we have the opportunity to observe upfront some of the biggest stressors that families in Singapore go through.They run the gamut of financial hardship, family dysfunction and very commonly, conflict among spouses. Let me sketch out two such cases we have seen and what we can learn about how children are afflicted by conflict.The first is a woman called Lily. She was the oldest of three children and for eight years since she was a child, she witnessed violence that took place regularly between her parents in their four-room flat. Lily’s mother eventually divorced her husband. But Lily bore the scars of these years.Filled with resentment and anger, she stopped school at 12, ran away from home and eventually became pregnant with her boyfriend’s child when she was 17. But despite her difficulties as a single parent, Lily was determined to be a good mother to her child. She received help from a relative and raised the child on her own.She was also closely supported by her medical social worker when her baby was born, and her social worker from the Family Service Centre. Lily is now 24, in a stable marriage, works full time as a front desk executive in a hotel where she is a good friend to many at her workplace.On the surface of it, one would say that because she came from a broken family, Lily ended up being a dropout and an unwed mother. Yet, she has turned her life around, is gainfully employed and has a family. Would society consider her to have fared poorer than her peers from intact families?AN ALTERNATIVE NARRATIVEConsider then, the case of Siew Choo who approached our FSC after filing for a personal protection order against her husband. She was terrified of him as he had repeatedly threatened to abandon her, hurt her and commit suicide whenever she raised the possibility of a separation.As a result of his threats, Siew Choo remained married to her husband, and did not attempt to file a divorce. Their only child, Denise was privy to this constant conflict. But Denise was very bright and a perfectionist who scored straight As in school, all through to her junior college days.She attained a scholarship with a government agency and went overseas to further her studies.Denise met her partner there and decided not to return to Singapore to serve her bond.They married in the absence of family members and friends. But Siew Choo soon found out that Denise’s new husband exhibits controlling behavior. He limits her interactions with Siew Choo and her husband, and controls who she meets outside of their family.  On the face of it, Denise was smart, successful, a straight-A student but the truth is quite different.Both cases I’ve highlighted show that family dynamics are complex, multi-faceted and highly stressful. Despite the different family situations and outcomes, there is a common theme – the adults and children in both cases experienced a high level of conflict.FIGHT, FLIGHT OR FREEZEDuring a high level of conflict, the human body releases cortisol (commonly known as our stress hormone) which triggers a fight/flight/freeze reaction in us. After the danger or threat has passed, the cortisol level should calm down.However, when individuals are subjected to prolonged and chronic episodes of stress, the body’s most important functions can be derailed. The CDC-Kaiser Permanente Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE) Study, one of the largest investigations on the impact of childhood abuse, neglect and household challenges on later-life health and well-being, suggests that such experiences can be linked to chronic health problems, mental illness, and substance misuse in adulthood.During her teenage years as a young mother, Lily often complained about having difficulties sleeping, and recalled having panic attacks at night, especially when she was alone at home.Those occurrences made it difficult for her to concentrate in the day when she had to either care for her young child or focus at work.The CDC-ACE Study also reports that children growing up with toxic stress, a common consequence of exposure to adverse childhood experiences, may have difficulty forming healthy and stable relationships. Siew Choo shared frequently about how isolated Denise was while she was in school.She believed that Denise experienced a high level of anxiety in social interactions all through her life. One wonders if there is a direct link between what Denise has witnessed in the home to her current difficulties in relationships.How did Lily overcome her sleep and mental health issues to be a stable mother to her child today? How did Denise’s social anxiety pave the way for a controlling relationship with her now abusive husband?SUPPORT IS CRITICALIt becomes obvious that their current life situation is influenced not just by the decisions their parents made about their own marriages. Lily’s life experience also suggests that with sufficient support from informal and formal systems, it is possible to recover from adverse early childhood experiences, or making poor decisions early on in our lives.The lives of Lily and Denise suggest that perhaps it is not the parents’ marital status that predisposes a child to poorer outcomes. Instead, dynamic factors such as exposure to high levels of conflict between parents, poorer support systems for single parents and the social stigma attached to a child in a divorced family may have greater impact. The solution then is not to reduce divorces in families. Rather, it is to provide quality mediation and counselling services for all families, improve support systems for divorced families, and make a conscientious effort to reduce the stigma attached to divorce in our society.Perhaps the challenge is for us as a society is to shift our focus away from saving marriages for the sake of it to creating an ecosystem where parental conflict can be reduced or managed and when there are children who exhibit poor outcomes, they are not written off and instead supported, helped and healed.Cindy Ng is former Director of MWS Family Service Centres and a trained social worker with many years of experience.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

170,"Day 2 of Budget 2021 debate: MPs discuss supporting women, youths, sustainability and fiscal position",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/budget-2021-debate-women-youths-sustainability-fiscal-position-14281758,25 Feb 2021 11:39PM,"SINGAPORE: Members of Parliament (MP) on Thursday (Feb 25) discussed issues involving women, youths, sustainability and Singapore’s fiscal position on the second day of the Budget 2021 debate.In particular, they suggested how to better support women, hear youth voices, preserve parks and forests, and balance Singapore’s coffers, as the Government looks to revive its economy amid the global COVID-19 pandemic.The Government has already spent nearly S$100 billion in five Budgets over the last financial year to help Singapore cushion the impact of COVID-19, racking up a deficit of S$64.9 billion or 13.9 per cent of GDP, its largest since independence.Minister of State for Social and Family Development Sun Xueling (PAP-Punggol West) said on Thursday that COVID-19 has brought challenges to women, including increasing the stress of caregiving, financial instability or the risk of violence.SUPPORTING WOMENWhile Parliamentary Secretary for Health Rahayu Mahzam (PAP-Jurong) praised this year’s Budget for helping sectors with a high representation of women and addressing their immediate concerns, she acknowledged some gaps that need to be worked on.“Gender bias and stereotypes and the disparity between men and women continue to exist,” she said.“That is one of the reasons why the Conversations on Women’s Development was started, to encourage a whole-of-society discussion on this to nudge behaviours and call for changes that benefit not just women, but the whole community.” The conversations, launched in September last year, seek to take a comprehensive look at issues that impact women at home, workplaces, schools and the community.Mdm Rahayu said these efforts are ongoing, with “much still to be done” to spark meaningful change in mindsets and systems “so that our boys and girls in the future have equal opportunities to pursue their full potential”.Moving on to women caregivers, MP Joan Pereira (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) called on the Health Ministry to better support caregivers of those with mental conditions, pointing out that Singapore’s rapidly ageing population would lead to more age-related mental health cases.“They need better access to information and guidance with care navigation,” she said.Ms Pereira urged the Government to train and upgrade more mental healthcare professionals to support persons with mental health issues as well as to help maintain the caregivers’ own mental health.“We must provide career counselling, guidance and training for caregivers who would like to start or return to work, including part-time and flexi-work,” she added.Ms Sun said women often play important roles as caregivers in families, noting that the Government is increasing its annual spending on the early childhood sector to more than S$2 billion per annum within the next few years.“These efforts help women, by giving women real choices, as they give women peace of mind should they decide to go back to work when they have a young child,” she said.As part of the Conversations on Singapore Women’s Development, Ms Sun said the Government has conducted 31 sessions and engaged more than 1,700 individuals so far, including youths, working mothers, homemakers, women leaders and men.“Many women and men have shared feedback on how women can be supported in the workplace and in their career aspirations, such as having more women in corporate leadership positions and putting in place formal and informal mentorship and networking platforms for women leaders to support and learn from each other,” she said.Ms Sun highlighted the Council for Board Diversity (CBD) as one platform that looks into having more women on boards.The CBD promotes “sustained increases” in the number of women on boards of SGX-listed companies, statutory boards and Institutions of a Public Character by encouraging organisations to be more diverse and proactively identifying and grooming potential board-ready women, she said.“Our women leaders play key roles in our IPCs, as leaders or board members,” she stated.LISTENING TO YOUTHSeveral MPs also urged the need to pay youths more attention. For one, Nominated MP Shahira Abdullah noted that this group is concerned about issues such as job security, sustainability and mental wellness - often taking to social media to voice their opinions.“Youth have a lot to say and contribute … It still seems like many would like to see the Government take note of their views and opinions, acknowledge that they have listened and show how their participation has helped to shape future policies,” said Ms Shahira.She also noted the strong potential of youth in the Malay community, citing this group’s strong desire to contribute to society.“We need to tap on our promising Malay youth bulge. I believe that the Budget should try to further leverage on this by providing more platforms to develop their leadership potential and volunteer with the community,” she added.When it comes to helping youths facing adversities, MP Rachel Ong (PAP-West Coast) pushed for a “consistent long-term mentoring programme” amid the social and family development ministry’s plans to expand its Community Link, or ComLink programme.She said that in her experience, consistent mentoring lasting at least a year has proven itself to be the most effective form of intervention.Three main benefits of such a programme are: Giving youth the assurance they are not alone; helping them recognise their value; and helping them break “self-limiting beliefs”, she said.“My hope is that through ComLink, long-term mentoring will be of easy access for our 10- to 16-year-olds to effect mindset growth and a healthier worldview,” she added.Building on the topic of mental health, Parliamentary Secretary for Social and Family Development Eric Chua (PAP-Tanjong Pagar) said a key issue is “to help youngsters suffering silently from mental health issues to normalise help-seeking”.“For our youth, whether they're coping with home-based learning or transitioning from student to working adult life, the pandemic has only made an already stressful rite of passage even more daunting,” said Mr Chua.SUSTAINABILITYMoving on to the environment, MP Dennis Tan (WP-Hougang) welcomed that the Government was aiming to plant a million trees by 2030 under the Singapore Green Plan, but called for greater legal protection for secondary forests.He said that while activities that may damage trees within nature parks are regulated, the mechanisms by which these activities are regulated as well as the penalties for contravention are “much less robust than those applicable to areas designated as nature reserves in the same law.Mr Tan pointed to the recent erroneous clearing of forested spaces in Kranji Woodlands as a “prime example”, where the offending contractor has “gotten away” with a stern warning and developer JTC has not faced any legal consequences so far.“The Workers’ Party thus reiterates our call on the Government to commit to providing more secondary forests with greater legal protection, with some of these areas regulated as nature reserves, while simple recreational areas could be allowed in other areas, but with more stringent rules and penalties than is currently enforced in public parks,” he said.“By legislating to this end, Parliament will send a clear signal to not only future generations but to various actors including contractors, ministries and statutory boards, and the Government itself that the destruction of forested areas will come at a cost.”MP Hany Soh (PAP-Marsiling-Yew Tee) also welcomed the 1 million trees target, saying that it will provide natural infrastructure that cools the environment, improves air quality and provides more places for families to bond and stay active.“With that said, I believe that there is a dire need for us to ensure that our parks and the facilities within them remain a safe environment of all users,” she said.On Feb 18, a 38-year-old woman died after she was trapped under a fallen tree at Marsiling Park. The National Parks Board (NParks) said the 20m-tall Araucaria excelsa tree was last inspected in April last year and found to be healthy. She suggested that the Government adopts measures such as selecting suitable trees and plants, locating planting areas away from crowded areas, and has “strict” maintenance regimes to check the health of trees periodically.“At the same time, I also hope that NParks will work with the grassroots committees to organise more awareness workshops, sharing tips on how to recognise potential hazards in parks and what to do when a park-related accident occurs,” she added.“Together, we can work as a community to prevent any unfortunate accidents from happening.”FISCAL STRATEGYA number of MPs also sought clarification about the country’s fiscal strategy and position, as Singapore dug into its past reserves for a second consecutive year to fund Budget measures.MP Cheryl Chan (PAP-East Coast) expressed concern over national spending, asking if Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat will be outlining how and when these amounts would be returned to the coffers.She said that such spending is presently justified, but cautioned against thinking of the Budget as an “annual rite” with “goodies”, for instance.This is especially so against a backdrop of tighter government revenue and escalating costs, she said.“It is important that we first try to think how to stretch our existing resources, our every dollar, instead of cultivating a mentality that we have a reserve to dip into,” Ms Chan said.On the topic of borrowing, some MPs asked about the Government’s plans to issue bonds to fund major, long-term infrastructure under an upcoming legislation, the Significant Infrastructure Government Loan Act (SINGA).MP Saktiandi Supaat (PAP-Bishan-Toa Payoh) asked about the likelihood - in a worst case scenario where the borrowing limit is hit - of making an exception to the principle that a government will not pass a funding deficit to the next.In the name of inclusivity, Mr Saktiandi also suggested allowing the public to invest in any future green bonds or long-term infrastructure bonds by the Government.Meanwhile, MP Jamus Lim (WP-Sengkang) mooted extending the maturity of SINGA bonds to 50, or even 100 years.“This would lock in the currently very favourable low rates for a much longer period, as befitting truly long-term projects,” said Associate Professor Lim.He also suggested benchmarking the speed of debt issuance against prevailing growth conditions. One warning sign, he said, is when the interest rate begins to consistently outpace growth rates.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

But, because of the evidence that was available, it was then brought down to culpable homicide, under Section 304A of the Penal Code,"" Mr Shanmugam said.""That is extremely serious and as we know, the prosecution is asking for life sentence whereas (the) defence is saying 14 years.""Myanmar national Piang Ngaih Don was punched, stamped on and starved by her employer until she weighed 24kg days before she died in 2016 from a brain injury. She was about a year into her first job in Singapore.  Employer Gaiyathiri Murugayan, 40, pleaded guilty on Tuesday to 28 charges, including culpable homicide, voluntarily causing grievous hurt by starvation, voluntarily causing hurt by a heated substance and wrongful restraint. Another 87 charges will be considered in sentencing.The High Court heard that she suffered from major depressive disorder and obsessive compulsive personality disorder, both of which substantially contributed to her offences. She qualified for the defence of diminished responsibility, which resulted in the murder charge being downgraded.On why Gaiyathiri's case took some time to be addressed in court, Mr Shanmugam said it is a complex homicide case involving a large number of offences.""Lots of CCTV footage were looked at in formulating the charges. There were numerous psychiatric assessments undertaken by different experts from IMH (Institute of Mental Health) as well as experts engaged by the defence in order to assess the mental state of Madam Gaiyathiri at the times of the offence,"" he told reporters.""Psychiatric assessments took considerable time. They were only completed in April 2020.""Mr Shanmugam added that it is “not easy” to gather independent evidence in such cases. “The (victim) has passed away. And you will only have the word of the people who are accused, or related family members,” he said.""Nevertheless, because of the very thorough work that was undertaken and the availability of the CCTV cameras, the evidence that was put forward, and the assessment of the psychiatric evidence, both prosecution and defence, Madam Gaiyathiri decided to plead guilty to a charge of culpable homicide.""Mr Shanmugam also expressed “complete abhorrence” over the case of abuse, saying that the “bestiality” of Gaiyathiri’s conduct was “shocking”.“Ordinary people are capable of extreme evil, and evil lurks in people who seem ordinary,” he said.“There are two pillars in any society to keep evil in check: One is education. Two, we need rule of law that keeps such evil in check. The law has to come down with full force when the rules are broken.”The penalties for culpable homicide not amounting to murder are life imprisonment and caning, or up to 20 years' jail, a fine and caning. Women cannot be caned.Gaiyathiri’s mother Prema Naraynasamy, and husband Kevin Chelvam are also accused of playing a role in Ms Piang Ngaih Don’s death. Their cases are still before the courts.Chelvam, a police officer, has been suspended from the force since 2016. He was charged with offences including causing grievous hurt, beating Ms Piang Ngaih Don with a bat and lying to the police to conceal evidence. Mr Shanmugam said Chelvam will face disciplinary proceedings after his criminal case is heard, no matter the outcome.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

172,"Man gets jail for trying to kill girlfriend, biting off her earlobe in 'vicious' public attack",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/chen-jianhua-stabbed-girlfriend-biting-off-earlobe-14262152,23 Feb 2021 01:25PM,"SINGAPORE: After suspecting that his girlfriend was lying to him about her job and thinking she had ""cheated"" him of the money he spent on her, a man stabbed his hostess girlfriend before biting off her earlobe.China national Chen Jianhua, 32, was sentenced on Tuesday (Feb 23) to five-and-a-half years' jail after pleading guilty to three charges of attempted culpable homicide not amounting to murder, criminal intimidation and trespass to commit theft. A fourth charge of stealing the victim's items was taken into consideration.The court heard that Chen was working as a cook while the victim, 38-year-old China national Ye Yuhuan, worked as a host at a ""flower joint"" or entertainment spot in Race Course Road.They lived in the same hostel - each in their gender-assigned areas - and became friends on chat app WeChat in February 2019. Chen began buying Ms Ye gifts and helping her out financially. Although they were not physically intimate, they regarded each other as boyfriend and girlfriend, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Dora Tay.Around July 2019, their relationship took a turn for the worse as Chen began suspecting that Ms Ye had been lying to him. He was suspicious of the nature of her job scope and tailed her when she refused to give him the exact location of her workplace.On the night of Jul 7, 2019, Chen broke into Ms Ye's hostel room and stole her luggage bag. After forcing it open, he found a China train ticket and a Singapore disembarkation card with Ms Ye's particulars.He was shocked to find out that the victim had lied about her age when she was really seven years older than him. He stole her phone and red packets containing S$800 as he felt that he had spent too much money on her and wanted to recoup some cash from her.When returning Ms Ye's bag, one of her roommates saw Chen and complained to the landlord that he had entered the women's room.Chen confronted Ms Ye over WeChat, accusing her of cheating him of his money and lying to him. He tabulated all the past expenditure he had made on her and demanded that she pay him back for it.He threatened to hurt Ms Ye and said they would die together if she did not pay him his money back. In his messages to her, he said that he wanted her to repay the money in full even if she had to sell herself, or they would ""die together"".After a few days of quarrelling, Chen bought a ceramic knife at a supermarket intending to stab Ms Ye if she insisted on reporting him for theft, as she had found out about the luggage bag.After a dispute at their hostel, Ms Ye was evicted by the landlord and moved out to stay with a friend. She did not respond to Chen's multiple calls chasing her for payment.On Jul 11, 2019, after Chen contacted Ms Ye's relatives in China to complain about her and said he would look for her at her workplace, Ms Ye filed a police report for theft and harassment.When an investigation officer called Chen about the police report, he was enraged and called his family in China to say he had been cheated. His mother advised him not to do anything stupid, but he went to look for Ms Ye with the knife in his pocket.HE FELT PREPARED TO KILL HER AND BEAR THE CONSEQUENCESHe felt he was prepared to kill her and die himself if he was later punished by the law, and was willing to bear the consequences of killing Ms Ye.He spotted Ms Ye with a friend at a mobile phone shop in Race Course Road and confronted her about the police report. Ms Ye told him it was not possible to change what she had already told the police and tried to walk away.While Ms Ye's friend was walking ahead on the pathway, Chen took out his knife, pulled Ms Ye to him and stabbed her in the front in a downward motion. At the same time, he bit off the victim's earlobe and spat out the torn flesh with an earring still embedded in it.Because of his forceful stabs, the ceramic knife blade broke into two pieces. The victim struggled and began bleeding profusely before collapsing as Chen held her.When he saw her bleeding, Chen felt he had been too impulsive and threw the knife into nearby bushes before calling the police. The attack had been witnessed by many people in the area, with several calling the police as well.Paramedics and police officers responding to the scene found Ms Ye lying in a pool of blood. Chen turned himself in and showed the police where he had thrown the knife, and the police recovered the weapon along with the bitten-off earlobe before arresting Chen.The victim was taken to hospital with a severed earlobe, a 6cm-long laceration at the back of her neck, a 15cm-long laceration in her back and multiple slashes on her hand. She was warded for seven days and given 14 days' hospitalisation leave, with her injuries assessed as unlikely to be life-threatening.Her wounds are not expected to result in permanent disability, although some visible scars might remain. Her earlobe was reattached with surgery but she suffered cosmetic disfigurement.SUFFERED FROM ADJUSTMENT DISORDER THAT CONTRIBUTED TO OFFENCEChen was assessed at the Institute of Mental Health and found to be suffering from adjustment disorder at the time of the offence, which contributed to the crime. He was suffering from an abnormality of mind that substantially impaired his mental responsibility for the acts.Deputy Public Prosecutor Dora Tay asked for at least five years' jail, adding that the prosecution were not seeking caning due to the diagnosis of Chen's adjustment disorder.She said the offence was premeditated, especially in the act of buying a knife beforehand, and the victim's injuries were serious. Chen bit off the victim's earlobe entirely, showing the viciousness of the attack, said Ms Tay. The assault also took place in public and caused a lot of disquiet, as shown by the numerous phone calls the police received.In mitigation, lawyer Chung Ting Fai, who had been assigned the case under the Criminal Legal Aid Scheme, agreed that five years' jail was sufficient.He said his client soon realised he was too impulsive and called the police. He also helped the victim to stop the bleeding by pressing on her wounds with his hands before the paramedics arrived, and surrendered when the police arrived.Justice See Kee Oon said significant force was used in the attack, which was committed in full public view and cannot be said to be an impulsive act.""I do not accept that the attack was committed purely on the spur of the moment,"" said Justice See. ""Crucially, the accused came to his senses quickly and relented.""He added that Chen's actions reflected ""genuine remorse and assumption of responsibility"". He considered that Chen had pleaded guilty and was a first-time offender, with the acts assessed as being ""out of character"" and with an impairment of his mental responsibility due to his disorder.For attempted culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Chen could have been jailed for up to 15 years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these punishments.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

173,"Hurting the hands that heal: Cases of abuse, harassment of public healthcare workers on the rise",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/healthcare-workers-abuse-harassment-cases-increase-singapore-14237158,23 Feb 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: Amir* was trying to stop a patient from leaving his ward when a punch landed on his left cheek so hard that his nose started bleeding.""I was shocked,"" said Amir, a health attendant at Singapore General Hospital (SGH) who said he had not experienced anything like this in his 15 years on the job.  Describing the incident in January, Sheila*, a nurse who helped Amir with the patient, said the man got agitated when there was a delay in the discharge process and he tried to leave without his medication.Healthcare workers were aware that the patient had mental health issues when he was admitted for an acute medical condition.""After he punched him, he (the patient) was also stunned,"" Sheila said. ""He just stare(d) ... and kept quiet, doing nothing. He did not continue to be aggressive or violent.” The hospital's security officers were called in.As for Amir, he went to the accident and emergency department where an X-ray and scan showed that he was fine. He told CNA in a phone interview that he has since put the incident behind him.With patients who have a known history of mental health issues, Sheila said she and her colleagues will be more careful not to trigger them. And while she has never been physically assaulted, she said such incidents are ""quite common"". ""Physical abuse happens because patients are not in the right state of mind,"" she said.UPWARD TREND IN CASESSuch incidents are not unheard of among public healthcare workers. Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said in a written reply to a parliamentary question earlier this month that based on data from public healthcare institutions, the number of abuse and harassment cases increased from 1,080 in 2018 to 1,300 last year.Over the same period, the number of such cases involving on-duty public healthcare workers that were reported to the police under the Protection of Harassment Act increased from 40 to 58.In line with the numbers, SGH has seen an increase in the number of abuse cases faced by frontline employees, said the hospital's chief communications officer Jennifer Wee. In SGH alone, there were nearly 200 cases last year, almost three times the number in 2016.Common reasons behind intentional abuse and harassment are unreasonable demand for extra services such as requests for staff members to purchase carbonated drinks or give preferential treatment, Ms Wee said, noting that there are also cases of unexplained aggression where there was no obvious provocation.Ms Wee said that some forms of such abuse and harassment include shouting and threatening, and physical abuse like pushing and hitting. Victims are typically frontline staff like doctors, nurses, as well as healthcare assistants and attendants, especially those involved in direct patient care, she said. SGH said that when its employees find themselves in an abusive situation, they will seek immediate assistance first from colleagues nearby.“The supervisor is then informed and if it is safe to do so, the supervisor would approach and talk to the angry patient or next-of-kin. In the event that they cannot be calmed or reasoned with, and staff safety is at risk, our security will be alerted,” said Ms Wee.“In most cases, our security officer or team will assess the situation first. In cases where the abuser cannot be calmed or reasoned with, or when staff and patients’ safety is at risk, we will call for police intervention.”ABUSE BY OLDER PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA, BEHAVIOURAL PROBLEMSAt Alexandra Hospital (AH), physical assault cases are common when it comes to older patients with dementia and behavioural problems, said senior nurse clinician Pauline Chong.“These groups of patients may have impaired thought processes whereby they are unable to express their needs or discomfort. They tend to get frustrated and physical aggression may set in when their basic or emotional needs are unmet,” she said. These needs include thirst, hunger and toileting. They are unable to respond well to unfamiliar people in a new environment as they lack a sense of security, she noted. Nurses are also verbally abused by patients who refuse to cooperate and insist on going out of their wards to smoke despite being at risk of a fall, she added.“In the course of our work, sometimes, we may come across patients who exhibit aggression or depression-triggered emotions. We have come across extreme cases who abuse our nurses verbally or throw them a punch or spit at them,” she said.“Nurses under such circumstances may feel discouraged and down when they encounter such patients,” she added, noting that it is important during induction and refresher training to educate nurses on psychology and human behaviours.Ms Chong said that AH makes the distinction between patients who are angry, aggressive and depressed and those who are mentally ill, under stress or experiencing anxiety.“These patients who live alone, have no next-of-kin support, and often, elderly with dementia, face entrenched social complexities which go beyond medical issues,"" Ms Chong said. ""We may refer one to a clinical psychologist of the care team of the hospital, and if psychotherapy and medication do not work, our care manager will try to find the source of the patient’s behaviour triggers before they are escalated.""It is not just the patients that nurses have to deal with. Visitors have also responded to restrictions on visitation with threats, Ms Chong said.She added that sometimes, abuse may also come from next-of-kin. “They may put forth unreasonable demands, pass sarcastic remarks, issue threats or talk down to nurses,” Ms Chong said.The Health Minister said in his parliamentary reply that frontline healthcare staff are trained to assess and de-escalate potential conflicts in the first instance and manage abusive situations.There are also measures in place to support those affected.""This includes helplines for affected staff, anonymised counselling support services on and off campus by institutions and community providers, and peer support programmes for staff,"" Mr Gan said. ""Members of the public are reminded through prominently displayed signages to treat our staff with respect and dignity, and that any form of verbal or physical abuse of our staff will not be tolerated.""* The names of the SGH employees have been changed at the request of the hospital to protect their identities as they may need to continue interacting with the patient in future.

175,Commentary: Our unhealthy ideas about work are worsening our workaholism problem,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/work-addiction-life-balance-employer-hours-burnout-mental-health-14171724,21 Feb 2021 06:43AM,"People with work addiction are driven to work excessively, despite the detrimental impacts this has on their health, wellbeing and relationships, says an occupational therapy professor.CARDIFF: As a culture, we’ve come to value growth and productivity, making paid work not only a necessity, but a central concern in peoples’ lives.Yet this attitude towards work is harming us more than it’s helping, with research showing that workaholism (also known as work addiction) is a growing problem in the industrialised world. And according to the findings of a recent study, work addiction is linked with poorer mental health.Work addiction is a clinical condition characterised by an obsessive and compulsive interest in work. People usually work more than they’re required to, either by the workplace or because of financial need.Other characteristics include being concerned about their performance at work, rigid thinking and perfectionism, which is often projected onto others.People with work addiction are driven to work excessively, despite the detrimental impacts this has on their personal health and wellbeing, and relationships.People at risk of developing work addiction often have low self-esteem, experience doubt about their performance at work, or have obsessive compulsive personality traits.WHY SOME PEOPLE DEVELOP WORK ADDICTIONNumerous studies have shown the negative impact of work addiction on mental health. But a recent study on workers in France investigated why work addiction happens to better understand the impact it has on mental and physical health.The researchers looked at a total of 187 workers from a range of different occupations and demographics, who were asked to answer four different questionnaires.They found that high work demands and people who worked in high pressure roles – for example managers with greater responsibilities – were the most significant factors contributing to the risk of work addiction.Where this was accompanied by working longer hours than required and having an obsessive approach to work, there was an even greater risk of developing work addiction.Women were also shown to be more predisposed to developing work addiction than men. Although it’s not entirely clear why women were more likely to develop work addiction, other research has had similar findings.Workers with depression were twice as likely to develop work addiction compared to those without a mental health issue. Poor quality of sleep, high levels of stress and low levels of overall wellbeing were also identified as high risk factors.Although this study’s sample size was small, previous research has also shown that work addiction is associated with depression, stress, sleep disorders and lower mental health. Burnout and exhaustion were also reported.NEED FOR A CULTURAL SHIFTWork addiction is more common in industrialised countries where work performance is a measure of success. This suggests that neoliberal ideas about work are influential in increasing the risk of work addiction.These ideas place pressure on intensifying workloads and performance at work in order to promote economic growth. They also focus on increasing a person’s responsibilities at work.Given the harms of work addiction, radical changes in both workplaces and society will be necessary. This would require society to stop viewing work as a pivotal tool of performance and growth, and instead place greater value and importance on the health and wellbeing of the worker, both individually and collectively.Support and change can actually happen in the workplace itself, which is why it’s important for employers to recognise and address work demands in a positive way. For example, one study has found that increasing job security and opportunities for development lowered the risk of work addiction.Other studies have suggested that work-life balance interventions could reduce the risk or work addiction. For example, if workplaces actively reduce working hours in order to give employees a chance to spend more time with their family, it can actually result in better work performance.And, fewer working hours may also reduce family conflict for workers, as employees are able to engage in family time more meaningfully.Promoting work-life balance has also been shown to increase both physical and psychological health, and personal resilience for workers. Balancing time and energy used on work and personal life helps people feel better – subsequently both improving mental and physical health.SEEKING SUPPORTAll this suggests that workplaces should develop work-life balance initiatives, provide opportunities for career development and increase job security to prevent work addiction from happening. These changes may also lower stress and absenteeism while improving performance.But not all workplaces have these kind of strategies in place – and they can be hard to implement because of our culture’s focus on performance and economic growth.If you’re concerned you have or are developing work addiction, address the problem now if possible.Seek support at work by talking to managers and peers if you can, ask for performance feedback, or even see if there is a way you can work to reduce some of your working hours.Speaking to mental health and wellbeing services can also help. If you don’t have support in your workplace, try talking with friends and family, and ask for their help in refocusing your time – such as having them remind you to take breaks from work.Of course, better work-life balance will help, but this can be a very hard thing to do as it requires adjusting daily patterns and changing how you think and feel.But if you’re able to balance work with other activities – such as seeing family and friends, exercising, or enjoying hobbies – your mental health and wellbeing will improve.Teena J Clouston is Professor in Occupational Therapy, Life Balance and Wellbeing at Cardiff University.

Sometime later, Mr Roslan approached Rosli and suggested that they co-rent Mr Roslan's flat.They registered their names with the Housing and Development Board as co-tenants and agreed to split the monthly rent.Despite having a roof over his head, Rosli began suspecting in August 2017 that Mr Roslan was overcharging him for his share of the monthly rent.At the same time, Mr Roslan had ended his relationship with a married woman who Rosli regarded as a sister and had known for more than 10 years.The relationship soured after the woman fractured her knee but Mr Roslan did not take her to hospital. Instead, her husband tended to her.When Rosli visited the woman, she complained to him about her unhappiness with his flatmate. Rosli then told her he was unhappy over the rent and wanted to stop sharing the flat with Mr Roslan.THE MORNING OF THE INCIDENTAt about 1am on Aug 16, 2017, a few guests went to Rosli and Mr Roslan's flat to watch a movie. However, Mr Roslan began arguing with Rosli at about 4am.They quarrelled about rent payments and utility bills, while two of the guests were still in the flat. Angered, Rosli walked to the kitchen, where he picked up a kitchen knife with a 17cm-long blade, said prosecutor Mr Yang.He allegedly went to the living room and stabbed Mr Roslan with such force that the blade penetrated the breastbone and perforated a ventricle in his heart.Mr Roslan tried to fend off the attack, said Mr Yang, but received multiple wounds on his arm and thigh. The two guests fled the unit, hiding at a stairwell and in another flat.Mr Roslan struggled down four storeys of stairs and collapsed on a grass patch in front of the block. A bus driver who was on his way to work saw him covered in blood and coughing before he dropped his head on the grass.She called the police and waited for them to arrive. Paramedics could not find Mr Roslan's pulse and pronounced him dead at 4.55am, while the police followed the trail of blood that ended up in the flat.Rosli had already returned to the flat, closed the gate and door, and cleaned up - washing the knife in the sink and cleaning the blood stains with a piece of cloth - said Mr Yang.After this, he left the flat with bags of clothes, personal belongings and drugs, avoiding the police by taking the stairs.He was arrested later that day at another block in the area.An autopsy on Mr Roslan found three stab wounds to his body, with the wound to the heart causing his death. IMH DOCTOR FOUND HIM FIT TO PLEADRosli was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health and found to be fit to plead and not of unsound mind at the time of the offence. He admitted to the doctor that he had taken nitrazepam around the time of the offence, but the doctor found that this had not significantly influenced his mental state.In accounts to the doctor, Rosli said: ""I thought he would never die. I wanted to teach him a lesson. I did not intend to kill him."" Separately, he told the police that he wanted to use the knife to hurt Mr Roslan as ""I was angry with him (for) cursing my mother"", and that he lost his patience reasoning with him.""I only wanted to injure him to teach him a lesson. I have no intention to kill him,"" he repeated.The prosecution will lead with evidence from 56 witnesses in the trial, while Rosli is represented by a team of lawyers led by Mr Anand Nalachandran. If convicted of murder, Rosli could either be sentenced to death or imprisoned for life. He cannot be caned as he is 51.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

179,Commentary: Your PE teacher’s secret headaches during a year of COVID-19,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/pe-lessons-teachers-covid-19-primary-school-secondary-education-14145286,13 Feb 2021 06:00AM,"COVID-19 had challenged physical education teachers in designing meaningful activities for students. It has also exposed and helped clear up public misperceptions of what PE entails, says NIE’s Chow Jia Yi.SINGAPORE: Despite the disruption wrought by COVID-19, the pandemic has been a massive learning moment of interest to us educators.Compared to many other countries, we should count ourselves fortunate our children had their learning minimally impacted, in part, thanks to a nimble education system and teachers who worked hard to find innovative ways to engage the children even during the circuit breaker.This is no mean feat. Our educators had to re-think and re-design pedagogical practices leveraging technology to sustain and even to some extent, enhance teaching and learning across the school curriculum.Credit too goes to parents at home, playing part time IT support and part time supplementary teacher.Yet in this, one subject stands out: Physical Education (PE). COVID-19 has challenged PE teachers in designing meaningful lessons and ensuring the goals of PE are still intact even as classes are transformed.  CHALLENGES BROUGHT ABOUT BY COVID-19More than any other subject, the teaching of PE has been challenged by this pandemic.Throwing and catching an object to oneself is different compared to learning in a pair or in small, socially distanced groups, both of which became impossible during the circuit breaker.Home-based Learning (HBL) took away the critical platform for students to see one another physically and robbed us of the mainstay of team sports to teach PE. HBL also posed the big challenge of sustaining attention when children have shorter attention spans.Over Zoom, teachers have had to pay attention in order to intervene to check on student progression and tailor activities according to each child’s proficiency level.What has been lost goes beyond the element of play, when PE aims to reinforce decision-making and problem-solving, through physical activities and games.Collaborative skills in fair play, teamwork and lessons of sportsmanship that could have been developed with physical communication when playing and interacting with their peers was also absent during HBL.The result is the loss of learning in exercising and developing the muscle as well as the mind for such psychomotor and leadership skills.   Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:MAINTAINING THE GOALS OF PE IN THE FACE OF COVID-19Most people tend to have poor, rudimentary ideas of what PE is about and how it contributes to a child’s development.Many have in mind an image of PE as having our children run around a field. The PE educator is often seen as the Regimental Sergeant Major dictating instructions for the session.This cannot be further from the truth. PE lessons have evolved from the days where physical fitness overwhelmingly is the chief goal of PE.Today, the objective of effective PE programmes is to spur the holistic development of an individual in the major domains of learning: Psychomotor, perceptual, cognitive and affective so our children can enjoy a lifetime of active, healthy living.In Singapore, one key goal is developing a child’s range of fundamental movement skills (throwing, catching, hopping, running, bouncing a ball) that supports their participation in a variety of lifestyle activities.But in this, PE is not about getting our children to repeatedly practise kicking a ball to get some sort of a correct form.Rather, effective PE is about providing opportunities for our students to move, develop self-awareness along with agility, endurance and strength and make good-decisions to enjoy physical activity in and out of school. The aim is to develop a healthy level of physical fitness that also strengthens mental health and general well-being.ADJUSTING TO THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC: THE NEW NORMALOne can imagine when COVID-19 struck and when our PE teachers had to quickly transit into HBL, the impact on the way our children acquire movement skills, knowledge and values was huge.Especially challenging was the fact that the venues where PE lessons were conducted – i.e., school fields, indoor sports halls, the swimming pools or even the neighbourhood parks - were now inaccessible.Technology kicked in, as PE lessons shifted online to platforms like Zoom and Google Classroom or lessons delivered through the Student Learning Space (the nationwide digital platform for interactive teaching and learning) where asynchronous learning could take place.For example, students could record themselves on video, learning or being involved in physical activities (e.g., like aerobic exercises, basic strength conditioning) at their own time even beyond the fixed lesson slots and post it online for evaluation.Individual learning with home-made equipment or minimal need of equipment became the order of the day for HBL PE lessons (for example, using towels as objects to throw with the laundry basket as a target).Even after moving out of the circuit breaker and back in schools for face-to-face lessons, PE teachers had to think out of the box to adhere to strict physical-distancing measures to conduct lessons, requiring new activities to be designed.There was greater emphasis on individual learning activities where students were provided with their own physical space during PE lessons to develop fundamental movement skills.I have personally witnessed how students were assigned to small groups for every PE lesson and what the constraints on mingling among groups posed, as a teacher educator and mentor to student teachers in the National Institute of Education.More time also had to be allocated at the start and end of each lesson to allow students to clean the equipment used and to observe strict personal hygiene.This was disruptive yet necessary. In retrospect, this essential exercise may have had aided the PE curriculum, as it reinforced lessons of developing good habits. It also heightened the importance of collective safety, with PE providing the platform to exercise taking personal responsibility for the common good.PE has not been divorced from the varied impact on groups of students. Some students were excited by the opportunity to don their PE attire and experience PE lessons in the confines of their homes while being active together with their classmates via online platforms. Some with smaller homes were not as fortunate.So it is no surprise that even with the new safe distancing restrictions, most students were thrilled to just get out to the courts and fields during PE lessons when they returned to school.INNOVATION AS A WAY FORWARD: PEDAGOGY LEADING THE WAYPE lessons today continue to be very different compared to pre-COVID-19 days. We probably are some time from returning to that state.It is not ideal but PE teachers demonstrated grit and adaptability across the island in rising to meet these challenges and leveraged technology to engage students.While technology has shown new possibilities of doing old things during this global pandemic, we should also be aware that there are still learning experiences that technology cannot fully substitute - i.e. the role of an educator and especially one in the context of PE.Perhaps this coronavirus will unleash a new PE pedagogy that harness the fresh potential technology offers.After all, the sole use of technology had constrained PE lessons at first but as educators designed lessons for the channel, the tide turned.Chow Jia Yi is an associate professor at the Physical Education and Sports Science Academic Group, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

180,Commentary: Implications of ‘long COVID’ mean faster vaccination programmes needed now,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/mutation-variant-stain-vaccination-faster-long-covid-symptoms-14111894,05 Feb 2021 06:09AM,"We need to spend whatever it takes on wartime-style mobilisation to make, distribute and inject vaccines, says the Financial Times’ Simon Kuper.LONDON: When I listen to scientists talk about where we might be a year from now, two main scenarios emerge.The first one is good: COVID-19 keeps circulating but loses its sting. Most people in rich countries, and the most vulnerable in developing countries, get vaccinated in 2021.The vaccines prevent disease caused by all strains. COVID-19 weakens. Once it finds potential victims protected either by vaccination or past infection, it becomes at worst a nasty cold.“The most likely thing is that it will mutate into a more benevolent form. That may solve the problem,” says Anthony Costello, a former director at the World Health Organization.But there’s another scenario, less likely yet so momentous that we need to think it through: The world gets “long Covid”.Vaccine-resistant mutations cause years of mass death, repeated lockdowns, economic disaster and political dysfunction. What determines which one comes true?COVID-19 WEAKENING THE LIKELY OUTCOME BUT LONG COVID PLAUSIBLEPrecedent favours the benign outcome. “Four human coronaviruses ...  circulate endemically around the globe; they cause only mild symptoms,” write Jennie Lavine of Emory University and others in the journal Science.These viruses may once have been deadly too, until humans acquired protective immunity through infection in infancy. When people were reinfected as adults, their immune systems knew how to fight back.COVID-19 may make that same journey much faster, with vaccines hastening herd immunity. Even as mutations emerge, previous vaccines and infections should confer enough immunity to protect us at least from severe disease; some existing vaccines seem to be handling the British and South African mutations.In this benign scenario, poorer countries can wait for vaccines, as their young populations aren’t very vulnerable to COVID-19. (More than half of African people alive today were born this century.)Yet the malign scenario remains plausible, says Costello. New variants have appeared fast. Philip Krause, chair of a WHO working group on COVID-19 vaccines, told Science: “If it is possible for the virus to evolve into a vaccine-resistant phenotype, this may happen sooner than we like.”It may be happening now in the Brazilian city of Manaús: Devastated by the first wave of COVID-19, it’s being devastated again, possibly because victims of the first wave aren’t immune to the new strain.Vaccine-makers could probably rejig them to combat new strains but it might take months. Then countries might struggle to summon millions of recently vaccinated people back for more jabs.And new vaccines might be only 50 per cent effective, like the flu vaccine. We also don’t know how long vaccines will provide immunity against COVID-19. Will people return for booster shots?INFECTIOUS MUTATIONS NEED HIGHER IMMUNISATION RATESWorse, highly infectious mutations have raised a country’s bar for achieving herd immunity. Getting there might now require vaccinating 78 to 95 per cent of people aged over 12, warns the consultancy McKinsey.Some will refuse vaccination. Meanwhile COVID-19 keeps circulating and mutating, especially in poor countries.By mid-January, 29 low-income countries combined had vaccinated just 55 people, all in Guinea, said the WHO.Ian Goldin, professor of globalisation and development at Oxford, sees a more likely scenario than global long Covid: a new pandemic.He notes the growing frequency of pandemics this century, as habitats of animals and humans become compressed, and global travel increases transmission.A PANDEMIC LASTING YEARSImagine a pandemic that lasts years, killing millions. Whole sectors — tourism, restaurants, the arts, aviation, conferencing — could collapse. So might democracies, as isolated people mainline conspiracy theories in their bedrooms.Bankrupt states would helplessly print money. The jobless young might grow up unequipped to deal with people off-screen.Many would rebel against lockdowns, fighting the forces of order. The mental-health pandemic would rage beyond control.A few countries — New Zealand, Australia, Taiwan, Vietnam — would become oases besieged by would-be immigrants from everywhere else. Between deadly waves, people would seek relief in the wildest experiences.To avoid global long Covid, states need to hurry. The quicker humanity achieves herd immunity, the less time the virus has to mutate beyond control.We need to spend whatever it takes on wartime-style mobilisation to make, distribute and inject vaccines. Costello calls for a “Home Guard” of contact tracers and vaccine promoters, including retired doctors and nurses.We also need to get vaccines to poor countries fast. The Covax facility — meant to ensure fair global distribution of vaccines — is fighting hard to reach 27 per cent of people in lower-income countries this year, in the face of underfunding and hogging of supplies by rich countries.Covax’s funding target for 2021 is US$6.8 billion. Compare that to the cost of a week’s lockdown in a rich country.In total, says Goldin, “Rich countries have found US$12 trillion for themselves, but only $100 billion has been pledged to developing countries.”“No one is safe until everyone is safe,” Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, the WHO’s director­general, has warned. People in rich countries tend to dismiss such pieties.We’ve learnt from experience that we can be safe even while pandemics decimate the world’s poor.

182,Commentary: Vaccines have been oversold as the pandemic exit strategy,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-vaccine-rollout-variant-herd-immunity-uk-14052058,28 Jan 2021 06:08AM,"Vaccination programmes must be accompanied with an unrelenting focus on suppressing the virus, says The Financial Times’ Anjana Ahuja.LONDON: Logistics permitting, about 15 million people in the UK will have received at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine by some time in February. Provided the second doses are delivered in a timely manner, this should keep the most vulnerable out of hospital.This milestone will not, however, push the UK much further towards normality. We do not yet know if the vaccines curb transmission, though it is reasonable to hope they might. Most working-age people are unlikely to receive a first dose before summer.Even if the elderly can savour a newfound freedom, it is unclear why unprotected individuals should be expected to head back to non-essential workplaces, especially amid concern about a deadlier variant.Given that vaccines have been sold as the main exit strategy come spring, some serious expectation management is now required – together with an unrelenting focus on suppressing the virus.VACCINATIONS INSUFFICIENT FOR HERD IMMUNITYOne source of gloom emerged at a briefing last week. Academic researchers warned vaccination alone might not induce sufficient herd immunity to stamp out the virus.An unhappy combination of imperfect vaccine efficacy, suboptimal take-up and super-infectious variants could derail attempts to reach the herd immunity threshold, when R falls below one and the virus begins to dissipate. Modelling from the University of East Anglia corroborates this unpalatable possibility.Another major worry is that countries with poorly controlled transmission might be acting as production lines for dangerous new variants. While current vaccines work against high-profile variants including B.1.1.7, now dominant in the UK, this good fortune might not last.One variant, first documented in South Africa, shows some resistance in the laboratory to neutralising antibodies, scientists reported in an unreviewed research paper last week.Moderna also said that its vaccine might not be as effective against this variant and has started developing a new formulation that could be given as a booster in the autumn.The key genetic mutation responsible has also been clocked in a Brazil variant. Yet another has been linked to a surge in California, where 3 million cases have been recorded.BEHIND THE COVID-19 VARIANTSResearchers have previously suggested that immunocompromised patients who suffer lengthy infections might act as Petri dishes for such irrepressible strains.But there may be a plausible alternative hypothesis, according to Tulio de Oliveira, a bioinformatician at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. He co-authored the paper on the South African variant and contributes to the World Health Organization’s Virus Evolution Working Group.His tip-off led UK scientists to more fully investigate the B.1.1.7 variant.“We had an open discussion in the group recently about why these variants were emerging independently in so many places,” Prof de Oliveira says.“We noticed a common factor about London, the Eastern Cape [South Africa] and Manaus [Brazil], where these three variants appeared: They were very heavily affected in the first wave of infection.”That first wave, the hypothesis goes, produced lots of people with antibodies that then gradually declined over time. In the second wave, some previously infected individuals who re-encountered the virus lacked sufficiently potent immunity to prevent reinfection or kill the virus quickly.VACCINATION MUST GO HAND-IN-HAND WITH VIRUS SUPPRESSIONIn effect, Prof de Oliveira says, a person with waning natural immunity might play the same role as an immunocompromised patient. If regions with raging transmission do act as breeding grounds for resistant variants, then failing to control spread will prolong the pandemic.Prof de Oliveira stresses that Taiwan, China, Australia and New Zealand, which have chased elimination, are the role models to follow.“This should be a wake-up call for all of us to control transmission, not just in our own regions but globally. This virus will keep outsmarting us if we don’t take it very seriously,” he says.That means not just vaccinating but fast testing, accurate and quick contact tracing, quarantine and isolation.In short, vaccination must go hand-in-hand with virus suppression, not become a substitute for it. A successful vaccine rollout will count for little if the country then becomes a crucible for resistant variants.Over the past year we have given the virus many inches and it has taken many miles. Even mild infections can result in “long COVID”, characterised by fatigue and breathlessness that linger for months.The pandemic is also creating a secondary epidemic of trauma among survivors and carers. Countries with rampant transmission are saddling themselves with a chronic health burden, both physical and mental, for decades to come. Excellent vaccines are, thankfully, reaching millions of arms, but suppression remains a crucial part of the endgame.Listen to experts break down the behind-the-scenes considerations and discussions going into what might be Singapore’s biggest vaccination programme ever:Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

184,Commentary: New US-China relations has to combine competition with cooperation,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/reset-us-china-relations-politics-economic-cooperation-14044666,27 Jan 2021 06:02AM,"Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, both chastened by four years of Trumpian disruption, have a real chance to reverse the course of bilateral relations, say experts.HONG KONG: Donald Trump has left the White House, but Trumpism has not left US politics. With Joe Biden as America’s president, the world hopes that the United States will shift away from Trump’s disruptive confrontational approach toward China relations and embark on a path of pragmatic engagement.At stake is whether this crucial bilateral relationship serves to strengthen or shatter the global order.Trump and COVID-19 have together provided painful but essential tests of both national well-being and the concept of an interconnected global order.Trump viewed globalisation as a hindrance to America’s national aspirations. But the pandemic proved that we live in an interconnected global society.Systemic threats like the pandemic are beyond any country’s power to resolve. If we neglect the health and livelihoods of the world’s poorest, the coronavirus will mutate and come back to haunt us, even in the richest walled-in community.Trumpism stood squarely against this reality, embracing the view that only nation-states or the elites who control them can address global problems.That “partialist” assumption is also shared by conventional defence and security strategists, who typically take national primacy for granted, resulting in zero-sum outcomes like the so-called Thucydides Trap.THE SUM OF MANY PARTSBut all threats to human security arise endogenously from the interaction of the world’s parts. As the ecologists Fritjof Capra and Pier Luigi Luisi observed in their 2014 book The Systems View of Life, “the major problems of our time are systemic problems – all interconnected and interdependent.”Accordingly, “they require systemic solutions”. Yet, systemic solutions fall into collective-action traps, because the parts will not work together to solve the problems of the whole.Ecologists are not nationalists, because they recognise that the whole is more than the sum of the parts.In 1981, the American futurologist R Buckminster Fuller pointed out that humanity was treading a “critical path” between mutually assured nuclear destruction and extinction caused by a warming climate.Forty years later, the world is running out of time to address rising temperatures and sea levels, increasingly frequent and severe natural disasters, and widening man-made inequalities.Thankfully, Trump showed that partialist solutions do not work. America First is America Alone. No country, even one as mighty as the US, can manage domestic crises without the resources that can come only from a global economic recovery.Chinese policymakers have learned from bitter experience that their country cannot solve global problems on its own, either. For example, China’s 2009 reflation, which helped the world recover from the 2008 global financial crisis, resulted in huge domestic costs.Whereas partialists divide the world into countries, classes, and creeds, globalists realise that man and nature are one. Humanity is more than one class, race, or creed, and there may be no perfect solution to a partial problem, only continuous hard work on what matters for all.GETTING OVER A MENTAL DIVIDECould recognising and trying to bridge this mental divide be the key to mutual understanding between the West and China?In his book A History of Civilizations, the great French historian Fernand Braudel quoted the French sinologist Marcel Granet. “The Chinese are either superstitious or practical, or rather they are both at once,” Granet said. “It is this ‘both at once’ that a Westerner often finds hard to grasp.”Some Western thinkers have of course understood such dualities. The economist Joseph Schumpeter, for example, observed that markets derived their dynamism from entrepreneurial “creative destruction"".This “both at once” worldview suggests that partial, linear, zero-sum, and monist perspectives misunderstand today’s interconnected global society. America worries that China may usurp global leadership, while China is concerned that the US is blocking its modernisation.This dynamic has fueled rising insecurity in the world’s two biggest economies, creating potentially fertile ground for further confrontation, and even a military conflict.The real question is not what the Chinese call “Project Hope” – a wish list that cannot be realised – but rather how best to manage the tough trade-offs needed to deliver the peace and prosperity that all the world’s people want.The pandemic convinced the Chinese that their country’s one-party system, however imperfect it may be, learned and adapted faster in combating the disease than an America poorly managed by Trump did.In fact, the Communist Party of China now treats global competition and criticism as a form of policy feedback. In some ways, this makes the rest of the world a de facto “opposition party” pushing the CPC to maintain its performance and legitimacy.This strategic realism has enabled China to move forward with a number of new forms of international engagement, including the new Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership  (RCEP) trade pact, the Comprehensive Agreement on Investment with the European Union, and China’s pledge to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2060.China’s so-called “dual-circulation strategy” is a signal to Biden that Chinese leaders are open to strategic cooperation in tackling climate change, addressing the pandemic, and restoring global trade and investment so that each country has more resources to address domestic inequalities and imbalances. In the real world, cooperation and competition can co-exist.Both the US and Chinese governments must start to understand that such an approach is the only way forward to foster sustainability and resilience. And, like in all conversations, the first step can set the tone.Presidents Biden and Xi Jinping, both chastened by four years of Trumpian disruption, have a real chance to reverse course.Listen to Prof Chan Heng Chee and BowerGroupAsia Managing Director James Carouso explain how America came to be so deeply divided amid a bitterly fought election on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast episode published in November 2020:Andrew Sheng is Distinguished Fellow of the Asia Global Institute at the University of Hong Kong and a member of the UNEP Advisory Council on Sustainable Finance.

185,3 arrested over protest against transphobia outside MOE building,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/moe-transphobia-protest-3-arrested-student-hormone-therapy-14045320,26 Jan 2021 11:44PM,"SINGAPORE: Three individuals were arrested on Tuesday (Jan 26) evening after a protest was held against transphobia outside the Ministry of Education (MOE) building. In response to queries by CNA, police said late on Tuesday night the three, aged between 19 and 32, were arrested for allegedly taking part in a public assembly without a permit. At about 5pm on Tuesday, a group of five had ""allegedly staged a protest” outside MOE headquarters along Buona Vista Drive with placards stating “#FIX SCHOOLS NOT STUDENTS”, “WHY ARE WE NOT IN YOUR SEX ED”, “HOW CAN WE GET A’s WHEN YOUR CARE FOR US IS AN F”, “trans students will NOT be erased” and “trans students deserve access to HEALTHCARE & SUPPORT”, said the police. The group did not have a police permit to carry out the public assembly, and when the police arrived, only three individuals remained. “The police warned them to cease their activities as they were liable for offence under the Public Order Act. However, they ignored the police’s warning and continued with their activities,” said the police. “The group was then issued with a ‘Move-on’ direction under Section 36 of the Public Order Act and were told that they would be arrested if they failed to adhere to the direction. The three refused to comply despite the police’s repeated warnings, and were arrested under the Public Order Act at around 5.35pm.”Five placards, two multi-coloured flags and a blue bag were seized in relation to the case. The three individuals were released on bail at about 10pm and investigations are ongoing, said the police. Earlier on Tuesday, Community Action Network SG said in a statement that a group of students and supporters were planning to stage a protest at 5pm on Tuesday, calling on Education Minister Lawrence Wong to ""end discrimination against LGBTQ+ students by MOE schools"". They also intended to call on Mr Wong to ""uphold the fundamental rights of all students to education within a safe and supportive school life"".In the statement, the protesters also urged the education ministry to acknowledge and apologise for ""the harm done by schools to LGBTQ+ through their schools' discriminatory practices"". Earlier this month, a student wrote in a Reddit post that MOE had prevented her from obtaining a doctor's referral letter to begin hormone therapy.The ministry denied these claims two days later, saying it was ""not true"" that it had interfered with the student's treatment and inviting the student to approach the school to ""clarify and discuss how the school can support his schooling better"". On Jan 21, MOE released a joint statement with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), saying that the final decisions on the use of hormone therapy ""rest with clinicians and their patients"". ""Such treatments also require the written consent from parents (where minors are concerned),"" said MOE and IMH.  ""Within the school setting, the schools work closely with IMH and the parents to support these students, and to maintain a conducive learning environment.""In this case, the school is committed to providing the education support the student needs to graduate, including via home-based learning.""According to the student, who only wanted to be known as Ashlee, she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019 and notified the school’s management of her diagnosis in March 2020. She was then asked to confirm this via a letter from her IMH psychiatrist, she told TODAY. The letter was reportedly given to the school and MOE the same month, and the education ministry told her through the school that it would work with her to understand her diagnosis and make school conducive for her. But when she was to proceed with hormone replacement therapy in August, she was informed by the psychiatrist that MOE had told the doctor to consult the ministry before any decision could be made regarding treatments for transgender students, Ashlee told TODAY. Because of this, she has not received the letter to begin hormone replacement therapy, she said. Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

186,Commentary: We are living in a golden age of ignorance,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/ignorance-internet-conspiracy-theories-technology-trump-donald-14020182,23 Jan 2021 06:01AM,"Diversions, political polarisation and conspiracy thinking have all contributed to this new era, says the Financial Times' Tim Harford.LONDON: Has there been a moment in modern history where so many people in free societies have believed such damaging lies?It’s easy to point to the US, where nearly 90 per cent of people who voted for Donald Trump believe Joe Biden’s election victory was not legitimate.No surprise, then, that there is considerable support for the recent violent attempt to prevent the democratic transfer of power.SLOWING DOWN VACCINE ROLLOUTBut it’s not just the US. In France, a minority of adults are confident that vaccines are safe, which explains why only 40 per cent say they plan to get a COVID-19 shot.This hesitancy also goes some way to explaining why France’s vaccine rollout has started so slowly.Meanwhile, across the world, substantial minorities believe that the COVID-19 fatality rate has been “deliberately and greatly exaggerated”. The proportion of COVID-19 deniers is 22 per cent in the UK; in many other countries, it is even higher.How did it come to this? The simplest explanation — to repurpose a phrase from former US Treasury secretary Larry Summers — is: “There are idiots. Look around.” But while there is a certain visceral satisfaction in that explanation, there is much more going on.‘AGNOTOLOGY’ AND DISTRACTIONRobert Proctor, a historian, coined the term “agnotology” to describe the academic study of ignorance. He became interested in the phenomenon after studying Big Tobacco’s all-too-successful effort to seed doubt about the scientific evidence on the risks of cigarettes.Proctor once told me “we are living in a golden age of ignorance”. That was in 2016; the golden age had barely started to dawn.Three elements of it are worth highlighting — none of them entirely new.First, distraction. It’s possible for people to spend hours every day consuming what is described as “news” without ever engaging with anything of substance.Some distractions are obvious: doing the sudoku will not help you understand the implications of the post-Brexit trade deal, and neither will gazing at pictures of celebrities.At least such diversions are marketed thus. Others are more insidious.Consider “scotch-egging”, the oddly British pastime of arguing over whether a particular activity (driving to beauty spots to go for a walk, cycling in east London when your home address is in Downing Street, treating a scotch egg as a “substantial meal” with your drink in a pub) does or does not violate the letter or the spirit of pandemic rules.Scotch-egg stories are emotionally salient and easy to understand, and superficially they seem to be about important matters of public health.But they suck attention away from the real questions: How can I live life while protecting myself and others? When I cast my vote, does the government’s response deserve praise or blame?POLITICAL TRIBALISMSecond, political tribalism. In a polarised environment, every factual claim becomes a weapon in an argument.When people encounter a claim that challenges their cultural identity, don’t be surprised if they disbelieve it.It is obvious that political polarisation might shape our beliefs about questions of politics (do you approve of Boris Johnson’s handling of the pandemic?) and government (was the US election fair?) and policy (should we provide a universal basic income?).But it also shapes our beliefs about apparently unrelated scientific questions, such as whether humans are causing dangerous climate change, or whether the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is safe.Logically, the answers to these questions should not skew left or right — but they do.THE HPV VACCINE CASEThe HPV vaccine is a fascinating example. A team of researchers at Yale’s Cultural Cognition Project concluded that many Americans had sharply different views about HPV compared to the hepatitis B vaccine (HBV).What explains the difference? They tended to learn about HBV from their doctors, while they learned about HPV from cable news.Not everything is polarised — but almost anything can be polarised, and it will be if a prominent political or media figure sees advantage in doing so.Distractions stop us from paying attention to what matters, and political tribalism makes us reject evidence that casts our tribe in a bad light.Combine the two, add steroids and you get the third element of the age of ignorance: conspiracy thinking.Conspiracy thinkers devote enormous mental energy to extracting meaning from trivia. Overwhelming evidence can be dismissed as fake news manufactured by the conspiracy.BANISHING IGNORANCESo can ignorance be banished? It isn’t easy.David McRaney, creator of the You Are Not So Smart podcast, and Adam Grant, author of Think Again, each offers similar advice: Don’t lead with the facts. Instead, establish rapport, ask questions and listen to the answers.(Needless to say, this is much easier in a real-life conversation than on social media.)You won’t be able to bully someone out of fringe views, but sometimes people will talk themselves around.This is wise advice, but my own recent work has a more modest goal. Instead of trying to enlighten someone else, I suggest that each of us starts with our own blind spots. We are all distracted.We all have tribes too: Social if not political. We are all vulnerable, then, to believing things that aren’t true. And we are equally vulnerable to denying or ignoring important truths.We should all slow down, calm down, ask questions and imagine that we may be wrong. It is simple advice, but much better than nothing. It is also advice that is all too easy to ignore.Listen to Prof Chan Heng Chee and BowerGroupAsia Managing Director James Carouso explain how America came to be so deeply divided amid a bitterly fought election on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast episode published in November 2020:Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

187,IN FOCUS: How a year of COVID-19 changed Singapore forever,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-pandemic-singapore-one-year-on-coronavirus-14004318,23 Jan 2021 06:00AM,"A year after Singapore reported its first COVID-19 case, CNA examines how the pandemic has changed the country.SINGAPORE: It may seem like a lifetime to some, but it was precisely a year ago that Singapore reported its first COVID-19 case.On Jan 23, 2020, the Ministry of Health (MOH) said it had confirmed one imported case of ""novel coronavirus"" infection in Singapore. At that point, the virus didn't have a name.The case was a 66-year-old man from Wuhan who arrived in Singapore with his family a few days before. The ripple effect from that first case has been powerful, with changes to the country’s working lifestyle, economy, social fabric and healthcare sector. Some of those changes will be transient, with things going back to the way they were once the pandemic is over.But the impact of COVID-19 has been so great that some aspects of Singapore's daily life have been changed forever.In the days after the first case in Singapore, there was little sign of the impact that was coming. Everyday life went on with little worry. But about two weeks later, ministers announced that Singapore would go into Disease Outbreak Response System Condition Orange and restrictions were introduced.By April, there were many clusters, including the first few in migrant workers’ dormitories. The country went into isolation, with a “circuit breaker” and strict rules on gatherings.Singapore became quiet: Busy hawker centres were open only for takeaways, non-essential shops were shuttered, and offices were closed as working from home became the new normal. Travelling abroad became a massive challenge, with countries imposing restrictions on visitors to protect themselves from imported cases.Even as Singapore saw community case numbers dip significantly in June, and the country began its reopening, there was still uncertainty about the coronavirus, its mutations and how the relaxing of restrictions would affect the country.Beyond the day-to-day challenges, conversations about bigger, longer-term issues began to emerge in Singapore. Is working from home the future? Will people keep their job? Will Singapore go into a recession? What about Singapore's migrant workers? Can our healthcare sector cope? What next?WHO NEEDS AN OFFICE?Remember when going into the office every day was the norm? Experts have long argued about the benefits of working from home – before COVID-19, it was viewed as a luxury and revolutionary.That revolution came quickly with the onset of the pandemic, but it was not always luxurious. Arguments can be made for and against telecommuting when it comes to work-life balance, with some celebrating time saved on commuting but others feeling the strain of working in a cramped environment with little separation between work and personal life.Nonetheless, some companies have already said that even when the pandemic is brought under control, they will continue with remote working.That means deeper changes to working lives as employers work out how to get the best out of their staff when they're sitting at home with associated distractions such as bored kids or noisy neighbours.Singapore Management University's (SMU) Professor Paulin Straughan said working from home is not just about physical relocation: “It is a whole new transformation of organisational culture, it changes the way we work and the way we account for KPIs (key performance indicators).”But this is “really dependent” on the employers – some require workers to log in to video chats at regular intervals for “face time”, while others are happy to let their employees take charge of their own time.One of the biggest changes to the way telecommuting is done is via video chats. Shares of Zoom soared as millions started using the video conferencing platform during lockdowns.Nanyang Technological University’s (NTU) Associate Professor Andy Ho said: “I think being able to meet on Zoom is actually not a bad thing, in a way that you can make sure that people actually are punctual. It's hard to be late on a Zoom meeting, you're home already, where else can you be?”But it is “very different” from meeting in person – there is less brainstorming, and it can be more of a hindrance than a help, he added. “When everybody is together physically, it is easy to have a creative, dynamic session, whereas in a Zoom meeting, you really can’t speak over one another.”Working from home might have seemed a dream for some before COVID-19, but once it became a reality, for many it became difficult to separate work life from home life.For families living in small homes, this became a clear issue in the early days of the pandemic.“People may find it challenging to unplug from work when there are no physical boundaries to distinguish between home and an office, or become frustrated at having to spend a disproportionate energy and time on work,” explained Ms Michelle Tan, senior clinical psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).Creating those physical and mental boundaries might be key to work-life balance, but for some, it is not as simple as keeping your office space and personal rest separate. For these reasons, COVID-19 has “highlighted inequality” in our daily lives, said Prof Straughan. “Work from home has benefited those of us with the resources – that luxury of broadband that works very well, that luxury of a private office at home and the luxury of peace and tranquillity in your home area which allows you to focus on work. Not everyone has that.”We have created a work culture that is “one size fits all”, but that cannot be the case going forward, she said, adding that this was because of the nature of work in different industries, employees coming from a wide range of backgrounds and the demands of clients.There are those who thrive on working from home, especially those who have the ability and discipline to segregate work life and personal life, despite the spatial issues.For Assoc Prof Ho, who just became a dad, it gave him the opportunity to be at home with his family at a time when he was needed. Working in an office and commuting to and fro every day would have meant spending less time with his newborn.However, some employers want their workers back in the office “for the sake of making sure we’re using the space”, he said. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND MENTAL HEALTHWhile some enjoy the opportunity to work from home, not everyone relishes it. Those in abusive family relationships struggle to break free, unable to reach out to friends and other family members, and the pandemic further isolated them.In May last year, the police said reports related to family violence rose by 22 per cent since the circuit breaker started. On average, the number of family violence reports per month rose by about 10 per cent in 2020, police said earlier this week.Calls to mental health hotlines have also gone up, as people confronted health fears and the impact of the economic fallout from COVID-19, with thoughts of self-harm and suicide.For families who don’t have a “strong dynamic” or are in “pressure cooker environments”, working from home can exacerbate these issues.“They’re stuck together, and there’s nowhere else to go, there’s nowhere else to hide, and especially for people facing abusive relationships in the family, those are the people that are in real danger of mental duress,” said Assoc Prof Ho.The difference the last year has made is that it allowed Singapore to more openly confront these issues, he added.“Obviously it is a pandemic and it has caused great loss and destruction to our lives, but the silver lining is it did bring our awareness and attention into areas that we would not have talked about in the past,” added the NTU psychologist.“Domestic violence is not something that we talk about openly, even mental health issues are not talked about openly. But because of COVID-19, because of the social distancing, and the physical distancing that has been set in place, and people are suffering from it, the awareness and understanding become much more pronounced.“We are much more aware of the mental strain and emotional duress that people are facing because of COVID-19. I think with this greater awareness that in the future, even when COVID-19 is behind us, we can still ride this momentum and continue to do more awareness campaigns … on these issues that we rarely get to talk about.”FINDING A CLASSROOM ONLINEThe idea of some form of flexible or blended learning has been touted for years, but COVID-19 changed all that. Previously done only a few times a year, home-based learning has become a regular part of the school year at secondary schools, junior colleges and the Millennia Institute.This came after a month of full-time home-based learning last year amid COVID-19. The Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Mar 27 that home-based learning would take place one day a week. But after a circuit breaker was announced on Apr 3 – and with it, the closure of schools from Apr 8 – home-based learning became the norm. In the early stages of this new reality, thousands of tablets and laptops were loaned out to students for home-based learning, as teachers worked quickly to implement class plans. For teacher Zacharoy Dass, doing lessons over Google Meet helped some of his students open up more.“I was able to hear more from some students who I may not have heard as much from in a normal classroom setting,” he said.“Being behind a computer screen helped to embolden some of them to speak up more, and just being in the comfort of your room ... I can definitely see how some students benefited from that.”Many students adapted to attending lessons online, even those who live in busy households as the circuit breaker forced parents to work from home.“Most of them were able to work out an arrangement that allowed them to continue attending lessons and getting the work done in time,” he added.Moving forward, it is prudent that home-based learning is infused into the curriculum, he said, adding that traditional classroom teaching is still important as it allows students to learn from spontaneous responses in the classroom. Holding classes online can sometimes make it harder for such spontaneity to take place, he said.The month-long home-based learning also allowed teachers and students to work on teething issues. “If we have to go back to a circuit breaker state, at least we know that we are more prepared than before.”WILL WE KEEP WORKING FROM HOME?With COVID-19 still a clear and present danger around the world, working from home might be the default for some companies in the short term. Whether the pandemic changes the approach to a physical office space in the long term is up for debate.The answer could be a flexible working environment, rather than a rigid one-size-fits-all solution, said the experts.What is needed is a culture change, said Prof Straughan.“What I'm hoping is now that we've gone through this period, where we realise that if I can work from home, and protect my family time and my private time, and my business continues to thrive in the midst of the worst recession ever, then surely, this is sustainable.“That we can continue to respect family time, and even if we work from home, respect the downtime that you must give to your employees, do not use it as an excuse to exploit them.”But if this cannot be achieved, then you might end up with a whole generation of the labour force who suffer from burnout and disillusionment, she warned.THE CONVERSATION ABOUT MIGRANT WORKERSFor the 300,000 migrant workers living in Singapore’s dormitories, life was quite different. So used to being out at work or with friends over the weekend, nearly all of them were confined to their rooms as the pandemic took hold.Some of these rooms accommodated more than 15 people, in double deck beds with little space and not much to do. Each day passed slowly. With communal facilities shut, many had almost no interaction outside those four walls, except when they queued to use the shower or toilet.With the threat of infection hanging over them, and the worry for their families back home, it became a difficult situation for many workers. As it would turn out, more than 150,000 dormitory residents contracted COVID-19. More than 54,000 dormitory residents have tested positive using the PCR test, while another 98,289 have tested positive using serology tests. The dormitory conditions helped the coronavirus to rip through the migrant population. The first cases were in end-March. Weeks later, Singapore was recording hundreds of new cases in the dormitories every day. The authorities kept the workers there, isolated from the community. Thousands were quarantined in their rooms, taken to hospital or shuffled to other dormitories to reduce the density.Conversations about living conditions, mental health, pay and the country’s reliance on foreign labour came to the fore. From an outpouring of support for those afflicted to racist remarks, it drew a wide range of comments online.This “huge swell of sympathy”, together with donations in cash and kind during the height of the outbreak may have been short-lived, but it brought the issue of migrant workers and their place in Singapore’s society to the forefront, said NTU’s Assistant Professor in Sociology Laavanya Kathiravelu.While this awareness may have also generated a “fear of their potential as vectors of infection and disease”, the conversation stretched beyond the living conditions in dormitories to the workers’ importance to Singapore’s economy.“It is great that such a conversation has become more mainstream, as our reliance on this group has grown without much public awareness about how it has happened,” said Asst Prof Laavanya.“Most of the discussion is now centred around treating migrant workers better – whether it is improving living conditions in dormitories, or being more kind in everyday interactions, or in discussing mental health issues that they are facing as a result of their continued confinement.”One of the main reasons COVID-19 spread through the dormitories at such speed was the living conditions many of these men lived in. Migrant workers CNA spoke to talked about the cramped conditions and difficulties during isolation.LIVING CONDITIONSAbout two-thirds of Singapore’s 300,000 migrant workers live in 43 purpose-built dormitories, while the rest reside in factory-converted dormitories, temporary quarters at construction sites and public housing or private residential premises.Over the last three years, foreign worker dormitory operators have flouted dormitory management rules about 80 times a year, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said.Every year, the ministry penalises about 1,200 employers for unacceptable accommodations and about 20 operators for breaching the Foreign Employee Dormitory Act licence conditions. For Cassia @ Penjuru dormitory resident Ripon Chowdhury, it was a “terrible year”. After contracting COVID-19 in May, he was taken to the National Centre for Infectious Diseases before being moved temporarily to a new dormitory. Being quarantined in a room with 15 other men was not an easy experience.“Before COVID-19, I only come to the room to sleep. But nowadays I still have to stay here – I don’t want to stay (in the room),” said Mr Chowdhury. “It’s crowded. I don’t think many workers in Singapore like to stay in dormitories, but we have no choice.”The Government said last year it will build new dormitories and refit unused state properties as part of plans to reduce the current density in dormitories. These will include quick build dormitories that can last two to three years, while there are longer-term plans to construct more purpose-built dormitories to house 100,000 workers.This will take time and a “whole industry effort”, said Asst Prof Laavanya, adding that the pandemic has driven home the urgent need for such changes.Mr Chowdhury said: “If you stay in a 16-person room … we just have a teeny locker and (we are) sharing the bathroom, the shower, the kitchen room with others … infectious diseases spread very fast. We need fewer people in the rooms.”But even as things look set to improve for migrant workers, the last 12 months have been extremely taxing on them, and not just physically.MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTLiving conditions were not the only topic that came to the fore during the last year, with authorities asked about the number of suicides at dormitories over the isolation period.Associate Professor Kenneth Mak, Singapore’s director of medical services, said in August they were concerned about migrant workers who were accommodated in facilities under “very tight regimes” and how the prolonged isolation could have an adverse effect on the workers.It was in stark contrast with the rest of Singapore. As the country brought community infections under control during the circuit breaker and gradually reopened, dormitories remained isolated for many more months. It took a mental toll on many workers.Bangladeshi Mohamed Jahid Hassan, who works as a safety coordinator, found the experience “very difficult”.“Last year for migrant workers was actually not so good. We come here for work, we always get together, we together makan (eat), cook … and weekly or monthly we meet together. But once COVID-19 hit Singapore, we cannot go out with friends,” he said.Living in a factory-converted dormitory with more than 300 people, he said they were moved into different hotels to isolate them as cases sprung up. While that might sound like a treat for some, the isolation proved difficult for Mr Hassan.“We stay in the room in quarantine and it’s too much, it’s so difficult for us, but at least we were together. We moved to a hotel, and that was very difficult for us … alone 45 days. That time we faced a lot of problems.”Their mental health took a beating. Some, like Mr Hassan, came up with innovative ways to pass time. He took courses to improve himself, and set up a WhatsApp group with his friends to study English.But worried for his family back home in Bangladesh – he supports his father, mother, wife and five-year-old daughter – the experience of living alone was not one he cherished as fear took over. Many of his friends told him about the conditions back home, where some of his friends were bedridden by COVID-19.“So many things come out in the brain (when we’re isolated) and we’re under pressure,” he explained.Mr Chowdhury said he felt left behind as he watched the country gradually relax restrictions.He added: “You can see, everyone is moving forward in Singapore, except us, still the same, left behind. Most dormitories are not close to the recreation centres. (They are) very hard to reach … and also even though there are only a few things or special events, we need to get permission from the employer.”Isolation has “serious psychological effects on some people”, said Mr Alex Au from Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2). Apart from the lack of freedom of movement, many workers are also under pressure due to the hefty loans they took up to work in Singapore, he said.“The psychological distress that they suffered sprang from very real conditions outside their control, which is basically, movement control – the lack of socialising, the lack of contact with others, as well as financial distress.”But even with the challenges of isolation, living conditions and mental health issues, Mr Hassan said he is grateful he is in Singapore.“I see a lot of Singaporeans helping out. This is very good for us, and we never forget them helping us, the Government also helping us,” he added.“REAL, TANGIBLE ISSUES”While COVID-19 might have changed the dynamics of the conversation around migrant workers, there may still be issues to be discussed. Beyond the immediate concerns – housing conditions, isolation, and stress – less attention is given to the “structural conditions”, such as their debt and their reliance on their employers to ensure they are being treated fairly, said Asst Prof Laavanya.TWC2’s Mr Au said Singapore will have to deal with the “real, tangible issues of money and freedom”.“I think we really need to do something about giving them a whole lot more freedom to move around, to change jobs, to say goodbye to the bad employer and go to a better employer who provides better,” he added.Asst Prof Laavanya said some people have suggested reducing the nation’s reliance on migrant workers more “holistically”, either through increased automation or replacing them with Singaporean workers. This view may go “hand in hand” with those who want migrant workers to be better integrated into Singapore’s communities, both physically and socially.“This is probably a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for us to do more, because of all these social issues that COVID-19 has exposed,” said NTU’s Assoc Prof Ho.“On the surface, we may seem like a very harmonious and well-structured, well-managed society – which we are – but there are many hidden issues that are not being brought forward. “And because of COVID-19 … there’s no opportunity to hide it anymore, and now, it’s all out in the open. There is the potential to do a lot more.”UNPRECEDENTED ECONOMIC CHALLENGESIn the early days of COVID-19, nobody quite knew how long it would last – the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Singapore lasted a few months before it was contained. But 12 months on, the country has started recording new unlinked community cases again and new clusters.The pandemic threw Singapore into a recession, with the Government presenting four Budgets worth nearly S$100 billion to mitigate the impact of COVID-19. “The COVID-19 pandemic has brought about unexpected and unprecedented challenges. It has severely disrupted global economic activity and led to both demand and supply-side shocks to the Singapore economy,” said Mr Lam Yi Young, CEO of the Singapore Business Federation.Even with the financial help, some industries were facing stark losses – none more so than the aviation and tourism sectors. As countries around the world shut their borders and flights grounded to a halt, visitors to Singapore dwindled down to the hundreds monthly. It is a far cry from the more than 1.5 million visitors who visit Singapore every month before COVID-19. “The impact of the pandemic was uneven across different sectors. The aviation and tourism sectors were more severely affected as they saw a sudden, massive drop in demand,” said Mr Lam.Although the Singapore Airlines (SIA) Group reported that in December it carried the largest number of passengers since border restrictions began, it was still a huge 97.1 per cent decline year-on-year. Never has the national carrier seen such loss, with the group cutting about 4,300 positions.“Without an almost fully recovered global economy it is difficult to predict what or when a recovery will take place,” said Associate Professor Trevor Yu, from NTU’s Nanyang Business School, about the aviation sector.While the establishment of reciprocal green lanes for travel has been useful in facilitating essential business travel, Singapore saw the launch of its first air bubble with Hong Kong postponed due to a fresh wave of infections in the Chinese city.The aviation sector has been “very creative” in dealing with the effects of the pandemic, said NUS Business School lecturer Rashimah Rajah.Moving duty-free sales online, redirecting cabin crew to social distancing ambassadors and opening up grounded planes for meals have all been welcome distractions for the sector. But it is still facing a long journey back.“I don't think it will go back to where it was, at least not with the old model of flying and providing excellent service on the plane ... you have to be creative and think about other ways to restructure the organisation, and also the workers themselves,” she explained.REBOUNDING FROM UNEMPLOYMENTWith Singapore falling into a recession, unemployment rates shot up. In August last year, the overall unemployment rate climbed to 3.4 per cent, past the 3.3 per cent high recorded in September 2009 during the global financial crisis. In September, it went up further to 3.6 per cent.Although it was still below the highest unemployment rate of 4.8 per cent recorded in September 2003 after the SARS outbreak, it was a worrying picture. While rising unemployment rates in Singapore are not new – the rate has been steadily increasing since the first quarter of 2018 – COVID-19 compounded the situation.“The overall global economy is still rife with uncertainty and job market is still relatively weak. People would think twice about changing jobs in the face of such prevailing sentiment,” said Assoc Prof Yu.But some workers started on new jobs, retraining or taking up traineeships to move into new industries. The idea of staying in the same industry for one’s entire career had gone with COVID-19.“There has been more and more attention on issues of retraining and career switches across many sectors of the economy. I would say these changes are definitely more acceptable for many individuals,” said Assoc Prof Yu.The Government introduced the Jobs Support Scheme, the Jobs Growth Initiative and other programmes to help workers, while employers of locals received wage and training support.Singapore started seeing the earliest shoots of recovery, with the unemployment rate in November falling for the first time in 2020.Jobs have been created in industries that do not always require industry-specific experience, and traineeships formed that allow a person to learn on the job. It has opened doorways for people to enter another industry than the one they were in.“When COVID-19 hit, many workers were quick to realise how obsolete their jobs could be ... and they also realised that there were other sectors that were rising, especially in data science, in big data, artificial intelligence and things like that,” said Dr Rashimah. “People understand that they need to retrain themselves and move to different sectors.”Those who were furloughed or put on unpaid leave also used their free time to upgrade themselves.“People quickly realised that the overarching thing that they need to stay relevant ... is resilience. They needed to be resilient, they understood they needed to be adaptable and flexible,” she said.Those in consumer, food retail and service businesses found themselves having to pivot quickly to new business models and leverage digitalisation to remain viable, said SBF’s Mr Lam. Sectors such as biotech, information and communications technology (ICT) and precision engineering sectors found good growth opportunities brought about by the pandemic, he added.AN UNKNOWN DISEASE“Am I going to die?”For National Centre for Infectious Diseases (NCID) ICU senior staff nurse Joel Quek, it was a question he was asked multiple times by COVID-19 patients who were uncertain about the disease and how it would affect them.Singapore has never seen a pandemic as prolonged and as widespread as the one caused by COVID-19. For the country’s healthcare sector, it is a fight that is ongoing.When the NCID opened in September 2019, it was in preparation for an outbreak such as this. Staff at the hospital are trained to deal with infectious coronaviruses, but this was different.The scale and the nature of the pandemic resulted in a fundamental change in work processes and patient care, as well as discussions about the welfare of healthcare workers. For patients who suffer from chronic illness, there is “some amount of expectation and preparedness” of what the disease might do to them, and patients might have the time to settle their personal affairs, Mr Quek explained.The difference is that some COVID-19 patients in ICU do not have this privilege, due to the “sudden and drastic nature” of the disease.“COVID-19 infections are always sudden and unexpected. Illness severity also varies greatly between patients. In comparison, the usual patients I nurse are suffering from chronic diseases and complications, such as hypertension, diabetes, heart disease and cancer. These diseases usually have an expected progression path and outcome,” said Mr Quek.“This is a key difference, which makes a huge impact to the patients’ experience of the illness. Multiple times … I had my patients look me in the eye, hold my hand, and ask me directly: ‘Am I going to die?’.“This was a question that was almost impossible for me to answer and it pained me greatly.”While most patients in ICUs can find support in having their loved ones close by, the infectious nature of COVID-19 also means patients are isolated from the comfort of their family and friends, who themselves might be isolated.“I vividly remember some patients had to spend their dying moments alone because of this. It was a poignant consequence of the infection,” said Mr Quek.Using video calls, many of these patients were able to speak to their loved ones before they died. “I did my best to ensure that these patients had someone by their side and a peaceful death,” said Mr Quek.“Thankfully the majority of patients suffering from COVID-19 infections recover and they have always expressed their heartfelt thanks to us. Working with COVID-19 patients has therefore not only been humbling but also extremely fulfilling.”During the peak of the pandemic, a second ICU was opened at NCID to accommodate the large number of patients. It was a “morale booster” seeing healthcare workers from different institutions and units working together, he said.On a personal level, Mr Quek was forced to cut short his studies – he was embarking on an Advanced Diploma in Nursing (Critical Care) – and return to NCID’s ICU in March last year. With his wife also a specialist nurse working in ICU, there was a risk of them contracting COVID-19. Neighbours, friends and family supported them while they isolated themselves and only travelled between work and home, he said.VERY THANKFULEarly COVID-19 patients like 28-year-old Celeste Chew said they are grateful for the care they received from healthcare workers when they were facing the unknown.“I'm just very thankful that things were all provided for us and we were very well taken care of, especially when you see how the other countries are struggling with it.“I think that the Government really stepped up to help us … everybody is not perfect. I feel that overall, Singapore has done quite a good job. I know a lot of people have a lot to say about (masks and lockdowns), but I feel that wearing masks is very important.”The COVID-19 situation has helped foster community spirit among strangers, with people showing more concern for each other and helping when they can.“I really think that it is quite a beautiful thing. I experienced it with neighbours also. I used to not talk to my neighbours at all, but now the whole floor are friends. That is just amazing, and I cannot understand how that happened. I got COVID-19 and everyone was really nice to us,” said Ms Chew.Her sentiments were echoed by COVID-19 patient John Bodill, who said the treatment he received was “100 per cent”. With nurses checking on him three times a day and making sure he was fully informed of any developments, it helped ease any anxiety he was feeling.NCID executive director Leo Yee Sin said she was thankful for the dedicated team at the hospital and the support from other healthcare institutions.“In the early stages, when much about the virus was still unknown, we had to adjust rapidly and adapt to the evolving situation as we learnt about the virus on the fly,” she said, adding that staff members took the initiative to seek solutions when challenges arose.THE NEXT PANDEMIC?Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat said on Thursday that the lessons from COVID-19 would help increase Singapore’s preparedness for the next outbreak, because “disease X is not a matter of if, but when”.After the SARS outbreak in 2003 that led to the deaths of 33 people, Singapore trained healthcare and frontline workers to better deal with infectious disease outbreaks. Medical facilities were also expanded and upgraded.NCID's Professor Leo said: “We cannot predict which novel pathogen will cause another epidemic or pandemic. Pre-pandemic preparedness, which is to have system readiness to mitigate and lessen any potential impact, is crucial to sustain human health, social stability and economic impact caused by these unknown pathogens.“No matter what system we have put in place, the most important thing is that the entire system must be flexible and be ready to take on whatever challenge, in whatever form and whatever shape.”A vaccine is not the only answer to public health intervention, and good hygiene practices “cannot be overemphasised” as part of our day-to-day life, she added.“COVID-19 has taught us many lessons, yet it may not be the most lethal pathogen to mankind.”Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

189,Man given jail and caning for molesting girlfriend's sleeping mother,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-given-jail-and-caning-molesting-girlfriend-sleeping-mother-14019588,22 Jan 2021 03:54PM,"SINGAPORE: A 25-year-old man was given nine months' jail and one stroke of the cane on Thursday (Jan 21) for molesting his girlfriend's sleeping mother.The man, who cannot be named due to gag orders protecting the identity of the victim, pleaded guilty to one count of molesting his girlfriend's mother in her home.The court heard that the accused has a baby with his girlfriend and was in her mother's home on Mar 9 last year.At around 8am, his girlfriend went to sleep in her room as she had been caring for the baby during the night.Before 11.30am, the accused entered the victim's room to take a pillow. He saw that his girlfriend's mother was asleep and that her breast was exposed.He molested her and squeezed her breast a few times, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Tin Shu Min. He also touched the victim's mouth with his hand. When the victim woke up, she saw the accused squatting beside her, with his pants down.The accused told her ""let's have sex"", and the victim refused. She asked him where her daughter and the baby were, and the accused said they were sleeping outside.The victim pretended to go back to sleep and the accused left. She was shocked by what happened but did not immediately report the incident as she feared this would raise the accused's suspicions.At 12.35pm, while the accused was distracted by the baby, the victim took the opportunity to report the matter, leading to his arrest.After this, the victim began to regularly attend sessions at the Institute of Mental Health as the incident had caused her to feel depressed.Although the sessions and prescribed medication have helped, she is still triggered and traumatised when she recalls the incident, the court heard.The prosecutor asked for the sentence that was eventually meted out, noting the harm caused to the victim and the fact that the accused was given probation in 2013 for a sex-related crime.For using criminal force to outrage the victim's modesty, the man could have been jailed for up to two years, fined, caned, or given any combination of these penalties.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

190,'Many things could have been done better': COVID-19 task force chiefs on the lessons from the past year of the pandemic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-task-force-done-better-gan-kim-yong-lawrence-wong-14012404,21 Jan 2021 06:31PM,"SINGAPORE: Looking back on the fight against the pandemic in the past year, co-chair of the COVID-19 multi-ministry taskforce and Education Minister Lawrence Wong admitted there were ""certainly many things"" that could have been done better.""At the start of the year, when we were fighting this virus, there was so much uncertainty, so many things we didn't know. We didn't know about the asymptomatic nature of transmission; we didn't know how infectious it was,"" Mr Wong said in an interview with the media on Tuesday (Jan 19), alongside his co-chair, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong.The interview was conducted just ahead of Singapore marking a year since it identified its first case of COVID-19 on Jan 23, 2020.Mr Wong added that if they had had ""a better picture then"", authorities would have ""taken different measures"", without detailing any specific instances.""Not everything we'll get right, that's for sure. The key, as I've said before, is that we have to be quick to adapt to adjust, to be nimble, put things right, recover from setbacks and move forward. And that's the attitude we've had,"" he said.Mr Gan acknowledged that the possibility of asymptomatic transmission - where patients could be infectious even before showing symptoms - was an important characteristic about the virus they did not expect.""If you remember in the very beginning, we said if you're unwell with flu-like symptoms, go back, take five days MC and if you don't recover, come and see the doctor again then we'll test you,"" Mr Gan said.Authorities later realised that would not work, and decided to swab everyone who was symptomatic ""so as to catch them earlier"", he said.""Even then, that's not enough, because by the time you're symptomatic and see a doctor, you've already gone few days as infectious. Therefore, even our contact tracing had to move backwards much longer so as to catch and detect more people who could have been exposed,"" he added.Responding to another question on how authorities could have avoided or mitigated the dramatic rise in cases in migrant worker dormitories, Mr Wong said: ""We would have done what we're doing today in the dorms. We'd be putting everyone on regular testing regimes. We would have taken far more measures that we had at that time, obviously.""The challenge is if you were to think back at that time - it's one thing to say I hope we can do it. But we didn't have testing capabilities to test to the level we have today.""So it's also a question of wanting do something, but do you have the ability to carry it out and execute it?""Mr Wong added that there were limited resources in terms of manpower as well, and deploying one resource to a particular area would have meant channelling it away from another.Both ministers reiterated an earlier pledge to conduct a full review of how the pandemic was handled, to see how processes and systems may be improved.CIRCUIT BREAKER WAS TOUGH JUDGMENT CALL: MINISTERSSingapore's partial lockdown from Apr 7 to Jun 1 last year, which came to be known as the ""circuit breaker"", was one of the most difficult decisions authorities had to make, the ministers said.According to Mr Wong, they knew it would be ""quite drastic"", with a significant impact on livelihoods and people's mental wellbeing.""How will it impact the vulnerable and elderly, and on balance, will it do more harm than good, or will we be able to address and effectively slow down transmission? That was a very tough decision to make, and there was a lot of uncertainty,"" he added.And if the decision to implement the circuit breaker was tough, questions on how and when to end it were no less difficult.""It's so easy to say: 'Be tight'. But for how long? Forever? One year, everyone cannot see each other? I think we will all go crazy,"" said Mr Wong. ""So what's the right balance, and how to make such calibrations amid such great uncertainty?""Mr Gan echoed that the move was very tricky because it also needed to be timed precisely.""If you do it too soon, it's not going to be effective. Then if you lift the circuit breaker and everything crops up, you must do it a second time … If you do it too late then it's not going to help because you're going to already have a big cluster in your hands.""So we needed to time it, but we can never be perfect in timing, so you just have to have a sense and make a judgment,"" he said.Breaking into a small smile, Mr Gan added: ""That's why I said Lawrence was very decisive, said if we have to move, then move.""He was referencing an earlier question posed to the ministers about what it was like working so closely with each other throughout the pandemic.""Once the facts are clear, there are no ifs and buts, just move and get it done, so I think I'm very happy to be working with him, and it's even enjoyable working with him - a very decisive co-chairman,"" he said.Returning the compliment, Mr Wong said he was fortunate to have known Mr Gan through other organisations, such as the PAP Community Foundation and the Singapore Labour Foundation, even before working together on the task force.""In many ways, he's been a great mentor … he has guided me along in the transition of chairmanship in these two positions … it has been a very pleasant and good working relationship because it was built on a relationship we already have.""With a laugh, Mr Wong added: ""He's literally on my speed dial. I disturb him all the time.""THE BIGGEST CHALLENGESThe issue of uncertainty arose several times during the interview, with both ministers describing it as the biggest challenge in tackling COVID-19.""As and when we needed to change our approach, we needed to move the whole-of-Government machinery to implement these changes,"" said Mr Gan.""We have to explain to people, communicate with Singaporeans to let them understand why we are introducing these measures and why we need do certain things that are not very popular, very tough,"" he explained.Another huge challenge was managing public sentiment. Mr Wong cited how at the start of the year, many people had clamoured for strict measures and believed the situation might ""be over in a month"", but authorities had to warn that it was going to be a ""long fight, a marathon"".But when the number of local cases dipped, sentiment swung, said Mr Wong. ""The mood was: Why don't we open faster, why are we still doing Phase 2 measures, when can we get to Phase 3?""He added: ""That's how (public mood) shifts so quickly and easily … to maintain a steady course and make sure that whatever we do, yes we have to take into account public opinion and feedback, but it ultimately has to be based on scientific evidence, data, expert opinion, and then explain that to the public and get public support for the measures. That's, to me, one of the biggest challenges.""""THEY MADE THE IMPOSSIBLE POSSIBLE""Wrapping up the interview, the ministers also reflected on the most memorable parts of the past year's fight against COVID-19.For Mr Gan, one such instance was witnessing how quickly community care facilities, such as the one at Singapore Expo, were put together. He said he was also moved by watching how people from different sectors - public and private - came together in a time of crisis to help.Mr Wong added: ""They made the impossible possible … If they had not done this, Singapore's trajectory through COVID-19 would've been quite different.""He also cited how students at a school he visited had been writing thank you letters to frontline and essential workers.""That was very heartening too … Hopefully, emerging from this crisis, we will be able to become a more inclusive, more gracious society because of (how) there is a greater appreciation for the important contributions that these people make, and we will have a greater sense of respect for work they do,"" Mr Wong said.This is the lowest overall number of total daily cases reported in Singapore since Jun 9 when four infections were identified.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

This comes after an 18-year-old student said in a Reddit post on Jan 14 that the Education Ministry had intervened with her treatment, preventing her from obtaining a doctor's referral letter to begin hormone therapy. MOE denied these claims two days later, saying that it was ""not true"" that it interfered with the student’s hormonal treatment, and invited the student to approach the school to ""clarify and discuss how the school can support his schooling better"". The Education Ministry and IMH wrote in the joint statement on Thursday: ""In treating individuals who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria, IMH clinicians will typically seek inputs from a wide range of stakeholders. ""The final medical treatment decisions involving the use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients. Such treatments also require the written consent from parents (where minors are concerned)."" In the school setting, the schools work closely with IMH and the students' parents to support them and ""maintain a conducive learning environment"", the statement read. DOCTOR TOLD TO CONSULT MINISTRY BEFORE TREATMENT: STUDENTSpeaking to TODAY last week, the student, who wanted to be known only as Ashlee, said that MOE’s initial response did not address any of the issues laid out in the Reddit post.Ashlee had asked that the school not be named for fear of repercussions for speaking with the media, and requested to be referred to by she/her pronouns.She was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019, she said, adding that the situation with MOE and the school started around February last year.Ashlee had notified the school's management of her diagnosis in March last year, and was asked to confirm this via a letter from the IMH psychiatrist, she told TODAY. The letter was reportedly given to the school and MOE the same month.MOE told her through the school that it would work with her to understand her diagnosis and make school conducive for her, she said. The school's year head and counsellor had also sat in for at least one of her appointments with the psychiatrist, said Ashlee, adding that some school rules were relaxed during the time, citing the example of being allowed to use the wheelchair toilet.But when she was to proceed with hormone replacement therapy in August, she was informed by the psychiatrist that MOE had told the doctor to consult the ministry before any decision could be made regarding treatments for transgender students, Ashlee told TODAY. Because of this, she has not received the letter to begin hormone replacement therapy, she said. Ashlee also told TODAY that during a meeting in October involving her father and the school management, she was told that she would have to continue wearing the uniform for boys. If hormone replacement therapy resulted in physiological changes that prevent her from doing so, she would be expelled from school, she said.According to Ashlee, the school's principal also requested to work personally with the endocrinologist to limit the dose of hormones so that expulsion was unlikely to happen.Addressing this case, MOE and IMH said in Thursday's joint statement that the school is ""committed to providing the education support the student needs to graduate"", including via home-based learning. ""The school will continue to work with the parents and IMH medical professionals to support the student's education journey and well-being,"" the statement read. ""We urge all parties to respect the privacy of the family, so that the parents can have the space to decide what is in their child’s best interest.""Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

He then went into a bedroom and searched through the drawers. He packed all the bras and panties he could find into a plastic bag that was on a table.However, before he could leave, a child returned home with a domestic helper.So closed the door to the bedroom and hid there until he was able to leave without being seen, fleeing through the front door with his bag of stolen clothes.On a second occasion on Jun 25, 2019, So took a lift to the highest floor of a block of flats and walked down the staircase floor by floor to see if he could steal any underwear.When he got to the fifth floor, he saw two women leave their flat and noticed that the door and gate were unlocked.He knocked on the door to ensure no one was home, before entering and stealing 26 bras, 11 pairs of panties, a pair of stockings and two nightgown tops worth S$1,590 in total.He stole again in October last year after he saw underwear hung out to dry on the sixth floor of a block. He stole three bras and eight pairs of panties.So was caught and remanded later that month. He was found to be in possession of 60 bras and 44 panties, which he could not give a satisfactory account for. Court documents did not indicate how he was caught.A medical report from the Institute of Mental Health found that So had a fetishistic disorder with a long-standing intense sexual arousal from women's underwear, specifically panties, for attaining sexual gratification.However, So was found to be fully aware of the nature and wrongfulness of his acts at the time. The prosecutor asked for nine months' jail. So's lawyer Wee Hong Shern asked for six months' jail instead, saying his client has no previous convictions and was fired from his job due to the case.For housebreaking by day to commit theft, he could have been jailed for up to 10 years.

Muhammad Ihsan Mahmud, 32, was given nine weeks' jail on Monday (Jan 18) for one count each of voluntarily causing hurt to a vulnerable victim and using criminal force against him. A third charge was considered in sentencing.The court heard that the Malaysian national began working at IMH in April 2016 and was a staff nurse at the time of the incident on Dec 8, 2019.Ihsan was on the morning shift with two colleagues that day - 60-year-old health attendant Sadasivam Kannan and 24-year-old staff nurse Iylia Muhammad Afiq Nor Effendi.The IMH patients, including the victim - a long-term patient at IMH since 2005 who suffers from schizophrenia - were scheduled for haircuts that morning. At about 10.30am, the victim was moved to the day lounge after his haircut.In the lounge, he was toying with another patient's urine receptacle before he splashed some urine on an attending nurse, who told Ihsan what happened before going to take a shower. After hearing what had happened, Ihsan approached the 58-year-old victim and splashed hand sanitiser in his face while the latter was restrained to a wheelchair.The victim raised his arms to shield his face and later wiped the liquid off with his shorts. After this, he picked rubbish off the floor while Ihsan tended to other patients.A few minutes later, Ihsan walked past the victim and sprayed hand sanitiser in his face, catching him off-guard. The victim could not shield his face in time and rubbed his eyes while Ihsan walked away to continue his tasks.A few minutes later, while securing the restraints for another patient, Ihsan tried to hit the victim with his elbow, but the latter dodged the hit.He later sprayed the victim's face with hand sanitiser a third time for no apparent reason, intending to annoy him. After this, the victim began to create a disturbance in the day lounge.Ihsan, Mr Kannan and Mr Iylia tried to convert the victim's one-point restraint into one with three points, but this agitated the victim.Ihsan punched the victim twice in his eye region before continuing to secure his restraints. The victim remained aggressive and started kicking the nurses, but eventually was subdued after the three men held him down.Ihsan kicked the victim while his colleague fixed the restraints around his forearms. His actions were caught on closed-circuit television footage, and Mr Iylia later discovered bruising around the victim's right eye.He administered an ice pack on the victim, while Ihsan reported the injuries to IMH management, prompting IMH to lodge a police report.The victim was taken to Singapore General Hospital with bruising over his face and a fractured toe.Deputy Public Prosecutor Phoebe Tan asked for 10 weeks' jail, saying that Ihsan had breached the trust and duty of care owed to the victim, who was vulnerable because of his psychiatric condition.Ihsan's actions also undermine public confidence in the administration of healthcare services in Singapore, she said.While he had pleaded guilty, all his actions were captured on CCTV footage, she pointed out.I DID NOT EXPECT THIS TO HAPPEN: ACCUSEDIn mitigation, Ihsan said he worked as a nurse to earn a living to support his family in Malaysia and did not expect this to happen.""I do not want to create any trouble while working here,"" he said through an interpreter, adding that he has three children, one of whom is a special needs child.""My wife has been suffering from depression after the birth of my daughter and her condition is getting worse,"" he said. ""From Jan 8, 2020, I have been unemployed and I'm thankful for my friend who has been helping me in my needs and also giving me shelter.""He apologised and asked for leniency, saying that his family was on its own as his father-in-law was warded for heart complications and his father was unwell in Penang.The judge said nothing in his family circumstances justifies a lower sentence, agreeing that the public disquiet caused was an aggravating factor. However, he gave some weight to the fact that Ihsan reported the victim's injuries.For voluntarily causing hurt, Ihsan could have been jailed for up to two years, fined up to S$5,000, or both. For using criminal force, he could have been jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$1,500, or both. As the victim was vulnerable and incapable of protecting himself from abuse due to his mental infirmity, the maximum sentences for both offences could have been increased for up to one-and-a-half times.PATIENT SAFETY IS TOP PRIORITY: IMHIMH said in a statement on Monday evening that it has safety measures and procedures in place to ensure patients recover in a safe environment. Any injury that is unexplained is also “thoroughly investigated”.Wards are equipped with CCTV cameras and staff members work in teams. These staff members are trained to observe and monitor the patients under their care for any change in behaviour and to look out for any injuries as sometimes patients may fall or injure themselves, said IMH. Following the incident, IMH said it further reinforced to staff members its culture of accountability and reporting issues so that steps can be taken to address them early. More frequent reviews were also held to discuss difficult cases in the ward. Additionally, nursing management staff members join the ward nurses and patients in their weekly community meetings to understand issues and listen to feedback from patients directly.IMH said it apologised to the affected patient and his family after the incident and “provided support”. The patient has also recovered from his bruises and is still being cared for in IMH for his mental health condition.Two other staff members were also investigated in relation to this incident, said IMH. The outcome of these investigations is still pending. These staff members are also no longer employed by IMH.“IMH would like to reiterate that patient safety and well-being are a top priority at the hospital.  We will not tolerate any acts of inappropriate behaviour against patients. Perpetrators will be swiftly dealt with and reported to the police,” said the institute.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

195,Serial molester given 12 years' preventive detention for preying on 10-year-old pupil,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/serial-molester-preventive-detention-pupil-13985540,18 Jan 2021 01:19PM,"SINGAPORE: About 10 months after being released from 10 years' preventive detention for molesting minors, a 61-year-old man reoffended by preying on a 10-year-old girl who was going home from school.Salim Abdul Rahman, who was a cleaner at a mall at the time, was given 12 years' preventive detention on Monday (Jan 18) for one count of molesting a minor, with two other charges considered in sentencing.Preventive detention places recalcitrant offenders in jail for seven to 20 years in order to protect the public from the offender, with no remission.Salim was given 10 years' preventive detention in 2009 for multiple counts of molesting minors. He was released in late December 2019 and started work as a cleaner at a mall in Serangoon.On Oct 1 last year, he spotted a 10-year-old girl in uniform on the bus he was taking. He alighted at the same stop as the girl, who was in Primary 4, and decided to approach her as he had ""evil thoughts of doing something bad"" and wanted to ""feel good"", the court heard.He went up to the girl as she was walking and touched her shoulders. He asked her where she lived and which school she attended, but she did not answer him as she did not recognise him.Despite this, Salim persisted in talking to the girl, handing her S$1.50. The girl kept it as she was afraid to anger him if she rejected him. Salim held her hand and told her to follow him to his house. He led her to a staircase at a housing block, but she refused to follow him up the steps, saying she wanted to go home for lunch.Salim molested her. The frightened girl dashed home and began crying to her grandparent, who later took the girl to lodge a police report.Salim was identified and arrested that same day and remanded soon after. He was assessed at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) and was not found to suffer from any psychiatric disorder or illness. He was assessed to have a high risk of reoffending.A HIGH DEGREE OF DANGER TO COMMUNITY: PROSECUTORDeputy Public Prosecutor Colin Ng asked for 12 years' preventive detention, saying that Salim is a habitual criminal and a menace to society, and that he poses a high degree of danger to the community.His previous convictions show ""a worrying proclivity for committing sexual offences against young children"", said Mr Ng, painting a ""disconcerting picture of an offender who displayed paedophilic sexual interest"".Not only had he reoffended soon after release, he employed a ""strikingly similar modus operandi"" by approaching victims who were returning home from school, offering them pocket money and leading them to a secluded spot.Salim admitted to sexually violating the young victim because it made him feel good, said Mr Ng.Salim also sought to downplay his actions by lamenting that the inability to obtain medication for his insomnia, diabetes and eczema had affected his judgement, but this shows a lack of insight into his offending behaviour, said Mr Ng.He added that Salim's propensity towards sexual offences against minors underscores ""a need to take him out of circulation completely"".Salim, who had no lawyer, said he was caught by surprise when he was sentenced in 2009 and urged the judge to impose a term of less than 10 years.""Please have some mercy on me. Could it be less than 10 years, because I'd like to change for the better and gain employment,"" said Salim through an interpreter. The judge said he accepted Salim's expression of remorse, but said he had to consider the seriousness of the offences as well as the IMH report and the report on his suitability for preventive detention.A slight uplift from his previous term is warranted for the protection of the public, added the judge.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

197,Singapore Heart Foundation launches 'first of its kind' female CPR manikin vest for training use,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/cpr-manikin-female-vest-training-singapore-heart-foundation-13979106,17 Jan 2021 12:00PM,"SINGAPORE: Those taking cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) courses will soon be able to practise the emergency procedure on female physiques, with the launch of a female CPR manikin vest by the Singapore Heart Foundation (SHF).The vest, launched in conjunction with National Life Saving Day 2021, has been described as the ""first of its kind"" and can be fitted on most CPR manikins in the market, said SHF in a press release.It will be used in the Foundation's CPR+AED (automated external defibrillator) training programmes from Sunday. The Foundation will also distribute the vests to around 60 accredited CPR+AED training centres.SHF received many queries from course participants on touching and exposing the chest of female casualties while performing CPR+AED, said the foundation's CPR+AED chief instructor Denise Ng.""With this female CPR manikin vest, participants can be accustomed to doing chest compressions around the female breasts and learn how to paste the AED pads without exposing the women's chest.""To be frank, in such a life-and-death moment, no amount of embarrassment is worth refraining from saving a life,"" she said.According to a 2020 survey on CPR+AED commissioned by the SHF and the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF), 6 per cent of 1,003 respondents cited the fear of being accused of molest as a deterrent to performing CPR on a stranger.""As CPR+AED training is taught traditionally with CPR manikins of a male physique, trained lifesavers are primed to be familiar with performing CPR on males compared to females,"" said the press release.""Coupled with the fear of committing an outrage of modesty on a woman's chest or inflicting injury on female cardiac arrest casualties, the gender gap in life-saving widens.""As such, there is an ""urgent need"" to train resuscitators to perform CPR on women and ""lower the mental barriers"" to save a life.IMPROVEMENT IN SURVIVAL RATESData for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, released by the Unit for Pre-hospital Emergency Care (UPEC) on Sunday, suggests that more people are suffering from cardiac arrest outside of hospitals.This is even after adjusting for Singapore's ageing population, said Prof Marcus Ong, who is the medical director at UPEC and senior consultant at the department of emergency medicine at Singapore General Hospital. ""This is due to the rapidly ageing population and a rising prevalence of chronic diseases in Singapore, such as diabetes, hypertension and other underlying heart conditions,"" said the press release.Survival rates for such casualties have improved over the past decade, with 13.1 per cent of the 2,972 people who suffered from an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest having their hearts restarted at the scene or en route to the hospital. This was the highest from 2011 to 2018.This led to a ""record high"" of 175 survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in 2018. More than two-thirds of these survivors had ""good neurological function"" after being discharged.Part of this was a result of the ""tremendous"" improvement in bystander CPR rates over the years, said UPEC. In 2011, the bystander CPR rate was 22 per cent, increasing to 61.8 per cent in 2018. Meanwhile, the bystander AED usage rate went up from 1.8 per cent in 2011 to 7.2 per cent in 2018.""The dramatic improvement in bystander CPR rates over the past years is mainly attributed to the success of the Dispatcher-Assisted CPR programme,"" said UPEC. In 2018, 1,222 patients received dispatcher-assisted CPR. There were just 54 such patients in 2012.But there is ""much room for progress"", said UPEC, comparing Singapore to other countries with ""top-notch emergency medical services (EMS) systems"".In 2018, Singapore's Utstein survival rate was 25.9 per cent, compared to 56 per cent in Seattle, US, which has one of the highest sudden cardiac arrest survival rates in the world.The Utstein survival rate measures the percentage of patients who suffer an out-of-hospital cardiac arrest that were witnessed and had shockable heart rhythms who survived to discharge. ""The survival rates for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims has shown to increase with bystander CPR. Many a time, there is a fear about doing harm - like breaking ribs while doing CPR or being afraid to use the AED. ""The breaking of ribs will not cause greater harm to the individual than the benefits of maintaining circulation with CPR. The AED is also a simple machine to operate,"" said SCDF's chief medical officer Colonel Shalini Arulanandam.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

198,MOE says 'not true' that it interfered with transgender student's hormone therapy,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/transgender-student-hormone-therapy-moe-education-ministry-13974584,16 Jan 2021 10:57PM,"SINGAPORE: The Ministry of Education (MOE) said on Saturday (Jan 16) that allegations of its interference with a transgender student’s decision to go on hormone replacement therapy are ""not true"".The 18-year-old said in a Reddit post on Thursday that the ministry had intervened, preventing the junior college student from obtaining a doctor's referral letter to begin the hormone therapy.The Reddit post stated that the student had obtained a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), and that the therapy was recommended by multiple doctors attending to trans patients in Singapore.""MOE is aware of the Reddit post which claimed that MOE had interfered with a student’s hormonal treatment. This is not true,"" said the ministry in a Facebook post on Saturday.""We invite the student to approach the school to clarify and discuss how the school can support his schooling better,"" it added.""MOE and schools work closely with and respect the professional advice given by MOH’s healthcare professionals. We are not in a position to interfere with any medical treatment, which is a matter for the family to decide on,"" said the ministry.""All schools have a duty of care to students and will work closely with parents and medical professionals. We encourage students who experience unkind behaviour from peers to approach the teachers or school leaders as they are committed to keep students safe.""THREATENED WITH EXPULSIONSpeaking to TODAY, the student, who wanted to be known only as Ashlee, said that MOE did not address any of the issues laid out in the Reddit post.Ashlee had asked that the school not be named for fear of repercussions for speaking with the media, and requested to be referred to by she/her pronouns.She said she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019, adding that the situation with MOE and the school started around February last year.Ashlee told TODAY that she had notified the school's management of her diagnosis in March last year, and was asked to confirm this via a letter from the IMH psychiatrist. The letter was reportedly given to the school and MOE the same month.She said MOE told her through the school that it would work with her to understand her diagnosis and make school conducive for her.The school’s year head and counsellor had also sat in for at least one of Ashlee’s appointments with the psychiatrist, she said, adding that some school rules were relaxed during the time, citing the example of being allowed to use the wheelchair toilet.However, Ashlee told TODAY that when she was to proceed with hormone replacement therapy in August, she was informed by the psychiatrist that MOE had told the doctor to consult the ministry before any decision could be made regarding treatments for transgender students.Because of this, Ashlee said she has not received the letter to begin hormone replacement therapy.In the TODAY report, Ashlee said that during a meeting in October involving her father and the school management, she was told that she would have to continue wearing the boy's uniform. If hormone replacement therapy resulted in physiological changes that prevent her from doing so, she would be expelled from school, she said.According to Ashlee, the school's principal also requested to work personally with the endocrinologist to limit the dose of hormones so that expulsion was unlikely to happen.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

199,IN FOCUS: Should parents divorce or stay together for the kids?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/in-focus-singapore-divorce-parents-children-counselling-msf-13946820,16 Jan 2021 06:00AM,"A month after the release of an official study that investigated whether children of divorcees “suffer long-term disadvantages”, CNA looks at the pros and cons of couples staying together for the sake of their sons and daughters.SINGAPORE: Before Alex’s* parents got divorced, they fought almost every day. Sometimes, the fights would even escalate physically, with her mother inflicting self-harm by hitting herself and punching walls.  “It was terribly disruptive and scary as a young child to see my parents fight,” she told CNA. “The air in the room would always get so tense and my sibling and I would try to hide and make sure we did not do anything to anger my mum for the rest of the day (as) we were worried that we would be on the end of the hitting.”The fights were often over their different personalities and values. While her mother was ambitious, her father was relaxed and easy-going, and did not prioritise climbing the social ladder, Alex said.She first heard from her father when she was about eight years old that he did not see the marriage working out. “I was hurt at first. Confused as to why my parents had to divorce while I had friends whose parents tried to make it work.”But then, even as a child, she did have moments where she wondered if it was better for her parents to get divorced.“When I was nine, I told my mum to get a divorce,” she said. “She was shocked for me to say that, but I think she also felt relieved.”When her parents finally separated three years later, Alex said that she realised “how toxic and unhealthy their relationship was”, and she became ""happy"" that her parents separated.But the divorce came with its own set of challenges. After going their separate ways, Alex’s parents barely talked to each other. They avoided each other as much as possible and relied on her to be their go-between. “I had to go to the other parent and say, mum or dad wanted me to tell you … All the time.”As she did not have good role models of a “healthy and functional relationship”, Alex found that she picked up some of her parents’ behaviour, like using abusive language on her partners. “I spend a lot of time to identify and unlearn these abusive behaviours, such as communicating my needs and expectations rather than just assuming my partner should know it,” she said.LONG-TERM DISADVANTAGES FOR CHILDREN FROM DIVORCED FAMILIESIn December, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) released its first local study on whether children of divorcees “suffer long-term disadvantages”, and if so, the extent of these disadvantages. The study looked at the economic and marriage outcomes of about 9,000 Singaporeans with divorced parents, at the point when they turned 35 years old.To ensure that the study compared families of “similar profiles”, researchers matched children of divorced families with children of intact families on a “range of demographic characteristics”, such as gender, year of birth, parents’ age and highest qualifications attained at the point of marriage. However, it did not account for “unobservable attributes” such as the family environment.“While the results might not strictly inform us of the causal impact of divorce, they provide an indicative sense of children’s long-term outcomes associated with parental divorce, which would in turn help inform interventions for children when couples file for divorce,” researchers wrote.Overall, the study found that children from divorced families were less likely to obtain a university degree, earned less, had lower Central Provident Fund (CPF) balances, were less likely to marry and were more likely to divorce among those who were married. Said Minister for Social and Family Development Masagos Zulkifli: “With this landmark study, we now know that the effects of divorce on a child are not temporary, and impact the child’s future, his education and his family when he marries. This is why post-divorce, positive co-parenting is so important.”  “At the same time, all of us can play our part. If we know someone whose marriage is suffering, do reach out and encourage him or her to seek help early. We may not only save that marriage but also change the life of a child, for the better,” he added.The study drew criticism from the Association of Women for Action and Research (AWARE). It said in a Facebook post on Dec 11 that it was “concerned” that the study’s methodology “masks important subtleties in strength of family ties, income and others that may contribute to these outcomes”.“As the study stands, it makes a claim of strong correlation between divorce and the seemingly negative outcomes for children, without considering other factors that may undermine its claim,” AWARE wrote, adding that factors could include the strength and quality of family ties, income status of parents and whether the children were exposed to a stable housing environment in their childhood.The association added that it would be a “grave disservice” to parents and children if Singapore made getting divorces harder on the basis of the study.In Parliament on Jan 4, Second Minister for Education Maliki Osman also addressed schools’ support for children of divorced families, noting that schools monitor students affected by divorce and other issues “closely” and provide social, emotional and learning support if needed.“When the school is informed of a change in parents’ marital status by either the parents or the students, teachers will check in with the students and assess the needs to decide what support is appropriate and necessary,” he said.DOES THE “DIVORCE PENALTY” EXIST?Sam*, whose parents divorced after he became an adult, said that his parents' relationship had always been “lukewarm”. While his father did not seem to care, he felt that his mother tried to stay in the marriage for the sake of the children.However, a series of miscommunications built up conflict over the years, which escalated to physical violence. It was then that Sam’s parents decided to end their marriage of more than 30 years.Even though the divorce happened when he was an adult, Sam still felt that their relationship and the eventual split made him more critical of relationships and more cautious of marriage.“I feel that either way, a divorce is a painful experience for the kids,” he said. “The pain is still there, despite whether it happens in infancy or when they are adults.”He added that adults are more likely to understand what is going on and the social and economic consequences of parents’ breaking up.“I hence feel that there really isn't a difference, the pain is the same. But if it were me, I’d still want a divorce to take place when the kids are adults, because by then the kids would know how to take care of themselves. And even if it affects them, they won’t be physically left with zero support,” he said.Counsellors said that proper and peaceful co-parenting after a divorce is the best way to manage any potential long-term mental and emotional issues for children.Chief wellbeing officer of the Singapore Counselling Centre John Shepherd Lim said that children are affected mentally and emotionally if they do not adjust to the divorce well. This could impact the way they respond to social situations and conflicts growing up.In families where parents quarrel frequently, whether they are together or divorced is “poor role-modelling” and could cause children to become “equally abrasive” or “conflict-avoidant” where they believe that all conflicts are ""bad"".The child could also develop “low confidence” in marriage, affecting how they manage future romantic relationships.In addition, conflict could take attention away from the child, and they find themselves “lacking in nurturance and support”, he said.“The above can be mitigated but requires a high level of self-awareness and commitment of both parents to ensure that the child adjusts well to the divorce,"" said Mr Lim.Parents who feel ill-equipped to help their children cope should tap MSF's programmes and provide their children with professional counselling support, he added.He noted that co-parenting has been “proven” to be an effective arrangement for parents “emotionally mature enough” to keep the peace in front of their children and grow to manage their emotions well.“Both parents must be committed to still play parenting roles in the child’s life; where both parents focus on moving forward as individuals while giving of their best selves to the child,” he said.Dr Tracie Lazaroo, a clinical psychologist at Inner Light Psychological Services and LP Clinic, said she does not believe the “divorce penalty” exists.“(The divorce penalty) largely depends on the stigma perpetuated by society and the extent in which the stigma is projected onto those within the divorce,” she said.“Children are inherently resilient and can be correctly supported and taught to excel and despite earlier circumstances. They also tend to bounce back from adversity much quicker than adults.”She suggested that most issues surrounding a “divorce penalty” is due to parents' poor knowledge of how to care for themselves and their children post-divorce, which can be managed once learned.Individual differences of the person and family matter as well, she added.“There are many systemic and environmental factors that can cause a child to not succeed in life; divorce is not the sole psychosocial stressor,” she said, adding that these could include chronic illness or having to manage “significant financial difficulties”.On minimising the effect of the “divorce penalty” on children, MSF said: “Divorce only dissolves the marital relationship, not the parent-child relationship.”While the outcomes of children with divorced parents “were on average worse” compared to children whose parents remained married, “this does not necessarily mean that all children will have the same outcomes”, the ministry's spokesperson told CNA.“These outcomes can be mitigated with effective co-parenting and strong support from the extended family and community.”WHEN SHOULD PARENTS GET DIVORCED?While divorce could have a negative impact on children, there are cases which might make divorce a better option, said Dr Lazaroo.Those in emotionally and physically abusive relationships should consider divorce, she said. This also applies to cases where one or more parties “weaponises or uses children as collateral in any way”, such as making them messengers between parents or asking leading questions to create doubt and guilt in themselves or the other parent.Chronic substance abuse could be another reason for parents to divorce, said Mr Lim, as “the child is usually also deprived as a result of heavy financial debts and poor care”.In less severe situations, like constant disagreements and fights from “fundamental differences in personalities and values”, couples should consider the ages of their children and the duration of which the conflicts have been happening, he said. “Divorce should never be finalised in a fit of anger. However, it is also important to note that constant marital conflict can be equally stressful and unhealthy for a child’s development,” said Mr Lim.“If counselling has been sought and either one or both parties show consistent unwillingness to improve the relationship, co-parenting might be an option to consider, where parents continue being a part of the child’s life while they live separately.”Parents who choose to stay together will have to navigate “complexities which can be novel and numerous”, said Dr Lazaroo. “However, it is not impossible.”“It is better for parents to stay together when most of the needs of all parties involved (children and spouses) can be met and equally considered. This is also true if both have the capacity to love and support their partners through difficult times and approach issues as a union,” she added.While heated disagreements may be unavoidable in any long-term relationship, the way partners resolve the disagreements matter. They should treat each other with mutual respect, patience and kindness, said Dr Lazaroo.If partners feel that an event or action constitutes a “marriage deal-breaker”, it is up to them to state their expectations and decide if it is something they can reconcile and forgive or move forward with.“Leaving these important incidents unresolved can increase the potential for similar instances to reoccur in future, therefore couples should consider staying together if they are mutually willing to compromise,” she said.It is important to note that many things can be worked through, even if it may not seem like the case initially, said Mr Lim.When couples find themselves fighting over the same thing again and again, or when one or both of them are “caught in behavioural patterns that repeat themselves”, they should look to counselling as an option before divorce, he said.This is because divorce could have “far-reaching negative impacts” on their children, especially those aged six to 12 who “might not fully understand the complexities of the decision made but yet are old enough to experience and understand feelings of abandonment, pain, and loss”.Another reason is that repeated behaviours have “deeper emotional and psychological roots” that individuals should deal with through counselling.“In fact, it is a common sentiment for couples to realise that the issues which they once deemed to be unresolvable can be worked through with the help of experienced counsellors,” he said.However, he noted that the effectiveness of counselling is “highly dependent” on the couple’s willingness to be vulnerable with each other and work through their differences, and the individuals’ willingness to change.HOW THE GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS FAMILIES GOING THROUGH DIVORCEIn response to CNA’s queries, MSF said it is not for the ministry to suggest circumstances or situations where it might be better for couples to divorce.“We respect the decision of each couple, but together with the DSSAs (Divorce Support Specialist Agencies) and other social service agencies, we aim to support those who wish to reconcile and those who decide to divorce,” its spokesperson said.The Women’s Charter mandates that couples with minor children who “cannot agree on divorce or its ancillary matters” attend the Mandatory Parenting Programme before filing for divorce, noted the spokesperson.Those who can agree on divorce or its ancillary matters attend the Parenting Pact when their divorce is concluded.As for Muslim couples, they have to go through counselling and parenting programmes as part of the divorce process at the Syariah Court.Couples considering divorce may also make use of a new online counselling pilot with the Community Psychology Hub, or approach any of the 215 trained Marital First Responders in the community. The Marital First Responders are equipped to provide basic marriage support to couples facing marital issues, the spokesperson said.The Mandatory Parenting Programme, which is facilitated by the DSSAs, helps parents “gain knowledge and insights” on the divorce will affect their children and themselves in areas including financial, psychosocial or emotional, said Ms Cathy Ding, manager at Thrive Parenting!, a DSSA under AMKFSC Community Services Ltd.For instance, parents will learn how to discuss their divorce with their children in “an age-appropriate and consistent manner”, and “avoidasking their children to make tough decisions over their future living or visitation arrangement which might lead to loyalty conflict in children”, she said.As for children of divorce, the DSSAs provide counselling and the Children-in-Between (CiB) programme. The CiB is a “groupwork programme” that provides “a space for children to feel safe when sharing their experiences and talking about what is going on at home, particularly about how they have been exposed to and caught in between their parents’ arguments”.“They learn to be more in touch with their feelings and learn ways to express themselves to their parents. Children are also taught how to develop positive thinking and assertion skills to avoid being triangulated in their parents’ conflicts,” said Ms Ding.The DSSAs support about 6,000 to 8,000 families per year, said MSF's spokesperson.In the Family Justice Court, a child’s wellbeing is “of paramount concern”, said a spokesperson for the Court.Divorcing parents who have at least one child below the age of 21 years and have disputes concerning their children are required by law to attend counselling and mediation as part of their divorce proceedings, the spokesperson said.Those unable to reach an amicable outcome will go through a trial. In each case, a judge may appoint a Child Representative, a trained professional who can “understand and present the child’s best interests to the Court” to help the Court reach a decision on the child’s arrangements.“A Child Representative represents the voice of the child, providing an independent view of the child’s issues and presenting an objective assessment of the arrangements which are in the best interests of the child,” the spokesperson said.In addition, the Court could appoint a Parenting Coordinator, to help separated and divorced parents “learn to co-parent effectively”.“A Parenting Coordinator works directly with the parents to facilitate communication and assist them in resolving disagreements arising from custody and access orders. A Parenting Coordinator also helps parents implement the parenting plan contained in the court orders (eg, orders relating to child access),” said the spokesperson.“Thus, by helping parents communicate with one another to find ways to resolve parental disputes or disagreements through consensus instead of bringing the conflict back to Court, the Parenting Coordinator minimises the need for parents to regularly attend Court for new orders, among other things. With time, the goal is to have the parents co-parent and resolve conflicts on their own.”HOW TO HELP CHILDREN ADJUST TO A DIVORCEParents play a “pivotal role” in helping children adjust to a divorce, said Mr Lim. “How parents themselves react and adjust to the divorce affect the way the children adjust - they look towards the parents for assurance and signs that they can get through this together,"" he said.“It is important for parents to help the child feel safe, secure and loved throughout the process.”In the process of a divorce, younger children may learn that both parents do not love each other anymore and fear that the parents do not love them too, said Mr Lim. Older children may be angry at the parents for breaking up the family or blame themselves for the divorce.“Parents can offer support to the children by letting them vocalise their thoughts and feelings, and having open and honest conversations with them,” he said.Minimising disruptions to the children’s daily routine would help give them a “sense of security, control and stability”, as they cope with the changes at home, he added.Meanwhile, parents should remain civil to each other and keep conflict, tension, negativity and blame away from the children, he said.If there is more than one child in the household, parents should not show bias when each child shows different methods of coping. “When parents separate, children may find that they have lost a parent, which is why effective co-parenting is a great way to help children adjust to a divorce,"" said Mr Lim.“Co-parenting does not simply mean that parents take turns to spend time with the child. Having an active role in the child’s daily lives ensures that their needs are met and retains close relationships with both parents.""For effective co-parenting, parents will have to separate their personal relationship from the co-parenting relationship, he added.""No matter how bad the divorce was, parents should make shared decisions when it comes to their child and communicate with each other so that the child will feel confident of the love of both parents and will be able to adjust more quickly to new living conditions.""Ultimately, said Alex, after experiencing the break down of her parents’ marriage and their subsequent divorce, she believes that couples should only stay together if they respect each other, and do not bring out the other’s worst qualities.“There are definitely material and financial benefits to having parents staying together, but do these benefits come at an emotional and mental cost for both the parents and for the kids long-term?"" she said. “I think children know that their parents are staying for them in general. I think parents should consider how they are going to raise functional, respectful and emotionally mature children in general. Whether they do that, married or divorced, depends on their relationship and circumstances.""*Names have been changed to protect privacy.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

200,Commentary: Workplace surveillance may hurt us more than it helps,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/work-monitor-surveillance-tech-aws-panorama-safety-privacy-13943892,13 Jan 2021 06:05AM,"Surveillance technology could help in ensuring workplace safety amid the pandemic, but its outcomes depend on the people who wield it, says an observer.LONDON: You can’t fault Amazon’s timing. In the middle of a global pandemic, the online retailer has launched a new workplace surveillance tool that could help to slow COVID-19’s spread.Called AWS Panorama, it uses computer vision technology to analyse footage from security cameras in workplaces. It can detect when employees are not complying with social distancing rules, for example.Amazon, which plans to sell the tool to other employers, says it can improve workplace safety in other ways, too.“Are people walking in spaces where they shouldn’t be? Is there an oil spill? Are they not wearing hard hats? These are real-world problems,” a senior executive told the FT.It’s easy to see how the technology could help in the fight against COVID-19, since workplaces are a major source of transmission.It could reveal pinch points in factories where social distancing isn’t possible, for instance, which might prompt companies to redesign work processes.But, like any tool, the outcomes will depend on the people who wield it.LAYING THE BLAME ON WORKERSHaving read a lot of corporate safety incident reports over the years, I’m struck by how often CCTV footage is used to blame the worker who was hurt.In a recent example from a British meat factory (an industry where work pressures are often intense), a man fractured his hand when running to fetch a metal plate.“This is a behavioural safety issue [because he shouldn’t have run] and he will be disciplined upon his return,” the company wrote in the report to the UK’s health and safety regulator.There was no mention of why he felt the need to run in the first place.In this context, it’s not hard to imagine a future scenario where workers are blamed for contracting COVID-19, possibly with implications for their sick pay, by employers unwilling to consider their own role and responsibilities.NON-TRADITIONAL MONITORINGThere is also the possibility of mission creep.A testimonial on the AWS Panorama website from guitar-maker Fender enthused: “We can track how long it takes for an associate to complete each task in the assembly of a guitar so that we’re able to optimise efficiency and track key metrics.”The comment has now been deleted from the site.Many employers are exploring how to use technological surveillance to drive productivity and measure performance.In 2018, the research company Gartner surveyed 239 big companies and found more than half were using non-traditional monitoring techniques, up from 30 per cent in 2015.Gartner defines monitoring as things such as “analysing the text of emails and social-media messages, scrutinising who’s meeting with whom, gathering biometric data and understanding how employees are utilising their workspace”.Walmart, the US retailer, has filed a patent for a system of sound sensors placed near cashiers which could “determine a performance metric for the employee based on the audio data”.In the white-collar world, an array of companies are selling software that enables employers to monitor what workers do on their computers.Time Doctor, for instance, will take regular screenshots of each employee’s screen, measure their breaks and send nudges if they stray on to non-work related sites.Supervisors are given dashboards that show “who’s a superstar and who’s slacking off”.TOLL ON PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTHBut you don’t have to be a slacker to recoil at the idea of constant monitoring. Humans are hard-wired to feel uncomfortable being watched all the time, especially when under pressure to meet stretching targets.“It makes me afraid, physically and mentally exhausted,” Hibaq Mohamed, an Amazon warehouse worker, told researchers at the Open Markets Institute of the monitoring at work.A body of research suggests jobs that combine high demands (concentration requirements, workload, time pressure) and low control (discretion to make decisions and schedule one’s own work) are ruinous for human health.Our metabolic, cardiovascular and neuroendocrine systems produce short-term responses to stressful situations, but when the stress is chronic, it can damage our bodies or tempt us to self-medicate.One study in the US, published last year, found that people in high-demand jobs with low control were more likely to die than people in high-demand jobs with high control.Workplace surveillance should be subject to regulatory oversight and ideally collective bargaining, since individuals will be better placed to negotiate the details en masse.It would be a dispiriting irony if technology brought in to protect our health in a pandemic made us sicker in the end.Can you say no to returning to the office?

201,Commentary: Encourage seniors in digitalisation drive instead of forcing tech adoption on them,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/digital-transformation-smart-nation-can-leave-seniors-behind-13943332,13 Jan 2021 06:03AM,"As more activities of daily life, such as shopping and learning move online, one vulnerable group cannot be left on their own to figure things out, says this observer.SINGAPORE: There would be little contention in labelling 2020 as annus horribilis or a year of disaster or misfortune. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more than 1.7 million people died from COVID-19 last year and the numbers are still going up.The ensuing lockdown of cities, and even entire countries, plunged the global economy into what the World Bank stated as the worst recession since the Second World War.According to data from the International Monetary Fund, all major economies in the world, with the exception of China, are projecting negative Gross Domestic Product figures.Due to fear of the virus, grief of bereavement, worry for their livelihood, and stress from the consequential lockdown, cases of reported mental health issues also rose. A WHO study found that more than 60 per cent of the 130 countries surveyed reported disruption to their mental health services for vulnerable people.The rate of disruption to mental health services might have been higher if not for countries, such as Singapore, making the switch to telemedicine and teletherapy to maintain some level of service amidst the social distancing imposed by circuit breakers and lockdowns.  Hence, the rate of digital transformation to many facets of life, such as shopping, learning and working, which has been accelerated by the onslaught of COVID-19, should be seen more as enablement rather than disruption. Yet, technology remains a double-edged sword. Even as it allowed life to carry on to some degree of normalcy amidst the pandemic, it could also create a divide between people along the two ends of the technology savvy spectrum.SENIOR CITIZENS ARE MOST AT RISK OF BEING DIGITALLY DISRUPTEDIn Singapore, the plight of senior citizens is of particular concern as they are the least technologically savvy group in the population. Based on figures from a 2019 survey by the Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA), 58 percent of residents above 60 years old are internet users compared to 89 percent for all residents.As the elderly are among the least technologically savvy group in a population, there is a risk that digital transformation could become more of a disruption than an enablement for this demographic group. Moreover, with rising incidents of cyber-attack and online scams, it is increasingly unacceptable for senior citizens to only have a cursory level of digital knowledge and skill.   The IMDA launched the Senior Go Digital initiative in May 2020 to ensure that older adults are not excluded even as the rest of the country progress towards becoming a smart nation.For example, to ensure that telco mobile plans and smart phones remain affordable to senior citizens facing financial difficulties, there is the Mobile Access for Seniors scheme.However, the challenge that seniors face in adopting technology is not only financial, but also cultural and social.WORK AROUND SENIOR NEEDSCultural concerns include the language medium and genre of digital content which appeals to senior citizens.During the early phase of the circuit breaker when physical activities came to a halt, some of the regular activities that senior activity centres and community clubs organised for the elderly moved online.The Ministry of Communication and Information also co-organised dialect-speaking e-Getai shows that were streamed online to not only entertain but also educate seniors on COVID-19 protection.Besides online content in Mandarin and Chinese dialects, the IMDA also curated content in Malay and Tamil for older adults who are more conversant in their own mother tongue.There were already online content that would appeal to the culture of senior citizens even prior to these initiatives. For example, Hokkien and Cantonese old songs and videos of Chinese opera in various dialects could be found on major online media platforms, such as Youtube and Spotify.All these efforts indicates a more widespread appreciation of the need for content that appeals to the cultural disposition of the elderly in encouraging them to go digital, instead of coercing senior citizens to adopt technology just so that they will not be left out from the emerging smart nation.If a smart nation does not offer anything that appeals to the needs and lifestyle of senior citizens, they will feel left out of the digital transformation. But just having relevant content is not enough. Senior citizens will still have to acquire digital skills to search and access these contents.The government has set up SG Digital community hubs at various Community Clubs/Centres and also public libraries across the island. At these hubs, senior citizens can obtain one-on-one guidance in learning basic skills like how to download, password protect, make calls or text.Such an approach is more effective in encouraging seniors to pick up new digital skills from a warm-bodied person rather than written instruction or online video.FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT IS CRITICALWhile it is certainly beneficial to have these digital community hubs where older adults can receive help in learning digital skills, numerous studies have also shown familial and social support to have a positive effects in the learning of digital skills among this group of people.The results of these studies mirrored my own personal encounters. I know of an illiterate lady in her seventies. During the Circuit Breaker, her family bought her a smart phone so that they could video call her, since in-person visits were prohibited.As one of her grandchildren had given birth to her first great-grandchild during that period, her family made it a point to have daily video calls so that she get to see the infant.The yearning to see her great-grandchild and the support of her family enabled her to quickly learn to receive video calls. These days, she always brings her smart phone along when she is out meeting friends and would proudly show photos as well as videos of the infant to her friends.Adding to the importance of familial and social support, research has also shown the efficacy of intergenerational approaches in senior citizens learning of digital skills.What this means is that older adults are better at learning digital skills from their grandchildren. We may all know an elderly who is an active user and should they run into trouble, they go to their teenage grandchildren for help.But attention also needs to go towards supporting senior citizens who live alone. In the past, senior activity centres and schools have partnered to organise intergenerational bootcamps to support seniors in picking up digital skills.With the understanding that the effectiveness of such intergenerational learning relies on the relational connection, it may be more effective if senior learners and their younger guides can bond over more sustained and regular sessions, something schools can weave into their calendars.Whether COVID-19 eases up this year or next, a digital transformation will continue to be a big part of our lives.Considering the various initiatives the government has in place, the key piece of the puzzle for the digital inclusion of senior citizens are now in shape.The next lap to close the silver digital gap lies with each of us in reaching out to and supporting older folks in our own family and community in acquiring digital skills and being comfortable with using digital technology.This may be the crucial bit to ensure that nobody will be left behind in a digitally enabled smart nation.Associate Professor Calvin M.L.

202,Man given stern warning for trespassing into church and defacing Mother Mary statue,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-given-stern-warning-defacing-mother-mary-statue-church-13944008,12 Jan 2021 06:29PM,"SINGAPORE: A man who trespassed into a church and defaced a statue of Mother Mary has been given a stern warning, with the prosecution withdrawing all charges against him.Race Koh Jun Xian, 38, was given a discharge amounting to an acquittal on Monday (Jan 11) for a charge of criminal trespass and another of defiling a place of worship with intent to insult a religion.He had climbed over the fence and entered the courtyard of Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary along Upper Serangoon Road on Nov 2, Nov 5 and Nov 12 last year.On the last occasion, he used Blu Tack, a removable adhesive, to stick marbles to the eyes of a statue of Mother Mary.In a statement on Tuesday, the police said it administered a stern warning to Koh for the two offences, after consulting with the Attorney-General's Chambers (AGC).Both charges were withdrawn in court on Monday, and Koh was also warned for committing criminal trespass for the other two occasions.Koh had been remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for psychiatric assessment after his charging on Nov 20 last year and found to have an extensive history of substance use disorder.However, he was assessed to be of sound mind at the time of the third offence.""The man claimed that he had wanted to pray to the statue and intended to beautify it out of gratitude,"" said the police. ""Police investigations revealed the man did not think that he would be defiling the statue. No permanent damage was done to the statue by the man's act,"" they added in their statement. ""A stern warning was thus given, taking into consideration the overall context of the offences, and taking into account the period of remand served.""The penalties for criminal trespass are a jail term of up to three months, a fine of up to S$1,500, or both. The punishment for defiling a place of worship with intent to insult a religion is a maximum five years' jail, a fine, or both.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

203,Commentary: Here’s what I won’t miss about working from home,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/working-from-home-covid-19-offices-companies-colleagues-13920402,11 Jan 2021 06:00AM,"After nine months of working from home, and initially favouring it, many can’t wait to get back to the office, says PeopleStrong’s Adrian Tan.SINGAPORE:  I almost pumped my fists in the air when I first heard the news. We will receive our batch of COVID-19 vaccine, Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong revealed in a televised address on Dec 14. Even though I have severe trypanophobia - a fear of needles -  I will not hesitate to get vaccinated.Because after close to nine months of solid domestication, I am changing my tune about how wonderful it has been to work from home.I can’t wait to get back to the office. And if that means getting vaccinated, so be it.I'm not alone. A week into 2021, some offices are once again teeming with busy executives instead of empty halls of furniture as employers inch closer towards normalcy a fortnight into Phase 3.  Dr T Chandroo, chairman of the Singapore Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry (SICCI) recently told the media he “anticipates that more employees would gradually return to workplaces” and “that smaller companies would like all their staff to [be] present”.I know many executives are relieved to be able to end their romance with work-from-home and make their way to the office. I too share these sentiments and  won’t miss working from home. TOO MUCH FAMILY TIME?During my early 20s, I dated someone I was so into that I kept pestering to meet her every day. Being cool and having other priorities, she refused and taught me that perhaps “absence makes the heart grow fonder”.My young raging hormones impeded me from truly understanding the importance of distance and personal space. But fast forward to today, the 24/7 with my family during the circuit breaker last year made me understand the lessons of that bad romance.When the most exciting event of the workday is a heavy downfall that forced me to move from the balcony to my bed, I have few exciting stories to share with my family at the end of the day. And vice versa. No matter how loving a family one has at home, tensions can build up, especially when the circuit breaker meant seeing each other the full day for nine weeks. Without colleagues as my unfortunate sounding board about familial issues during that period, there was no outlet to release all those built-up pressures at home. Like what Sylvia Chan from Night Owl Cinematics shared in their video talking about her divorce, she can’t possibly complain to her husband Ryan Tan about her co-worker Ryan Tan.An amount of absence would provide a better balance to any relationship. Not just to sustain it but to reduce the number of conflicts as the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) learned in July 2020 when there was a 30 per cent rise in inquiries on family conflicts.LACK OF SOCIALISINGOutside of home, I have a daily routine involving writing down three amazing things that happened that day to me every evening. And my occasional face-to-face meeting with people would always be the first thing on the list.I recently caught up with an old friend I hadn’t met for years and we ended up chatting over three hours at Starbucks. This nostalgic bromance may not have been possible over a Zoom call.Socialising with others has been widely recognised to be an essential human need. That may be a key reason why we have felt more mental and emotional suffering during COVID-19 after needing to scale back on our engagement with others. There is a large body of medical and psychological research that suggests that socialisation and physical touch have positive benefits on individuals’ mental, emotional, psychological and medical well-being. Psychologist and social science columnist Susan Pinker explains that “face-to-face contact releases a whole cascade of neurotransmitters and, like a vaccine” protects humans. She adds thatduringsocial interactions, “dopamine is [also] generated, which gives us a little high and it kills pain, it’s like a naturally produced morphine.”Granted, I could get all that at home but the interactions at home tend to be slightly different. I wonder how many among us have the time and ability to have conversations and engagement with their family that go beyond the operational and mundane household matters? For those who don’t, having that socialisation outside is a much-needed complement.    Of course, I am not saying you should go around hugging everyone you see back at the office. A simple handshake and a nice chat over lunch or at the pantry may be good enough to satisfy our needs.THE ON-DEMAND HOUSEHOLD BUTLERAlthough my colleagues were unable to do their usual office deskside drive-by to disrupt my workflow when all of us had to make the work-from-home leap, such distractions did not disappeared. Instead, they were replaced by a worse version led by the kids and the missus.The remote isn’t working, someone needs a towel or questions when dinner will be ready are among the many countless requests that I simply don't have the arms and legs for. These suspiciously seemed to be timed perfectly with an important work commitment - like when I’m about to do up a quarterly budget for the department or start the weekly Zoom meeting with the team.Headphones can help. However, my four kids don't understand Do Not Disturb cues. Worse, these fuel their curiosity to find out what I’m listening to, leading them to grab my headphones to find out.NEVER KNOCKING OFFThe line between work and home disappears when you start working from home.During the earlier days of phase 1, I practically sat at the dining table from sunlight until sundown working. The only push factor to stop was when the family needed the table for dinner or when the evening mosquitoes became unbearable.It is not a unique situation.Some clients of Jeanette Lim, a psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health, are putting in more than 50 hours a week. And there is hardly any breather since many of us are working with little to no interaction with other people.Throw in some overly diligent colleagues with lots of time on their hands, and you are likely to find yourself a part of an email tennis match with the obligatory volley of messages going past dinner time and sometimes supper too.Contrast that to an actual office environment. Once I am out of the building, I’m out.  MY MAKE-SHIFT HOME OFFICEWithout the luxury of a dedicated study room, I have to hotdesk between my dining table, sofa or on my bed depending on the availability. It may sound cosy but my body, especially my back, will usually be screaming otherwise an hour into my work.These are places that are not ergonomically designed for work. I also have a sucky webcam on my old laptop. Video calls tend to make me look like a character from the Minecraft video game. And depending on the time and day, my Zoom calls could come with complimentary but rather unwelcomed background audio ranging from construction noises and screaming kids to barking dogs.I was truly elated when we were forced to work from home due to COVID-19.No more time-wasting commute, impromptu disruptions, last-minute meetings, early morning decisions on what to wear and rigid working hours.But the price to pay is huge when you lean all the way to the other side.Working from home still has its merits and I am okay with it as part of the working arrangement but not entirely.An office and the colleagues that come with it is a good counterweight to the makeshift need of working from home. The sense of camaraderie and community at work adds another dimension to our lives, including a sense of fulfilment.And after such a long period of absence, I can’t deny the excitement of meeting and catching up with colleagues again.. I will savour that moment as much as possible just before the two-hour meeting calendar invite hits me.

205,The retiree who transformed a sparse plot of land into three award-winning gardens,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/retiree-community-garden-hdb-plants-trees-13920774,10 Jan 2021 06:01AM,"SINGAPORE: Nine years ago, Mdm Lee May La, 64, nearly lost her life.She had gone to Australia to attend her son’s graduation when she had a sudden onset of meningitis - an infection of the membranes that cover the brain and the spinal cord - which left her unconscious in an Australian hospital.For two months, she could not walk. And with the medication she had been taking, she started suffering from reduced bone density.“The doctor (told) me, you need vitamin D,” she said, which is why she joined her fledgling neighbourhood community garden as a full-time volunteer in 2012.When asked if she found the work taxing at first, as she had been recovering from her infection, Mdm Lee, who is now retired, said: “Once you enjoy, you don’t feel anything.”Now, almost a decade later, she manages the three award-winning community gardens in her Bukit Batok neighbourhood, runs workshops for gardeners and has been enlisted to work on several other gardening projects, including a garden for patients with dementia at the Institute of Mental Health. Her bone density has also returned to normal.A FEW CROPS AND MANY QUARRELSAnyone visiting the three community gardens at Bukit Batok Central will be struck by the size of the plots. Where most community gardens tend to be smaller, Mdm Lee’s gardens span the length of the adjacent Housing and Development Board (HDB) flat, covering about 20,000 sq ft.The first is a sprawling vegetable garden, and at 10,000 sq ft, it is brimming with salad greens, fruit trees and koi ponds. In the corner, there is a small hydroponics set-up, built by the volunteers themselves. It even has a long-tailed myna that says phrases in Teochew and Mandarin.The second garden, at 3,000 sq ft, takes its inspiration from art. Donated sculptures are the centrepieces here, and a small path guides the visitor through the garden.The last garden, a 7,000 sq ft plot, is dedicated solely to fruit trees - there are papaya trees, banana trees and even a temperate Brazilian Grape Tree that has somehow managed to flourish in Singapore’s humid, tropical environment. But this community garden did not always look like this. When she started in 2012, said Mdm Lee, the garden was only a third of its current size, with only a few fruit trees and few individual lots.The community gardeners were also individualistic and fought often, she said, recalling that they often quarrelled over soil and gardening implements.“I (didn't) like seeing everyone fight,” she said. So when she took over as garden leader in 2014, she started to put the garden in order. “I found (the individual plots) very messy. The aunties simply plant anything inside, like rojak,” she said. “And then after that I influenced the uncles and aunties. I don’t divide. Once I take over (as) garden leader, I don’t let them become (individualistic). All plant together, all share together.”Over the course of a year, she bonded the quarrelling gardeners together by organising monthly birthday parties, volunteer potlucks and sharing her own produce with everyone else.Now, they all work together as a team to maintain the garden. According to Mdm Lee, there are about 20 to 30 volunteers and 10 active gardeners working on the plots, with the oldest aged 80 and the youngest aged 17.“I LIKE TO SEE THE GREENERY”Although the residents volunteer their time, there are still new plants and fertilisers to buy. In all, Mdm Lee forks out a few hundred dollars a month to maintain the community garden.She said with a laugh: “My husband said, you take my salary and you spend in the garden.”For her latest project, the hydroponics garden, Mdm Lee spent a further S$3,000, topping up the money already subsidised by the Residents’ Committee.But her dedication does not stop there. Every time before she plants something new, she will do her research on Google to make sure she understands how to care for the crop. She, along with five other gardeners, also used their SkillsFuture credits to attend a one-day course on hydroponics.She even went to Chiang Mai, Thailand, with two other volunteers to learn how to make enzymes, which they use to enrich the soil.To spread her love and knowledge of gardening, Mdm Lee started to work with childcare centres in the vicinity to educate preschool children about the plants and crops in the community gardens as well.For her future plans for the gardens, Mdm Lee just wants to “plant something special”, something different for the children who visit her garden.She also wants to add an arch to the entrance of her second garden and plant more flowers and plants over the sculptures, so that when people look over the community gardens, they can see a “small botanic gardens”.“I like to see the greenery,” said Mdm Lee, on why she likes gardening. “I saw the children, so happy, looking at the crops. I feel so satisfied. And now you see our volunteers, so (harmonious), like kampong spirit, I feel so good.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

206,"More turn to mindfulness, mental wellness programmes to cope with stress from COVID-19",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mental-wellness-programmes-mindfulness-courses-covid-19-stress-13904826,09 Jan 2021 06:00AM,"SINGAPORE: Minutes into a mindfulness workshop, a participant tears up as she tells the people gathered in the room that she hopes to get help as she feels she is “not doing well” in life. She apologises for the mild outburst but moderator Associate Professor Angie Chew tells her it’s okay, and an assistant offers a hug. Of the more than 30 participants at the workshop, a fair number shared that they have experienced sudden changes in their lives, either due to the COVID-19 pandemic or a family member falling ill.They were hoping to learn techniques to better manage their stress or anxiety at the Mindfulness-based Stress Reduction (MBSR) workshop organised by non-profit organisation Brahm Centre, which started on Jan 5.MBSR workshops, created by Dr Jon Kabat-Zinn at the University of Massachusetts Medical School in 1979, helps people cope with stress, depression or anxiety. A secular practice, it is now offered in many settings around the world, including hospitals, schools and prisons.“I suppose (this is) because people have no idea where to go. So this is not just a physical getaway but it's a mental vacation,” said Assoc Prof Chew. “Because it's overthinking that causes burnout.”She told CNA that there have been more inquiries about the centre’s mindfulness courses since the “circuit breaker” period in April, and there is a waitlist for their classes and workshops. The centre trained more than 23,000 people last year, a three-fold increase from 2019. A large number of these were from corporate workshops, and also from a mindfulness conference in August that saw 5,000 people sign up.MORE CORPORATE WORKSHOPSYoga and meditation studios told CNA that they have seen a similar situation - mindfulness classes, which tend to be in small groups, are oversubscribed.The Singing Bowl Gallery, which focuses on sound meditation, now holds daily classes due to restrictions on class sizes and increased demand. The number of people who attend its classes each month has increased from 15 before the pandemic to about 40 people.Ms War War Lwin Tun of Ohmsantih Yoga said that she used to get more requests to run physical yoga workshops, but last year, the number of meditation and mindfulness workshops for companies went up significantly. She now runs at least four such events a month.“I think companies also have that awareness now that my employees may be more stressed than before,” she said.Ms Dawn Sim, director at The Open Centre, which runs mindfulness and mental resilience programmes, said that more people have come forward to take their courses. In addition, the corporate workshops they run have switched from focussing on leadership to being about managing stress and anxiety.Health Can Be Fun, a health consultancy that helps organise wellness workshops, has also seen the number of mental wellness programmes they run increase about three times in 2020, from one or two a quarter to one a two a month.Companies from a range of industries have shown interest in training for stress management, mindfulness and resilience building, and workshops that teach breathing techniques and art-based therapy have proven to be popular, a company spokeswoman said.""In Asia and Singapore, there has often been a stigma surrounding mental health and seeking help. However, COVID-19 has certainly changed the landscape. Since the start of COVID-19, many companies and individuals experience the impact of poor mental wellness and health,"" she said.WHY THE INCREASE? The emergence of a new disease and the effects it has had on society and the economy may have something to do with this phenomenon.The fear and anxiety triggered by COVID-19 and its consequences can be overwhelming for some, said Ms Sara-Ann Lee, a senior clinical psychologist from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH).“The pandemic has emphasised the importance of mental wellness given that many countries had to enforce policies that required physical distancing among individuals in order to control the spread of the virus.”She added that many reported feeling lonely, isolated and depressed due to “lockdown” measures in many countries. In Singapore, the circuit breaker lasted for two months and many employees lost their jobs or had their pay cut, while some businesses struggled to survive despite substantial subsidies from the Government.Most people have had to adapt to safe distancing measures and new rhythms as schools and offices shifted to their homes.Travel restrictions which have stopped people from going overseas for leisure may also have led to the increase in demand for mental wellness programmes, as people have more time in Singapore, some studios said.MORE HELP AVAILABLEIn October, the Government set up a COVID-19 Mental Wellness Taskforce to tackle the pandemic’s impact on mental health.Announcing the formation of the task force on Oct 10, which was World Mental Health Day, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said that with COVID-19, more people are facing stresses, pressures and disruptions to their lives and livelihoods.“Health authorities around the world must not only fight COVID-19, but also manage its impact on the mental health of their populations,"" he said then.The Ministry of Health Office for Healthcare Transformation (MOHT), along with other public service agencies, has also launched the mindline.sg website, which helps people assess their mental well-being and consolidates resources that they can tap to cope with stress. In mid-October, an AI penguin chatbot named Wysa was added to the site.As of Dec 28, more than 100,000 have used the site, MOHT said.Ms Wong Yin Li, who heads the youth division of Fei Yue Community Services, said that resources such as mindline can be useful because people can seek help anonymously and in their own time.“It is very good for clients who need to understand more and feel safer before they can do the next step of going for face-to-face services,” she said.Practitioners CNA spoke to also suggested that those who want to start practising mindfulness can have a taste of it by turning to mobile apps, before deciding if they want to commit to classes or workshops.Ms Sim said: “They can start anywhere, anytime ... there are lots of good apps around, and if they want more support, then they can sign up with one of the centres. It’s a way of life and they don’t have to wait until they finish that project, or when they resign.”WAYS TO RECOGNISE AND RESPOND TO STRESSIMH’s Ms Lee said that in the new year, an increased focus on mental wellbeing is likely to continue as people start to become more aware about these issues and take steps to look after their own mental wellbeing.“Stress is a normal part of our day to day lives, even more so that the fight against COVID-19 continues. We all need to be able to recognise and respond by developing healthy ways to cope with stress,” she said.Ms Lee recommends that people control the amount of information they read regarding the pandemic and trust only reputable sources of information.They should also try to maintain work-life balance despite working from home by setting appropriate boundaries and sticking to a regular work schedule if possible.“Take care of your body by ensuring adequate nutrition and sleep, coupled with exercise. Make time for self-care activities to relax and unwind,” she added.Assoc Prof Chew said there are times when it can be hard to manage one’s repetitive thoughts and worries, despite resolving to do so - which is when mindfulness techniques can be useful.Very often, it’s the inability to let go of what has happened that leads to suffering and negative emotions perpetuating, and having the right “foundational attitudes” can help, she said.“The foundational attitudes of mindfulness is to be curious so that you are less judgmental; to accept what you can't change in that moment in time … to be able to be grateful for what we already have instead of letting the mind focus on what is lacking,” she said.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

207,"Family treated woman as slave, knocked out teeth, poured hot water and chained her to toilet bowl",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/family-treated-woman-as-slave-knocked-teeth-poured-hot-water-13914012,07 Jan 2021 07:15PM,"SINGAPORE: A woman who initially sought refuge with a family after running away from home became their slave after angering one of the women by engaging in a sex act with her husband.Four of the family members pleaded guilty on Thursday (Jan 7) to various crimes including assaulting the 30-year-old woman and lying to the police to protect the family.Muhammad Iskandar Ismail, 32, received two months and four weeks' jail for lying to the police and voluntarily causing hurt. His brother Muhammad Iski Ismail, 29, was jailed for eight months for lying to the police and asking his brother to lie as well.Their two sisters, 39-year-old Hasniza Ismail and 34-year-old Haslinda Ismail, will be sentenced at a later date. The victim was made to do chores without pay, confined in the flat for one-and-a-half years and chained nightly either to a bed, a metal plate fixed to a wall or to the toilet bowl.The two sisters and their mother, Hasmah Sulong, abused the victim by twisting her toes with a pair of pliers, knocking out her teeth with a hammer and splashing boiling water on her groin area. Even though she suffered burn injuries and blisters and became incontinent, none of the family members called for medical help. Instead, they applied Dettol, cream or medication on the wounds.It was only when Hasniza noticed that the victim was too weak to get up, or eat and had dark liquid flowing from her mouth and nose that she called for an ambulance.For weeks before this, the victim had been chained half-naked to the toilet bowl in the kitchen sitting in her own excrement and eating off the bathroom floor. She was taken to hospital and found to be dangerously ill, suffering from pneumonia and with sepsis from her burn wounds. Healthcare workers expected her to die.The 30-year-old woman, who has intellectual disabilities and is considered a vulnerable victim, had multiple injuries over her body - deformities in her ears, 10 missing teeth, a deformed toe - and was severely malnourished. She required eight hours of resuscitation in the Emergency Department and was transferred to another hospital in light of her severe burn injuries. She eventually recovered and was discharged more than three months after admission, but still suffers permanent deformity in her ear.HOW IT BEGANThe court heard that the victim got to know the Ismail family as she went to school with one of the siblings. After running away from home in early 2016, the victim began staying with them and agreed to pay the matriarch of the household, Hasmah Sulong, S$150 for laundry and slept on a mat in the living room.Hasniza knew that the victim was intellectually slow and had mental problems, and admitted thinking of her as ""a girl who was easy to eat"", meaning she would comply with instructions, even those involving sexual acts.Hasniza discussed with Haslinda that they should make the victim their ""babu"", or slave. Hasniza would punish the victim by slapping or hitting her whenever she did something ""wrong"" such as being unhygienic, lying or not obeying orders.Between May and June 2016, Haslinda accused the victim of performing fellatio on her husband, 33-year-old Egyptian Hany Aboubakr Abdelkarim Abdelfattah. She made him slap the victim and after this incident, the family began the abuse.On one occasion, Haslinda poured hot water from a kettle onto the victim, scalding her stomach, thigh and groin. The victim indicated she was in pain, and Haslinda told her to stop groaning or she would splash the hot liquid on her again.Afraid, the victim did not tell anyone what happened and other family members only found out about the scalding when they noticed the victim's trousers sticking to her burn wounds.VICTIM'S FATHER BEGGED HER TO RETURN HOMEIn June 2016, the victim's father went to her workplace at a fast food outlet and pleaded with her to return home. She agreed and secretly packed her clothes as she was afraid the Ismails would not let her leave. They had earlier confiscated her passport and NRIC.She told Haslinda she was leaving the family only after she arrived at work, but Haslinda turned up at the restaurant demanding for outstanding laundry fees and probing the victim on her reasons for leaving. Haslinda took the victim's phone and made her follow her back to the flat. But she confined the victim in the flat and did not allow her to return to work. The victim was forced to perform household chores without pay.She did not attempt to flee, as she was chained up at night, the court heard, and the family threatened to smear her reputation by saying they would call her a thief if she tried to escape.The family also took the victim to clean a house in Malaysia and Haslinda once splashed hot oil on her there, causing burn injuries from her armpit to her waist and near her buttocks. The victim was made to wear a tudung when returning to Singapore to conceal the injuries on her cheek.After the victim stopped working at the fast food outlet in June 2016, Haslinda's assaults grew worse. On her mother's instigation, she used a hammer to knock out two of the victim's upper front teeth and poured more hot water on her lower body and thighs.Haslinda also used a pair of pliers to twist a toe on the victim's left foot while her mother Hasmah did the same to the victim's right toes.Haslinda had alleged that the victim was stealing from her so Hasmah asked the older sister Hasniza to buy a metal chain meant for securing bicycles in order to chain the victim at night.THE CHAININGOn most nights, Hasmah chained the victim's hands or legs to a baby swing in the living room, securing it with a padlock. She was concerned that the victim would run away or steal food, and only released her in the mornings.After one of Hasmah's sons saw the victim shifting the swing at night to use the toilet, Hasmah instructed one of her sons to affix a metal plate with a hook to a wall so they could chain and secure the victim there.The victim was then chained to the metal plate, with the loops around her hands or legs and occasionally around her neck. She was in this position between eight and 12 hours daily, and had to sweep and mop the house before she was allowed to eat breakfast.She was also tasked to look after the children in the flat. On one occasion, Hasmah assumed that the victim had poked Iskandar's son with her finger as the boy's eye was red. She told Iskandar about this, but the victim denied it and he did not pursue further.However, a few days later, he saw the victim pulling his son's hand and confronted her. When she said it was nothing, Iskandar grew angry and asked if she had poked his son's eye on purpose previously. He slapped and punched her in the stomach and performed a leg sweep, resulting in her falling to the ground. THE HARI RAYA HAJI INCIDENTAround the Hari Raya Haji festive period in September 2017, Haslinda asked the victim to come to her flat to help her with the celebratory preparations. When the victim got there, Haslinda refused to let her use the toilet or sleep. Instead, Haslinda made her stand in the kitchen until the next morning. When the victim lost control of her bladder and urinated on the floor, Haslinda punched, slapped and hit her with a broomstick, hanger and towel.She tied the victim's limbs with cable ties and made her continue standing in the kitchen in her soiled trousers even when other family members arrived for the Hari Raya celebrations.When Hasmah arrived with two packets of rice noodles for the victim, Haslinda threw away one packet and urinated into the other, which she made the victim eat.Sometime around October or November 2017, the victim began suffering from urinary and faecal incontinence. When her condition worsened, she was moved to the toilet and chained to the toilet bowl for most of the day.Hasniza threw away the metal chain before the police could seize it, and the metal plate outside the room was also removed and plastered over before investigations began.The family would admit to using the chain and metal plate later during investigations.Haslinda moved out of the flat in October or November 2017, but returned to her family home on one occasion. When she was there again, she punched the victim twice in the stomach and made her pull her ears and do squats.Hasniza saw this and tried to stop Haslinda, and they began quarrelling. In her anger, Hasniza used a baseball bat to hit the victim on her back and right arm. She later threw the bat away.HER DETERIORATING STATEFrom late December 2017, the victim could no longer control her bowels and was chained half-naked to the toilet bowl in the kitchen bathroom, where she sat in her own excrement and ate off the floor.Although she was very weak by this point and an unbearable stench was emanating from her, none of the family members sought medical treatment for her, the court heard.The abuse continued until around mid-January 2018, when the victim was too weak to get up or eat, and had a very smelly discharge coming from her vaginal area. Dark liquid was also flowing out from her mouth and nose, and Hasniza, who would clean her, noticed this. She washed the victim's body repeatedly with 15 bottles of Dettol or alcohol, but still found the smell unbearable and noticed that the burn wounds were swelling and oozing pus.Hasniza called for an ambulance and the victim was taken to the hospital near death. She was admitted to the intensive care unit. Doctors found that she suffered multiple injuries including large scalp lacerations, cuts on her face, cuts on her lips, deformities in both ears, damage to her cornea and burns on 30 per cent of her body.An IQ assessment revealed that she scored in the low or extremely low ranges for several categories except her processing speed index, which could not be assessed as the victim was unable to perform the tests due to visual disability arising from the abuse.She was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and found to have mild intellectual disability since childhood and with deficits in intellectual functions that would have affected her ability to seek help.When they were questioned by the police, the family members initially denied the crimes on Hasniza's instruction and claimed that the victim had turned up at their house two weeks earlier. Iski, Hasniza's brother eventually told the truth.The prosecution sought nine-and-a-half years' jail for Haslinda, calling this ""an appalling case of abuse, cruelty and vileness"". The victim treated the Ismails as her family, but they essentially treated her as a slave, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Ang Feng Qian.SHE WAS ABUSED BY FAMILY: DEFENCE FOR HASLINDAHaslinda's lawyer Audrey Koo said her client ""has not had an easy life"" and had a ""tumultuous relationship with her family"".She claimed that Haslinda was abused by her family since she was young and molested by her father. During the offences in 2017, her father died and her husband was jailed in Malaysia, while she suffered a miscarriage, said Ms Koo.Haslinda was also made to pay rent, and the lawyer said that if she did not, her mother or sister would chase her and her children out of the flat. Her child was also diagnosed with global development disorder, and Haslinda has been suffering from depression, said Ms Koo.The lawyer added that Haslinda ""felt provoked"" by the victim during some of the acts, claiming that the victim made offensive comments about Haslinda's son being ""illegitimate and not circumcised"".She argued that Hasmah, being the head of the household, instigated the abuse and chaining. ""Haslinda also lived under the mercy of Hasmah and the rest of the family,"" she said.After Haslinda moved out, she was ""completely unaware of the state of the victim"" and was ""shocked and horrified by the extent of the abuse"" when her lawyers showed her photos.Haslinda's husband was given three weeks' jail in November for his role in the case, while Hasmah's case is pending in the High Court.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

208,Former school bus driver jailed for locking 3-year-old girl in van without ventilation for more than an hour,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/school-bus-driver-jailed-locking-girl-van-without-ventilation-13903720,06 Jan 2021 01:13PM,"SINGAPORE: Upset that he was not being paid more to take extra students to school, a school bus driver locked a three-year-old pupil in his minivan for more than an hour without ventilation. Zulkahnai Haron, 47, was given 10 months' jail, fined S$3,000 and banned from driving for a year on Wednesday (Jan 6). He pleaded guilty to one count of ill-treating a child by causing her unnecessary suffering and an unrelated traffic charge.The court heard that Zulkahnai was a driver at a transport services company, taking students to and from school on designated routes. On the morning of Jan 20 last year, Zulkahnai reported to work as usual and had finished dropping off the students on his routes when his supervisor asked him to pick up more students.Zulkahnai asked if he would receive an extra allowance for this, but ""did not receive a satisfactory answer"" from the supervisor and began feeling unhappy.He did take one extra student to school but remained upset about the allowance. Despite knowing that the victim was still in the minivan, he asked the bus attendant to leave first, breaching company policy stipulating that bus attendants could leave only when all the students had left the bus. Instead of taking the last pupil to school, Zulkahnai drove home and parked his van in a multistorey car park at Admiralty Drive at about 9am.He left the girl in the van, locked it and went to buy food at a stall before going to shop for groceries at a supermarket. After this, he went home.At about 10am, a man walking in the car park with his wife heard a voice saying ""hello, hello"" coming from the minivan.They found the victim inside sobbing and calling for her mother, still strapped in to her seat with a safety belt. The man called Zulkahnai, whose number was listed on the vehicle, while his wife called the school and took a photo of the girl.HE LIED TO PASSERS-BY AND POLICEWhen Zulkahnai got back to his vehicle, the woman scolded him, but Zulkahnai told her not to worry, as it was ""only a few minutes"". He said he would take the girl to school, but the woman insisted on tagging along as she was concerned about the girl's safety.When they got to the school, the woman told the victim's teacher what had happened.Zulkahnai was not forthcoming in investigations. In his statement to the police, he said he had left the victim unattended for about 30 minutes to return home to change. He claimed he had a stomach ache and had inadvertently soiled his pants.He maintained this account until he was confronted with closed-circuit television footage of him in the supermarket. He eventually admitted leaving the victim in the van as he was upset about his allowance.He admitted that he had returned to the van only after receiving a call from the passer-by and that he lied as he was afraid of getting more charges if he told the truth.VICTIM SUFFERED PTSD, AFRAID OF BEING ALONEThe victim was examined at the Institute of Mental Health's child guidance clinic and found to have suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the incident.According to the victim's mother, the girl was scared to be alone and could not sleep without her mother for six months after the incident. She was also afraid to take the school bus as she was afraid the driver would forget about her and leave her alone inside.Zulkahnai also admitted to an unrelated charge of beating a red light in April last year and causing injuries to a motorcyclist who fell while avoiding a collision.Deputy Public Prosecutor Yang Ziliang asked for a year's jail as well as a fine of S$3,000 and a driving ban of one year.He said this was the first prosecution under the newly amended law for unnecessary suffering caused to a child. Statistics show that the number of child abuse cases has increased more than twofold over the last nine years, said Mr Yang, and any sentence imposed must strongly deter other offenders.""She was locked in the bus for more than an hour, unable to move or get help. The pain she must have suffered at that point in time would be very hard to calibrate,"" he said. ""We submit that the psychological wounds, while invisible to the eye ... will leave an indelible mark on the victim's psyche.""Zulkahnai committed an egregious breach of trust and was dishonest during investigations, the prosecutor added. VICTIM NOT PHYSICALLY HURT: DEFENCEDefence lawyer Sofia Bennita Mohamed Bakhash said there was no element of physical hurt to the child, although she was in discomfort. She was not hurt or bruised, and there was no indication of breathing difficulties while she was in the van.Ms Sofia said there was a concern over the child guidance clinic report, as it was taken a while after the incident and via the mother, so there ""could be inflation of the issues raised"".Her client was facing ""financial difficulties"" at the time of the offences and has since changed his line of work, staying away from anything vehicle-related and working as a security guard.A jail term would affect his family life, as he has two school-going children aged 17 and 18 he has to support, said the lawyer.In response, the prosecutor said it was fortuitous that the van had not been parked under the sun or more harm could have been caused. District Judge Marvin Bay said he understood that Zulkahnai's frustrations arose from not receiving extra allowance for the additional passengers, but said he had placed the child in a potentially dangerous situation.""Alone and restrained in the unventilated van, the three-year-old child would be at risk of oxygen deprivation if left there long enough,"" he said, adding that ""we do not know how long you would have left the child in the vehicle"" if not for the passers-by. He noted Zulkahnai's plea of guilt and clean record, but also considered the element of premeditation he had by discharging the bus attendant before parking the vehicle and his attempt to conceal the crime.For ill-treating a child, he could have been jailed for up to eight years, fined up to S$8,000 or both.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

The police said they were alerted to the incident at 9.28pm, and found an 18-year-old man lying motionless at the location.He was pronounced dead at the scene by a paramedic, said the Singapore Civil Defence Force (SCDF). A passer-by at the scene, Mr Kia Kin, told CNA he was heading towards Raffles Place MRT station when he saw an SCDF ambulance and several police officers in the area.

211,"Commentary: Not quite winter in Singapore, but no shame in bringing out the sweaters and jackets",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/commentary-not-quite-winter-in-singapore-but-no-shame-in-13897166,06 Jan 2021 06:05AM,"Sweater weather has arrived, says Cherie Tseng, as Singaporeans have responded to the cold weather by pulling out their warmer clothing from the wardrobes.SINGAPORE: I discovered, somewhere at the start of December, that my three year-old didn’t own a jacket.He had one when he was younger since we had travelled to Japan in the winter, but given how 2020 produced the less-than-stellar prospects of near-future travel and our island nation’s generally hotter temperature range, it wasn’t till we hit a spate of rainy days that we realised our little one needed warmer clothing.Every year, at least in recent memory, right around Christmas and New Year’s Day, Singapore’s usually balmy and humid weather, gives way to torrential rain and a slight cooling.When the dawn of this new decade brought with it days of incessant, relentless rain, my eight year old-son opined that it wasn’t just raining cats and dogs, it felt more like raining “mammoths and dinosaurs”.IS WINTER HERE?I’d bet the weather apps must have seen a huge uptake with every other person checking in on the temperature.It even became a competition among some to see who could record the coldest temperature or whose home was in the coolest spot in Singapore. Instagram stories carried screenshots of the weather like a warped game of social one-upmanship before a friend won the raffle and posted one that read “22 degrees out, but feels like 20 degrees”.In some parts of Singapore  like Woodlands, Bukit Panjang, Newton and Upper Bukit Timah, mercury levels fell to as low as 21 degrees Celsius, while across the island it hovered around 23-24 degrees Celsius as torrential rains hit us in the few days of the new year.Experts have said that these rains and low temperatures may continue for a few more days yet, even right through till mid-January or later. On Dec 31, the Meteorological Service Singapore said “the rainfall for first half of January 2021 is expected to be above average over most parts of the island”.Dr Matthias Roth, Professor of Urban Climatology at the National University of Singapore, suggested the “prolonged rain spells should disappear once the dry phase arrives in February”.  Far from a conversation starter platitude, yet the weather was all anyone could talk about over the New Year period.Unsurprisingly, Singaporeans have responded to the cold weather by pulling out their warmer clothing from the wardrobes. Sweater weather has arrived. Winter is here. Or some version of it anyway.RAINING ON THE PARADETik Tok Singapore released a little tongue-in-cheek post of a guy dressed in a singlet with the caption: Rest of the world when its 22 degrees. It cuts immediately to a bundled up version of the man in all his winter beanie and scarf glory, sipping a hot beverage with the descriptor: Singapore when its 22 degrees.Local media site SGAG said what was on everyone’s mind: Time to bring out all the winter clothes we didn’t get to wear in 2020! Accompanying it was a photo of a hoodied-out fella next to a faux TV fireplace. A small Christmas stocking hung in the corner.Even Her World Singapore capitalised on what must be a slow season for Winterwear in the country: “Now’s the best time to don knitwear and live out your winter style dreams,” they posted on Facebook, followed by a post on 10 pretty knitwear for sweater weather in Singapore. On my Facebook feed, everyone became a Winter Collection fashion consultant wondering out loud on who’s broken out their winterwear yet. A friend of mine bravely admits, “Am I the only one breaking out the winterwear? Who has Heat Tech on?” Heat Tech, in case you didn’t know, is an innovative new material developed for warmth and comfort by UNIQLO and textile manufacturer Toray. DRESSING APPROPRIATELY FOR THE SEASONI met up with some friends on New Year’s Day and saw adults happily bundled up in jackets, kids in hoodies and galoshes, old folks with scarfs to keep the wind chill at bay. The day after, at another gathering, I myopically opted to wear sleeveless and was grateful my husband thought to bring a cardigan to rescue me from my vanity.I joke with overseas friends that contrary to popular belief, Singapore does have four seasons: Wet-and-cold (La Nina), hot-and-wet, hot- and-dry (El Nino) and cold-and-dry. Otherwise known as the seasons of ponding season, steamed pau season, mosquito season and being-inside-a-shopping-centre season.And with each season, we dress appropriately. Raingear and jackets when La Nina rears her ugly head and brings monsoon - and sometimes hail - to our shores. Beach gear with a side of umbrella when we head into more mainstream weather forecast, hoping for the best weather but also prepared for the worst.In the middle of the year, we all collectively smell like a blend of citronella and lemongrass with the kids sporting little mozzie patches at the back of their shirts. And ask any mother of young children and she’d be able to tell you which shopping centre’s air-conditioners run cooler than most and where a cardigan-in-hand may be useful.The point is, we suit up for occasion. We wear and do what works for each of us. And really, kudos to those who are willing to do so at the expense of some small ridicule. They are more comfortable for it. If it floats your boat, power to you. VANITY OR PRAGMATISM?We are a society that applauds those that resist and hold out, instead of complimenting those who opt for pragmatism – cover up when it is cold. Isn’t it time the boring, predictable and sensible wins the day? This, in a time where we preach self-care and share coping mechanisms. Furthermore, the truth is, for many of us feeling boxed up this season, being able to play dress up for a faux Winter Holiday can go a long way to satiate our wanderlust souls. We, the current wearers of sensible, courtly shoes, can do well with a healthy dose of whimsy and fun in a time of erstwhile drudgery. A modicum of slightly cheeky reprieve if you would Besides an added style element that cannot be understated – don’t you just love those chic jackets, cardigans and scarves - our collective mental well-being might just thank us for this winter-esque interlude. As would our freezing bottoms. After all, who would want to catch a cold during the pandemic and risk having to undergo more uncomfortable COVID-19 tests?This brings to mind early COVID-19 days where people tended to overprotect and were often subjected to social media ridicule. But really, if we think deeper, we downplay what must be deep fear for themselves or maybe vulnerable family members at home. They harmed no one in their choice of ski mask goggles on top of their masks so why make a fuss about it?They did what they felt they needed to do. To cope, to stay safe, and to feel safe. NO SHAME IN PADDING UPIf we must, let’s fuss about things that matter.The torrential dinosaur-esque rain that helped us welcome this New Year triggered landslips and flooding round the island. It caused statuesque trees to fall, like the massive 22m one at Fort Canning Hill. Photos in news coverage show slope erosion at ongoing construction sites, barrier fences along major canals felled. In videos that circulated on WhatsApp, golf courses were submerged, while manhole covers sprouted small water fountains.If ever there was a time on a global stage where small sensibilities like wearing a cardigan when you are cold, opting out of a large social gathering if you are even remotely ill, or wearing a mask out in public should be lauded, it’s now. If 2020 taught us anything, it is to roll with the punches and make the best of a given situation.When life gives you lemons, you make lemon meringue pie. When there’s a virulent virus out and about, you safe distance and wear a mask. And when El Nina brings torrential rain and sweater weather, run an ugly sweater contest with your colleagues on Zoom.Cherie Tseng is Chief Operations Officer at a local fintech company, a mother of three and editor with The Birthday Collective.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

The authorities revealed last month that 180 patients were affected by the wrong diagnosis and half of them may have received unnecessary treatment.The patients were wrongly classified as being positive for HER2 - a gene that controls how a healthy cell grows - instead of HER2 negative. This affects how a patient is treated, most commonly with a drug called Herceptin.Common side effects due to HER2-directed treatment include diarrhoea, chills and fatigue. About 3 to 4 per cent of patients may also experience heart problems. Responding to parliamentary questions about the incident, Dr Koh said 200 patients have been reclassified from HER2 positive to HER2 negative as of Dec 23. Of these, eight patients were treated at private hospitals and 192 patients at government-run hospitals. Eight patients are pending retests.""Joint care teams have been formed, comprising KTPH surgeons, histopathologists and the treating oncologists, to review the individual care plans for these affected patients, based on the change in HER2 status,"" said Dr Koh.The hospital is also reviewing the bills of the affected patients, Dr Koh said, adding that the costs incurred by patients due to unnecessary treatment will be fully refunded. The amount each patient will be refunded will depend on several factors, including the length of their treatment and the hospital they went to, he added.""KTPH is also ready to provide any clinical and financial support to the affected patients including on-going or follow-up treatment, if any, which may be needed as a result of over-treatment,"" Dr Koh told the House.The National Healthcare Group has convened an independent review committee, comprising external experts from various disciplines in the healthcare industry, to conduct a ""thorough evaluation of the incident"" and to recommend measures to improve the process. he said.""This ensures that any system gaps are identified and addressed swiftly to prevent recurrence of similar incidents,"" he added.KTPH first started testing patients for HER2 in 2012. Responding to questions about the efficacy of the test and why it took eight years for the problem to surface, Dr Koh said that testing for HER2 is a complex process and it took years for a significantly higher-than-normal positivity rate to appear before it was clear there was an issue with the results.Dr Koh also clarified that although KTPH is reassessing results from 2012, it does not mean that all the results since 2012 were wrong.“It may well be that the errors could have occured in the last three months or six months (but) KTPH is being prudent and careful by going back … all the way to when the test first started,” he said. When Non-Constituency Member of Parliament Hazel Poa asked if it is possible these patients receive lifetime free healthcare as compensation, Dr Koh rejected the suggestion as most of the side effects from HER2 treatment are temporary. As for whether the patients will be offered mental health support financially, Dr Koh said the decision lies with the medical team helping the patient. “A panic attack or anxiety episode can occur with or without cancer, it can occur with or without treatment,” he said.

213,"Commentary: After the craziest year, teachers start first day of school with nervous apprehension",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/first-day-of-school-singapore-teachers-anxious-nervous-13855824,04 Jan 2021 06:04AM,"Yet teachers have been the true heroes of our education system taking on more responsibilities and staring down big COVID-19 challenges, says Jason TanSINGAPORE: Monday (Jan 4) marks the start of a new school year – at least for Primary 1 and Kindergarten 1 kids.With a new school environment and fresh faces, most students no doubt feel some level of excitement, even nervousness, and so will their parents, seeing now how only one guardian can accompany the child.Months of logistical and emotional preparations have been invested leading up to this day to soothe concerns.But here’s some food for thought for anxious faces gearing up for today’s big milestone: In the wake of a coronavirus-plagued year, it is not only students and parents who are looking forward to the new school year in 2021 with a mixture of excitement and apprehension. Teachers too are anxious.EXCITEMENT AND SATISFACTIONDon’t get me wrong. The first day of school is seen by many educators as a wonderful chance to greet a new class and put them on a strong footing for a year-long journey of discovery and learning.While many teachers might shepherd their old classes from the previous years, each new school year brings with it a few new classes and up to 100 or more fresh faces in my experience.Teachers feel that excitement as they look forward to unwrapping each student’s unique personality and figuring out how best to help each of them learn and grow, not only through the academic curriculum, but also through other school experiences such as co-curricular activities.But in addition to getting to know individual students, teachers also have to develop an awareness of the class dynamics, for instance, how students interact together and oversee those exchanges with care.So understandably, along with the excitement, educators feel a certain degree of nervous apprehension.A YEAR OF ZOOM SCHOOL AND BIG CHALLENGESLet’s not forget teachers too have just undergone the craziest year in their educational careers that upended educational pedagogy. The COVID-19 crisis that erupted in 2020 brought about tremendous tumult in Singapore schools.Not only were classroom teaching and learning activities forced to go online for a while, co-curricular activities were suspended for a few months before being progressively and only partially allowed to resume.The crisis also had consequences for school examinations. The Ministry of Education announced the cancellation of all mid-year examinations while the Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board announced reductions in the content coverage for the key national examinations such as the Primary School Leaving Examination.Meanwhile, the suspension of face-to-face lessons brought into stark focus social and educational inequalities.Thankfully, the Education Ministry offered to supply personal learning devices and took steps to ensure the continuation of the School Meals Programme for students in need of such assistance.At the same time, teachers had to instruct students on various safe management measures in order to guard students’ physical health, while also keeping a watchful eye out for possible mental health issues.NEW DEMANDS SET TO CONTINUEThe demands placed on teachers in 2020 are likely to continue. For instance, teachers will have to figure out how to hold the National School Games and ready their students for the Singapore Youth Festival Arts presentation, both of which are on track to restart in 2021.Teachers also have the challenge of interpreting Ministry of Education policy announcements like plans to make blended learning a regular feature of the school curriculum, and translating them in meaningful ways within their individual practice.Besides this, teachers will have to implement the Character and Citizenship Education 2021 curriculum, which focuses, among other things, on the strengthening of mental health and cyber-wellness education and the establishment of peer support structures within every school.Other priority areas include enhanced support for students with special educational needs and after-school provisions for disadvantaged students.Teachers also have the onerous responsibility of responding to emergent societal concerns such as the protection of students from online predators and the promotion of gender education and respect.The good news is new opportunities are also availed to teachers hoping to find support to cope with these challenges.The Ministry of Education introduced the SkillsFuture for Educators, an enhanced professional development roadmap, at the Committee of Supply Parliamentary debates in March 2020. Teachers will have the chance to improve their skills and competencies in areas such as inquiry-based learning and e-pedagogy in order better to prepare for the evolving priorities in the school system.FRESH AREAS OF CONCERNPeople often think teachers naturally have confidence and are endowed with strong public speaking skills, and do not realise how teachers are invariably concerned about how well their students will respond to both their teaching and to them as individuals.This concern does not diminish with increasing experience as previous successes do not automatically guarantee success with subsequent students.There is also the prospect of responding to the unknown, for instance, in finding out about crises that occur in students’ lives and responding in a responsible and caring manner.In recent years, the apprehension that teachers feel has been increased by the knowledge that students’ lives are in some ways substantially different from those that teachers themselves experienced when they were of school age.For instance, present-day students are for the most part digital natives, and teachers therefore have to take this phenomenon into consideration when planning their teaching and learning activities, while being aware of the possible cyber-threats their students face.Listen to two parents share their front-row experience to their kids' educational journey of home-based learning during the circuit breaker on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:In addition, teachers have to help their students navigate a more diversified school landscape than that they went through.There are also concerns over the world into which their students will emerge as adults. How do teachers prepare their students to be lifelong learners in anticipation of a future widely believed to be volatile and unpredictable, and for a workplace in which skills will increasingly count for more than qualifications?THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH PARENTSYet another key group of stakeholders that teachers will have to work with in 2021 are their students’ parents.While parents are naturally focused on their children’s learning and growth, teachers have to deal not only with individual students but also with the collective welfare of students, whether in or out of the classroom.Teachers have the task of communicating clearly to parents the rationale for various school practices, especially in light of the fact that, like the teachers, the parents too are grappling with the realities of numerous policy changes.In other words, teachers are a mediating bridge between parents and the Ministry of Education.For example, parents of non-special needs students may need to understand how the mainstreaming of students will special educational needs will benefit their children in terms of developing values such as care and respect, rather than thinking that the special educational needs students will slow down their children’s progress.Furthermore, teachers have the heavy responsibility of enlisting support from, and forming collaborative partnerships with, a wide diversity of parents that range from the over-anxious to the uninvolved.As teachers head back to school in 2021, their excitement is probably coupled with some trepidation as well. The uncertainties that emerged in the year 2020 offered them an excellent opportunity to grapple with different roles such as health care worker and online educator. They also tested teachers’ resilience and adaptability.Their responses to these challenges will serve them well as they continue with the task of contributing to their students’ holistic development and that of working hand-in-hand with their students’ parents.Above all, we are reminded that education is at its very heart, an extremely human undertaking, and is not only about challenges but also about opportunities to help each student in his or her own learning journey.Listen to three working adults reveal how their PSLE results have shaped their life journeys in a no-holds barred conversation on CNA's Heart of the Matter podcast:Jason Tan is an associate professor at the National Institute of Education.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

That is because she has grappled with an eating disorder for the past seven years – one that involves chewing food and spitting it out, to avoid ingesting it. The string of get-togethers for meals, especially during Christmas, New Year and Chinese New Year, can be a mental torment, she explained. “Even before you reach the person’s house, you’d be planning days ahead: ‘If I eat turkey, I’ll just take the breast meat. Or if we’re ordering pizza, I’ll check how many calories are in that slice. Am I just going to eat the tomato on the pizza and leave the crust behind?'” she said.“Eating out with people was also stressful because then I needed to plan how to (chew and spit),” she said, adding that it took a lot of practice to keep her behaviour as discreet as possible. “I would try my best to avoid outings … When people had gatherings, then I’d say I wasn’t free,” said Jas, who works in education.These days, she is on the road to recovery but the festive season is still stressful. In the face of so many opportunities to have a meal, she said she has to “undo a habit that has been with (her) for so many years"".Her experiences of the holiday season are not uncommon.Dr Ng Kah Wee, director of the Eating Disorders Unit at Singapore General Hospital (SGH), noted that patients struggle more during the festive period for many reasons.For one, people with binge urges may cave in when they see an abundance of food, while those who restrict their food intake may struggle with turning down social events or communal meals, Dr Ng added.Having more family reunions may also exacerbate depression and anxiety among some patients, especially those who already battle issues of low self-esteem and body image distortion, she told CNA.COVID-19 AND ITS EFFECT ON PEOPLE WITH EATING DISORDERSThe holiday season caps a pandemic-struck year that has put even more stress on those with such disorders.Jas cited how the ""circuit breaker"" period that started in April caused her disorder to go unchecked, as she was able to engage in unhealthy eating behaviour in the privacy of her own home.“I would also have the urge to chew and spit because food was so nearby, I could just go to the fridge and do it. It was difficult for me,” Jas said.On the other hand, she also had to eat with her family more often than before – a dicey situation given that they did not know about her eating disorder.Experts pointed out that COVID-19 has affected patients in other ways.Closer supervision at home brought about more anxiety and tension for patients, while the pandemic “abruptly halted” usual routines such as going to school or work, said SGH’s Dr Ng. “Some more unfortunate had lost their jobs, or perhaps this misfortune had befallen their parents. Correspondingly, when anxiety and depression became worse, their eating became more erratic and purging behaviours increased,” she explained.She added that the pandemic and safe distancing restrictions prevented many patients from turning to their previous ways of coping, such as going out with friends or watching movies.“We saw patients who adopted maladaptive measures such as turning to alcohol, drugs and self-harm. Some patients even contemplated suicide when they were at the peak of their distress,” Dr Ng told CNA.Dr Courtney Davis of KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital (KKH) added that COVID-19 led to increased health worries as well, which triggered a worsening of eating disorder symptoms among some.“Examples of aggravated symptoms include increased amounts of exercise and increased preoccupation with dietary restrictions,” she said.However, both doctors also noted that some patients’ conditions improved amid the pandemic.Dr Ng said a “small proportion” of them became better during the circuit breaker period because of closer parental supervision.Parents were able to notice early changes in moods and abnormal eating behaviour, and got their child medical attention “in a timely manner”, she explained.MORE CASES AMONG YOUNGER PATIENTS At SGH’s Eating Disorder Unit, there were about 150 new cases in 2020. The average age of patients presenting for the first time was about 17 to 22 years. An overwhelming majority were female patients.These numbers are similar to previous years’ figures, SGH said. However, KKH – which attends to younger patients – has seen cases growing.Its Adolescent Medicine Service saw 96 new cases of patients with eating disorders in 2020, compared to 80 in 2019.In previous years, the service saw 50 to 70 new cases per year on average.Dr Davis said the hospital is unable to establish the exact reason why cases have continued to rise, adding that research is ongoing in this area.She noted though that “better awareness on eating disorders has likely played a part in the increase in numbers"".There has also been an “increased complexity in a subset of cases”, said Dr Davis.“We are seeing more patients who require medical admission at presentation compared to before. This trend suggests an increased severity of symptoms at presentation,” she told CNA.“We are also seeing younger patients. About 20 per cent of the patients are younger than 13 years old on presentation.""To bring down the number of patients with eating disorders, SGH’s Dr Ng cited several possible solutions.Apart from helping the young build their self-confidence and identity “in a healthy manner”, teachers can be trained to identify those who may be at risk of developing such disorders.Psychiatric disorders must also be de-stigmatised, Dr Ng said.She added: “Encourage the general public to pay attention to the mental health of themselves and their loved ones, especially in this unprecedented trying period of a pandemic.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

216,"Commentary: After a year of uncertainty, make short-term goals your New Year’s resolutions for 2021",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/new-year-resolutions-2021-covid-19-coronavirus-pandemic-13865802,31 Dec 2020 06:00AM,"Welcoming the new year may feel a bit different this year, given the challenges of 2020 and the inability to celebrate together, says a psychologist.REGINA, Canada: For many people, the yearly date change — adding one more year to life’s tally — puts a greater focus on long-term goals than busy lives usually allow.For many, this leads to the tradition of New Year’s resolutions, a chance to consider our progress on becoming the “ideal self” many people hope to achieve by the end of their days.Even with the knowledge that the focus will shift back to the short-term demands of day-to-day by mid-January, it is valuable to consider those longer-term aspirations, if for no other reason than for people to remind themselves that there’s more to them than the harried exhausted person who, at the end of the day, wants nothing more than to get into their PJs and play a video game, binge-watch a favourite TV serial, or read a current novel.But this year, thinking about the long term is much more difficult. The pandemic has given us all a different experience of time.The pandemic has not only served as a visceral reminder that something unexpected can land in our well-envisioned path, halting all progress. It has also made the path beyond the pandemic unclear.As many pundits are noting, a “return to normal” — meaning life exactly as it was before COVID-19 entered our vocabulary — is highly unlikely.The future has become less predictable, which also means that setting long-term goals is much more difficult. It’s hard to imagine an ideal self without knowing what that self will be experiencing.MAKE SHORT-TERM GOALSAs a psychologist, I think resolutions for 2021 should be much more short-term than usual. It is probably challenging enough to figure out what’s needed to make it through the months until everyone is vaccinated and can start to make their way back into a more social world.You might be thinking that this hardly seems like a good use of once-a-year resolutions, but even though these goals will be very short-term, this is valuable given that public health leaders are warning that these particular months are likely to be the hardest of the pandemic.So even though these goals will likely only be needed for a few months, they can be vital for determining our state when the pandemic comes to an end.Living through several months of pandemic uncertainty and restrictions has likely given many people a pretty good idea of which personal vulnerabilities this constrained life chafes against.Some people may be struggling to keep their emotional balance. For others, the absence of friends and even casual acquaintances may be driving them mad. Others might be panting to get back to the gym.These personal points of pain can give people some idea of what resolutions they might make.Addressing those specific points may help enable people to care for themselves well enough to arrive at the pandemic’s end with some semblance of good physical and mental health.Reviewing the advice that mental health professionals gave at the beginning of the pandemic may be helpful in figuring out your specific short-term resolutions to deal with personal challenges.Or you, like many others, might have discovered the healing properties of nature during this time, as documented in a preprint (not yet peer reviewed) study.If so, your resolutions could be about making sure you continue those activities and visiting your favourite nature spots during these winter months. My own resolution, for instance, is to spend at least five minutes each day appreciating the birds in my yard, which never fails to lift my spirits.PANDEMIC LESSONSFor those who can’t resist thinking about long-term goals, despite the uncertainty that this pandemic year has introduced into the world, you could review what you’ve learned during the pandemic. Long-term resolutions could be based on consideration of three things:1.            What do I want to keep from changes I made to cope with the pandemic?2.            What do I want to reclaim from the pre-pandemic time?3.            How would I “build back better” if I were in charge of the world or my neighbourhood?Each of these things will require some long-term goal focus, and can help you imagine a new ideal self for the post-pandemic times.Like Christmas 2020, New Year’s 2021 is likely to be unique in many people’s memories. Many people have gone out of their way to make these moments as tolerable as possible, given the circumstances, but these new ways to commemorate the holidays are unlikely to become traditions, or things people will want to repeat in subsequent years.Approaching 2021 resolutions by harvesting any bright spots or treasures that have revealed themselves during this unusual time may help illuminate a new path to follow once the pandemic has ended.Listen to infectious disease expert outline what's needed to get a vaccine manufactured, transported and administered in our Heart of the Matter podcast:  Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramKatherine Arbuthnott is Professor of Psychology, University of Regina.

217,Commentary: Being forced to log on to work from home created stress and fatigue for workers,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/work-from-home-force-log-on-stress-burnout-fatigue-13865558,31 Dec 2020 06:00AM,"Employers should enter 2021 resolving to communicate clearly boundaries on when responses to work are required, says NUS Business School’s Dr Rashimah Rajah.SINGAPORE: Coupled with employees reporting decreased mental health in 2020, managers now face new challenges stepping into the new year.According to a Qualtrics study in Singapore in April 2020, 26 per cent of employees surveyed reported a decrease in mental health.Out of these, 25 per cent reported a decrease in mental well-being due to stress, 22 per cent due to anxiety, 19 per cent due to job insecurity, 7 per cent due to fatigue, and 6 per cent due to work-from-home (WFH) arrangements.That wholesale leap into WFH might have a lot to do with it. According to a study by Mercer South and East Asia in April 2020, WFH arrangements have been especially hard for managers, with 39 per cent reporting they were less effective at work than before, compared to 22 per cent of non-managers.WHY WFH CAUSES STRESS AND FATIGUEWhat is the relationship between working from home and mental health? A 2017 study on job connectedness that I did with Professor Remus Ilies from the National University of Singapore might have the answer.Seeking to understand employees’ attitudes to using ICT devices to attend to work matters remote, the study examined how using technology for work can affect work-family boundaries and personal well-being.This experience sampling study surveyed 115 employees working full-time in Singapore and showed that job connectedness on its own did not have significant effects on well-being.The relationships, however, changed when we look at the fit between employees’ values and the current work arrangement.Job connectedness led to increased well-being (including higher job satisfaction, lower burnout, and lower work-family conflict), when engaging in such behaviour was voluntary.When connecting to the job via ICT devices was involuntary, employees experienced lower levels of well-being.In other words, when employees, on their own accord, connect to work matters remotely, that brings them higher satisfaction. Plausibly, this is because employees feel empowered, motivated and in control of their work tasks and career trajectory. Choosing when and where to do their work can account for conflicts in their personal and family schedules as well.However, when this was involuntary, their mental health and personal well-being suffered. Work-family conflict and the feeling of burn-out were exacerbated, and job satisfaction was reduced.A 2020 study that I did with Assistant Professor Lucas Monzani from the Ivey Business School found that when being connected to the job is perceived as an obligation, or as an additional demand, technology is not as welcomed by employees.Did the employee sense that he has to reply to that email while attending to the crying toddler at home? Did the individual have to pick up that phone call when she was making lunch? Depending on signals received by employees from their organisations, using ICT devices for remote work can be helpful or dreadful.ALL ABOUT FITIn most cases, alternative work arrangements were made possible for the employees in this study. Organisations provided resources like laptops, mobile phones, and flexible working hours.One might think that this is the one-size-fits-all answer: Provide the resources, and employees will use technology to get to work. But the answer goes beyond providing resources.It is all about fit. Did employees want to connect to the job remotely, because this gives them greater flexibility in fulfilling work and family duties? Or did they wish to keep their jobs and family life separate?For some others, having a hard cut-off time for work gives them the freedom to fully immerse in family and social activities.WHEN FLEXIBLE WORK ISN’T A CHOICEBut the COVID-19 pandemic and mandatory WFH arrangements across non-essential services resulted in employees not having much of a choice in whether to be digitally connected to the job.Their values were not aligned with the company’s new ones, and they did not have time to adjust.You might say this arrangement was only obligatory during office hours. Indeed, many knowledge workers have engaged in flexible work or remote work in one way or another prior to the pandemic, but the reality is very few of them did this full-time. According to the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics, only 5 per cent of workers were working virtually full-time, whereas this figure was 6 per cent in the European Union.The sudden shift to full-time remote work meant that employees quickly lost their ability to appreciate face-to-face interactions with colleagues, leading to feelings of isolation and decline in mental health.Employees entered an organisation thinking they were a good fit with the company’s culture of teamwork and work-life balance, only to find themselves alone and having to mix work with family.ENSURING FITSo, how should managers enter 2021? The answer lies in ensuring fit.The COVID-19 pandemic has tested companies’ ability to be agile and to embrace digital technology. When hiring new talent, recruiters should ensure that agility and resilience are among the top criteria for selection.Agility and resilience can be assessed using personality tests and competency-based interview questions. When workers are agile, they can respond to work challenges flexibly and creatively. For example, they can better adjust to WFH arrangements by creating their own personal boundaries, such as working from a quiet space in the house away from distractions.Listen also to property experts discuss whether and how the outlook for the Singapore residential market has changed with COVID-19 and why they say it seems to be holding up exceptionally well: For their current talent, managers should ensure that employees are equipped with the necessary training to conduct their work tasks effectively using technology and ICT devices.This goes beyond technical skills and should include soft skills like effective virtual communication, email etiquette, and ground rules for video conferences.RESOLUTIONS FOR MANAGERSUnderstanding that there is no one-size-fits-all answer is a first step.  Managers should take time to understand employees’ needs and preferences with regards to using technology to work from home.Often, accompanying provision of resources with clear communication will help. For instance, managers could allay employees’ concerns by saying that a work mobile phone does not mean the employee will have to be contactable 24 hours a day.By demarcating specific timings or tasks for which the mobile phone will be used, managers help to reduce anxiety associated with job connectedness, as employees know they have opportunities to disconnect and unwind from work.Managers themselves need to embrace technology to conduct their work more effectively.With more trust, empathy, and clearer (virtual) communication with employees, companies can still stick to their yearly resolution: The next year will be the best year ever.Can you say no to returning to the office?

218,"A journey of reward and regret: Yishun mum who fostered 5 kids, helps needy students",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/yishun-foster-mum-needy-students-regret-13691852,30 Dec 2020 06:30AM,"Mdm Sarimah Amat was named Yishunite of the Year for her contributions to the community.SINGAPORE: Mdm Sarimah Amat, 53, was bathing her second foster child, a cheerful four-year-old boy with infantile epilepsy, when she made a decision she would soon regret.The homemaker had tried to keep the playful boy from falling, but it was she who fell in the bathroom instead. Mdm Sarimah hurt her knee and inflamed an old injury, and she decided this was the final straw.""I told my foster care officer that I don't think he's a match for me,"" she told CNA. ""Because I don't have the skills and energy to match. He would throw tantrums and roll around.""After about seven months caring for the boy, Mdm Sarimah returned him to his natural parents. Three weeks later, he died from the epilepsy, which involves repeated seizures.But those who know the sprightly woman's journey as a foster parent will understand that she is far from a quitter.Mdm Sarimah is fiercely passionate about nurturing children and watching them grow. She had worked as a kindergarten teacher and silat instructor, before a serious knee injury, aggravated over all those years running around kids, forced her to stop.Mdm Sarimah has three children of her own, and the void of not having anything to do compelled her to look at fostering. ""I don't want to become a vegetable,"" she had told herself. ""I love children, so what can I do?""She called for a family discussion, mindful of her children's personal space. And when they agreed, she prayed for a sign that she was doing the right thing.Soon, she stumbled upon a Facebook post with a quote from the Prophet Muhammad: ""The best of homes are where orphans are taken care of.""Foster children might not necessarily be orphans, but this was good enough.Mdm Sarimah welcomed her first foster child in 2012, a four-year-old girl who first arrived at her Yishun flat. ""Her expression was like asking me to rescue her,"" she recalled of that moment. ""I carried her in my arms and I could feel her trembling.""Since then, Mdm Sarimah felt as though fostering was her calling, a responsibility to shower parental love on a child who has been abused, neglected or abandoned. In some cases, their parents have a physical or mental illness, or are in jail.In 2013, her foster care officer called, asking if she had space for one more. Mdm Sarimah knew from the authorities that there were many children waiting to be fostered. There was no turning back now.""Initially it was just to try out fostering. Then it’s not that I fell in love with the process, but I felt it’s become my mission,"" she said, wishing she lived in a bungalow so she could foster more children.""I am physically capable, I have the knowledge and skillset from being an early childhood teacher, so I can provide hope for these children. I have the capacity, so why not?""Mdm Sarimah would end up fostering five children in the past eight years, two of whom are still with her. Even before that, she had housed at-risk youths and took in four of her niece's children.Her community efforts do not end there. She runs a programme to provide stationery and essentials to needy children locally and abroad, and started an initiative to look after the disadvantaged and elderly across 16 blocks in her neighbourhood.In October, she was named the inaugural Yishunite of the Year, which recognises a Nee Soon GRC resident's contributions to the community.In a Facebook voting competition, Mdm Sarimah's entry received the most ""likes"" among four other nominees, many of whom helped the needy through various means.""Sarimah is a housewife with three children but she has enough love for more,"" a description of her entry began.Mdm Sarimah said the award has spurred her to do even more. ""I feel like my contributions are small compared to other people, like philanthropists,"" she said, although she feels everybody can start small.""You don't have to be rich,"" she added. ""You just have good intentions, and God will take care of the rest.""REGRETMdm Sarimah's selfless acts of generosity have led to feelings of satisfaction and some sadness.She acknowledged she had a rough start with the boy who had infantile epilepsy, especially because she was straining to handle his special needs. All her experience did not seem to help.The boy's tantrums included destroying his siblings' gaming device and art project, but Mdm Sarimah remained patient. She fed him the medicine he needed every day to calm down, calling him ""happy"" despite his condition.She doted on him and cleaned him up, earning praise from an aunt who said she had never seen the boy so fit and healthy. Even the boy's father could not recognise him during a routine visit, Mdm Sarimah said.Then the incident in the toilet happened, and Mdm Sarimah decided she could no longer keep up. Weeks later, she received the terrible news over the phone.""His mum called me and said he was gone,"" Mdm Sarimah said, adding that the boy had died after spending the night at home with his father.""I was so sad,"" she continued, feeling like she had lost one of her own children. ""I regretted sending him back. Maybe if I didn't, this could have been avoided. But it's God's will.""Mdm Sarimah pleaded with her foster care officer to let her arrange the boy's funeral and burial for a final goodbye. His body was brought to her house first. ""My children were really taken by it,"" she said. ""I still see flashes of him at home.""SEEING THEM GROWHowever, Mdm Sarimah was not deterred by this experience.In 2014, she fostered a six-year-old boy for half a year, then in 2015, a two-year-old boy for five months. They eventually returned to their biological parents, who showed they were committed to caring for their children.Including the four grandnephews and grandnieces who had lived with Mdm Sarimah since 2009, there could be nine children at home at one point. ""It was like a childcare centre,"" she exclaimed.The children did not get along sometimes, so Mdm Sarimah sat them down and spoke to them. She asked the older children to guide their younger siblings.""If they have problems with each other, the more you get them to work with each other,"" she said. ""So they understand each other better. Everybody plays their part in this house.""When asked if she ever got tired having so many children, Mdm Sarimah simply replied: ""I always tell myself it's like a challenge.""""When I taught silat, I built my students and made them win matches,"" she said.""My grandnieces and grandnephews came with scabs and lice in their hair, without knowing how to read or count. I cleaned them, and in three months, they were singing karaoke. It gives me joy to see them accomplish.""The four of them returned to their natural parents last year.Mdm Sarimah said she gave all her children, natural or not, equal treatment and love, including in what they got to eat and wear.""There is no difference because we don’t want the child to feel isolated, or feel like they are from a different family and so are treated differently,"" she said.""We want them to feel a sense of belonging and be a part of the family. The child may not be able to express the hurt of being left behind, and being put up with a total stranger to live and adapt. So it’s a silent pain that’s kept inside.""If we don’t fill that void for the child, it will be a future problem. The role of a foster parent is to fill that void for them, and really fill it up to the brim (with love). Even if it’s overflowing, it’s okay.""Mdm Sarimah wished she had more time to mould her third and fourth foster child, but she accepted that fostering will always be a temporary arrangement. Her eldest foster child would sometimes say she misses her parents.""The child really needs the natural family. They may be living here happily, but in their hearts they miss their parents. That need has to be met,"" she said.""While they are under my care, my task is to instill values in them. So when they go home, they are able to meet challenges with their own family.""LETTING GOIn 2016, Mdm Sarimah decided to foster a baby for the first time. This two-month-old girl was different from the rest, as she did not yet come with her own personality or character.""It's like a blank canvas, and we are the artists providing all the nurturing,"" she said. ""It requires more energy, no doubt, but it's easier to shape her.""The girl, who lost her father when she was still a baby, is four years old now and still lives with her. Mdm Sarimah described her as the apple of her eye.""When I see her being pampered by my husband, I get a bit sad. For all that she knows, it could be her own dad,"" she said. ""It was heartbreaking to see a young child without a father. I'm more determined to help her make it in life.""Mdm Sarimah's first foster child, adopted in 2012, is also still with her. She is now 12 years old and has just finished her Primary School Leaving Examination. Mdm Sarimah has reminded her that she is defined by her heart, and not her results.Both of her current foster children visit their natural parents regularly, every weekend or during school or public holidays. Mdm Sarimah tells them to forgive their parents, and be the catalyst for change in their families.But she admitted she will be extra sad when they eventually go back for good.""They are the longest with us, so it’s definitely going to be harder. But when the time comes, we need to,"" she said.""No matter how much we love them, we can never match their natural parents. We may hug them and everything, but in their heart they know it’s not coming from their real mother.""But I’ll be sad if they return and more damage is done. Our effort over the years, giving them the self-esteem and values, could suddenly be reversed.""MORE KIDS ON THE CARDS?As for potential foster parents who are still unsure about the commitment, Mdm Sarimah advised them to chat with other foster parents and look through resources provided by foster agencies.""But at the end of the day, it has to be a sincere and practical decision that is achievable,"" said Mdm Sarimah, who makes it a point to tell others about the scheme and has recommended five foster parents.""When it's time to decide, I would just say trust your intentions. For you to be a caretaker of the children, it is a noble thing to do.""Moving forward, Mdm Sarimah said she has no energy to foster another child for now, pointing out that it is all being expended on her 13-month-old grandson.Only her eldest child, 29, is married. She also has a 27-year-old daughter and 24-year-old son. Her husband, 54, works in construction as a safety coordinator.""When my eldest moves out, and my other children get married, the house will be quiet and I have nobody to speak to,"" she said.""Maybe I will consider fostering a teenager then, because by then my energy would have been depleted. So teenagers will be good. I know they come with a different set of challenges, but I would love to try.""A LOVE FOR CHILDRENIn the meantime, Mdm Sarimah is keeping busy with the programme she founded to help disadvantaged schoolchildren, called Project Pencil.It started by accident in 2014, when a friend who was going to visit an orphanage in Thailand asked if she had any pencils to donate for 30 orphans who loved to draw and write.Mdm Sarimah had just gotten a box of 12 pencils from her neighbour, but she decided it was not enough. She asked her friend for more time to canvass on Facebook.""The donations went up to 70kg,"" she said, laughing. ""There were drawing blocks, colouring pencils and watercolour paints. That was how it started.""Mdm Sarimah continued gathering essential items to give away for her friend, who went to another orphanage in Indonesia and then a disaster-stricken area in Malaysia. Her biggest haul of donated items was 900kg, and included fresh water and clothes.Locally, Mdm Sarimah would round up aid for anybody who needed help, including someone who went through a major surgery or whose house was ravaged by a fire. Donations ranged from diapers to cash.Project Pencil's most recent initiative, called Bag to School, aims to raise S$50,000, providing 5,000 children with S$100 worth of vouchers each for school bags, shoes and stationery.Mdm Sarimah has overseen more than 20 projects both locally and overseas, and makes it a point to involve her children, be it through packing supplies or calling for donations.""You never know, the children whose hearts we've touched could be the next leader or president. Most will be mothers who will teach the next generation,"" she said.Ultimately, Mdm Sarimah believes her passion to help children stems from her desire to see them succeed.""If a child is hungry or thirsty, you can buy them food or drinks. But if they need love or guidance, you can’t buy these from 7-Eleven off the shelf,"" she added. ""It’s something that must really be taught and come from the heart.""Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

219,Commentary: Still checking work emails on holidays? Here’s how to stop,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/commentary-still-checking-work-emails-on-holidays-here-s-how-to-13853748,29 Dec 2020 06:08AM,"Our work is often so closely tied to our sense of who we are, many of us struggle to switch off on holidays. But it's never too late to hide the laptop, say two management observers.SYDNEY: Finally, the holidays are here — the break you’ve been waiting for. You want to leave work behind, kick back and enjoy time with family and friends.But you’re still checking work emails and taking work calls. Even if you are away from home, at a nice hotel that screams holiday, you’re still thinking about work, or even doing work, although you promised yourself this time would be different.If this sounds familiar, you’re not the only one struggling to switch off on holidays.One reason is you, like many others, might derive a strong sense of self from your work.WORK HELPS SHAPE YOUR IDENTITYHumans crave answers to the question “Who am I?”. One place we find these answers is in the activities we do — including our work.Whether we work by choice, necessity, or a bit of both, many of us find work inevitably becomes a source of our identity.We develop professional identities (“I’m a lawyer”), organisational identities (“I’m a Google employee”), or as we discovered in our research, performance-based identities (“I’m a top performer”).Such identification can be beneficial. It has been linked with increased motivation and work performance, and even better health. But it can also prevent us from switching off.YOUR WORK IDENTITY IS MAKING IT HARD TO SWITCH OFFWe all know people who are mentally “on holidays” even before the holidays have started. But for others, switching off from work is not so easy. Why?One factor is our identity mix. We all have multiple identities, but the range and relative importance of our identities vary from person to person.If work-related identities occupy a central place in how we see ourselves, they’re likely to shape our thinking and behaviour beyond work hours — including during holidays. In other words, we stay mentally connected to work not because the boss or the job necessarily requires it, but because it’s hard to imagine other ways of “being ourselves”.Equally important to why some of us struggle to switch off on holidays are environmental cues. That relaxing chair by the pool or the company of family tell us we’re off work. But email alerts or phone calls, or even the simple sight of our laptop, can activate work identities and associated mindsets and behaviours. No wonder our plans for switching off are doomed.A LOT YOU CAN DOIt’s worth considering all that obvious advice you’ve heard on the benefits of digital detox.This is even more important in the new normal of working from home in 2020 and beyond. For many of us, the office and home are now one and the same, meaning we have to work even harder to protect non-work time from work-related incursions.From an identity perspective, though, there’s a lot more we can do.First, we can scan the environment and remove any cues that might activate our work identity (beyond switching off email alerts). This might be something as simple as hiding your laptop in a drawer.At the same time, introduce cues to activate other identities. For instance, if you’re a tennis player or an aspiring artist, keep your gear visible so your brain is primed to focus on those aspects of your self.Second, research suggests we can engage in “identity work” and “identity play”. That’s deliberately managing and revising our identities, and even experimenting with potential new ones. Imagining and trying new and more complex versions of ourselves takes time, but it can be an effective antidote to an overpowering work identity.But simply trying to not think about work over the holidays is likely to do more harm than good. Much research shows trying to suppress certain thoughts tends to have the opposite effect, making us not only have the thought more, but also feeling worse afterwards.A better approach may be to accept the thought for what it is (a simple mental event), and naturally let your mind move to the next carriage in your train of thought.In the long term, it’s worth reflecting on whether you might be over-identifying with work.One way to test this is by assessing how you feel about doing the unthinkable of completely unplugging for a while. Does that make you anxious?What about the idea of retirement — that final “holiday” we’ve worked towards our entire life? This too can be challenging for identity reasons: Giving up work can feel like giving up a part of ourselves. We can prevent that, and ensure we enjoy retirement and all other holidays, by considering what else we could use as equally valid sources of identity.Ultimately, the aim is to see ourselves as the complex creatures we indeed are, defined by more than just our work.Can you say no to returning to the office?

At the time of the incident, some of his victims were warded in the High Dependency Psychiatric Care Unit, a highly specialised ward for patients who are actively disturbed, suicidal or severely mentally ill. Other victims include his then-colleagues and a pregnant woman who responded to an advertisement he posted for a photoshoot model.The man was caught in March this year by a victim who saw him take an upskirt video of her on an escalator at a train station.The police arrested the man on Mar 4 this year at IMH and seized his phones. Four types of videos were found in them - upskirt videos of IMH staff and members of the public, videos of IMH nurses changing, videos of IMH patients showering and videos of the accused molesting IMH patients.As part of his duties caring for patients in the High Dependency Psychiatric Care Unit, the man had to monitor patients in the shower to ensure they did not commit acts of self-harm.Usually, nurses are assigned to wards of their corresponding gender, but the man would occasionally be asked to carry out duties in the female ward by the nurse in charge of the shift.Investigations found that he had filmed nine female patients in the unit.He also molested a victim at the unit who had been restrained to a hospital bed, and filmed himself committing the crime.The man also outraged the modesty of another patient who had been sedated for aggression.In a separate incident, the man posted an advertisement online for a pregnant model for a photoshoot. He asked the woman who responded to the ad to wear a dress that clearly showed her pregnancy bump and met her at Chinese Gardens.While instructing her to face away from him, the man took five upskirt videos of the pregnant woman before placing the videos in an application that password-protected the clips.The man, who is married with four children, pleaded guilty to eight charges of molestation, insulting a woman's modesty and various acts of voyeurism. Another 34 similar charges were taken into consideration. He has been diagnosed with voyeuristic disorder.Deputy Public Prosecutor Thiagesh Sukumaran asked for 58 months' jail and 13 strokes of the cane, taking into account ""the large number of offences, the repugnant and sickening abuse of the accused's position"" and ""how the accused compromised the physical integrity and dignity"" of the patients under his care.Nurses are at the heart of our healthcare system, he said, but the accused instead perpetrated ""egregious abuse at a public hospital"", with his ""despicable conduct"" striking ""at the very ethos of nursing"" and threatening to ""grossly taint and mar the efforts of healthcare workers everywhere"". Defence lawyers Mato Kotwani and Ashwin Ganapathy asked instead for not more than 57 months and a week's jail, and no more than nine strokes of the cane.Mr Kotwani said his client's decision to plead guilty stemmed from his remorse.""He is truly sorry for the hurt and pain he has caused to the victims and their families,"" he said. He added that his client has made ""unqualified confessions to the police, fully assisting in their investigations"".District Judge Luke Tan said he broadly agreed with the prosecution, adding that the accused has ""really done a great disservice"" to the nursing profession.IMH said in response to queries from CNA that it takes a serious view of the incident. It has also since tightened protocol for staff members working in mixed-gender wards.""IMH takes a serious view of the incident and staff conduct, and had fully cooperated with the police in their investigations,"" said an IMH spokesperson, adding that the accused was dismissed on Mar 11. ""We had also reached out to the affected staff and patients, addressed their concerns, and provided support to them,"" the spokesperson said.""Following the charge in court, we have reminded all staff to adhere to the hospital’s code of conduct. We also further tightened our protocol for staff working in mixed-gender wards.""In response to queries by CNA, the Singapore Nursing Board said that the man has not been able to practise as a nurse since he was dismissed from IMH and no longer holds a valid practising certificate.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

The offences took place in 2016. The first victim was a 28-year-old man, who befriended her through a mutual friend.As Wong was down after a break-up with her boyfriend, she went out socially with the first victim, the court heard.During an outing, the victim left his wallet on the table to go to the toilet. Wong took his debit card from the wallet, memorised its details and placed it back.At the time, the victim did not know what Wong had done, but later realised that there were unauthorised transactions on his card.He confronted Wong, who admitted to using his card details to make online purchases without his knowledge. She did so on more than 20 occasions between August and September 2016, buying items like tickets worth more than S$300, a Lazada purchase worth S$320 and a purchase of almost S$200 from an online fashion store.Wong made full restitution for two of the transactions, and the victim managed to dispute the third purchase with the bank.The second victim was a 26-year-old woman who was also a friend of Wong's. She first realised that there were two charges on her card she had not made when she tried to make online payments but could not due to insufficient funds.She realised that she had been charged about S$264 for accommodation at Hotel Clover. Later, she found out that Wong had used credit or debit card details belonging to other people and confronted Wong about it.Wong admitted memorising her card details when the card was unattended. The victim disputed the impugned transaction with her bank and was refunded, with the bank recovering losses from the hotel. Wong has since made restitution to the hotel.The prosecutor asked for two months' jail for Wong, who has no prior convictions. He noted that there were three victims across all 31 charges, and more than S$2,000 involved in total.He recognised that Wong has pleaded guilty and made restitution. He said there was no inordinate delay as mentioned by Wong in a previous hearing, saying the delays were due to the COVID-19 situation and other factors.Wong, who had to plead guilty in the afternoon after omitting to take her mitigation plea with her in the morning, did not add much verbally to her written plea.She said a psychiatric report she had submitted was ""the best possible way to prove that back then in 2016, I was really behaving out of character and it was not something I would normally do at all"".She did not mention in open court what conditions she had, answering the judge's questions to say only that she has been going to a psychiatrist to make sure she is ""alright mentally"".She said she is not on medication and last saw the psychiatrist in November.Wong took part in Miss Universe Singapore 2017 and later became an e-gaming commentator.  The judge asked Wong to attend at the Institute of Mental Health for a report to assess her suitability for a mandatory treatment order.She will return to court in February for a further mention of her case.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

He received immediate attention from officers at the scene and paramedics who arrived 20 minutes later, but he could not be resuscitated.The court heard that Mr Chua, who has two children with his ex-wife, was imprisoned in Changi Prison's Cluster A since 2004, where he was remanded after being charged with kidnapping for a ransom.He was transferred to the psychiatric housing unit in 2018 after his pre-existing bipolar symptoms grew worse. Prison officers in this unit - the sole housing unit that deals with inmates with psychiatric issues or mental disorders - have attended courses to help them in dealing with the inmates.Mr Chua was assessed to be non-suicidal. On the morning of his death, officers dispensed medication to the inmates through metal gates before allowing them out of their cells for the scheduled hour of television time in the TV room.However, Mr Chua - who was noted to be reclusive - had never joined them for TV time and would be allowed out of his cell to roam the day room. He had done this for months without any issue.Closed-circuit television footage showed Mr Chua walking up the stairs from the third floor to the fourth floor, where he began climbing up railings that had bars across them.He climbed sideways from the bars, using them as steps, until he was on the fourth level. By this time, officers spotted him and rushed to the scene and called out to him, but Mr Chua released his grip and fell backwards.He landed on the back of his head at the foot of the stairs on the third floor. Rescue efforts failed and he was declared dead at 10.15am that day.HIS MENTAL HEALTH RECORDSHis only available medical record was from the Institute of Mental Health, where he was remanded in early 2004. He was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.Before this, he had been a managing director in a cleaning company, but his erratic behaviour began to manifest when he visited a university for a meeting and offered to donate a million dollars, before racking up S$600,000 of gambling debts.He later reported being depressed and began drinking heavily. After his conviction and sentence, his wife filed for divorce in order to apply for a rental flat, but still considered him her husband and visited him with their two children.She had been concerned that he had a mental illness since 2002, when he began to manifest hallucinations, telling her that the kitchen was hell and the living room was heaven.She referred him to a private hospital for treatment and suspected he had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depression.In the months before his death, his ex-wife noticed that Mr Chua had become more aggressive towards her during her visits and she felt his medication did little to help him. She last visited him in November 2019, before speaking to him over the phone in June this year.However, she saw no signs of suicidal inclinations in her ex-husband. The other prison officers and Mr Chua's cellmate also did not notice any such signs, the court heard.POST-INCIDENTAfter Mr Chua's death, SPS instructed that no inmate would be allowed to remain alone outside their cells. High-risk inmates will now be warded in the complex's medical centre.The prison is also reviewing its infrastructure design and is considering a sensor system that would be triggered whenever anyone tries to move close to the railings.SPS said it is also studying the feasibility of installing additional railings at the stairs to deter inmates from scaling from the stairs to the railings.The coroner noted that the railings were originally meant to prevent prisoners from falling off the second floor, but unfortunately facilitated Mr Chua's climb instead.The railings are likely to be replaced with ones that cannot be gripped or held onto, the court heard.The coroner noted that Mr Chua had been receiving appropriate medical treatment during his incarceration, and that the prison wardens and medical staff had responded promptly.He conveyed his condolences to Mr Chua's family.In a statement on Tuesday night, SPS said it noted the findings of the coroner's inquiry and that it is ""committed to ensuring the safe and secure custody of inmates"".""Mr Chua's death, which has been ruled a deliberate act of suicide by the coroner, is an unfortunate incident,"" said SPS.It added that SPS officers reached out Mr Chua's family after his death to extend assistance and extended their condolences to his family.Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

225,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/work-from-home-telecommuting-mental-health-business-13783824,21 Dec 2020 06:00AM,"The office was never meant to be at home but because this arrangement is here to stay, bosses need to change the way they respond to their employees, says this observer.NEW YORK CITY: Many managers are treating this year’s pandemic-induced shift to work-from-home as though it were standard telecommuting. But it’s not, and operating under the assumption that it is can ultimately harm employees’ morale.While office workers are typically faring better than essential workers during the pandemic, the abrupt shift to remote work was jarring, and its effects should not be overlooked.Leadership experts and cognitive scientists can attest that resistance to change is less about the change itself and more about losing control and fear of uncertainty. Humans – and other animals, for that matter – respond defensively when the power to make decisions about their own lives is removed.And in a recent study on COVID-19 and mental health, researchers found that adults surveyed in the United States and five European countries who believe that other people or random chance mostly dictates what happens to them also report greater symptoms of depression.There’s a big difference between choosing to telecommute and suddenly being forced to work from home. While eliminating the daily commute has been nice, the average office worker simply wasn’t mentally or financially prepared to turn their home into a makeshift WeWork location while also taking on previously outsourced teaching, childcare, and eldercare duties.Many families do not live in homes that can easily accommodate telecommuting, and some employees’ domestic arrangements are not conducive to success.SET REASONABLE EXPECTATIONSManagers can take several steps to ease these burdens for their employees.Many employees are bearing new burdens and facing pressure from multiple sources. Managers can avoid overwhelming them by eliminating unnecessary reports and redundant procedures, and by being as transparent as possible about deadlines.For example, if an important client meeting is postponed, managers should inform everyone who is preparing materials for it immediately, so they can re-prioritise the day’s tasks.Likewise, managers shouldn’t expect immediate replies to emails – a constant sense of urgency contributes to employee burnout.Sending emails outside of working hours (especially late at night and on weekends) should be avoided, or staff shouldn’t be expected (much less required) to answer after-hours messages immediately.Don’t force employees to be “on” all the time: Zoom fatigue is sky high, and employees may have to manage quiet space so that all household members can participate in their respective work calls and video meetings.SUPPORT AND BE PUBLIC ABOUT PRAISEWomen usually get the short end of the stick, with one author dubbing them “reluctant nomads” in the “battle for space.” For example, an employee might find herself perched on the edge of the bathtub, precariously balancing a computer on her knees, so that her partner and children can conduct their business or school work from the living room, bedroom, and kitchen.And women tend to face unfair criticism and pressure over their appearance on Zoom. Managers should ask whether any meetings could be eliminated, shortened, or conducted without video.Find more opportunities to celebrate accomplishments: While it’s always a good idea to strike a balance between criticism and praise, employees now face a constant flood of terrible news related to the pandemic, and are likely starved for wins.Managers should look for small successes that can be publicly recognised to boost morale, and thank employees for their hard work when they see a job well done. It costs nothing to show appreciation, and a little positive feedback could be exactly what someone needed to hear on a particularly rough day.Capitalise on accessible resources: Managers should look for ways to create more win-win scenarios while leveraging the assets they already have. At Barnard College, for example, we are paying our students to tutor the children of our faculty and staff.Our undergraduates gain part-time work at a time when internships and entry-level jobs are scarce, and our full-time employees can outsource one task among their many responsibilities.We are also offering extended childcare and eldercare benefits through our existing contract with an external provider. Managers who are unclear about where employees need some help could ask them in an anonymous survey about the biggest challenges they face and allocate resources accordingly.Adjusting to sudden change requires effort on everyone’s part. Managers owe it to their employees to stop treating work from home like a luxury.The office wasn’t invited into the home. It turned up like an unexpected guest – and it shows few signs of leaving soon.Can you say no to returning to the office?

227,Commentary: The office Secret Santa gift exchange can be a landmine,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/office-secret-santa-exchange-what-to-buy-13799204,19 Dec 2020 06:00AM,"The Scrooges and Grinches among us are wondering how this workplace obligation managed to survive the pandemic, says Tracy Lee.SINGAPORE: I would be the first to admit that since I became an adult, I have never really been big on giving or receiving gifts.If you earn your own money, why do you have to wait for a special occasion like your birthday or Christmas, and for someone to kill their brain cells trying to read your mind, only to get you something you probably don’t want, like or need?It’s much easier, and way more efficient, to buy yourself anything you want, anytime you wish. Well, that’s the idea in my head anyway. Besides, the things I really want are too expensive as gifts.Which is why I am one of those people who find the concept of the office Secret Santa — a practice of giving an anonymous gift to a colleague whose name one has picked randomly out of a hat — somewhat pointless.And I am not alone in this.Complaints abound in the Twitterverse.“You know when you do Secret Santa and you give the person a gift card, glove and scarf set in a handmade gift bag you sewed yourself, and you get a stained coffee mug with Halloween candy in it?” went one.“We’re having five different Secret Santa exchanges at my work. If one of my presents isn’t a raise to pay for this nonsense, I’m quitting,” went another.GIFTING IN A PANDEMICAccording to a 2019 survey by UK-based job search portal Jobsite, 35 per cent of employees would like to see Secret Santa banned at their workplace; 26 per cent spend more than they can afford on presents for co-workers; 17 per cent feel that they are judged based on how much they spend on gifts for colleagues.You can imagine how many more people feel this way in 2020, when COVID-19 has led to so many of us working from home, consuming less — and more consciously — in an attempt to save our planet (and our dwindling bank accounts).Add to this we are stressing out over our mental health and how our vulnerable loved ones are doing. While desperately Marie Kondo-ing our possessions to spark joy amid a very challenging year.Buying gifts for family and friends we care about would make the trip to town, with the December downpours and the insane crowds, worth the trouble. But for co-workers whom we have not seen for much of the year?Yet, it is the season of giving after all and we don’t want to sound particularly Gringe-y. In the past, the easiest thing to do used to be, to buy something edible, like chocolates or biscuits.But with so many people adopting trendy dietary restrictions nowadays, knowing if your colleague has nut allergies, does keto, suffers from gluten-intolerance, is insulin-resistant, avoiding carbs, or simply doesn’t have a sweet tooth – makes for a tough decision.ARE THERE FAIL SAFE GIFTS?This is where beverages could come in handy: Think premium tea in a beautiful canister, a DIY hot chocolate kit, a subscription box of fair-trade coffee beans.Another previously failsafe office Secret Santa commandment, was to buy something to perk up the recipient’s workspace. Unfortunately, in the past nine months of work-from-home, hasn’t everyone already bought as many succulents, photo frames, aromatherapy diffusers, ring lights, ergonomic wrist rests and mini USB-desk fans as they need for their home offices?If you want some ideas on what to buy, there are no lack of articles to help you along. Just search for Secret Santa gifts and the first thing that pops up is “31 Secret Santa gifts your co-workers will love”.Among the many suggestions are evergreen winners: Novelty socks, desktop golf, bowling or Zen Garden kits, office mugs emblazoned with passive-aggressive messages such as “I survived another meeting that should have been an email”.Or how about a notebook shaped like a block of cheese for all your “Gouda ideas”?To me though, having gifted and given many a notebook, chances are most of these stocking stuffers are going to end up being re-gifted, or abandoned in the deep dark recesses of the drawer in your home.Perhaps the best thing to do is just drop the pretense, ask the person you are buying for what would he or she like and get it over with – no one ends up with waste and everyone gets what they want.THE SECRET SIGNALS OF GIFTINGThen there are the potential dangers associated with gifting colleagues — ill-intentioned folks using anonymous workplace gift giving as an opportunity to bully, harass or sabotage; of sensitive souls taking offence when none was intended; of privacy being invaded, especially since your Secret Santa needs your address in order to be able to send you your gift.You’ll have to be careful too about the gift you get – a bottle of wine for someone who is trying to cut drinking or a bath set for someone with body odour – these can be interpreted poorly.Watching too much Black Mirror has also made me illogically paranoid. Is the fact that the office babe getting a cute bear from the office nerd suspicious? Does it have a hidden camera?Or if your nefarious nemesis gifted you with a USB stick, could it be infected with a malicious virus that could wipe out all your Excel spreadsheets and PowerPoint presentations?Then there’s the biggest headache of all – what if you draw your boss? Suddenly, there’s all this unnecessary pressure to make sure your gift is classy yet not too expensive or worse, doesn’t send the wrong signal (it may not be a good idea to gift a book on how to be a better manager for instance).To put an end to all this Secret Santa-related stress and anxiety, companies should let employees opt out if they so wish, or abolish the practice altogether, and make a donation to charity instead.We do have colleagues who are friends so people should just decide who, what and how they want to share gifts.But if you really, really can’t bear to see Secret Santa die or just don’t want to be the wet blanket that opts out of the mandated office fun, then do the most sensible thing – re-gift what you get to your mother-in-law. Socks are always useful.Tracy Lee is a freelance writer who writes about food, travel, fashion and beauty.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

228,Tennis coach jailed for sexually exploiting 14-year-old male student,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tennis-coach-jailed-sexually-exploiting-14-year-old-male-student-13800220,18 Dec 2020 06:32PM,"SINGAPORE: A freelance tennis coach who was ""ashamed of his sexuality"" grew close to a 14-year-old male student he taught and later exploited him sexually.Phoo Siang Qing, 40, was jailed for 33 months on Friday (Dec 18) for two counts of sexual exploitation of a young person and one count of sexual penetration of a minor. Six other similar charges were considered in sentencing.The court heard that Phoo began coaching the victim at his school in 2011. The boy was in Secondary 1 at the point in time.After an overseas trip in June 2013, the boy and his coach became closer.The boy also went for additional training lessons as he wanted to train more, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lee Zu Zhao.Phoo began taking the boy for dinner, asking him out for movies and taking him home. He began kissing the boy's cheek and forehead when he dropped him off at his house, and asked if he could kiss his lips.The boy was initially reluctant but eventually gave in, according to court documents, and Phoo would later regularly give the boy goodbye kisses on the lips.Court documents stated that they would also hug and kiss in Phoo's car or house, and Phoo started molesting the boy.Occasionally, the boy would follow Phoo home after training and they would shower together and perform sex acts on each other.Court documents did not specify how the crimes came to light. The prosecutor asked for at least four years' jail, while the defence asked for 16 months.Lawyer Peter Keith Fernando said his client came from an abusive family, which had an effect on his esteem and self-worth.""He had a sexual orientation as a teenager in secondary school where he was not attracted to members of the opposite sex and felt uncomfortable and ashamed of his sexuality,"" said Mr Fernando.Phoo had difficulties with interpersonal relationships and his mental health, was reserved in nature and lacked self-confidence, he added.He said his client periodically suffered from depression and that the crimes occurred ""in the context of the nature of a relationship between them which had developed into an interpersonal one"".The victim ""had expressed curiosity about sexuality"" and asked Phoo about it on several occasions.""My client perceives that it had developed into a relationship with the (victim). Each time the (victim) was with him, he had voluntarily gone to the accused's car to be fetched home, he had gone to the accused's house. It was not a question of my client in any way pressuring him to be with him,"" said Mr Fernando.The prosecutor responded that the psychiatric report tendered by the defence did not show how Phoo's conditions reduced his culpability in any way.He added that the victim knew Phoo only because he was his coach and this was a coach-student relationship, which featured an abuse of trust.For each count of sexual exploitation of a young person, Phoo could have been jailed for up to five years, fined up to S$10,000, or both.For sexual penetration of a minor, he could have been jailed up to 10 years and fined.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

Ahmed, who was betrothed to another woman at the time, first strangled 34-year-old Indonesian national Nurhidayati Wartono Surata with a towel. He then tied a rope around her neck in several knots and twisted her head forcefully.He stole her valuables and left her body to be found by a receptionist later that night. An autopsy found the cause of death to be strangulation and a cervical spine injury.Judicial Commissioner Mavis Chionh found that his actions before, during and after the killing ""demonstrated premeditation, cogent planning and methodical execution"".She rejected Ahmed's partial defence of grave and sudden provocation – that the victim had humiliated him by saying: ""He is better than you, he is better than you in the hotel, he is better in bed, he is better financially. If you don't believe, next week I will go with him, we’ll make a video and show you."" The judge found that the victim had said no such humiliating words. Ahmed had not mentioned these words in his multiple police statements and in his interviews with the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) psychiatrist.The allegations surfaced only one-and-a-half years after the incident, when Ahmed was providing his account of events to the defence psychiatrist.""I find his explanations for his failure to mention the humiliating words in the police statements and to (the IMH psychiatrist) to be far-fetched,"" said the judge. ""I agree with the prosecution that the accused's story of the humiliating words was precisely that – a story.""Even if the victim had said such words, the judge said that this was a premeditated killing, with Ahmed keeping a rope in his pants and taking it with him to the hotel and clearing his bank account beforehand.""On the totality of the evidence ... I find that the accused had decided even before Dec 30, 2018, that he would kill the deceased so long as she refused to leave her new boyfriend and to get back together with him,"" said Judicial Commissioner Chionh.Ahmed had also made several admissions in his police statements that showed his premeditated plan to kill the victim.In his testimony at trial, led by defence lawyers Eugene Thuraisingam, Chooi Jing Yen and Hamzah Malik, Ahmed said he considered the victim to be his wife, even though they were not married. He was diagnosed with adjustment disorder at the time of the offence, but no contributory link was found between this disorder and the crime.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.

232,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/spa-beauty-wellness-pampering-covid-19-13749504,13 Dec 2020 06:01AM,"If you find yourself booking an ultra-indulgent spa or a meal at an expensive restaurant when you never did before, you are not alone says Kristen Juliet Soh.SINGAPORE: I met up with a friend recently and noticed she was sporting a radiant “holiday glow”, knowing that she couldn’t have come back from any leisurely overseas trip.“It must be the spa ‘day-cation’ I had yesterday,” she told me.She had spent almost S$600 on a four-hour retreat at a spa, which included a massage, a facial, a manicure, and a meal.Having known her for a long time, she had always struck me as someone rather prudent with her money. I had never would have thought she would splurge on a day spa as extravagant as this.“I’ve cancelled all my travel plans this year and decided to direct a portion of that budget to this instead,” she explained.Her explanation justified her actions. After all, a one-week trip to Japan would have set you back by at least S$2,000 even if you didn’t shop too much.“This is the only way for me to truly feel like I’m catching a break, especially with everything that’s going on this year.”REDIRECTING TRAVEL BUDGETSI am also guilty of splurging on things I normally won’t spend too much on in 2020.Specifically, expensive beauty devices – facial rollers, LED light devices, eye massagers, you name it. I acquired most of them during those two long, gloomy months of circuit breaker when facial salons weren’t allowed to operate and I was spending all my weekends at home.I have been extremely lucky to still keep my job during this crisis. But while trying to cope with the changes and shocks that came with the pandemic and lockdown, I found respite in my grooming routines.I consoled myself that staying home gives me more time to re-focus on myself and I should make the best out of the situation by achieving a “post-circuit breaker glow” that I can flaunt when I meet people again.I noticed that people are spending on more luxurious beauty services on Salon Finder, a salon voucher e-commerce site owned by Daily Vanity.Compared to the same period in 2019, the number of voucher transactions jumped approximately 180 per cent this year.This trend started as early as June, even before the Government gave the green light for salons to re-open, which means that consumers are buying vouchers in order to use them later as soon as salons reopen.And as the year progressed, with little hope for an overseas holiday more consumers are spending locally.When she launched the Beauty Services Competency Framework in August, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Low Yen Ling spoke of this strong demand for beauty and wellness services, despite COVID-19 restrictions.At the event, Ms Low said: ""People still want to look good and feel great. In fact, given the current travel restrictions, more people are having to look for spa and beauty services locally.’’THE LIPSTICK EFFECTSpa owners are seeing healthy numbers too – many say their packages, especially couple packages, are already fully booked till the end of the year.Even aesthetic clinics I spoke to say they’re seeing more business than before.They tell me people are going for treatments on weekdays since they can simply head home after their lunchtime aesthetic fix, without worrying about their colleagues questioning them about the marks on their faces.Some call this the “lipstick effect”. This is an economic theory that says consumers are more willing to purchase relatively affordable luxuries like a Chanel lipstick during a recession, instead of big-ticket luxury goods, such as a Chanel bag since they will not be able to afford it. (Ironically, lipstick sales have gone down in 2020 probably because of mask-wearing, but you get the idea.)While the lipstick effect may be at play, there is more to this behaviour than just an economic response.After all, the pandemic has triggered more than a recession. Our lives have changed in so many other ways: We can’t travel whenever we want. Big family gatherings, such as birthday party for Grandma, are no longer possible.Even eating out with friends come with restrictions too.WHY SELF-CARE HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANTSelf-care has always been commonly practised even before 2020, whether visiting a spa or spending time at home with a sheet mask as we sip on a cup of hot tea.But the pandemic has made self-care more meaningful than before.Every aspect of our lives is now regulated in order to manage the pandemic, still without a clear end.Splurging on spa treatments or a more pampering skincare routine serves as a sliver of warmth and comfort in what seems like an endless winter.It is something we need for our mental well-being during these trying times.I would argue self-care in a pandemic has become a necessity.Of course, I’m not saying you should go out and splurge on a S$600 spa day. This is still a huge luxury for many.But it is okay to find respite in our grooming routines – expensive or not – as a way to focus on yourself and get your mind off worrisome news and the unknown future for a while.I know my superhero mask is a sheet mask. Because whenever I take time to recharge myself through my skincare routine, I find myself emerging more energised than before to take on whatever the world has to throw at me.Kristen Juliet Soh is the editorial director and co-founder of Daily Vanity, which owns Salon Finder.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

233,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/doctor-jailed-upskirt-videos-gopro-cameras-chu-ben-wee-13750534,11 Dec 2020 02:40PM,"SINGAPORE: Over at least four years, a medical student-turned-doctor took more than 3,000 upskirt videos of female students from his junior college and later of nurses and colleagues at the hospitals he worked at.Chu Ben Wee, 28, hid GoPro cameras in what he considered his ""special shoes"" to carry out the offences on hundreds of women. This is one of the most prolific serial upskirt cases in Singapore, the prosecution said.The National University of Singapore graduate was sentenced to three years' jail on Friday (Dec 11) for four counts of insulting a woman's modesty. Another 13 charges were taken into consideration.The court heard that Chu was a student at Raffles Junior College (RJC) between 2009 and 2010 and later graduated with a medical degree in 2016, going on to work as a medical officer at two different hospitals.His offences took place between 2009 and 2019, with gaps in between. He began taking videos in his junior college years, capturing 666 clips in 2009 and 2010.His modus operandi included a pair of black sports shoes, which he would cut holes in at the front. He then concealed GoPro cameras in the shoes, aligning the lenses to the cut holes, and downloaded applications linked to the cameras that gave him live feeds on his phone. This set-up allowed him to control the camera's functions through the app.Whenever he wanted to film upskirt videos, he wore what he refers to as his ""special shoes"" and followed women he found attractive or were suitable targets.Generally, he targeted women in short skirts or dresses in their late teens or up to 30 years old. He would follow them closely after observing that they were wearing only underwear and not shorts under their skirts, and position his foot underneath to capture the videos.Back home, Chu would transfer the videos to a hard disk and tag them with information such as their names, estimated ages, race, colour or type of underwear and other clothing.When he had the urge to masturbate, he would do so while watching the videos.When he began working as a doctor, Chu targeted nurses and female colleagues in two hospitals using the same modus operandi.THE FIRST ARRESTIn January 2018, he was taking upskirt videos at a store in Novena Square 2 when the victim felt something make contact with her ankle and turned to see Chu.She observed him and suspected that he was using something other than his phone to record upskirt videos of her, so she squatted down and pretended to browse items on a lower shelf.When she did so, she noticed the camera hidden in Chu's shoe and immediately confronted him, shouting for help. Chu was detained and admitted to police that he had taken upskirt videos of her.He was arrested and a search conducted at his house, with police seizing his shoes and other devices containing at least 2,945 upskirt videos. Chu also identified the other 666 videos he had filmed while at RJC.He was released on bail, but offended again while he was a clerk doing his national service. He bought more shoes, devices and a GoPro camera in April 2019 and filmed upskirt videos at various locations for a week or two until a victim spotted him in the act at Plaza Singapura.He ran away but was later arrested. Of the 217 upskirt videos found on his devices, clips of 184 women went undetected and he was released again on bail.THE JUNIOR COLLEGE FAIRIn July 2019, he saw on a junior college's website that they were having a career fair. He bought a PE shirt and long white pants that were part of the JC uniform on Carousell and bought the equipment for his video-taking before going down to the fair.He walked closely behind a teacher and was not stopped by the security guard at the main gate. After changing into the VJC uniform in the toilet, he went to the canteen, where he concealed the GoPro camera in his shoe.He then began recording upskirt videos of female students as he followed them to the school hall. Over the next two hours, he walked around the hall, targeting any female student who was wearing a skirt and letting the recording run so he could capture multiple victims. In total, he recorded 97 videos containing 309 separate upskirt incidents that day.A female student noticed that Chu had walked slowly towards her friend in the school hall and kept pointing his foot forward while looking at his phone.Suspecting that something was amiss, she and her friend watched him and noticed that he would walk very close to a female student before pointing his foot forward and lifting it up off the ground while looking at his phone.One of the girls noticed a hole in Chu's shoe and suspected that there was a hidden camera. They alerted a teacher, and Chu was later located at a toilet. He had changed out of the school attire and claimed that he was from the Ministry of Defence manning one of the booths.He eventually admitted that he was just a visitor and was arrested after a teacher called the police. He was subsequently remanded.ONE OF THE MOST PROLIFIC CASESThe prosecutor on Friday asked for at least 37 months' jail, calling Chu ""one of the most prolific serial upskirt video recorders to come before our courts"".""Such systematic and premeditated violation of women’s privacy at public places, in a workplace setting and most worryingly, at schools, inevitably causes considerable public disquiet and must be met with condign punishment,"" said Deputy Public Prosecutor Sruthi Boppana.""In total, the accused took no less than no less than 3,260 intrusive videos of women over the course of about four years,"" she said. ""He is one of the most persistent and frequent upskirt offenders to have ever reached the courts. The sheer number of upskirt videos he took, and the frequency of his wrongdoing, indicate a strong need for specific deterrence.""She pointed to how Chu took ""special care"" to disguise himself as a student at the JC fair and targeted young victims between the ages of 16 and 18.While Chu was assessed by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) to be suffering from a paraphilic disorder and major depressive disorder, there was no contributory link between his illnesses and his offences.Chu had told the IMH doctor that he started watching pornography when he was in kindergarten while he was unsupervised. This continued in secondary school and he began filming upskirt videos when he was 17, usually when he experienced stressors in life.Defence lawyer Luke Lee asked for a shorter jail term, saying that his client had first seen a doctor only after his January 2018 arrest, and that Chu is aware he needs to be treated.When he recovers, he can return to be a beneficial member of society, said the lawyer.For each charge of insulting a woman's modesty, Chu could have been jailed for up to a year, fined, or both. He was allowed to begin his sentence from Jan 9 this year, when he was remanded.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['court', 'crime', 'upskirt']",Singapore
235,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-virtual-travel-webcam-live-stream-tourism-13725962,09 Dec 2020 06:12AM,"Webcams have connected individuals to distant countries and even areas of their very own cities, says an observer.PRESTON, England: During the first UK lockdown I received an email from my son’s primary school with a list of webcams we might enjoy having a look at. We particularly enjoyed watching and identifying the animals at a particular African watering hole that we could watch live online.I continued exploring this world of live-streamed place-based webcams, something I had previously overlooked. I was fascinated by those focusing on city centres, which revealed largely deserted urban landscapes.I left nature cams and coastal webcams open on my PC monitor as welcome distractions as I worked from home. They offered me a portal to the outside world, when I, like so many others, was trapped inside.MASSIVE UPSURGE IN WEBCAM TRAVELI suspected I was not alone in my virtual travels. Indeed, the media soon described a massive upsurge in the usage of these webcams.Edinburgh Zoo saw its webcam views surge from about 100,000 to 5 million per month. As an expert in tourism, I wanted to explore this further. I set up a questionnaire and heard from 227 members of the public about their experiences travelling through webcams.Some had used webcam travel for years, as a way to connect to nature. One respondent described the appeal of his favourite webcam at an eagle’s nest:I enjoy watching the eggs hatch and observing the eaglets mature over springtime, learning to fly, and leaving the next. I find it a nice antidote to the urban environment in which I live and work.Respondents found webcam travel relaxing, especially when the subject was nature and wildife – “It makes me feel calm and relaxed when I’m stressed or feeling anxious”.Coastal scenes were also very popular. One person told me:I always found, in the time before the lockdown, looking at the sea to be relaxing. I really miss walking by the coast. Watching the waves helps me to feel more connected with the outside world and reminds of me what is waiting once it is safe to venture out once more.One thing that these accounts revealed was the importance of the live and unfiltered nature of webcam travel: “It helps to keep in touch with places and things I like. Also watching in real-time makes you feel almost as if [you are] there.”The live nature of the experience seemed to facilitate a sense of connection.THE RISE OF VIRTUAL TRAVEL AMID COVID-19The places which are visited virtually, through these predominantly static webcams, are varied, numerous and increasingly popular. Wildlife settings, coastal scenes, city centres, zoos, aquariums and countryside are all favourites.This increase in popularity is unsurprising given the events of 2020. This year, our freedoms have been restricted in a way most people have never experienced. In this context, webcam travel is a way to connect to nature and the outdoors.Brockholes Nature Reserve, Lancashire, told me that they saw 850 views of their two nature-cams in February 2020 but two months later, in April, this number had increased to 13,917 – a rise of 1,537 per cent.The company SkylineWebcams, meanwhile, have over 1,000 place-based webcams around the globe showing city centres, heritage sites and a variety of resorts. In May, they told me that they too had seen an enormous rise in popularity of their webcams, saying:With the spread of COVID-19 our site has, in fact, witnessed an increase in numbers, rising from an average of 70 million monthly page views to 120 million in March.A WAY TO CONNECT WITH THE OUTSIDE WORLDWebcams have definitely played an interesting role during lockdown, they have connected individuals to both distant countries and areas of their very own cities they would usually attend on a day-to-day basis.My research supported these reports: I found that nearly a third of the respondents tried webcam travel for the first time during lockdown, and 64 per cent were viewing webcams for longer periods of time than normal.69 per cent said they were more likely to physically visit places they had viewed through webcams, when restrictions were lifted.Webcam travel therefore provides a relatively affordable way for tourism organisations to connect with visitors as recovery looms. 90 per cent of respondents felt a sense of connection to place or nature and 83 per cent felt more positive after webcam travel.Of the two-thirds who tended to view webcams of places that they already knew before lockdown, 83 per cent said that this experience brought back happy memories.One wrote of his favourite webcam at Arnside: “A beautiful and unspoiled place in Cumbria – each time I look at it, it evokes very happy memories of lovely visits there.”Nostalgia can ward off negative feelings such as loneliness, boredom and stress. This offers refuge against the challenges, anxieties and frustrations associated with lockdown.The subjects of many of the webcams are outdoor natural settings or wildlife-related.Environmental psychology offers insights which help explain this appeal. It has been proven that exposure to natural environments offers wellness related benefits associated with positive feelings such as calm, refreshment and enjoyment.Even exposure to pictures of natural environments can be linked to mood restoration.AN UPLIFTING EXPERIENCEIn 2020, webcam travel offers a feeling of control over our movements, allowing us to exercise our freedom – at least virtually if not corporeally.Yet the experience is an uplifting one. It seems to be relaxing and improves mood at a time when there are widespread concerns regarding mental health, offering an unfiltered experience which supplements and supports connection to place and nature.As our freedom of movement continues to be curtailed due to COVID-19, webcam travel seems set to continue. This may strike some as depressing, but webcam travel is not just way to cope via escapism or nostalgia: It allows a connection to places we know or plan to explore sometime in 2021.Such imaginative travel can allow us to catch a glimpse of a more positive future. It also offers an opportunity to the tourism sector to connect to its customers as it considers how to recover.And connecting with nature, albeit virtually, is no bad thing for us, the wildlife charities who share their nature-cams, or the planet.David Jarratt is Senior Lecturer in Tourism Management at the University of Central Lancashire.

237,"Unable to travel, employees struggle to clear unused annual leave while some firms adjust policies",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/employees-struggle-to-clear-unused-annual-leave-travel-covid-19-13699254,07 Dec 2020 06:01AM,"SINGAPORE: Many employees are struggling to clear their days of annual leave, said human resource experts, as COVID-19 travel restrictions prevent Singaporeans from going overseas for leisure.Some employees have tried to save up their unused leave days to bring them forward to the next year, but the lack of a break from work could take a toll on their mental and physical health, experts told CNA.“Many employees tend to not take annual leave when they are working from home, as they do not feel like they need a ‘getaway’ from the office environment,” said Ms Jaya Dass, Randstad’s managing director for Singapore and Malaysia.“However, not taking leave for a long period of time can impact energy levels, mental health and overall well-being,” she said, adding that this could lead to employee burnout.Over-working could also cause higher stress levels, more health problems, as well as reduced creativity and performance, said Robert Walters South East Asia HR director Tricia Tan, factors which could reduce productivity.Employees hoarding and carrying forward their unused leave days is also an issue for companies, noted Ms Dass, as firms would have to register those unused leave days as a financial liability in the profit and loss statements.And this might not be a feasible option for start-ups and small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) that usually have a lower cash flow, she said.If companies allow employees to bring forward their unused leave to the next year, it could lead to a “drastic drop” in the workforce when leisure travel can resume.“This would affect productivity levels and increase stress on the employees who have to take on more workload,” Ms Dass added.ENCASHING LEAVETo address the issue of unused leave, Nanyang Technological University (NTU) introduced an initiative to allow employees to donate their leave days to raise money for student aid.It announced in November that employees donated more than 20,000 days of unused leave worth S$10.25 million.The voluntary donations were made by 1,821 faculty and staff members, with each employee contributing an average of 11 days. The highest donation was 15 days of leave. This could be a viable option for firms, but only if it is a voluntary option for employees, said Ms Dass.“It will not be good for employee morale if it is made mandatory that they have to give up their annual leave, especially if they are allowed to carry forward some to 2021,” she added.Re-encashment of unused leave towards charitable purposes sets the “right intention”, said Ms Tan.That aside, companies that allow the encashment of leave in light of the COVID-19 situation could be setting a precedent where employees might think this is an option in future, she warned.It could drive “wrong behaviours around hoarding leave so that they can encash it at the year-end”, she added.Encashment costs money, which will place financial strain on businesses that are already struggling, Ms Tan said, adding that the priority at the moment should be on ensuring that business operations can continue viably so that employees will continue to have a job.WHAT COMPANIES CAN DOOther options companies can look into include allowing a portion of annual leave to be carried over to the next year to be cleared within a set time period, or enforcing block leave.Companies can also allow employees to use their annual leave as flexible credits for benefits such as self-improvement courses, counselling, health screening, yoga and gym classes as well as health supplements, said Ms Tan.The last option is to forfeit the leave, she added, but this is the “worst case scenario” that companies should avoid “as it opens up feelings of discontent and unfairness”.Some companies told CNA that they have adjusted their leave policies given the unprecedented situation brought about by COVID-19.Mr Ernest Phang, OCBC’s head of corporate services of group human resources, said that the company recognises the “exceptional year” due to the pandemic.“This year, our employees would be able to carry forward additional days of their annual leave to 2021 (from the current seven days to 12 days) or choose to encash some days (up to five days) of their annual leave,” he said.In addition, employees on the OCBC Flex Plan will continue to be able to convert up to three days of their leave for credits, which can be used to reimburse co-payment of medical expenses for themselves or their family members, insurance premiums, wellness and other personal expenses.UOB’s head of group human resources Dean Tong said that the bank increased the number of unused annual leave days that can be carried over into 2021, from 10 to 14 days.The bank also revised its employee care programme this year to allow staff members to use up to two days of annual leave carried forward to offset any expenses. Previously, this applied only to health and wellness expenses.A Keppel spokesperson told CNA that the conglomerate’s policy allows unused leave to be carried forward to the following year, up to a maximum of one year’s provision.“We encourage our employees to consume their annual leave and take days off to unwind and recharge,” the spokesperson said.Ultimately, it is up to the line managers is ensure that employees use their annual leave and take time to recharge and disconnect from work, said Ms Tan.“As a line manager, practising what you preach is important - leading by example and setting the tone of the importance of time off,” she added.On the need to disconnect from work, she said: “We should not neglect the fact that annual leave is set out with the key intention and purpose of allowing employees to take time off work to rest, renew themselves physically and mentally.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

Member states of the UN drug agency had on Wednesday voted 27-25 with one abstention for Recommendation 5.1, which states that cannabis and cannabis resin should be deleted from Schedule IV of the 1961 Convention – a global text governing drug controls. ""I put this down to the power of money. Companies see a huge amount of profit and a very invidious idea that cannabis is not harmful is being pushed,"" said Mr Shanmugam. ""But the evidence that it is harmful is quite substantive.""Mr Shanmugam noted that last year, the medical journal Lancet highlighted that there was a greater risk of psychotic disorder from the abuse of cannabis.The Surgeon General of the United States also pointed to three negative effects of cannabis, said Mr Shanmugam, including an effect on adolescents' learning and a decline in IQ.Singapore's Institute of Mental Health in 2015 reviewed ""all the reputable literature on the subject"" and presented it to the UN, he added. ""The evidence was quite clear. I said it to the United Nations at the UN. I said, look, if there is evidence that it is not harmful, we will change. But so far, what we have done has worked for us,"" said the minister. ""It should be doctors and medical associations who should be telling us that they need this for medical purposes and if so, a framework can be worked out, to be given to patients who need it, with suitable safeguards,"" he added.""It should not be profit-driven companies which decide, which you buy over the counter, and say that it is for medical purposes.""Speaking to reporters on the sidelines of a launch of a book featuring quotes by rehabilitated ex-offenders, Mr Shanmugam cited several negative effects of legalising cannabis, using Colorado state as an example. One study estimates that for every dollar Colorado receives in tax money from the sale of drugs, another US$4.50 is spent to deal with the negative consequences, he said.""Increased number of people in prisons, increased homicides, increased crime ... How can it not be concerning? The evidence is there,"" he added.Singapore needs to ""hold the line"" on the issue, Mr Shanmugam said. ""Of course, it depends on persuading the population with rational arguments, with science, and also trying to persuade the international community,"" he told reporters.""I think if it were based on rationality and science, I have no doubt we will succeed. But we are also fighting the power of money in other countries.""DRUG SITUATION IN SINGAPORE 'UNDER CONTROL' When asked to assess Singapore's current drug situation, Mr Shanmugam said: ""You can never win the fight. But, we more or less have it under control."" He noted that the number of first-time drug abusers being picked up in Singapore has been on the rise.With East Asia and Southeast Asia being the second-largest market for meth, Mr Shanmugam said the situation is ""not pretty"". ""As I have said, we have managed to have it under control in Singapore, but you need to be constantly on the vigil, and there is a fight internationally as well,"" he added. ""We need to put forward our position, persuade countries that it is in the public interest – their public interest as well as our interest – that we fight this together.""Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

239,Teenagers on REACH panel signals inclusivity: Chairman Tan Kiat How,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/teenagers-on-reach-panel-signals-inclusivity-chairman-tan-kiat-13682260,04 Dec 2020 02:54PM,"SINGAPORE: At the end of a long interview on Tuesday evening (Dec 1), REACH chairman Tan Kiat How nearly sprinted out the door to get home to his family.He was rushing home to bathe four-month-old Isaac, in a narrow window of time which he tries to set aside for his newborn, before heading out again for house visits in his constituency.Singapore's future, how he wanted to make it a better place for his son, and the hopes, dreams and anxieties of young people here came up more than once as he spoke about how REACH hopes to engage Singaporeans in the future.It was Mr Tan's idea to have more students on the new REACH supervisory panel, the youngest of whom is 17.Of the 39 members on the panel, which will sit for a two-year term, 15 are representatives of tertiary institutions, up from five in the last committee.Ten members come from the polytechnics, the Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Singapore Institute of Technology and ITE colleges. Five are from the autonomous universities, which were represented in the last panel.""I wanted to signal inclusiveness, inclusivity. There's no reason why only representatives from the universities are on the REACH panel. Having engaged with young people from ITEs and polytechnics. I do think they have a very strong perspective, very good perspective on issues,"" Mr Tan, who is also Minister of State in the Prime Minister's Office and for National Development, said.He shared how he met many students when he attended their graduation ceremonies and dialogue sessions as CEO of the Infocomm and Media Development Authority (IMDA), when he worked closely with the media industry and schools with media training programmes.""There are some young people who may express themselves in different ways. They don't write essays, but they can express themselves in art, doing video clips, films, or just talking about things in a more casual session, like going to a cafe, talking about things ... (it) doesn't mean your voice matters less,"" he said.The youth members have already given some fresh ideas to revamp engagement with young people and given them ideas about what topics people their age have at the ""top of their minds"", he said.While they're concerned about job opportunities in the midst of the pandemic, young people are also very concerned about climate change and sustainability, as well as mental well-being.The East Coast GRC member of parliament (MP) shared how he himself had to adjust to a different rhythm as he became an MP, an officeholder and a father at the same time about four months ago.""It's very hard to juggle time between work, constituency, family ... it's very tough - I'm still adjusting, still learning. I think that's one of the biggest changes was actually also finding time for myself and my wife,"" he said. ""And this is one of the topics that came up very often the young people -  mental health.""REACHING MIDDLE AGEThis focus on engaging young people comes at a time when REACH is nearing middle age.At its 35-year mark, REACH has evolved since its days as the Feedback Unit, which was started in 1985 when there were far fewer ways for the man on the street to get his voice heard.Then in 2006, the Feedback Unit was restructured and renamed REACH - becoming the lead agency for engaging and connecting with citizens, and adding more online feedback channels on top of traditional ones.Now in 2020, it's getting its eighth chairman and renewing its mission. Today, with a plethora of communication options available to anyone with a laptop and a smartphone, the situation seems to have turned on its head - is there too much noise out there? Is there a need for REACH?According to Mr Tan, there's much more to REACH than just collecting feedback: It reaches out to segments of society that may have been overlooked, and it experiments with new ways of engaging citizens, while building trust and relationships with different segments of society over time.“We want to reach out to every segment of society in the modality which they are comfortable with and create a safe space to have that conversation, because we want to hear from them. ""And not just superficial feedback, but understanding what drives them, what their anxieties or concerns are, what their hopes and aspirations are, what Singapore they want to build,"" he said.DOES FEEDBACK ""SINK INTO THE DEEP SEA""?But do these conversations have a practical impact on public policies? Mr Tan admits that some Singaporeans feel that they give feedback, but it then ""sinks into the deep sea"", never to surface. It's a misperception, he said.“We take every feedback, every suggestion very seriously and the team pores over it, analyses it, collates it and sends it to the ministries. We try to get back as well ... We keep trying to do more to close the feedback loop.""When he was at the receiving end of feedback at IMDA, he was glad for it, he said, especially when it came from groups that the tech and media agency would not usually reach out to. This came in useful when the agency tried to digitalise hawker centres.""When we first started the programme, there was a lot of apprehension by hawkers and stallholders. But REACH went out to them through listening points or engaging them with the IMDA team, and we had very useful feedback,"" he recounted.The agency also tries to make sure that they hear the voices of those who are ""hard to reach"", such as those living in rental flats, and prison inmates.""It's not just going through surveys, because often times it's about building a relationship with the person,"" he said.REACH said it spoke to more than 120 inmates at the Lloyd Leas Community Supervision Centre earlier this year - an idea from the younger members of the team to reach deeper into the community.In one-on-one conversations with REACH officers, they shared their aspirations of being able to find a job, having the courage to turn away from their old friends and really start anew, being forgiven by their families, as well as their cost-of-living concerns.BULIDING TRUSTREACH continues to try out new ways of reaching people, even during the ""circuit breaker"" when they could not organise physical events. That was when WhatsApp chat groups were created to find out how people were coping during the coronavirus outbreak. The response was ""overwhelming"", he said.REACH said it has been able to engage more Singaporeans using digital platforms this year, and has more than 1,200 members in its WhatsApp group chats. While fewer participants have attended its dialogues due to COVID-19 safety measures, it set up e-Listening points for citizens to give feedback online. About 49,000 people were reached compared to 35,815 in 2019 and 21,300 in 2018.Over the years, REACH has also helped to change the government's mindset about engagement, Mr Tan said. Each ministry now has a communications and engagement unit.""It wasn't a natural state or the natural inclination of most policymakers 35 years ago,"" he said, but he added that there were still gaps to fill.“Ultimately, the way I see REACH's role is not just getting feedback, but creating platforms and building that trust, that relationship on those platforms that people can feel comfortable sharing their views with one another,"" he said.“Moving forward, we do want create more spaces where citizens can come in and speak about things.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

240,Commentary: We can no longer ignore the health risks of climate change in Asia,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/climate-change-public-health-crisis-temperature-sea-rise-food-13691900,04 Dec 2020 06:19AM,"Asia is particularly vulnerable due to its increased exposure to the effects of climate change, says an observer.SEATTLE: Surface air temperatures over land have increased by around 1.5 degrees Celsius in the last 150 years, leading to adverse impacts on human health and well-being.Further warming will magnify these risks, depending on the extent of emissions reduction and investment in building climate-resilient health systems.Asia is particularly vulnerable due to increased exposure to the consequences of climate change. It is projected to experience increases in ambient temperatures, extreme precipitation events and sea level rise.These will have health consequences, including temperature-related morbidity and mortality, injuries and deaths from extreme weather events, vector-borne diseases and undernutrition.EXTREME WEATHER DETRIMENTAL TO HEALTHAsia has already experienced an increase in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as tropical cyclones, ﬂoods, droughts and heatwaves, resulting in significant numbers of injuries and deaths.The region is particularly at risk because of the large and growing populations, long coastlines, abundant low-lying areas and reliance on the agricultural sector and natural resources.Increasing unpredictability of the annual monsoon is of particular concern in Southeast Asia. These vulnerabilities amplify climate-related risks in many countries.Compounding of extreme weather events, such as high temperatures coinciding with cyclones or back-to-back heatwaves, are also of particular concern and will occur with increasing frequency.Under most scenarios, rising temperatures will expose large populations to health-damaging heatwaves throughout Asia. Risks will be especially severe in densely populated cities and agricultural areas of South Asia and eastern China.Higher average temperatures reduce productivity of outdoor workers, and can also adversely affect maternal and child health.Successful heat action plans have been implemented in India, China and other countries. These need to be regularly reviewed as the onset, severity and duration of dangerously high temperatures change.Improved access to air conditioning is part of heat adaptation in many settings but is not feasible at the scale required to protect entire populations.DISEASE AND MALNUTRITIONVector-borne diseases, particularly mosquito-borne diseases, are a major public health problem in Asia, with malaria, dengue fever and chikungunya at endemic levels in the region.Climate change affects ambient temperatures and precipitation levels in ways that are generally beneficial for mosquito populations, increasing their geographic range and extending transmission seasons for these diseases.Recurrent outbreaks pose significant health threats, as evidenced during the early years of the 21st century.Warming temperatures, changing precipitation patterns and greater frequency of droughts and desertification have compromised food security in parts of Asia.Although climate change has increased crop yields in some high mountain regions, yields in lower-latitude regions have been negatively affected.Increased atmospheric carbon dioxide levels can lower the nutritional quality of crops. More frequent extreme weather events will also disrupt supply chains.With cereal prices projected to increase by 2050, the region’s most vulnerable people face food insecurity and hunger. Southeast Asia has already seen an increase of stunting in children.LINK WITH MENTAL HEALTHAlthough frequently overlooked, mental health problems are common throughout Asia, and are amplified by stresses associated with climate change. Acute, climate-related events can lead to mental distress, which may manifest as anxiety, mood disorders and social withdrawal, and can increase suicide risk.Prolonged and repeated droughts have been associated with depression and self-harm, especially among farmers.Long-term climate change also undermines the sense of place that is foundational to mental well-being in all populations, and especially in indigenous cultures; sea-level rise in the Pacific is a well-documented example.Shortening return periods between extreme weather events threatens the capacity of societies and individuals to recover confidence and promote mental healing.The compounding and increasingly negative effects of repeated COVID-19 lockdowns on morale and well-being illustrate this phenomenon.MODELLING A USEFUL GUIDEModelling suggests the most effective way of reducing the number of people vulnerable to climate change is through sustainable development that actively reduces socioeconomic inequality and poverty in Africa and Asia.One analysis looked at the interplay between socioeconomic development and 14 climate change risks to water, energy and land sectors, including exposure to extreme heat events.Global exposure to multisector risk was projected to double, with a 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius warming and then double again with a 3 degrees Celsius increase.With a 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius increase, the total population exposed to multisectoral risks increased by 69 to 113 per cent and the level of exposure increased by 60 to 258 per cent. Most of the risk was in Asia and Africa.The magnitude and pattern of future injuries, illnesses and deaths associated with climate change depend on the level of warming and on the socioeconomic development pathway followed.Pathways with higher population growth, high levels of consumption, limited investments in technology development and a low ability to adapt will magnify the health risks of climate change.A comprehensive approach is needed to manage these risks, requiring scientists, policymakers, funding-source managers and the public to work together to address the impacts of climate change and build resilient communities.This requires well-coordinated, multisectoral actions with the active participation of individuals and communities at risk.Innovative policies based on sound science, political will and sustainable financing, supported and coordinated by international organisations like the World Health Organization, are essential for preparing for and managing the health risks of a warming planet.Listen to an expert break down the effects of rising temperatures and sea levels:Kristie L Ebi is Professor of Global Health and Environmental and Occupational Health Sciences at the Department of Global Health, the University of Washington.

242,Commentary: Is behaving with social responsibility during a pandemic so hard?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/wearing-masks-keeping-safe-distances-covid-19-rules-13668496,01 Dec 2020 06:04AM,"There is a way to shift your mindset if you find yourself struggling to wear masks or keep safe distances, says SUSS’ Brandon KohSINGAPORE: As the coronavirus rages on worldwide, many countries have re-entered lockdowns while others battle third or fourth waves of outbreaks.In contrast, while there have been a few new local community cases in the last few days, most in Singapore are anticipating the country shift into its third phase of reopening, having dramatically reduced the total number of infections, with the majority coming from imported cases.We have been in Phase 2 for five months, with most people largely adhering to COVID-19 rules, save for a few bad eggs.Can Singapore maintain the current benign state? The recent rise in breach of safety measures by both individuals and establishments may be a cause for concern.NON-COMPLIANCE TO SAFETY MEASURESReaders from Singapore probably struggle to understand why people in other countries refuse to wear masks and social distance amid climbing infection and death rates. In fact, some people even actively resist safety measures their governments impose.When it comes to health-related behaviours, at least three factors appear critical: Norms, attitudes, and perceived behavioural control.Norms refer to how strictly a culture expects a certain behaviour. Singapore is a textbook definition of a tight culture, where societal norms are strict and strongly enforced by law or through informal means such as public shaming.In contrast, loose cultures often value individual autonomy. This in part explains why many in Western countries protest against mandating mask-wearing, arguing it is an infringement of individual rights.Attitudes, which include our subjective beliefs and evaluation of a behaviour, have a part to play. During a crisis, the media, Internet, and people around us play a big role in shaping our views.Unfortunately, in the US for example, the messages from health professionals, political leaders, and social media has been confusing. Misinformation is prevalent. This has caused some people to think that masks are ineffective or that COVID-19 is no more serious than the common flu.The problem of mixed messages is often exacerbated by confirmation bias – a psychological effect where people tend to selectively overweigh and remember information that confirms their prior beliefs. When faced with varying opinions, people may unfortunately view safety regulations to be a matter of choice, and act according to their own biases.MAKING SELF-CONTROL A HABITBut if norms and attitudes don’t explain why there have been recent violations of rules in Singapore, what does?Perhaps it’s the third factor of perceived behavioural control concerns whether people feel confident in successfully executing behaviours.For example, even when tasks such as remaining isolated during the circuit breaker and mask-wearing appear straightforward, they become challenging with the passage of time.One common notion is that people have become “fatigued” by the prolonged adherence to the safety measures. In psychology, this is sometimes referred as “ego depletion”, when people exercise self-control to the point of exhaustion.Self-control, which is act of enduring short-term displeasure to reap valued long-term goals, can be an emotionally labouring challenge in many circumstances, for example if people are trying to diet.Because the human brain actively seeks short-term pleasures, such impulses must be suppressed if we are to succeed at self-control. When this mental willpower becomes depleted, people relent to their impulses.A good habit, however, is very different. Habits are behaviours performed automatically in response to certain cues, often without conscious thought and do not drain our willpower.Behaviours such as mask-wearing and social distancing probably started out as a type of self-control behaviour, which can be draining over time.For example, do you find the discomfort of wearing a mask constantly distracting your thoughts? Do you actively resist the urge of pulling your mask down for a momentary relief? If so, you may be mobilising your willpower, which can be mentally depleting.In contrast, for those who practice COVID-19 safety measures out of habit without thinking will probably find it requiring less effort and are not susceptible to the same fatigue.Indeed, these individuals may even feel uncomfortable without their masks or guilty for flouting any rules.As Singapore considers relaxing more rules in the shift to Phase 3, the key question may be how we can facilitate the formation of these good habits.THE VALUE OF SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY IN SAFETY MEASURESWith any motivated behaviour, doing something that aligns with our beliefs is generally more pleasant and intrinsically rewarding. For example, when people volunteer for a cause they believe in, the positive emotions experienced from acting in line with one’s values keeps them going.Similarly, keeping to the safety measures will be easier when we see its value.Singapore has done well in the fight against COVID-19 because of the effective measures put in place.Other countries are struggling to contain the virus and have had to get back to punitive lockdowns, but here, we have been able to go about our lives – going to work, school and to go out to eat and exercise, with some small tweaks.Perhaps because of our low number of cases, some have disregarded the need for safety measures. But being vigilant is still critical if we want to keep our freedoms now. The asymptomatic cases and transmissions in the community that have remained undetected all this time are showing up in community surveillance testing.This will become important as we open up to travellers and relax the rules further in Phase 3.Masks also have added benefits of preventing other contagious diseases, such as the common flu. Falling sick during such a time is worrying and impinges on our psychological well-being.Finally, our engagement in the safety measures also symbolise our values of social responsibility. When we actively participate in the safety measures, keep in mind we are not only protecting ourselves but also gesture our commitment to care about one another as a society.HOW TO GET BUSINESSES TO ACT RESPONSIBLYSeeing the value of social responsibility will also motivate businesses to stay safe.A growing concern is that more establishments are breaching safety measures, some of which are repeat offenders. Recently, several food and beverage outlets (F&B) were caught serving alcohol beyond 10:30pm and taking reservations of more than five patrons.These cases are glaring because unlike individuals who may commit spur-of-the-moment errors, organisations are expected to be more systematic, so as to keep their businesses going in a trying time.Understandably, the COVID-19 measures have weighed heavily on the bottom lines of many establishments, particularly F&B outlets. Unfortunately, this frames the safety measures as a cost, and a business’ natural reaction to cost is to try to circumvent it.Seeing the safety measures in a positive frame can lead to innovative outcomes.Well-established organisations have long recognised the value of practicing corporate social responsibility (CSR). CSR not only holds an organisation socially accountable; it builds a brand.If one looks past the mandatory nature of the COVID-19 measures, they in fact bear all the characteristics of CSR. It symbolises the willingness to put profit-making aside for the well-being of the community.Organisations that realise this can convert the difficult situation into an opportunity, by innovating ways to make the safety measures easier, safer, or more pleasant for their customers.For example, supermarkets in Finland have implemented a new hands-free door handle for refrigerator doors. Not only does it reduce risk of transmissions, it turned out to be more ergonomic, especially for people with physical difficulties.To spur adherence and innovation, perhaps instead of only policing non-compliance, recognition can be awarded to businesses who have high standards of adherence and innovation during this time.The improving COVID-19 situation in Singapore may have led some to question and disregard the safety measures. But resisting the safety measures is not only painful but illegal.Instead, we can focus on collectively valuing and exercising our social responsibility to form good habits. This not only keeps us and our families safe but also protects many of the freedoms we take for granted.Dr Brandon Koh is an Industrial-Organisational Psychologist and Lecturer at the Singapore University of Social Sciences.Listen to Malaysians share how they have been coping fighting a new wave of COVID-19 infections in Heart of the Matter podcast:Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

243,The Big Read: Enough is enough. Just what does it take to break mental health stigma at the workplace?,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/the-big-read-enough-is-enough-just-what-does-it-take-to-break-13659308,30 Nov 2020 06:26AM,"Tackling the stigma surrounding mental illness and encouraging employees to speak up about their problems may be the biggest workplace challenge, based on interviews with workers, employers, human resource experts, general practitioners and psychologists. SINGAPORE: For more than two years since she started working at a bank, Mavis (not her real name) has been keeping a secret from her bosses: She suffers from depression and anxiety.While her company has hired counsellors, Mavis has never used their services, and seeks external counselling instead. She has kept her mental health condition under wraps due to the “toxic” work culture, said the 25-year-old associate, and she fears that her chances of a promotion will be stymied if her condition is out in the open.“Some have told me that (the company counsellors) will report back to the bank, though my boss said that this doesn’t happen - but you never know,” she said. ""In my industry, you are expected to work very hard and expected to have endurance … Those  who can work a lot and handle a lot are seen as better.""A former trainee at a law firm, who wanted to be known only as Chloe, had a similar experience. The 26-year-old, who began working at the firm early last year, developed anxiety attacks throughout her six-month traineeship. Things worsened to the point where she broke down during several lunch breaks, after feeling like she was manipulating her clients by withholding information. “I felt like I had to lie to my client ... and I was under so much anxiety. During lunch, I would go down to cry, because I felt like I just couldn’t cope.” Like Mavis, Chloe did not tell her bosses about her deteriorating mental health, but put on a poker face when she returned to the office after each breakdown.“I have friends in the legal practice, and the advice given to me was that I could not speak to anybody about (my emotional issues). The concern was really stigma, so I had to go for private counselling,” said Chloe, who is no longer with the firm but is furthering her studies.  This is what some employees here have to face. But what about the employers? What do they have to say?Those interviewed stressed that they are open to listening to their staff about whatever problems they may have, including mental health issues. However, they admit that a line has to be drawn, especially when it comes to business-critical roles. If the employees continue to fall short of expectations or are unable to work for long periods of time due to their mental health conditions, the employers said they may have no choice but to refer the workers to other roles within the company or fire them. Still, having to support staff who have reached their breaking point may not be the biggest challenge when it comes to mental health issues at the workplace in Singapore. It is actually tackling the stigma surrounding mental illness and encouraging employees to speak up about their problems, based on interviews with workers, employers, human resource (HR) experts, general practitioners (GPs) and psychologists. While calls to improve mental health awareness in the workplace are not new, the issue has taken on an added urgency this year with COVID-19 creating new stresses and pressures for everyone. And with more people forced to work from home as the pandemic rages on, the boundaries between work and rest have been blurred, taking a further toll on the mental health of many employees. But even before the coronavirus struck, the mental health situation here has been a growing concern: The Singapore Mental Health Study conducted between 2016 and 2018 found that one in seven people experienced a mental disorder in their lifetime, compared with one in eight people in 2010’s Mental Health Study.Just earlier this week, TODAY reported that the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) is investigating allegations made against a firm here where a former employee has committed suicide allegedly due to harsh working conditions.Against this backdrop, a tripartite advisory on mental well-being at workplaces was issued last week by the MOM, Singapore National Employers Federation and National Trades Union Congress. In introducing the advisory, Manpower Minister Josephine Teo said “protecting workers’ mental health has become even more important” during the pandemic. Among its guidelines are:While these guidelines are a step in the right direction, more can be done in ensuring that these initiatives are not treated as a paper exercise, and that cultural changes are enacted at the workplace, HR experts and mental wellness advocates said. Ms Anthea Ong, founder of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, a community of leaders from various companies and national agencies which champion workplace mental well-being, said that the guidelines are “solid building blocks” but it will be up to the bosses to take the lead in eradicating stigma at the workplace.“If the leaders do not catch on and only leave it to the HR department to go and fulfil the requirements on the advisory, then I don’t think we have actually made a dent,” she said.“Until it is actually embraced, acknowledged and acted upon by the leaders ... only then do we start seeing these programmes, policies and practices making an impact on the ground,” said Ms Ong, a former Nominated Member of Parliament. CHALLENGES FACED BY EMPLOYERSWhile larger firms may have more resources to implement the tripartite advisory guidelines, this is not always the case for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), many of which are feeling the crunch from the current economic slowdown. Mr Adam Esoof Piperdy, chief executive officer and founder of events company Unearthed Productions, said that SMEs like his are in a “very precarious position” during the pandemic and it may not be practical for them to tick every box in the advisory. “Such measures would (require) quite a high investment. I think what we would rather do is to have more informal practices of checking in with each other,” he added. Even for larger firms with comprehensive mental health initiatives, the issue of employees not speaking up about their conditions remains a problem - one that has been exacerbated by remote working. Ms Anuradha Purbey, people director at insurer Aviva Europe and Asia, said that a consequence of remote working is that managers are not able to meet their employees on a frequent basis.“Hence, it becomes harder to ‘visibly’ identify any mental health and other challenges that employees are facing,” she said.  “So, we have to rely, primarily, on the online catch-ups and frequent surveys.” And like what Mavis and Chloe faced, Ms Anuradha acknowledged that the stigma surrounding mental illness is what prevents many firms from detecting mental health issues in the first place, since employees are reluctant to reach out for help. “While mental health awareness has been gaining traction in Singapore, for many it is still considered taboo to acknowledge their struggles,” she said. “At Aviva, we want to make talking about mental health as normal as talking about physical health and continue to do what we can do to remove this stigma.""While there are firms which are willing to cut some slack for employees with mental health issues, they also said that there is a limit to how much employers can do. Mr Piperdy, for example, said that he will try his best to get any colleagues struggling with mental health to seek professional help or give them days off if they are unable to cope. However, since the event industry is a client-facing role, he cannot continually make concessions at the risk of letting his clients down.“At the end of the day, the job scope doesn’t change … if they’re not able to manage the workload that comes in, which is something we actively do, then I think we will help this person to transition to another job, maybe we will look for opportunities for this person.""We have successfully redesignated some of them, to find suitable jobs in more fixed, permanent (roles) such as working in a venue instead of working for an events company,” Mr Piperdy added. “But we are actively trying to avoid that by having early intervention, coaching and mentorships.”TAKING THE FIRST STEP: BOSSES SAYING ‘IT’S OK TO NOT BE OK’ In recent years, some companies in Singapore have come up with a slew of measures to promote mental wellness at the workplace, many of which are in line with the tripartite advisory’s guidelines.For instance, national media network Mediacorp introduced earlier this month an emotional and mental well-being support initiative that consists of emotional and mental wellness training and a one-on-one confidential counselling service, among other things. Mediacorp Chief Human Resources Officer Yvonne Ee said: “As part of our corporate wellness initiative, we continue to support our people with resources they need to adapt positively and perform well, during these unprecedented times.” She added: “Through (the initiative), we look to create an environment where staff can build strong mental and emotional resilience, and feel secure as they continue to contribute to the organisation.” Biopharmaceutical firm AstraZeneca Singapore said that among its mental wellness initiatives is an internal online platform for employees to discuss mental health issues and queries within chat groups. It also has in place the employee assistance programmes which provide confidential counselling. President of AstraZeneca Singapore Vinod Narayanan said: “While we continue to build our open and inclusive culture at the workplace, we also recognise the impact COVID-19 has on mental well-being of our employees and will continue to build that space where it is safe for employees to speak openly about mental health issues.”In response to queries, business consultancy PwC Singapore said it provides several avenues to support mental health including an employee assistance programme, workshops, support groups and online resources to drive awareness of the subject. Online marketplace Carousell said it has a dedicated wellness programme where employees “come together as a team to focus on our well-being”, at least once a month. It is also looking into establishing an employee assistance programme to offer support to employees struggling with personal and work-related problems. While companies ramping up their mental wellness initiatives is a positive sign, HR experts said that this has to be coupled with bosses who lead by example in creating a more open company culture. Earlier this week, Bloomberg reported that Economic Development Board managing director Chng Kai Fong had opened up about his mental health struggle during the pandemic at a technology conference on Nov 22. Mr Chng - who was formerly the principal private secretary to Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong -  said that family matters that occurred in April had affected his emotional and mental state, leading to feelings of “heat and anger” and depressive bouts.According to Bloomberg, Mr Chng said he wanted to openly share his experience with others who might be facing mounting pressure to lead during times of fear and uncertainty.“We can do a lot more as leaders to acknowledge that (it’s OK not to be OK) and to share a little bit more about ourselves,” Mr Chng said. “And that builds trust.” Otis Asia Pacific president Stephane de Montlivault, who is a member of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, said that being more open about his struggles with mental health meant that employees of the elevator company were more willing to share their problems as well. “I shared my personal situation as I happened to also have a number of difficulties (amid COVID-19). I lost a colleague and very close friend who died in a car accident … and shortly after that my father-in-law had a heart attack and was in the ICU,” he isaid. “I was facing a lot of stress, and had sleeping issues, anxieties.""When he shared these issues at a forum with his employees, many of them started opening up, and subsequently many were willing to go to their bosses directly with their problems, he said.“(We) made it very open and clear that it is not only okay, but normal and encouraged to talk about our difficulties and to work on them as a team,” said Mr de Montlivault. “This actually caused us to take some actions in some cases when we found that people had difficulties when we were constrained by not being able to come to the office.”Agreeing, Ms Ong said that bosses who are willing to reveal their vulnerable side send a clear signal to employees that having mental health issues does not mean that they will not be able to succeed at work.“That’s a very big part of stigma in the workplace, (which) stems a lot from concerns with career progression and advancement,” she said. “When leaders are the ones sharing, then it says that it does not affect your promotion options, your career progress, and your potential.” Veteran HR practitioner Carmen Wee said that the employer-employee relationship should be one that is centred on the well-being of the employee. “If employees are fearful in asking for help, there’s something wrong with the culture or leadership approach,” she said. “If you work in a company where the company respects you, wants to look after their well-being, which employee will not flourish and perform?”There would not be such a fear if employees “feel supported and don’t feel like their psychological safety is threatened”, she added. Ms Wee noted that for cases where an employee’s mental health condition becomes too severe to continue working at a company, firing the employee should be a last resort. Other alternatives such as no-pay leave, counselling and job coaching should first be considered. “If at the end of the day, the person still can’t cope and the job is still contributing to the stress, there needs to be a heart-to-heart talk, and if everything cannot be worked out, they might have to part ways,” she said.Even when making such a decision, the company must also be sensitive given the pandemic situation, where it may be difficult to find employment. Employers can introduce the affected workers to new jobs that may be more suitable, or link them up with job courses. “Each person’s circumstance is different, so the company needs to examine and come up with an individualised plan,” Ms Wee said.PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH SHOULD BE SEEN ON PAR Although awareness of mental health here has grown, there remains a common misconception that physical health takes precedence over it, when both in fact should be viewed on par, said psychologists and GPs whom TODAY spoke to.Dr Geraldine Tan, director and principal psychologist of The Therapy Room, said that whether it is a physical or mental illness, patients can be “struck down” by it for a prolonged period. “When they have their diagnosis of anxiety and depression, they cannot go into the office, and someone else has to take over, so it is as bad as having surgery, or breaking your leg,” she said.  Agreeing, GPs said that they would give medical certificates (MCs) regardless of whether it is a physical or mental ailment. Dr Sunil Kumar Joseph, a GP who runs Tayka Medical Family Clinic in Jurong, reiterated: “Mental illness is treated the same as physical illness from a medical point of view, so there is no issue.” The World Health Organization (WHO) defines health as “a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity”.According to the American Psychological Association (APA), physical and mental health are interconnected and cannot be viewed in isolation. “Stress can take a toll on our physical health, while physical challenges can also bring new stress into our lives,” the APA said on its website.Regardless of the literature, Dr Sunil said the main obstacle is the stigma that prevents patients from visiting him in the first place. And one policy that propagates the stigma is company-paid insurance, he noted. “Indirectly, (the company) is able to access all your medical history because you signed a waiver to your rights of confidentiality,” he said. “So very few people who are using corporate insurance are willing to disclose mental health conditions, so that’s one stumbling block.” He added that a lot of insurers do not pay for mental health treatment. One guideline in the tripartite advisory says that companies with flexible employee benefits, such as medical benefits, should consider extending the scope of coverage to include mental well-being programmes, mental health consultations and treatments.Companies such as Aviva Singapore, consultancy firm PwC Singapore and investment holding company Jardine Cycle & Carriage have health coverage plans that include mental health treatment. Otis’ Mr de Montlivault said that as per the guidelines, his firm will be looking to include mental health as part of its health coverage as well. In the meantime, Otis employees can tap internal company self-funded insurance which has been expanded to include coverage for psychological support services.If employees are hesitant to get MCs for their mental ailments, some companies have a policy where a limited number of sick days can be taken without having to produce an MC.Some employers also provide medical leave based on trust, rather than having to always provide MCs.Mr Jeffery Tan, chief executive officer of charity organisation Jardines Mindset Singapore and group general counsel of Jardine Cycle & Carriage, said that if employees report that they have mental health issues without an MC, it will come down to “managerial discretion and empowerment by the supervisors”. “Even for physical ailments, we don’t always need to be able to produce an MC before we can go off; we can see someone is struggling with an ailment, they can take an afternoon off,” said Mr Tan, who is also part of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup. “This is coupled with an element of trust in a safe environment, as opposed to starting off by saying ‘if I have this, are people going to game the system and be less than truthful?’,” he added. “I think those are all the wrong dynamics.” Agreeing, Ms Audrey Ng, global head of HR for mining firm Anglo-American Marketing, said that trust is “central to the relationship with our teams”. “We know that the overwhelming majority of them are highly dedicated and committed to achieving great results for the entire organisation, so if we see that someone needs a break, we try to ensure that he or she feels empowered to take some time off with line manager approval,” said Ms Ng. Still, some employees said taking medical leave as and when they need to is not feasible, as they are on project-based jobs. A junior art director at an advertising firm, who wanted to be known only as Isabel, said that the number of projects she had to do during the circuit breaker period increased by about 40 per cent as more clients were looking to advertise online. The longer working hours and higher workload resulted in the 24-year-old feeling stressed and anxious to the point where she would vomit regularly and lose her memory while at work. She could not take a break as she had to meet the clients’ deadlines, and no one could take over her projects as they would not be familiar with the clients’ requests. “In advertising, the mindset is always clients first, and that’s very detrimental on the employees,” she said. WHAT EMPLOYEES CAN DO THEMSELVES Dr Douglas Kong, a mental health expert and performance coach, said that those who are stressed at work may not be able to identify the signs until it is too late. “Those who are under stress, or have some issues in their life that they aren’t handling well … they can’t see it, and they do their best to cope and handle it,” he said.  He has seen several cases of employees who would not admit to their stress and anxiety, only for their mental health conditions to worsen and affect their productivity. “So people think that mental illness is terrible, that you must not have it … But the point is that if you can deal with it earlier... it can allow the person to overcome it and get on with their lives and work,” said Dr Kong. Mr Adrian Choo, founder of career strategy consulting firm Career Agility International, said that employees must know “when to back off” when caught in a stressful situation. “Employees themselves need to know when they are being stretched and are hitting the limit… (They) need to ask themselves what is more important, your health or your career?” he said. “Because if you are burnt out, you are of no use to your company anyway.” For Mavis, the bank employee who is hiding her mental health condition from her bosses, only a significant cultural shift in her company will prompt her to open up about her struggles to her superiors. “If I see a culture where you’re talking openly about mental health, and it’s very clear that if I say something about it, not just my bosses but my colleagues will not think differently of me,” she said. “(Instead) it will be something that can actually help me, with people being more caring and it is not something that will be looked down on.”She added: “But right now, it is a far cry from that.”For more news like this, visit todayonline.comCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

244,Commentary: Moving to Singapore in the middle of a pandemic has changed the meaning of home,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-coronavirus-move-home-singapore-tips-belonging-house-13600598,29 Nov 2020 06:08AM,"The move was disorientating but has prompted deeper reflections on what home and belonging mean, says Annisa Natalegawa.SINGAPORE: A few months ago, my husband and I decided to make 2020 even more memorable and moved from Jakarta to Singapore.Moving home, and its accompanying physical and emotional disruption, is often cited as a leading cause of stress. A cross-border mid-pandemic move with a four-year old was a Highly Stressful Life Event - so stressful it warrants capitalised first letters.But the move made sense for a number of reasons: A new regional role for my husband, the opportunity for me to work from my company's Singapore headquarters, and the chance for my son to grow up in one of the safest cities in the world.Nothing about the experience could have been classified as “normal”. Our applications were delayed for months due to the circuit breaker – once Singapore entered Phase 1 of its reopening, we took a chance and reapplied.We were fortunate enough to receive approval a month later, but this was at a stage when Singapore was just starting to reopen its borders. There was a lot of confusion about paperwork and process.In the end, we were left with a short three-week window to prepare. Miss that window for approved entry and we would risk going through the whole process again.PREPARING LIKE A MOTHER GOING TO THE TRENCHESWe chose a condo and school on the basis of Zoom calls and Google Map consultations – it was disconcerting to transfer deposits for places we had only seen on a screen.We fretted endlessly when the movers came to pack - pleading that they keep their masks on despite the heat, spraying sanitiser on every surface. I prepared like a mother going into the trenches, for a two-week Stay Home Notice that took family bonding to a new extreme.But in retrospect, those were mere logistical hassles that could be overcome. Indeed, the true challenge of moving during COVID-19 was mental and emotional: It was the element of leaving Jakarta without knowing when we would be able to return.What in the past would have been a straightforward move to a neighbouring country suddenly felt like a huge life-altering relocation.It was sad saying goodbye to a city in lockdown, a ghost of the vibrant, tangled metropolis that it should be. When we left, several places that had been key parts of our daily life – our grocery stores, gyms, favorite restaurants, regular street food vendors – had shut down or remained closed.My husband's office was still restricted, and he wasn't allowed access to the building to pack up his belongings. The security guard did it for him.Meanwhile, I emptied my desk alone, my colleagues still working from home – not the way I ever imagined leaving an office I'd worked at for many years.CONCEPTS OF HOME UPENDEDMy experience was not a unique one, but one millions of people all over the world have gone through over the past few months.For those of us privileged enough to be accustomed to the freedom of travel - the expats, the global travelers, the diaspora -  the concepts of seamless travel, home and belonging have been upended.When borders began to close earlier this year, those of us who had the privilege of choice were forced to assess the pros and cons of remaining in a foreign country versus returning to countries of nationality.Fear of being locked out of one's own country and the potential loss of rights, protections and freedoms, led to a wave of repatriation that few could have anticipated.In most cases, these moves are meant to be temporary but have turned out to be much more.I have watched friends return to the countries that issued their passports with newfound appreciation. I have seen the self-professed nomads strive to accept their clipped wings.I know those who have opted to leave countries with better healthcare systems to be locked down with loved ones, and I know those who have chosen to stay overseas, recognising that after several years abroad, friends have become family.A STRANGE TYPE OF HOMESICKNESSThere are those who have lost their jobs and with it their visas. There are those for whom returning home is not an option.And there are those like me, trying to build a sense of belonging in a time of uncertainty, oscillating between feeling thankful that you were even allowed into another country in the first place, and the feeling of homesickness for a life that really only existed pre-coronavirus.For those of us with a life previously defined by multiple geographies, it has been an ongoing process. Where do we fit in a world where physical location means so much, yet at the same time, due to incessant Zoom calls, has become irrelevant?As we approach the end of the year and a looming holiday season devoid of festive pilgrimages home, I am expecting feelings of displacement to deepen, along with sentiments of nostalgia, loneliness and longing to see the turn of a new year, and hopefully a better year, in a place we will soon call home.We cannot let such feelings shake our sense of self. Because the truth is that no one has felt “at home” since the pandemic began.And while borders are gradually reopening, it will be impossible to return home to the lives we left behind, when traveling back to Jakarta on a whim, a fancy or a family emergency will not be seamless.Ultimately, I am also learning that a sense of belonging can be derived from a physical place, but it can also be derived from a person, or a shared experience.While the simplest definition of home is the place where you live, perhaps this pandemic demands oversimplification.Perhaps now more than ever, home must simply be the people we love, and the life we lead, wherever that may be.Annisa Natalegawa is Partner and Managing Director of Asia Group Advisors, a government relations and public affairs consulting firm headquartered in Singapore.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

245,Woman who sued PUB for S$5 million after falling into manhole accepts settlement offer,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/woman-who-sued-pub-for-s-5-million-after-falling-into-manhole-13646766,27 Nov 2020 06:11AM,"SINGAPORE: A woman who sued PUB for S$5 million after falling into an open manhole and suffering multiple physical and psychological injuries has accepted a confidential settlement offer and will withdraw her claim.This came on the fourth day of the trial, with Ms Chan Hui Peng's lawyers accepting the offer late Thursday night (Nov 26).Ms Chan's lawyer told CNA that his client felt the offer ""was fair"", and that the trial was ""really taking a toll on her mental health"".Ms Chan had made the S$5 million claim, adjusted from an original figure of S$20 million, for an incident five years ago in Kovan.She had fallen about 2m into an open manhole in a pedestrian path at the intersection of Simon Road and Upper Serangoon Road on a sunny morning on Dec 1, 2015.She fractured her ankle, sustained multiple bruises and suffers lingering ailments such as an inability to run, an altered gait, and pain in her lower back. She also cited psychiatric injuries such as anxiety, panic attacks, post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder and schizophrenia.She sued for damages including for pain and suffering for her injuries, cost of future medical expenses, loss of opportunity to have a child, prospective costs of a caregiver and loss of earning capacity and future earnings.Her acceptance of the confidential offer, which was made by PUB's lawyers Mr Anparasan Kamachi, Ms Grace Tan Hui Ying and Mr Shanen Nanoo Siva Das from WhiteFern LLC, came after Mr Anparasan accused her of engineering her claim by orchestrating evidence of a mental illness and other complaints.This was followed by Ms Tan taking her through extensive documented psychiatry notes from Tan Tock Seng Hospital from April 2016 to December 2016.Ms Tan argued that there was no diagnosis of PTSD and that Ms Chan had tried to influence medical reports by asking the psychologist to amend her reports. The latter refused.Hours after cross-examination ended, Ms Chan's lawyers, Mr Letchamanan Devadason and Mr Ivan Lee Tze Chuen from Legal Standard accepted the offer to settle on behalf of their client.The terms of the offer to settle, which was made on Nov 10, are confidential, Ms Tan told CNA.Parties appeared before the trial judge briefly on Friday morning to address the issue of costs. After this, Ms Chan is set to file a notice of discontinuance against PUB, withdrawing her claim.They agreed to take the discussion on costs offline, and to return before the judge the following week to have a hearing on costs and any consequential orders.Mr Anparasan said he would make ""strong submissions"" on Ms Chan's conduct and how she ""thwarted mediation"". He will also touch on ""the whole issue of her schizophrenia"".""It's to send a strong signal out there for deterrence, having spent four days in court, what transpired,"" he said.He added that there was a possibility the costs will ""eat into the damages"".Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

247,Commentary: How COVID-19 has forced employers to be more human – and rewards them in the process,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/coronavirus-covid-19-business-hr-employer-work-from-home-burnout-13621632,24 Nov 2020 06:14AM,"The COVID-19 pandemic will force a rethinking on how firms approach to human capital, says Crystal Lim-Lange.SINGAPORE: In the 1970s, renowned economics professor Milton Friedman wrote a famous essay explaining that the only purpose of a business was to generate profit, and the sole focus of the CEO, to rally the human capital of the company around that cause.Since then, corporates around the world have adopted profit as their religion, operating with their eyes firmly fixed to the bottom line and a firm foot on the gas pedal.Then COVID-19 entered, upending this simple equation of big profits equals a good business.THE COMING CHANGE TO HOW FIRMS MANAGE HUMAN CAPITALSome companies, like Amazon, Zoom and many others profited massively by virtue of being in the right place at the right time.Yet, many other well-run and well-loved companies, like Singapore Airlines, found themselves bleeding further into the red every day through no fault of their own.The sad sight of SIA jumbo jets, grounded next to a quiet airport, coupled with news of the company’s fighting spirit demonstrated in its COVID-19 response, from reviewing fleet sizes, to having flight attendants joining frontline efforts and offering novel dining experiences, show a company’s value cannot be purely assessed on profits.What makes a company valuable is also its purpose, contribution and humanity – and what it’s doing to help other businesses, communities and people get through this generation-defining crisis.This global trend towards purpose over profits was already gaining momentum even before COVID-19 hit.In August 2019, a letter issued by the Business Roundtable, signed by 181 leading US companies from Apple to Walmart, essentially rebuked Friedman’s worldview by declaring that they would commit to deliver value not just to shareholders, but also to their four other stakeholder groups - employees, customers, suppliers and communities.“One of the definitive results of the pandemic around the world is that we can see the old Milton Friedman model crumbling. No one believes that anymore. The pandemic hasn’t changed everything, but we are starting to see much more concern for people,” Bob Aubrey, founder of the ASEAN Human Development Organisation told me.The pandemic will more deeply shape our approach to human capital, making employees care more about inclusivity, investing in mental well-being, empowering our workforce with more flexibility in how they work, and ultimately shifting the focus of businesses to purpose, not just profits.Even for pragmatic Asia, companies will be forced to look at human factors such as diversity, inclusion and stress indicators, and move beyond paying lip service to these issues for a few powerful reasons.A CULTURE THAT CONTRIBUTES TO PROFITSFirst, there is a consensus that a caring, inclusive culture is directly linked to more profits.For instance, Deloitte’s research found organisations with inclusive cultures twice as likely to meet or exceed financial targets and eight times more likely to achieve better business outcomes.Companies with high levels of purpose outperform the market by 5 to 7 per cent annually, growing faster with higher profitability, empirical research on 1.5 million employees from Professors Claudine Gartenberg and George Serafeim from the University of Pennsylvania Wharton Business School and Harvard Business School respectively shows.Futhermore, McKinsey’s findings from more than 1,000 companies in 15 countries suggests a growing performance gap between inclusive companies that “get it” and companies yet to embrace diversity.Companies in the bottom quartile for gender and ethnic diversity were 27 per cent more likely to underperform on profitability.COVID-19 will do more to separate the goat from the sheep.I have seen this in Singapore, where companies who haven’t prioritised inclusion are now in a vicious cycle of low employee morale, high turnover and burnout, which fuels even more underperformance and less management focus on inclusion as they are too busy fighting fires.On the other hand, I have also seen a wave of companies developing a virtuous cycle of investing in a caring, purposeful culture, doubling efforts to amplify employee support, psychological safety and inclusive leadership training.A WORKFORCE THAT CARES ABOUT THEIR COMPANY’S VALUESSecond, a younger workforce demands a more flexible, inclusive and values-driven approach to work, and employers who want to attract and retain talent, a scarce resource that remains in high demand, will have to listen.

Millennials are now the biggest segment of the workforce, Gen Zs are starting to enter the labour market.Research suggests they are much more purpose driven than other generations. They want to join companies that align with their values, with LinkedIn’s research finding almost nine out of 10 Millennials would take a pay cut to work at a company with the same values as their own. This figure was just 9 per cent of baby boomers.This makes sense as the Millennials and Gen Zs will probably be spending more time at work than any other preceding generation, and want to contribute to something they care about.CONSUMERS WHO CONSUME RESPONSIBLYThird, consumers and clients are choosing to spend their dollars with corporates who signal a high level of environmental social governance (ESG), including employee treatment, and diversity and inclusion metrics.  Morgan Stanley's Institute for Sustainable Investing’s survey concluded that 86 per cent of millennials are interested in sustainable investing and are twice as likely as the overall investor population to invest in companies targeting social or environmental goals.Bank of America Merrill Lynch predicted that millennials could pour between US$15 trillion and US$20 trillion into Environmental, Social and Corporate Governance (ESG) investments in the US in the next two decades.The stakes are high for companies who do not keep up with the current consciousness. In 2020, we have also seen clear the “cancel culture” financial repercussions for companies deemed to have been hypocritical in their values or mistreated their employees.Just think about how Starbucks’ memo asking employees not to wear Black Lives Matter T-shirts led to instant global backlash from consumers.The Instagram movement #PullUpOrShutUp has convinced more than 200 companies, including Estée Lauder companies and Levi’s, to reveal how many Black employees they have and commit to improve.And fashion advocacy non-profit Remake has announced an estimated US$22 billion owed to garment workers that have gone unpaid since March owing to the coronavirus from 21 brands, including H&M and Nike, after calling on brands to #PayUp via an Instagram campaign.Consumers and employees today have never been more vocal. They also possess the platform, knowledge and desire to call businesses out for their failings.According to Edelman’s study, 64 per cent of consumers around the world will buy or boycott a brand solely because of its position on a social or political issue.MENTAL HEALTH HAS BECOME A KEY CORPORATE CHALLENGEFourth, we are experiencing a major rise in firms offering mental health support for their staff as companies grapple with the realisation that burnout and stress has serious impact on business.Employee Assistance Programme providers are reporting an uptick in companies signing up for counselling. Most of my corporate clients have significantly increased their mental health and resilience training budget this year.This is an encouraging and much needed trend as Singapore is regularly voted as having one of the world’s most stressed and sleep-deprived workforces, even before COVID-19.Over 1 in 3 employees report often feeling tired or having little energy and over 2 in 5 employees feeling burned out and exhausted from work, according to a SHRM study.While employers are upping support, we also need leaders themselves to normalise talking about mental health and demonstrating by example, taking concrete actions to alleviate stress by reducing work hours or having policies on not working on weekends or minimising late-night conference calls.DEEPER RELATIONSHIPS AMONG WORKERSLast, COVID-19 has forced companies to relax policies regarding working from home.While most used to tolerate the occasional remote working arrangement, this pandemic has led many employers to realise trusting their employees to get their work done without constant onsite supervision can lead to increased productivity.Zoom meetings have also provided an unusually intimate glimpse into our colleagues’ lives.We discover new things about each other as we see people’s tattered posters and plant collections, what they really look like without make-up, and how they speak with their pets and children when they are interrupted.We have gone from seeing our colleagues as mere transactions to connect and exchange data with, to real human beings who live, love and suffer just as we do, imbuing work with deeper and more human dimensions.The real gift of this pandemic may well be the start of a more conscious, human-centric approach to work.A caring, purposeful, flexible work human capital approach can no longer be seen as a nice-to- have.It is the foundation on which a company builds its future survival on: Put people and purpose first and the profits will follow.Crystal Lim-Lange is co-author of the national bestselling book Deep Human- Practical Superskills for a Future of Success and the co-founder of Forest Wolf, a leadership training and talent development consultancy.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

248,Social entrepreneur Anthea Ong applies for second term as NMP,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/anthea-ong-applies-for-second-term-nmp-parliament-13621080,23 Nov 2020 04:04PM,"SINGAPORE: Social entrepreneur Anthea Ong has put her name in the ring for a second term as a Nominated Member of Parliament.   The application was an ""eleventh-hour effort"" after prompting from a friend last week, she said in a Facebook post on Monday (Nov 23). The deadline for submissions is Nov 23 at 4.30pm.A term for an NMP usually lasts two-and-a-half years. Ms Ong's previous term ended when Parliament was dissolved on Jun 23, less than two years after she was sworn in on Oct 1, 2018.Up to nine NMPs can be appointed in each Parliament.A number of functional or interest groups are generally represented by NMPs, including business and industry, labour, the professions, social service organisations, the civic and people sector, tertiary education institutions, and media, arts and sports organisations.The National Trades Union Congress has nominated union leader Abdul Samad Abdul Wahab, 48, while environmental groups have put forward Dr Andie Ang, 35, a primatologist and president of the Jane Goodall Institute (Singapore).The applications will be considered by a Special Select Committee of Parliament, which will recommend the candidates for appointment by the President.Those nominated to be NMPs should have rendered distinguished public service, ""have brought honour to the Republic"", or have distinguished themselves in one of the fields above, the Office of the Clerk of Parliament said when calling for applications.Ms Ong said in her Facebook post that other than ""the 3Ms of her heart"" - mental health, marginalised communities including migrant workers and ""Mother Earth"" - she is keen to champion ""the strengthening of the NMP system as a nonpartisan institution especially as she sees the ills of divisive partisan politics around the world"".The founder of A Good Space, a co-operative to support active citizenry, she has often pushed for putting greater priority on mental health. She is known for highlighting the rights of migrant workers and was among those who signed a recent open letter calling for more diverse representation on the Emerging Stronger Taskforce.During a parliamentary debate in May on the COVID-19 outbreak, Ms Ong asked Manpower Minister Josephine Teo if the Government would apologise to Singapore's migrant workers for the “dismal conditions” at dormitories.Mrs Teo replied then that the workers are focused on how the authorities are helping them deal with the situation, and she has not come across any workers who have demanded an apology.Among the NMPs in her term, Ms Ong filed the most number of parliamentary questions and responded to the most number of Bills, according to a tally by CNA in February.The other NMPs in the previous term were Mr Mohamed Irshad Abbas Ali, the founder of inter-faith group Roses of Peace; labour representative Arasu Duraisamy; Sakae Holdings chairman Douglas Foo; executive director of the Singapore Chinese Orchestra Terence Ho; communications and media professor Lim Sun Sun; president of the Pharmaceutical Society of Singapore Irene Quay; labour economist Associate Professor Walter Theseira, as well as Paralympic gold medallist Yip Pin Xiu.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

249,Man gets 20 years' jail for sexually assaulting intellectually disabled daughter,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-gets-20-years-jail-for-sexually-assaulting-intellectually-13621110,23 Nov 2020 03:41PM,"SINGAPORE: A man sexually assaulted his intellectually disabled daughter when she was between six and eight years old, and again when she was 17.The crimes only came to light when a teacher at the victim's special education school noticed she was not her usual self and found out what happened.The 52-year-old man, who cannot be named due to a gag order protecting the identity of the victim, was sentenced on Monday (Nov 23) to 20 years' jail.He pleaded guilty to two charges of sexual assault by penetration, including one aggravated charge, and a third charge of molestation was taken into consideration.The offender was a dishwasher at the time of the offences, which first took place sometime between 2008 and 2009.The girl shared a bedroom with her parents, but her mother was not around on the night her father sexually assaulted her for the first time.She felt scared but did not tell anyone about what her father did as she was afraid her parents would scold her, the prosecution said. She also started harming herself with a ruler and stapler.The offender targeted his daughter again when she was 17. His wife had moved out of the matrimonial home a few years earlier when he sexually assaulted the girl in October 2018.At the time, the man shared a room with his daughter, sleeping on mattresses next to each other, in a home shared with other relatives.At 12.30am on Oct 26, 2018, the man drank some alcohol before lying down on his mattress. He then moved next to his daughter and began sexually assaulting her. The girl covered her face with both hands and tried to push her father away. Eventually he fell asleep beside her, and the teen cried silently in bed, said the prosecution.Later that day, the victim went to a performing arts class, where the teacher noticed she looked disturbed and frustrated.She took the victim out of the class to ask if she was alright, and the teen eventually told her that her father had touched her inappropriately. A school counsellor was notified and the police were alerted.The victim was seen by a psychologist at the Institute of Mental Health and found to be in the extremely low range of intelligence. She was diagnosed with mild intellectual disability, and found to lack awareness of social norms and conventional consequences of behaviour. This meant that she likely requires continued guidance and supervision to guard against undesirable influences or treatment, the court heard.""A HIGHLY DISTURBING CASE""Deputy Public Prosecutor Chee Ee Ling asked for at least 24 years' jail, calling this ""a highly disturbing case"".She said the man was ""emboldened by his child's naivety and silence over the years"", and said the victim was especially vulnerable as she was both very young when the abuse started and intellectually disabled.The offences disturbed the victim deeply, causing her to self-harm after the first offence and appearing frustrated and disturbed after the second.""As the victim’s father, the accused was in a position of absolute authority and influence over her life. He was vested with the responsibility of taking care of the victim and protecting her, especially since her mother had left the household,"" said Ms Chee. ""The victim looked to the accused for fatherly love, affection and security. Instead of caring for and protecting her, the accused callously abused the victim to satiate his sexual desires.""The victim now lives at a shelter for teenage girls who are abused and is undergoing special education.After the crimes were committed, the victim's father was assessed at IMH and found to have a cognitive functioning for perceptual reasoning within the extremely low to borderline range. However, his level of independent functioning in the community did not meet the criteria for intellectual disability.He was also diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and was possibly intoxicated at the time of the 2018 offence. However, he was found to have enough clarity of mind to know what he was doing and that it was wrong.The man said he knew he made a mistake and said he would not drink or smoke again. He also asked the court for a chance and said he would be a better husband and father after his release from prison.For sexual assault by penetration of a minor, he could have been jailed between eight and 20 years and given at least 12 strokes of the cane. Of his 20-year jail term, a year is in lieu of caning as he is above 50 and cannot be caned.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['court', 'crime']",Singapore
250,Commentary: The cult of work is eroding the value of parenthood,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/motherhood-unpaid-labour-disrupt-career-women-housewife-13480126,23 Nov 2020 06:14AM,"The work of homemakers, driven almost entirely by females, often goes unnoticed as much of it occurs in the private domain, says June Yong.SINGAPORE: In today’s modern consumerist world, where financial and career success are heralded, childbirth is unfortunately seen by some as a career death sentence for women, or at least a pause button.In a New York Times article, correspondent Claire Cain Miller goes as far as to say: “One of the worst career moves a woman can make is to have children.” As society venerates the cult of more – more wealth, achievement, status, productivity – less economically tangible priorities may get left behind.The work of homemakers, driven almost entirely by females, often goes unnoticed as much of it occurs in the private domain. Changing dirty diapers, whipping up a wholesome dinner, helping a young child regulate his emotions – all of these happen behind closed doors.Similar to how we deem supermarkets as the main provider of our daily necessities and food, and relegate the mental image of a farmer toiling in the hot sun to the back of our minds, such is the unseen-ness of a mother’s hard work.Moreover, in a materialistic and status conscious society, work that has no economic value attributed to it often gets little appreciation.Why has the world of paid work, and its bedfellows of wealth and status, been elevated to such a point where other worthy pursuits, such as volunteer work or child-rearing, are trivialised?KEEPING THE ECONOMY RUNNING VS RUNNING THE HOUSEHOLDIn recent decades, dual-income families are increasingly viewed as a middle-class necessity and the concept of the working woman has been lauded accordingly.Due to government intervention, more workplaces in Singapore now adopt family-friendly policies, making it easier for homemakers, who have taken time off for family, to transit back into the workforce.While this is beneficial as dual-income households get to enjoy greater financial stability, there is a price that is often overlooked.Apart from being generally time-poor, such dual-income parents typically experience “role overload,” where the stresses of juggling work and family can sometimes overwhelm one’s resources and ability to cope.  It’s a catch-22 as for most lower and middle-income families, where both parents need to be working in order to support the growing family’s needs.However, the presence of young children in a woman’s life can sometimes be an income glass ceiling; many get overlooked for promotions and pay raises as the assumption is that their time and energy is divided.The help of a village – whether it comprises willing and able grandparents or a dependable helper – is a crucial determining factor as to whether the parents can juggle the conflicting demands of work and family successfully.THE RISE OF WORKISMIn a 1957 article in The New York Times, the writer Erik Barnouw made a daring prediction: With increasing automation, work will become easier, and as a result, man’s identity would be defined by our hobbies or our family life.  But it seems like reality has bucked his prediction – particularly in Asia.According to data published by the International Labour Organisation (ILO) in 2019, the region has the longest average work-week. Three ASEAN countries are in the top 10, with Myanmar clocking 48 hours, Brunei, 47 and Malaysia, 46. Thailand and Singapore are in the top 20, with an average of 43 hours spent at work each week.Derek Thompson, in The Atlantic, defines workism as “the belief that work is not only necessary to economic production, but also the centerpiece of one’s identity and life’s purpose; and the belief that any policy to promote human welfare must always encourage more work.”In his article, Thompson alludes to the fact that while America’s richest men may have the onus to “live a little,” they are actually driving themselves to the bone.And it’s not just confined to the ranks of the rich and wealthy. He writes:Finding meaning at work beats family and kindness as the top ambition of today’s young people.But the kind of work that gives rise to the purpose and identity that Thompson writes about is often unpaid and sown in tears and sweat. And the informal caregiving work that so often falls on women’s shoulders is just that.Isn’t the joy of caring for one’s offspring, and nurturing them to be their best possible selves deeply purposeful and gratifying?This is not to say that all paid forms of work are meaningless, purely economically-driven activities. There is a place for work, to find purpose in it, and it is necessary to provide well for ourselves and our families.But have we all taken work a bit too far? Do we live to work, or work to live?Is it time to elevate the status of mothers so that they do not feel they’re being left behind?NOT “JUST A MUM”Michaella Thornton, in her January 2019 essay Pink Slips, describes a “disparate refrain,” where it is a significant event when a man loses his job, but when it comes to a woman’s layoff, especially a mother’s layoff, it is trivialised or used as an argument for her to stay home.Why is a woman’s paid work seen as less important when she loses it, and yet if she doesn’t work, she is “just a mum”?It seems that for mothers who have opted out of the workforce for a season to care for their children, this double jeopardy is commonplace. I recall a few of my friends lamenting whenever they get hit with the question: “Why are you allowing your studies to go to waste?” Or: “What do you do at home all day long?”Although society has progressed in many ways and women today are as educated, if not more so, than men, it seems women’s work in the form of unpaid childcare and eldercare remains unseen and unaccounted for. Their paid careers are often not accorded the due respect and dignity too – deemed to be less important than that of men.Granted that the work of washing laundry and changing diapers isn’t exactly glamourous. Perhaps it is because we have grown up feeding on a steady diet of images of what success means.This is intensified in today’s social media-immersed world, as posts of confident, beautiful women who seem to have it all shout out to us, making us wonder when it will be our turn to enjoy the “good life.”When the stay-home mother shares another picture of her adorable cooing baby, is this as envied? We all know we shouldn’t take such filtered images of achievement at face value, but why does it gnaw at our sense of well-being? After all motherhood can provide a very fulfilling and purposeful life if we approach it with the right attitude. How can shaping future lives not be important?Instead of chasing after the cult of work and the demi-gods of wealth, status, or even calling, it is perhaps time to turn inward – to look at motherhood, child-rearing and family as the nucleus of our being and the foundation from which the rest of life grows.Maybe then it will be a whole lot harder to dismiss motherhood as just a punctuation in life that you just have to cross over.June Yong is a mother of three, an educational therapist and owner of Mama Wear Papa Shirt, a blog that discusses parenting and education in Singapore.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

The police received a report on Nov 12 at about 10.50am that a statue in the courtyard of a church along Upper Serangoon Road was defaced. In response to CNA queries, the police confirmed that the church in question was the Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Hougang.The church said last week that a statue of Mary in its courtyard had been found defaced.Through ground investigations and images from closed-circuit television cameras, officers from the Ang Mo Kio Police Division established the identity of the man and arrested him on Wednesday. The man will be charged in court on Friday with criminal trespass and defiling a place of worship with intent to insult the religion of any class under the Penal Code. If found guilty of criminal trespass, he may be jailed for up to three months, fined up to S$1,500 or both. If found guilty of defiling a place of worship with the intent to insult the religion, he may be jailed for up to five years, fined or both. The police will seek a court order to remand the man at the Institute of Mental Health. ""The police do not condone acts that insult the religious harmony at the places of worship of any class in Singapore and perpetrators will be dealt with sternly in accordance with the law,"" it said.

253,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/employee-workplace-mental-health-insurance-tripartite-advisory-13586244,19 Nov 2020 06:14AM,"SINGAPORE: Companies that have expanded employee benefits to cover mental health services said the move sends a crucial signal to workers that they take the issue seriously, adding that it makes business sense as well.Such benefits are among the recommendations issued by a tripartite advisory on Tuesday (Nov 17) promoting mental wellness in the workforce. It comes amid growing attention on the added stress workers may face as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. “For companies with flexible employee benefits (e.g. medical benefits), consider extending the scope of coverage to include mental well-being programmes, mental health consultations and treatments,” the advisory said.""This signals the company’s desire to support its employees in overcoming their mental health challenges.""It is a sentiment shared by companies who have implemented measures to support their employees' mental well-being.Calling employee benefits the “most visible” part of a company’s stance, Accenture’s head of human resources for Southeast Asia Grace Yip said: “When a company does make a change in their benefits, it’s a firm and clear signal to the workforce that we take it very seriously.""It is seen as skin in the game.""The consulting firm incorporated mental health coverage into its employee health benefits in 2018, when it allowed claims for related treatments to be made under its specialist outpatient insurance, but only with a referral letter.In 2019, it did away with the need for referrals. The move was a part of larger efforts to promote inclusion within the company, with other initiatives targeting awareness and education about mental health, for example.“You can put in benefits, but if you’re not changing the other stuff, you’re not moving the needle,"" Ms Yip told CNA on Wednesday.“We need to create, in a holistic way, an environment that is safe and encourage people to think about mental well-being and care about others.""The efforts have paid off, according to Accenture. Internal surveys have shown a 75.4 per cent increase in employees who feel safe expressing mental health challenges to their supervisors.There has also been a “positive response” on assessments of how supported these employees feel, said Ms Yip.There is also a business case for investing in mental health, said the executive director of the Singapore Human Resources Institute Alvin Aloysius Goh.“If a staff’s mental well-being is not taken care of, he or she may become less productive or may even result in leaving an organisation and these will impact the company greatly,"" he said.“When an organisation looks after its employees, it will reflect positively in their business, hence it is not just if this is a good investment, it is a necessary investment.""COVERING MENTAL ILLNESS LIKE A PHYSICAL ILLNESSAt Otis Elevator Company, while its medical insurance provider does not cover mental health services, employees can tap internal “company self-funded insurance” which was expanded to cover some specialist treatments, including psychological support services.This is an “intermediary solution” because the goal ultimately is to have external insurance cover mental health services, said Ms Karine Scelles, the firm's executive HR director of Asia-Pacific.While the company is in talks with its insurer to see what this plan could look like, the main challenge is nailing down a cost.“The (insurers) will tell you that they are okay to cover mental health, but they’ll have to increase your premium by ‘XYZ’. I understand they also have to look at economics, but it’s creating the wrong discussion,” said Ms Scelles.“I really think there is something to be done in terms of having this industry consider mental illness like any other physical illness.""She added: “People spend most of their time working and so as an employer, we have a responsibility for people to be in their best condition, perform and feel well.”BANDING TOGETHER TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO HIGH COSTSAccenture and Otis Elevator Company are part of the WorkWell Leaders Workgroup, a circle that includes top executives from the private and public sector who meet quarterly to discuss inclusive practices.A subgroup was also set up to deal with the prohibitive costs of improving corporate mental health coverage.They are working together in the hope of strategising and negotiating with insurers.“Once you have a certain level of risk-pooling, then the risk management part of it makes it more affordable, like a critical mass kind of thing,” said mental health advocate Anthea Ong, who founded the workgroup.“The fewer employers who come on board, the more expensive it continues to be, and it’s a chicken and egg situation. There needs to be a collective coordinated effort.”The former Nominated Member of Parliament added that out of the recommendations by the tripartite advisory, which include organising workshops or training managers to spot distress, insuring mental health is the “biggest and hardest” to do.“Therefore, I wouldn’t say it should be the first thing on the list firms should do. But it still absolutely deserves our immediate attention to work on it because it will take time, justification, resources and negotiation,” she told CNA.Ms Ong added that when employers create a safe space for workers to seek help, people will come forward earlier.“The earlier you seek help, just like any condition, the better your recovery. That helps the company,” she said.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['manpower', 'mental health', 'employees', 'insurance']",Singapore
254,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/university-sexual-harassment-education-awareness-13531564,18 Nov 2020 06:20AM,"An unpleasant encounter in campus made this young woman understand that sexual harassment is a complex issue and education is at the heart of change.SINGAPORE: My freshman experience was an unhappy one.Initially, plunging into a new social context was both thrilling and daunting. When uncertainties arose, I confided in a senior I had met during one of my orientation camps.But in time the relationship became fraught – he demanded more of my time and energy, accused me of leading him on, and spread rumours about my character in social circles that we shared – circles in which he was well-established and well-liked.I struggled to appease him, desperate to maintain a sense of normalcy and social balance.When he put his hand on the small of my back one day, I froze - and said nothing. Then it happened again. And again.I soon discovered that not being able to say no was just one complex factor which nurtured the insidious presence of sexual harassment on campus.WHY UNIVERSITY STUDENTS ARE SUSCEPTIBLEIn a recent survey commissioned by The Sunday Times of 440 undergraduates, a fifth of respondents said they knew a friend who had been sexually harassed in the past year. Nine students themselves reported being victims of sexual harassment. While harassment is not limited to universities, the unique circumstances of students in universities should warrant careful consideration.University is a time of exploration and experiential learning. Students are on the cusp of adulthood, forming new and complex relationships in a highly social environment.For many moving into campus residence is their first time living away from home.There are several factors at work: Balancing newfound independence with living in close proximity to the opposite gender, exploring new relationships, and in many cases, a greater propensity to consume alcohol.Taken together, these can put students in a vulnerable position.For seniors or staff who are established in existing social or institutional groups, it becomes easy to prey on uncertainties and exploit these weaknesses.Even for fellow students without ill intentions, the quick thrust into a new depth of intimacy can lead to boundaries being crossed. In some circumstances, neither party could be aware that a boundary existed, until one side is made to feel unsafe and uncomfortable.Once these situations arise, many victims are unwilling to address the issue, afraid they will be socially penalised for disrupting group harmony, or making things “awkward”. If the perpetrator is in a position of authority, in cases such as with former Tembusu College professor Jeremy Fernando, the power disparity makes it harder to speak out.Victims swallow their discomfort and dismiss their experiences, sometimes even continuing to bear with persistent advances, which can have deep implications on their physical, mental and emotional health. MORE EDUCATION IS NEEDEDSince the public outcry in April 2019 against the case of National University of Singapore (NUS) undergraduate Nicholas Lim who filmed then-undergraduate Monica Baey in the shower, universities have been quick to implement new guidelines and measures against campus sexual harassment.NUS and Singapore Management University have established dedicated care units to respond to cases of harassment and provide professional support to affected students. NUS and Nanyang Technological University (NTU) have launched new anti-harassment online modules, which are mandatory for all students.All three universities announced their planned actions to review disciplinary guidelines and frameworks.Still, these efforts have limitations in curbing the issue of sexual harassment.As a co-founder of Girl, Talk, a student campaign against campus sexual harassment, I spoke to many women across universities in Singapore who persistently raised common gaps in education.These included a need for more understanding about sexual harassment which can be nuanced and insidious, more discussions around the principles of consent, and more knowledge about how to react to harassment situations.In all these topics, universities play a pivotal role in foregrounding education, which can help students safely navigate new relationships and boundaries on campus.UNIVERSITIES MUST EDUCATE If universities are truly taking note of the 172 reported cases of sexual misconduct in institutes of higher learning between 2015-2019, and committed to changing this, they must be proactive in creating and upgrading new and existing avenues of education.The compulsory anti-harassment online modules adopted in NUS and NTU are a positive step forward, but information on these modules must more seriously target student mindsets, and cannot be seen as an inherent chore – something a student haphazardly clears to in order to gain access to report slips.Universities must look to continually refresh and update module content by consulting students and experts to realise gaps in education and opportunities for greater engagement.Going one step further, workshops can play a role in facilitating open and honest discussions.Regular, accessible workshops that cover a range of topics – the psychology behind “fight”, “flight”, “freeze” or “fawn” responses, consent and setting boundaries, the existence and eradication of rape culture – can help male and female students break down the issue of campus sexual harassment.These workshops can also be practical, and involve external vendors, such as the Sexual Assault First Responder Training by AWARE's Sexual Assault Care Centre, which equips participants with the necessary skills to be effective first responders to survivors.Students who attend these workshops can possibly be roped into volunteer programmes, stationed in campus or available on call, to provide support when they are contacted or activated.Universities can also explore innovative solutions such as utilising virtual reality (VR) simulations to help students learn how to identify and respond to harassment situations, stimulating their emotions and reactions without compromising on comfort and safety.Through mental rehearsals, students can reduce affective forecasting error, decreasing the discrepancy between the way they imagine they would behave, and how they would actually behave in the situation.Above all, schools must be open to collaborating with student advocacy groups such as Girl, Talk or Students for a Safer NUS, empowering, advising, and uplifting them, instead of attempting to manage or control these efforts.But there are limitations even to the effectiveness of agent-centric, empowerment-based education. Even if students are able to clearly express their needs, the alarming rise of voyeurism and other non-consensual pornography show how circumstances are often completely out of their control.In all cases, universities must take swift action, as well as uphold accountability and transparency within the wider university community.If universities are truly looking to create safe, conducive spaces for living and learning, they need to take more holistic approaches to prioritising student safety and building a culture that is intolerant towards sexual harassment. Three years after the incident in my first year, I contacted that senior to speak about it. To his credit, he was open, apologetic and willing to accept accountability for his actions.That day, I gained closure, but I also gained something else – a foundation for my advocacy.“It keeps running through my brain,” I told him, “That if maybe I had known how to establish my boundaries, that if maybe someone had told me I had the absolute right to safety and no one was entitled to take that away, that maybe - just maybe  - neither of us would need to be here today.”Today, I speak up about campus sexual harassment, boldly and unapologetically, joined by many other student advocates. We spark important conversations, with the strong and fervent hope that these conversations will continue to educate, empower, and impact a generation.Heather Seet is the co-founder of youth collective Girl, Talk and an advocate against sexual violence.

255,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tripartite-advisory-on-mental-well-being-at-workplaces-issued-13576906,17 Nov 2020 03:49PM,"SINGAPORE: A tripartite advisory was issued on Tuesday (Nov 17) to provide guidance and resources on mental wellness to Singapore’s workforce.The Tripartite Advisory on Mental Well-being at Workplaces was developed by the Ministry of Manpower (MOM), the National Trades Union Congress (NTUC) and the Singapore National Employers Federation (SNEF) in consultation with HR practitioners and social agency partners.“There has been increasing attention on workers’ mental well-being and growing recognition that a negative work environment can impact workers’ mental health,” the tripartite partners said in a media release.“Conversely, workplaces that promote workers’ mental well-being are more likely to observe increased productivity and reduced absenteeism.”Manpower Minister Josephine Teo introduced the advisory in her opening address at the Singapore Workplace Safety and Health (WSH) Conference, describing how “protecting workers’ mental health has become even more important” during the COVID-19 pandemic.“The tripartite advisory sets out practical guidance on measures that employers can adopt to take care of their employees’ mental well-being, and the resources employers and self-employed persons can tap,” she said.Mrs Teo summarised the four key aspects of the advisory for employers.“First, appoint and train mental wellness champions to organise programmes, talks and workshops on mental wellness,” she said.“Second, provide training on self-care and equip managers and human resource personnel with skills to be supportive leaders.“Third, extend employee flexible benefits to cover mental health related consultations and treatments or provide employees access to employee assistance programmes.“Fourth, recognise the need for employees to have adequate rest outside work hours.”In addition to providing resources and helplines that employees and self-employed persons can utilise to safeguard their own mental well-being, the advisory also offers health tips for work-from-home arrangements.BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEESMr John Ng, SNEF vice president and chairman of the Workplace Safety and Health Council, said that both employers and employees will gain from the adoption of the advisory’s recommendations.“The mental well-being of employees may affect their work, safety and health. The Tripartite Advisory will help employers to take proactive steps to take care of their employees’ mental well-being so that they are able to stay focused at work, work safely and stay healthy,” he said.“In turn, employers will benefit from a healthy and productive workforce which can contribute to better business performance.”Mr Gary Khoo, director of preventive health programmes at the Health Promotion Board, said that awareness of mental well-being at a workplace has a positive impact on its working environment, and will boost employees’ abilities to respond to challenges.“By implementing mental wellness programmes at workplaces, employees can be equipped with coping skills to manage challenges faced at work,” he said.“Employers can also train leaders at the workplace to identify and support staff who may have mental health and well-being concerns. This will create a supportive workplace environment for better engagement of employees.”IMPACT OF COVID-19The advisory comes against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has produced an array of challenges that can impact the mental wellness of workers.“The recent COVID-19 outbreak has led many workplaces to adopt work-from-home arrangements as the norm,” the tripartite partners said. “This has blurred the lines between work and home, leading to employees feeling more stressed and facing a higher risk of burnout.”Mr Melvin Yong, assistant secretary-general of NTUC said that the advisory “will help to reassure workers that safeguards are in place to support their mental well-being”. “In this prolonged period of telecommuting work arrangements, I understand that many workers are facing greater mental stress from juggling work and personal commitments while having to adapt to the COVID guidelines and restrictions,"" he said.“The guidelines, particularly the part on establishing a work-life harmony policy for employees to rest and recharge after work, will benefit many workers especially those suffering and those who are at risk from workplace burnout.“The Labour Movement is also committed to work with our unionised companies to adopt the recommendations and partner our employers and the Government to strengthen mental health-related support at the workplaces.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

256,,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/living-near-siblings-family-elderly-13530934,14 Nov 2020 06:01AM,"Living within walking distance to your sibling has many upsides but there are challenges too and it boils down to one thing, says this observer.SINGAPORE: When my wife and I were deciding on our BTO flat back in 2007, we had a few options to choose from.There were more affordable choices in non-mature estates such as Woodlands, Bukit Panjang, Choa Chu Kang and coveted ones in the Bukit Merah and Queenstown area nearer to our workplaces.Nevertheless, we chose to settle down in Punggol. It wasn’t because of the Punggol 21 initiative nor its popularity among young couples.We just wanted to stay closer to my siblings - my younger brother and elder sister’s place was three bus stops away and a 15-minute drive across the expressway respectively.We loved the idea that doing so meant more frequent visits, more quality time and stronger family ties. The kids will grow up alongside their cousins as friends rather than distant relatives you see only annually at Chinese New Year.The grandparents also get to see their grandchildren more often and enjoy blissful moments of joy with the family.A CNA story of siblings who built a huge compound so they could live with each other captured the imagination of readers. It’s a luxury few of us can afford.And if we’re honest, most of us might want a little more space than that away from our siblings, no matter how huge the place may be.After all, it’s not all a bed of roses when proximity, on top of familiarity, breeds friction.LESS TIME GETTING TO EACH OTHERS’ PLACESConvenience is a huge consideration. My wife and I do not have a car so the time saved on commuting was key when we thought about living close to my siblings.Although Singapore’s extensive road-rail-bus network facilitates a seamless travel, one could still spend a an hour or more commuting had we lived in a different neighbourhood seeing that you have to connect from an MRT to bus and walk from the bus stop to their flat, not to mention the occasional traffic jam.Had I chosen a flat in Chua Chu Kang, it would take us an hour and a half getting to my brother’s Punggol place.A friend of mine, who lives a few floors away from her siblings and parents, shared that despite being married with two children, she still heads back to her parents’ place each day to enjoy a home-cooked dinner.This ritual means a lot to the entire family where it gives her parents time with her children regardless of the hustle and bustle of each day.CARING FOR AGED PARENTSOften, siblings live near each other to share in caring for aged parents. My parents, both in their 60s and 70s, live with us and being close to my brothers and sisters makes it easier for them to come around.Caring for the elderly is a physically and emotionally draining job that gets progressively more demanding when old folks develop complicated health conditions.About four in 10 of carers of stroke survivors have depressive symptoms, according to a 2017 study by the Institute of Mental Health and the National University of Singapore,Temporary respite care for caregivers is available for a few hours to a day, with mean tested subsidies for eligible households from the Agency for Integrated Care, but in my experience, it has been challenging to get help at very short notice.In situations like these, a close living sibling can be a game-changer for cash strapped families.When my dad had to undergo treatment for his prostate condition, I was thankful my brother helped chaperone him to the hospital a few times when I could not do so due to work commitments.Living close can help ease the logistical challenge. But what more is gained cannot be counted in dollars and cents.The familiarity of a loved one’s voice and physical presence can help soothe a sick elderly’s anxiety. This intimate support might not easily be replaced by a non-family member.A sibling living nearby can also help look over a child during work exigencies.Another friend of mine, Mdm Toh, a customer service representative, told me she found it hard to take last-minute childcare leave and pry herself from work when her child fell sick and was thankful her sister living across a few blocks could.NOT A BED OR ROSESFor every happy tale however, there are unpleasant experiences too. The one thing that matters is your relationship with your siblings. You have to be honest about the state of your relationship and how much work you want to put into it. Be frank about whether you get along well and why.If you don’t see eye-to-eye on most issues, living so close that frequent interactions become the default will not magically transform a poor relationship into a close one.It might even strain the relationship further.Unless the relationship is harmonious and strong to start with, the outcomes might be disastrous.When siblings aren’t in similar economic circumstances, getting a nearby place may be a financial challenge. Resale flats nearer to downtown and in mature estates command a higher asking price.A resale 4-room flat at Bishan Street 22 and the coveted Duxton at Cantonment Road transacted at S$688,000 and S$1.03 million respectively in October.Families can tap into the HDB’s Proximity Housing Grant (PHG) to buy a resale flat but these might not make a huge world of difference.Even if you have decided to move closer to your sibling, beware that proximity is two-way street and will come with certain expectation of reciprocity in providing help readily when you are called upon.HOW TO MAKE IT WORKLet’s not forget there is a very important person in this equation too: your other half. They have to be fine with being physically close to your family.The challenge also is that even the closest of siblings have different commitments and priorities. It would not be fair to rely on one who seems to have more work flexibility or fewer family commitments to bear the lion’s share of caring for elderly parents and drop everything on hand to help out on a regular basis.This is why I believe it is important to respect each other’s need for privacy, manage guidelines regarding visits, and be conscious of not imposing your parenting style on your sibling’s children.Taking into account these dynamics, deciding whether to move closer to your siblings is quite heavily dependent on your relationship with each other. Being closer could mean more time and effort to talk, and is always a good way to improve relationships.Conversely, closeness can also lead to differences becoming obvious. If parties take each other for granted, unhappiness can set in.Before making the move, assess your priorities, take your family’s personality into consideration and have plenty of conversations with your siblings about the boundaries and expectations.For all you know, a Whatsapp family chat group might suffice if you are just looking to stay updated on family affairs.Tan Chin Hock is recipient of the filial piety award conferred by the Nanyang Confucian Association and Founder of Holdinghands.sgCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

259,Commentary: Why men should care and do more about women’s issues,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/singapore-divorce-gender-review-father-mother-roles-13439434,07 Nov 2020 05:57AM,"The upcoming review of gender issues in Singapore must involve an often overlooked demographic – men – says AWARE member Kristian-Marc James Paul.SINGAPORE: A while ago, I was watching the Netflix series Sex Education. For the uninitiated, Sex Education follows Otis, a teenager who starts giving out advice to his school mates after years of observing his single mother - a sex therapist - counselling her clients.In one particular episode, Otis and his mother have a huge argument that they can’t seem to resolve. In response to Otis’ stubbornness, his exasperated mother says:As the primary carer in your life, I always get your worst. And I’m tired of it.As the only son of a single mother too, I think about that scene a lot. Like Otis’ mother, almost all of the workload and responsibility fell onto my mother after my parents’ divorce.And like Otis’ father in the show, who is separated from the family, my father seemed to escape these responsibilities. He moved out, spent weekends and holidays with his friends, while my mother worried constantly about housing us, making financial ends meet and being a good parent to me.A WELCOME GENDER REVIEWI thought about that scene again about a month ago, when it was announced that Singapore will embark on a comprehensive review of issues affecting women to bring about a mindset change on values like gender equality and respect for women.The review is the first of its kind and marks a welcome shift — the announcement articulated that “changes to Singapore’s cultural value system” are needed, as opposed to just piecemeal solutions.However, there was one thing missing in the announcement: An explicit call for men to get involved in the process.Gender discrimination, and the structural barriers that women face, exist because generations of men have been complicit (consciously or unconsciously) in the oppressive system of patriarchy.A lot of men have held onto misogynistic views, perpetuated unconscious biases, relegated women to the space of the home, discriminated at work based on gender, committed sexual and domestic violence, and so on.This review, then, is an opportunity for men to think about how we can inculcate the importance of gender equality into other men. It would be remiss if we didn’t get involved in this review and if we let women do all the work.For the men that need convincing, there is extensive international literature that suggests that men in gender-equal societies are better off than those in less equal ones.These men tend to be healthier, both mentally and physically, and more satisfied with life on multiple fronts. As such, it is only in our own interests to show support for gender equality and to try and find ways to achieve it.However, I don’t want to dwell too much on studies and disembodied analyses, because gender equality and equity is personal to me.WOMEN DOING THE WORK ON BEHALF OF MENAs I mentioned, for years I witnessed the struggles of my single mother. My maternal grandmother was also a single mother. So I have come to see how gendered this phenomenon can be.Care work, for too long, has fallen almost exclusively on the shoulders of women without any choice in the matter, and often without compensation. Bearing the responsibility of managing the household, caring for children, are all forms of labour that are rarely distributed evenly.For example, in June, a National University of Singapore research revealed that on average, mothers spend more than twice as much time as fathers directly engaged with their child on weekdays.This then results in the lack of accountability seen in men. Time and time again we see emotionally absent or distant fathers, fathers who leave the parenting to their wives.This isn’t because they’re ill equipped to parent — there’s nothing inherent in men that makes them poor carers. More likely, men are socialised to see this as work they don’t need to do.This may not be a belief that is explicitly articulated. But one only needs to look at how paternity leave is structured and thought about to see how deeply ingrained this line of thinking is. By law, employers are only obligated to give two weeks of paternity leave in Singapore, compared to at least 12 weeks of maternity leave.While numerous organisations do give more than the mandatory two weeks’ paternity leave, the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF) reported that 6 in 10 fathers still did not take paternity leave in 2018.It goes without saying that this imbalance of care work is even more pronounced for single mothers, where all the responsibility has to be taken up by one person — like my mum.GENDER INEQUALITY HARMS MEN TOOBeyond housework and parenting, men also tend to delegate emotional labour to women. And while that may not strike you as ""real work"", ensuring the psychological well-being of others is a mental load that strains the bandwidth of many women.Many men see emotional and mental well-being as ""feminine"" and unimportant concepts. This mentality prevents them from seeking help and support—especially from other men — and from developing emotional literacy and intelligence.For example, a 2016 Canadian study found that among 360 respondents who had experienced depression or suicidal ideation, more men than women were embarrassed about seeking formal treatment for depression.This penalises men around the world to an enormous degree. It is tragic, but not surprising, that three times as many men as women die by suicide in high-income countries, as reported by the World Health Organization in 2018.We end up being so paralysed by the expectation of being stoic and ""rational"", we end up hurting ourselves and the people around us. We wear this mask of invulnerability so tight that it ends up being self-destructive - choosing not to seek professional help (or assuming that talking to our female partners is sufficient), or resorting to violence when things get too bottled up.We don’t emotionally connect, and we don’t emotionally invest. We rarely unpack or deescalate. Imagine then, the kinds of role models and modes of masculinity that exist in this world for the next generation.MEN MUST PLAY THEIR PARTThe cycle must be broken, and that work lies squarely on men. Men are the only ones who can become better men; women cannot do that work for us. It is my job to improve myself, using everything my mother has taught me.Like what it means to be accountable to the people who rely on you, what it means to be honest in your communication, what it means to love openly, to be a better person, a better man, a better role model.I do have hope that the tides are turning. I have had many powerful conversations with men who recognise the need to work towards a more gender-equal society. But more of us need to put in the labour.Undeniably, most men have exhibited some form of misogyny and toxic masculinity in the past; I know I have. It might be something seemingly small, like making sexist jokes or an inappropriate comment, or it might be a form of discrimination that was more overt.But the aim here is not to strive for some form of ethical purity that doesn’t exist. Rather, it is to recognise our mistakes, hold ourselves accountable to said mistakes, and learn to be better moving forward.So what’s next? What do we do?Make your voices heard. Call out toxic behaviour. Stop relying solely on women for emotional work and start developing emotional literacy amongst your male friends.And finally, demonstrate your support for this review on women’s issues by participating however you can. There is value and power in showing up.And it’s important to show that we, as men, are willing to put in that work to fight for gender equality so we become better role models for the next generation of partners, husbands, fathers, sons.Kristian-Marc James Paul is a member of AWARE.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

""This will allow us to detect any potential re-infections and enable swift and decisive measures to prevent further spread of COVID-19,"" they said.Recovered workers with COVID-19 onset before Apr 16, will also be closely monitored, as they were among the earliest batch of workers in Singapore to have recovered from COVID-19, with their antibodies likely being the first to fade.They will undergo monitoring tests, including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology tests, at regular intervals. If the ministries detect that the workers' antibodies are starting to fade, or if there is evidence of re-infection of recovered workers, rostered routine testing may resume for recovered workers earlier.""MOH and MOM will continue to review the latest scientific evidence relevant to these measures and revise our policies accordingly,"" said the ministries.""It remains the shared responsibility of all stakeholders including dormitory operators, employers and workers to ensure strict compliance to Safe Living Measures, and to seek care when unwell in our fight against COVID-19.""Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

262,New task force set up to improve support for migrant workers' mental health,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/mom-task-force-improve-support-migrant-workers-mental-health-13479636,06 Nov 2020 09:28PM,"SINGAPORE: A task force has been set up to improve awareness of mental health issues among migrant workers and to provide better support for those who need such care, the Ministry of Manpower (MOM) said on Friday (Nov 6). Named Project Dawn, the 10-member task force involves representatives from the MOM, government psychologists, the Institute of Mental Health (IMH), as well as the Migrant Workers' Centre (MWC) and HealthServe - two non-governmental organisations (NGOs) that help migrant workers.Some mental health support initiatives have been put into place, and HealthServe has been providing tele-counselling services, conducted via Zoom or on the phone with the workers in their native languages.HealthServe said that it had noticed a gap in this area before the COVID-19 pandemic and was able to quickly extend its nascent mental health programme during the circuit breaker, when coronavirus cases surged among migrant workers and many were quarantined in their dormitories.MOM has also started training Forward Assurance and Support Team (FAST) officers, who are stationed at dormitories to help migrant workers, in psychological first aid, and will extend such training to all new and existing FAST officers.Psychological first aid is often used to support people in the aftermath of a crisis and involves giving both emotional support and practical help to them.More initiatives will be rolled out and the task force aims to implement them by end-2022, said Dr Lam Meng Chon, director (medical) of MOM's Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group as he outlined the task force's implementation plan at a media briefing on Friday.""We see the implementation of Project Dawn as building blocks - we are first looking at raising awareness in good mental health practices as the base layer ... (then) strengthening primary care to improve access to mental health services,"" he said.A third layer of prevention would be to ensure that those who need specialist care get help and continued support for recovery. For a start, NGOs such as MWC will include mental health education in its programme to help new migrant workers settle in from next year, while more frontline officers, dormitory operators and employers will be trained to better detect at-risk workers and refer them for care, if necessary.Social well-being activities such as excursions with managed itineraries will also be organised in the dormitories, MOM added.""We are working with our frontline teams and NGOs to ... establish peer support networks that can (be) the first line of defence within the dormitories and offer para-counselling,"" said Dr Lam.The task force will work with MWC's ambassador network to identify ""peer support leaders"", as well as recruit recovered workers who are willing to act as intermediaries for their peers.Mr Bava Sahib, an MWC ambassador for five years and deputy property officer at The Leo dormitory, said that the ambassadors have been helping migrant workers with their issues, such as disputes with employers. During the pandemic, they monitored workers for depression and helped them seek help.Mr Bava and a fellow MWC ambassador told CNA that the workers faced various stressful challenges during the pandemic.Besides not being able to go out and meet their friends, some have lost their jobs, some have not been paid their salaries and some have faced difficulty going home despite having urgent family issues. ""We have a large number of ambassadors in the dormitories of different nationalities ... If any workers have any mental pressure or depression, anything ... immediately our ambassadors refer them to us,"" he said.Minister in the Prime Minister's Office and Second Minister for Manpower Tan See Leng told reporters that moving forward, such mental health support for migrant workers will not just be a permanent feature, but also a ""work in progress"".""We're committed to making sure that we're not focused on just the physical wellness but also the mental well-being of the migrant workers. I think that's most important.""Obviously, this is an ecosystem that is evolving rapidly,"" said Dr Tan, who added that many organisations, in particular NGOs, have come forward to make this possible, and he hopes more will come forward.He also said that he hopes people will become more accepting of mental health issues, such as depression, which can happen to anyone due to stressful situations.Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegramCopyright© Mediacorp 2021.

264,"Man jailed for role in case of woman who was tortured by his wife's family with boiling water, pliers and hammer",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/man-jailed-for-role-in-case-of-woman-tortured-by-his-family-wife-13450032,03 Nov 2020 01:52PM,"SINGAPORE: After a man engaged in sexual activities with a family friend, his wife grew angry and allegedly tortured the victim with her family members - using pliers to twist her toes, a hammer to knock out her teeth and splashing boiling water on her.The man, 33-year-old Egyptian Hany Aboubakr Abdelkarim Abdelfattah, was the first of the lot to be sentenced on Tuesday (Nov 3) and was given three weeks' jail.He pleaded guilty to voluntarily causing hurt to the victim, a 30-year-old woman with mild intellectual disability, by slapping her face. A second similar charge was taken into consideration. The court heard that Hany is married to co-accused Haslinda Ismail, 34. They were acquainted with the victim as she was a school friend of Haslinda's brother. The victim later became acquainted with Haslinda's family and often visited them and grew close to them, calling Haslinda her sister and staying with them when she had her own family problems.Hany got to know the victim better while he worked at a supermarket and saw her nearly every day as she worked nearby. Between May and June 2016, the victim performed sex acts on Hany at a staircase landing.Haslinda found out and confronted the victim a few days later when Hany and other family members were around. She scolded the victim and slapped her face, before directing Hany to point his middle finger at the victim and slap her face twice.He complied and members of Haslinda's family began abusing the victim. They used tools such as a pair of pliers to twist her toes, a hammer to knock out her teeth, a baseball bat to hit her head and boiling water which they splashed on her.The victim subsequently wore a tudung to cover injuries on her right cheek. Haslinda's mother stopped taking her to Malaysia to clean the family's flat there as she was afraid the victim might seek help from Singapore immigration officers at the checkpoint.On Aug 31, 2017, Haslinda brought the victim to another flat to help with her family's Hari Raya Haji preparations. She made the victim stand in the kitchen throughout the night, keeping watch to ensure she did not use the toilet or sleep.At around 11am the next morning, unable to control her bladder, the victim urinated on the kitchen floor, angering Haslinda, who hit her with a broomstick so hard that it broke in two.Haslinda then used a hanger to hit the victim's arms and rolled up a wet towel to hit the victim again, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Ang Feng Qian, Li Yihong, Grace Chua and Ng Jun Chong.She also bound the victim's hands and legs with cable ties and made her continue standing in the kitchen in her soiled trousers. Haslinda's family members arrived for Hari Raya celebrations that day at about 3pm and saw the victim standing in the kitchen with her limbs tied up, but they did nothing.Hany was also present in the flat and knew how his wife treated the victim, but did not intervene.When Haslinda's mother arrived at the flat for the celebrations, she bought two packets of noodles for the victim. But Haslinda threw away one packet and urinated into the other packet. Hany had seen his wife soil the food. Haslinda later demanded that the victim eat the noodles and she complied.Hany also slapped the victim twice that day because his wife told him to.Haslinda eventually released the victim from her cable ties only after her family left the flat in the evening.VICTIM TAKEN TO HOSPITAL NEAR DEATHCourt documents did not state how the offences were uncovered but the victim was near death when she was taken to hospital on Jan 16, 2018. An IQ assessment found that she scored in the low or extremely low ranges for several categories except her processing speed index, which could not be assessed as the victim was unable to perform the tests due to visual disability arising from the abuse.She was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and found to have mild intellectual disability since childhood and with deficits in intellectual functions that would have affected her ability to seek help.The prosecution said while Hany had no previous convictions, he was aware of what the victim had been subjected to. Ms Ang said Hany had admitted to slapping the victim, and the events which led to them ""are very cruel"".Hany's lawyers said he is extremely sorry and genuinely remorseful and fully cooperated with the police, giving full disclosure of what happened. He also has to care for two children, one of whom suffers from a learning disability. The cases for the co-accused, which include several members of Haslinda's family, are pending. Haslinda is set to plead guilty later this month.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd. All rights reserved.",False,"['court', 'crime']",Singapore
265,'The role is demanding': How a new resource aims to help caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/tan-tock-seng-hospital-caregivers-portal-covid19-13415048,03 Nov 2020 06:30AM,"SINGAPORE: In the course of his work, Dr Lim Wee Shiong has seen not just sick patients, but also stressed caregivers.“The carer will bring them (their loved one) to the ED (emergency department) and say: ‘Mum is not very well.’ ... The complaints are very vague but nothing very tangible. But when you dig deeper you find that the carer is having difficulty coping,” said Dr Lim, who is a senior consultant at Tan Tock Seng Hospital’s department of geriatric medicine.“Even though there isn’t a really acute problem in a sense, these attendant care issues need to be looked at as well.”This is where online tools to enhance “caregiving mastery” - the knowledge and skills needed to perform the role as a caregiver - come into play, Dr Lim told CNA. One of these tools is TTSH’s new online physiotherapy-related resource library called 'Carers X Physios', which was launched in September. Created especially for caregivers to refer and practise skills, it includes video demonstrations on complex care instructions, home-based workouts as well as safe caregiving management tips. The resource library also offers a platform for caregivers to tap on community services for help and join support groups. The hospital also plans to continue to update and add more materials to the collection, including tips and information from other departments. “The resources are great because making use of technology, at their own time, at their own pace, at their own convenience, they can look at resources, they can revise some of these things to help them enhance the caregiving mastery,” explained Dr Lim.EXACERBATED BY THE PANDEMICWhen it comes to caregiving mastery, Dr Lim noted that the current COVID-19 pandemic has added a layer of “complexity” for caregivers. This is because they have to deal with the new situations they face daily as a result of the pandemic, on top of fulfilling their role as a caregiver. In addition, Dr Lim noted that caregivers often face issues relating to ""personal mastery"" -  the care for their personal well being - as they adjust to the demands of caregiving.And some of these stressors have been “exacerbated” by the pandemic, he added.“Because of the pandemic, they have been more ‘isolated’ socially, (are) not able to go out and meet friends, (with) more time having spent to look after loved ones,” he said.“Often because of that, they also have poorer lifestyle habits and self care - more sedentary lifestyle, unhealthy eating habits and insufficient rest. And they also have to cope with their own stressors as well, their own uncertainty, especially some caregivers who may be affected by the pandemic themselves and also their own fears about the pandemic.""A previous study conducted by Dr Lim and his colleagues from TTSH’s Institute of Geriatrics and Active Aging also found that caregivers worry about their performance when fulfilling their role.“In the pandemic situation, there will be more stress and more pressure,” he added. “This is  a new situation, it is unknown, the sense of control is less, and (they feel like): ‘I need to get on top of things, I need to do things well.’ So much so that sometimes the caregivers forget to take care of themselves - they overlook the personal mastery part.”Pandemic or no pandemic, adjusting to a new role as a caregiver is a common concern caregivers face, TTSH senior physiotherapist Lim Biyu told CNA.“Usually they have a lot of skills to learn at once, on top of this understanding (of) their loved one’s medical condition. So this actually adds to the mental load. And depending on the task involved, some tasks may require many steps, and techniques. So that upon reaching home, caregivers themselves may start to forget parts of the training, and this just contributes to the existing challenges,” she explained.“What most caregivers need is the reassurance, revision of the skills taught in the hospital when they are back at home caring for the loved one.” This is where the resource library can come in handy, she pointed out.“Most of the points of contact or most of the support is done within a short period of time, which is either when the patient is in the hospital, or in the post discharge. So a lot of times ... when the caregiver has to refer to some sort of resources or require further support, by then it might have already been three months or six months after discharge,” she explained.“At their convenience, they would maybe prefer to refer to these resources that are already there, (and now) they know where to find it because it's easily accessible on the internet. The videos there are also quite comprehensive, so they do range from a variety of tasks. At the moment, it is physiotherapy related, there are plans to add more resources and materials to the website.The “new normalcy” following Singapore’s “circuit-breaker” has also provided new opportunities for caregivers, noted Dr Lim. “With the relaxation of certain measures, it also gives the opportunity for the caregivers to take better care of themselves - especially the personal mastery part - because now this is the time where they can actually find pockets of space to do some things they like to do,"" he said. “And of course I think that new normal does mean leveraging on technology and related resources.”Calling caregivers the “invisible workforce”, Dr Lim stressed the importance of their role in today’s society.“They are the main ones who will be helping to look after our frail older adults with an aging society. So you can imagine that with aging population, the rate at which the population ages and thereby the rate of increase of frail older adults will outpace the ability of the healthcare system to provide,” he explained.“It’s also been said that our caregivers, they are part of the invisible workforce that we have to care for the older adults.""And the efforts of these caregivers will allow for the “aging in place” of their loved ones, where they can live out the remainder of their days in the comfort and security of their own home, added Dr Lim.“There are only four kinds of people in the world. Those who have been caregivers. Those who are currently caregivers. Those who will be caregivers, and those who will need a caregiver,” he added, quoting former US first lady Roselyn Carter.“We are all inextricably linked to caregiving.”Copyright© Mediacorp 2021.

266,"Commentary: To survive COVID-19 disruptions, Singaporeans must learn how to learn better",https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/commentary/covid-19-jobs-reskilling-learning-to-learn-skills-13414468,02 Nov 2020 06:07AM,"With a quick crash course on better learning, Fung Fun Man and Ng Chia Wee say workers and those aspiring to join the workforce must re-gear themselves or risk being left behind.SINGAPORE: Earlier this year, Senior Minister (SM) Tharman Shanmugaratnam stood at the entrance of the Employment and Employability Institute, exalting Singaporeans to take up the challenge of lifelong learning.“Everyone should have the courage to re-gear to stay on track,” he said in his June ministerial broadcast, “and make the effort to acquire new skills at regular points in your careers, possibly even learning whole new disciplines.”“Please take on the challenge.”More than four months on, the protracted economic downturn and the continuing spate of retrenchments have only reinforced SM Tharman’s points. If anything, it is no longer just an important challenge, but an urgent necessity for individuals to re-gear themselves, or risk being left behind.Many resources have been devoted to this national effort helping Singaporeans consider what they should learn, not least through programmes like the SGUnited Jobs and Skills programme.Yet amid the flurry of discussion on this issue, have we missed out on an equally critical point: How Singaporeans should learn?LEARNING HOW TO LEARN MUST BE A FOCUSAt first glance, this seems strange.We were never taught how to learn in school, we were just taught what to learn and learnt it seemingly well by most measures. As a nation, we ace PISA scores and the sheer number of passes and straight As each exam season seem to gravitate upwards.But that’s the point. We were never really taught how to learn.At a time of massive disruption wrought by a pandemic, when we are being called on to learn new skills and master new disciplines with unprecedented urgency, not knowing how best to learn could hamper our efforts to re-gear ourselves.According to Institute for Adult Learning (IAL) researchers Chia Ying and Sheng Yee Zher who were involved in Singapore’s Skills and Learning Study in 2017: “Technologies for learning and learning to learn are important elements to enable lifelong learning, especially amongst seniors.”They also noted that “seniors with low education attainment have low learning to learn score”. This is disconcerting, as older workers have the highest risk of being left behind by disruptive changes and find themselves in long-term unemployment.While public discussion often involves “technologies for learning”, a cursory glance at the news and our daily lives suggests far less talk about “learning to learn”.While the IAL has in recent years incorporated “learning to learn” (and “technologies for learning”) into their lifelong learning framework, the intensity of the COVID-19 situation demands that much more be done to bring “learning to learn” into mainstream national discourse.In this regard, a recent comment by Nvidia’s Dr Simon See on how students have to learn how to learn given the rapid obsolescence of tech skills is a promising sign. However, more than just an enabler of learning or a strategy for students to confront technological change, we argue that learning to learn should represent the foundation on which lifelong learning policies must be developed, especially given COVID-19 disruptions.Far from being a headlong rush into something novel, this view echoes those of education and training researchers like Ian R Cornford, who had argued in a 2002 International Journal of Lifelong Education paper for the necessity of “learning-to-learn skills” in successful lifelong learning endeavours.This new foundation, we further argue, must be incorporated at three levels: Individual (our focus), workplace, and institutional.A CRASH COURSE IN BETTER LEARNINGThe fastest path to change lies within the individual. Before turning to institutions, individuals must seek out means to help themselves learn better which can be achieved in a few ways.First, focus on learning that makes connections and join the dots with what you already know.In How Learning Works: Seven Research-Based Principles for Smart Teaching, a book used and cited by many educators, the authors argue that a key distinguisher between experts and novices is “the number or density of connections among the concepts, facts, and skills they know”.Think back to all the “aha” moments you’ve had in life – some may have been the birth of new ideas, but more commonplace are the new connections you made between ideas.At the risk of over-simplifying neuroscience, making connections ties down new knowledge to the old, strengthening our entire mental structure of knowledge because we understand how vastly different issues might be related to each other and learn how to recognise and create new patterns and relationships of understanding.The next time you go for a new course, actively connect prior knowledge to new content, and you will get much more out of it.A second strategy focuses on getting to the core of novel concepts by asking “why?” or “so?”, and is interestingly well-illustrated by an example involving Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister, himself an avid lifelong learner.In The Big Ideas of Lee Kuan Yew, Heng Swee Keat, who is now Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister, wrote about his time as Mr Lee’s principal private secretary. He noted that Mr Lee’s favourite question was “so?”, one which forced Mr Heng to “drill to the core of the issue”.A similar question is “why?” In another IAL research project, Dr Bi Xiaofang and Mohamed Fadhil found that “why” questions were important for adult learners from the healthcare and information and communications technology sectors in making sense of new knowledge.A simple word can indeed help one go far.Third, have the right mindset to succeed at every goal. Recent research by Assistant Professor Patricia Chen, deputy director at NUS Institute for Applied Learning Sciences and Educational Technology (NUS ALSET), suggests going far as a learner ultimately relies on one’s attitude, especially in the face of challenges in learning new things.In a recent study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Prof Chen and her team found that students with a “strategic mindset” – who actively consider how they can adapt their strategies in the face of challenges – had a greater tendency to use metacognitive strategies that in turn helped them achieve their goals.Thus, the next time you face a learning difficulty, actively ask questions like “What are things I can do to help myself?”, or “Is there a better way of doing this?”Sustain this as a consistent habit, and you may achieve your learning goals more easily in the long run.BEYOND THE INDIVIDUALWhile individuals can benefit from a few learning strategies to learn how to learn better, sustained success in better learning for all Singaporeans will require continuous involvement by employers and educational institutions.Employers should consider sending their employees for learning strategies courses, and consider, for instance, rewarding employees who have made use of newly learnt skills effectively. Educational institutions can play an upstream role in preparing for the post-COVID-19 world, incorporating learning strategies into their curriculum.Before COVID-19, learning strategies might have been a good-to-have, a discussion we could put off for the future. However, the intensity of the current economic disruption means we can no longer wait.After all, as SM Tharman said in his ministerial broadcast, “the future begins now”.Fung Fun Man is an Instructor of Chemistry at the National University of Singapore and the principal lecturer of the course Learning to Learn Better and a recipient of the YSEALI Fellowship for Civic Engagement (2019).Ng Chia Wee is a third-year student at the National University of Singapore’s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences, and a teaching assistant for the Learning to Learn Better course. He is also part of Access, a social mobility non-profit organisation.Copyright© Mediacorp 2021. Mediacorp Pte Ltd.
