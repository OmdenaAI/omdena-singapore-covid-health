4,SGExams,24778,[A Levels] Suggested answers for Biology H2 Paper 1,e38ec3,Vouchful,1574995134,15,1,"

Proposed Answers for H2 Biology Paper 1 (2019) With explanations 

1) C 

Statement 1 is wrong as prokaryotes that are cells and are living yet do not contain compartments  
 Statement 2 is wrong as Virus contain DNA and are smaller but are acellular  
 Statement 3 is correct as Cell theory states that the smallest most basic unit of life is cells Statement 4 is correct as Cell theory states that All living beings are composed of one more cells making it the “building block” of life 

2) B 

A is wrong as there are fragments of membranes in the vesicle not enzymes  
 B is correct as ‘fragments of membrane’ suggest the digestive ability of hydrolytic enzymes and single membrane suggest lysosome  
 C is wrong as it doesn’t explain why red colour is lost.  
 D is wrong as what is in the membrane is other fragmented membranes not proteins 

3) B 

A is wrong as DNA is in the nucleus, not the cytoplasm  
 C and D are wrong because RNA polymerase is tagged and not ribosomes. This is a transcription process that occurs in the nucleus 

4) C 

1 is actually correct based on data. A theoretical explanation is that while the enzyme is unfolded, the shape of active site is maintained due to high disulfite bonds in that area and hence can still form ES complex and can benefit from higher effective collision due to higher temperatures 

2 is incorrect based on the data as a 15 degrees, percentage unfolding in 0% 3 is correct. Based on content knowledge 

5) C 

For curve X, the only possibility is increased substrate concentration as the product amount at the end increases compared to original curve. This would not be achieved with the other 3 options 

6) C 

A and D is wrong as Vmax is reached at high substrate concentration making it a competitive inhibitor 

B is wrong as arabinose has a similar structure but not the same structure as glucose. In addition, “fit temporarily” is a much better expression than ‘bind” to show conceptual understanding 

  

7) C 

 

A is wrong has no IPSC were used. IPSC originates from somatic cells, not embryo B and D are wrong as human embryonic stem cells are pluripotent 

8) B 

J is DNA polymerase as DNA ligase only appear on lagging strand K joins DNA fragments as it is DNA ligase  
 All options for H appear acceptable 

9) A  
 A is correct based on content knowledge (Glycoprotein different, antibodies from memory B cells in previous infection are unable to recognize)  
 B is wrong as antigenic drift will only affect within the species. Hence the Pigs will suffer from this change but not humans  
 C is wrong as in this context, virus unlikely to spread from birds to human (Dotted arrow)  
 D is wrong as all the glycoproteins will still be ‘human’ and the immune system can respond. Only when a foreign glycoprotein is added will it be highly dangerous 

10) A 

1 is correct as cytoplasmic bridge must form  
 2 is true as for F type bacteria, only F plasmid transferred. Only Hfr types are able to transfer some of the bacterial chromosome  
 3 is true has the non-F plasmid bacteria gains a F plasmid  
 4 is correct as it is the F plasmid that form Sex pilli 

11) C 

Inducer is Lactose  
 Promoter is DNA  
 Repressor is a protein coded by Lacl gene 

12) A  
 1 is correct as shown from the first statement  
 2 is correct as seen from how maternal RNA can have poly(A) tail added by the embryo 3 is correct as seen from third statement 

13) D  
 Content Question: Refer to lecture notes 

14) A 

1 is correct as P16 is turned off causing cancer due to its TSG function  
 2 is correct as the gene isn’t mutated, it is methylated which is the change of structure of DNA without changing its base sequence  
 3 is correct as methyl Groups are derived from the diet (See PKU disease for another example) 

  

15) C 

 

Metastasis causes the mobility of cells. Transformation is the ability to overcome contact inhibition 

16) D 

A and B is wrong as you cannot get 2 Y from an issue with the egg which only has X C is wrong as it would form sperms with XY causing XXY rather than XYY  
 D is correct as it allows creation of YY sperm 

17) A 

Dihybrid as there is 2 genes, linkage as both are on the same chromosome, epistatic as they are enzymes in a pathway. Does not have multiple alleles as each gene has only 2 alleles 

18) C 

Parental Genotype BbDd x Bbdd

Gametes (BD) (Bd) (bD) (bd) x (Bd)(bd) 

&amp;#x200B;

||BD|Bd|bD|bd|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Bd|BBDd|BBdd|BbDd|Bbdd|
|bd|BdDd|BBdd|bbDd|bbdd|

&amp;#x200B;

19) B 

You need the table no matter what, you also need expected ratio and the observed numbers. With this, you can work out the expected numbers and total number of offspring 

20) B 

1 is correct based on content  
 2 is correct due to presence of carotenoids  
 3 is incorrect as leaves reflect the middle of visible spectrum giving it green appearance (ROYGBIV) 

21) C 

Concentration of RuBP will be low as carbon fixation can occur to form PGA but no Reduced NADPH and ATP to convert PGA to TP. Hence Low TP and High PGA 

22) D 

A and B are wrong as elections don’t pass through ATP synthase but through cytochrome oxidase complex  
 C is wrong as protons move from thylakoid lumen into stroma  
 D is correct as proton move from intermembrane space to matrix 

23) B 

Q and R are ligand receptor  
 S and T involved in relay path  
 Cellular response is a change in gene expression as it targets DNA 

24) B 

A is wrong as it is the same tree, no meiosis  
 B is possible  
 C is wrong as it is on the same tree and likely faces the same environmental conditions D is wrong as the tree is an individual while natural selection works on populations 

25) D 

A is wrong is paraphrased it just means: Selection favors no change. Which isn’t true as there are still changes in phenotype when usual temperature was returned to  
 B is wrong as when weather was warm, beak size continue to rise  
 C is wrong wing length did decrease in cold weather 

D is correct as skeleton size could increase in usual temperature environments 26) D 

1 is speciation and not microevolution  
 2 may not work as you cannot use molecular homologies to show the selection pressure that was undergoing as for convergent evolution, genetically not homologous but faced similar selection pressures  
 3 is correct as humans can play a selection role (Artificial Selection)  
 4 is correct as speciation occur despite no geographical isolation 

27) C 

Injection 1 is likely a direct injection of antibodies as seen from immediate rise making it passive and not creating memory cells 

Injection 2 is a typical vaccine making it active and generates memory cells 

28) B 

Reduction in risk for immunodepressed people and newborn babies are true due to herd immunity  
 Eradication cannot occur unless it is a worldwide effort and not just in Singapore 

29) A 

1 is true as number of species fall  
 2 is true BUT not reflected in the graph as only altitude is stated (is not drawn directly) 3 is true from graph  
 4 is not true as from graph, number of species rise

When there's people going all the way to senoko industrial area to purchase disinfectant, you know things are getting ridiculous. We all should take extra precaution, practice good hygiene and exercise common sense during this period




Overnight in Asia, we hosted a call with Professor John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at The University of Hong Kong and expert on coronaviruses. He was a key member of the research team at The University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He has been studying coronaviruses for 25 years. Below are my notes transcribing the call. 

Quick summary: 

Look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it’s below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.
 
My notes from the call below:
 
Q&amp;A Session with Professor Nicholls:
 
What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official “confirmed” cases?
 
People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is &lt;1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons: 1) either China’s healthcare isn’t as good – that’s probably not the case, 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARS there’s probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There’s a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to SARS and MERS we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to SARS to MERS. So a correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold.
 
You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that?
 
There are two ways to detect a virus: 1) Through the genetic material – DNA or RNA or, 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors’ labs look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests they are using PCR which give you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there’s another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can’t turnaround in 5-10 mins which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases.
 
Your colleague at HKU estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb first we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past?
 
Those figures did not take into account restriction on travel, quarantine etc. These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically, these models have not been all that accurate.
 
When do you think this thing will peak?

Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit.
 
Sunlight will cut the virus ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 mins and in the dark it’s about 13 mins to 20 mins. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That’s why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infections rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing is still cold which is why there is high infection rates.
 
In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10 degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And high humidity the virus doesn’t like it either. That is why I think SARS stopped around May and June in 2003 – that’s when there’s more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavourable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold – it’s always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favourable in Asia in about May.
 
The second factor is that of personal contact. With SARS once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal oral route, there was much less emphasis on the masks, and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of the social hygiene (than China). So in those countries you should see less outbreaks and spreading. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open-  there’s more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries the sanitations systems tends to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May.
 
People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it’s all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials – is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say “I told you so”. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn’t come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It is Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus – the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people etc…
 
What do we know about the transmission rate? It’s been estimated around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic?
 
This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don’t have with this virus).
 
We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages at the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine to the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers.
 
Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the R0 of 2.5 or 2.7.  Do you think that is high or low. What does that mean?
 
Measles was about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it’s about 2.2 as it’s being transmitted within the community.
 
Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with SARS and MERS.
 
There’s talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don’t think there are any super spreaders.
 
What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic?
 
Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That’s based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days.
 
There’s a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shredding the virus and he was asymptomatic.
 
That’s something about kids and we saw this with SARS. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus which we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer.  SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn’t the virus killing the patients it was the body’s reaction.
 
We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer.
 
Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms or mortality rate?

SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity – try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc.. The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it’s those with the co-morbidity are most at risk. For the seasonal influenza that’s also what we find. It’s the people with the co-morbidity that have the increase mortality rate.  Having said that there’s a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30.
 
I think this looks more like the seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity.  Now that we have better case control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%.  When you look at all the death reports – separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China.
 
Mortality rate in China – is much higher? Why?
 
Its related to the environment. In the high income countries you don’t have as high a population density, higher level of environment control and hygiene. In Indonesia – it’s unlikely to spread much as it’s very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that’s unlikely – too hot there’s not a lot of travel there. Europe – possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher.
 
At this stage it’s a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the “lethal virus” but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don’t call that “the lethal influenza”.
 
There’s news reports that antivirals are being used and that it’s working what are your thoughts on that?
 
With SARS it didn’t seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seems to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it.
 
Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit.
 
The problem with the antivirals – because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so can now test it to see what will work and not work.
 
Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything?
What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals – it’s to take the work load off the staff which is likely exhausted.  
 
In HK with SARS we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the work load off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit.
 
The recovery rate now higher than the deaths rate? Thoughts on that?
What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn’t know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don’t get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge.
 
I’d consider a patient recovered if he’s been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid were very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn’t know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression.
 
I haven’t seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged.
 
Evidence of E-coli?
Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK.
 
What does it mean for a patient to have recovered?
That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That’s the criteria for Hong Kong. But there’s no good data or guidelines on this.
 
What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population?
If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don’t have a ”spell check” so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won’t mutate.  This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months.
 
Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. 
With SARS we didn’t know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn’t be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workload off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan.
 
If we look at the serious cases being reported it’s about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for the severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption?

In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that’s why it’s important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It’s very important to dissect it out.
 
Would it be too early to make conclusion outside of Wuhan? It’s still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making assumption with very little data and very early data?

That’s all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages – there’s such a variable. But now for political reason people are far more aware of the virus so it won’t be as epidemic as it was early on. There’s far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behaviour. Which I’m not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far less outside of Wuhan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f06uuc/clsa_conference_call_with_coronavirus_expert/,0.0,"['&gt; Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity.   \n\n""Really meh...""  \nTime to fit in more outdoor exercise in the next month or two.']"

I've been quietly following all the various narratives and threads of the Wuhan virus. The fear is palpable and understandable. I hope I can constructively contribute to the conversation, not by taking a stance or pushing an agenda, but by offering good, clear research and reliable data. Some might disagree, and that's fine.

*Why should you listen to me? Are you a health professional or a doctor?* No, I’m not. Let’s get that out of the way. However, I do have an advanced degree in political science, and I am well-trained in research methodologies and technical writing. While subject matter might change, scientific method does not. And that’s something all scientists have to learn. Yes. Even us fake, wanna-be social scientists. Currently, I am a security and political risk analyst for a major MNC covering this outbreak for my company. I am in constant consultation with our company’s health advisers and experts, which also informs some of what I’m writing below.

**On Masks**

By now, the pictures of endless queues and equally endless debates about the efficacy of masks are permeating Singapore. Some say it prevents infection, while others say it's more for the sick. What gives? There are a few factors to consider here.

* **Masks seem to offer the user at least some protection from infection...**

Not bad, right? Even a 5% reduction in chances of infection sounds good to me. This [meta-analysis](https://watermark.silverchair.com/cix681.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAlgwggJUBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJFMIICQQIBADCCAjoGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMGRo5uZQB0berZ2oSAgEQgIICC9SxIpnrOeQKSQ6lKWprgtENrg6nowrcSVD1mvNy4KMnEFCT8RUbremmwyvVX0sCdXHez5gcWus44_5ryHqLzjCrI6S2lXWwYULA_2_3JQlxPMM9-Z_ilWY5qmvtXYPIdcw-RgKJGu0seSICq_CvNYuzJrPEOoDFfDescNmshGLFRTKxgk3hycb32qMRlOA0TZBFBurSvtb8lVy0F3DU_A6wd_nmXkAkRijRZY_evQWLW_YTpf06mRb_YqGCYUJKjjpC-vooAhoinMMhUz93S9ZsZ9zVle_fNpLIxy4z2Lt5h24jK_5Y_siZzVPan81aLysuFR2M1RiLYgmSvNMFq-IAPU_bsmB3j4AjLPBfetzzgsGYLonERV87WtjOpkOYFh2unJwyQDrUjxkAFx-wMgmUYjqGhldIgpaNsm1wjADCkccJ0k4RbMJFiD8gMT1n0hj56NqPjAOvUX0WMNA054OzrzzMHtoQOZn9WW0o1xtRYhlT2pGOb712rz2_7GyyJ4bTNKa6YZ1-MKj0lQ8bDMlr5vFeIS4FY_Gsm_ahH-dG7M-vun912KBIKptfRNZwayxOnZGSv-d3drSLv60dMW1WiGsuRBhxZnzDQPLwhTRSGHJRY1ipqrCg2bIbO12jM4ag0xQTlEby1LnEy40oDNUgw8QU96gv_0T0u7zd9VRBlgOlZjnYE9ZytPo) of 6 randomized clinical trials and 23 observational studies concluded there is an observable benefit of limited protection from mask users. N95 provided better protection than medical masks (aka surgeon masks). However, researchers of this meta-analysis also found the multiple studies informing this conclusion had all kinds of limitations and errors like self-reporting, inconsistent use of masks across subjects, poor auditing, lack of control group, etc. Many of the studies were retrospective observational studies after SARS and other outbreaks and not tightly controlled clinical trials. 

Still, the evidence is encouraging.

* **...however, masks offer protection only under perfect use.**

What does this mean? All N95 and medical masks are not created equal. We all have different face shapes, nose and mouth sizes, jaw lines. There are endless brands of medical masks and N95s. Proper fit is critical to ensure protection. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23210700) observed 84 nursing students with no prior experience with or knowledge of N95 masks. They were split into groups. Some groups were received training on how to properly fit and use the masks, while other groups were not. The study found a statistically significant difference (aka probably not chance) in ambient air particles between the trained and untrained groups. This [study](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18980503) followed healthcare workers with no fit-test training for 14 months. Less than 50% of subjects formed an adequate seal. Even after proper training, a group of healthcare workers had to try different masks to ensure an adequate fit. Keep in mind these are nursing students and healthcare workers, and studies are *still* suggesting difficulty ensuring proper use. In other words, there's a very high probability that you, your loved ones, and all the people around you are not using masks properly.

So the way us normal peasants use it, it might not be so effective. That might be way many health authorities tell us not to bother with masks. You're going to be taking it off and fidgeting with it and leaving air holes all over the place to avoid that slimy layer of nasty, post-prawn mee breath saliva condensation on the lower half of our face. And this is true. I was walking around today at the airport and the use of masks were really... just anyhow.

* **Ah ha! So masks are BS, right? These mask people are paranoid and stupid, right???**

Okay, hang on, you darn ""I told you so"" crowd. Not so fast. Sure masks might not be so effective as limited protection. However, placebo effect is important. I'm not saying placebo effect will ward off 2019-nCoV in any way, no. But it does ward off something else destructive: fear. It wards off fear. You put on that mask, and there's that tiny ray of light piercing into the dark depths of anxiety and fear. Sweet relief. And the weird thing about placebo? It still works even if you know it's all just a sham. Always being fearful and worrying puts your body under a constant state of stress. This [meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1361287/) of 300 studies across 30 years show that stress does diminish our immune system’s ability to respond to diseases. Short bursts of stress -- we’re talking minutes -- triggers adrenaline and boosts our performance. Chronic stress over a long timeline will start to affect our immune system, and not in a good way. And last I checked, there was no expiration date on the Wuhan virus.

It’s important to understand there aren’t any magical, one-size-fits-all protection against this virus. It’s going to take a combination of proper use of masks, good hand washing habits, avoiding sick people, and a bit of luck. You can get the best fitted mask and wear it properly for 16 hours out of the day, but if you have crappy hand washing techniques, the moment you wipe your lips, pick your nose, or rub your eye, all those endless hours of discomfort and gross, hot breath will mean fuck all.

**So... to wrap up...**

Be patient. There are so many unknowns about this virus, and science is a painstakingly difficult process. One mistake and you’ve wasted time and millions of dollars on the wrong vaccine. Or you’ve overreacted and wrecked your economy with an overzealous policy. There are real consequences that may even be worse than this coronavirus can ever hope to do. 

If you’ve made it this far, thanks for staying with me. Whether you agree or disagree, let’s try to deal with this with a clear-headed, rational approach. If you have better arguments, studies, data, evidence, or questions, let’s share it below. I would love to be proven wrong so we can better inform the public with healthy discourse. And let’s keep animosity and hostility to a minimum.

I think pretty much everyone knows that there is actually more people infected with this WARS/Wuhan virus than said by our news outlet. So this is what people should know about it, in points of course. 


1) Currently there are more than 300 new cases per day or per week if I’m not mistaken &amp; a Vaccine for this sort of pathogen will take months if not years because this Virus is common amongst, you guess it right, animals. Yes it’s common amongst animals and animals itself until someone decided to eat a snake that was already infected with the said virus and hence mutated in his blood stream which then lead to the said signs which is fever, cough, flu and so forth. 



2) And why will a vaccine take such a long time to recreate? Simple. To recreate something that is not common or better yet, has never been encountered will be even harder because you never know if the vaccine that you have created will help to eliminate the said virus OR increased it’s mutation speed and hence spreading the virus even faster amongst people hence why it’ll take a while. 




3) so right now, Every country in the world is doing what they should do. Containment till further notice. To decrease the percentage of people being infected with the said virus. But there are also other fears that this virus can be spread amongst utensils and even hand rails and so forth hence why countries like the philiphines had 500 people from china inbound to their airport deported back immediately after landing to prevent the virus from infecting more people which leads to the next point. 




4) Countries like Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia &amp; any country that has been infected or has not yet been infected should close down flights to china &amp; divert flights that are inbound from china, back to where they came from. As to so minimize the spread of the virus in so that they virus is contained in one country and not multiple.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/eu398c/wars_virus/,0.0,['None of this is actual information people should know that will help to contain or prevent the spread of viruses.

4,singapore,229981,[Update] Antivax in Singapore,g4r2rr,unawhut,1587382046,59,1,"Hello! It is saya again. Remember this post? Well the celebrity has posted a clarification video (which I will provide a link for if you contact me privately). Since we apparently misinterpreted her previous stories (hence caused unnecessary tension), I will be doing a verbatim run-down of her main points. I will not include any of my own thoughts in this main post to limit skewed representation. 

1) “I did not mention that I am anti-vaccine. I mentioned actually pretty clearly that I preferred delayed vaccination for the betterment of my kids development.” 

2) “I admit I’m not a researcher nor am I a doctor. But, I am a mother who, after doing some research is just concerned over her kid’s well-being. But, I am a mother who, after doing some research, is just concerned over her kid’s well-being and this has led me to read up and ask more questions over the years with regards to vaccination from many reliable sources including health professionals.” ... “Since I became a mother, I have been reading on every aspect of healthy development concerning my children and I feel that every child is different, and I’m sure so is the mother who cares and nurtures them. So I do what I do is just and right for my children.”

3) “Allow me to make myself clear that I did not impose to anyone to not vaccinate their children, nor did I condemn any parent who vaccinated your babies at birth. I mentioned, to each his own, and I totally understand parents who send their kids to vaccination. I was also not trying to spread awareness on anti-vaccines, I was merely trying to have conversations with people who share the same thoughts as I do. In fact, I was also appreciative to talk those who did send their kids for vaccination and started to spark a conversation with me. I personally feel that this is a learning process and I was interested to listen to what others think about this”

4) “This is my platform and all I wanted to do was share sincere opinions.”

5) “I come from a family where natural or alternative healing is practiced. When I was sick a child, my parents would actually heal me through traditional healing, and having said that we do not disagree with orthodox medication. But we always try our best to not depend on it. So I grew up over the years experiencing this and witnessing how much it has actually benefitted me and my family. So after having my own kids, I felt that since the remedies worked really well on me, I perhaps could also practice the same on my own children. So I hope this gives you a better understanding of where I’m coming from.”

6) “I mentioned that I preferred delayed vaccination because I prefer to give my children to give them what nature has already provided them right after birth. I feel that everyone has their right to give their views on this, and as a mother I also have the right to decide what I feel is best for my children.”

It's also less embarrassing than the one our parents and grandparents had where they worried about their lanjiao shrinking due to swine flu. 

""The boy’s problem had started at school, where he’d heard rumors that tainted pork—inoculated against swine fever—could cause koro. Earlier that morning, he’d eaten a steamed bun with pork in it. When he went to urinate, he looked down and felt his penis start to shrink. “Frightened, he quickly grasped the organ and rushed to his parents shouting for help.”

More people followed. Before long the hospitals were flooded with patients. Pork sales plummeted. The Ministry of Primary Production announced that both swine fever and the vaccine were harmless to humans, but the epidemic seemed to accelerate. For seven days it continued, until finally the Singapore Medical Association and the Ministry of Health started appearing on television and radio to announce that suo yang was a purely psychological condition, and that no one had died from it. There was an immediate drop in the number of cases. By November, there were no reports at all.

In the end, a total of 469 cases were recorded, though the real number was certainly higher, since the survey only included Western hospitals and did not account for traditional Chinese doctors. All patients who were interviewed by doctors had heard stories about koro before they experienced it. After the epidemic, the Chinese Physician Association concluded that “the epidemic of Shook Yang was due to fear, rumor mongering, climatic conditions, and imbalance between heart and kidneys….” Meanwhile, a Western-oriented “Koro Study Team,” concluded that koro was “a panic syndrome linked with cultural indoctrination.”

17,singapore,237908,Singapore warns its economy could shrink by 7% due to coronavirus: Infection rate among migrant workers living in dormitories approaching 10% [*Financial Times*],gr8srv,bolusk1,1590537869,15,1,"Singapore faces its sharpest contraction since independence after the city-state warned that its economy could shrink by 7 per cent in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. 

After initially winning international praise for its efforts to control the spread of the virus, the number of cases in Singapore has soared.

The infection rate among the 323,000 migrant workers living in dormitories, who have driven the surge in coronavirus patients, is now approaching 10 per cent.

There are 32,343 cases in Singapore, one of the highest rates on a per capita basis in Asia. Dormitory residents account for more than 90 per cent of total infections. 

The virus is dragging down the economy. The Ministry of Trade and Industry said on Tuesday that it expected gross domestic product to fall between 4 per cent and 7 per cent in 2020. It had previously projected a contraction of between 1 per cent and 4 per cent. 

“The outlook for the Singapore economy has weakened further since March,” the MTI said.

“Notwithstanding the downgrade, there continues to be a significant degree of uncertainty over the length and severity of the Covid-19 outbreak, as well as the trajectory of the economic recovery, in both the global and Singapore economies.”

If GDP growth contracts by 5 per cent or more this year, it would mark the steepest fall since Singapore’s independence from Malaysia in 1965.

“It is almost certain that it’s going to be the worst [drop since independence], short of a miracle or a vaccine very soon,” said Chua Hak Bin, senior economist at Maybank.

Heng Swee Keat, the finance minister, on Tuesday announced a fourth support package of S$33bn (US$23bn) involving relief measures for businesses and households after Singapore’s small, open economy was buffeted by a lockdown. The country’s four support packages total almost S$100bn, or nearly 20 per cent of GDP. 

Sectors including construction — which relies heavily on migrant workers — transportation, wholesale and retail trade all shrank in the first quarter of the year. The accommodation and food services sector contracted by an annualised 69.9 per cent from the previous three months, its biggest fall on record.

“Singapore does not have a domestic tourism market,” said Mr Chua. “Ultimately any kind of lift-off, especially for hospitality and aviation, will require a relaxation of border controls which is the most difficult part of this exit from lockdown.”

But Mr Chua added that the expansion in biomedical manufacturing, finance and insurance in the first quarter suggested that those sectors could help offset the “negative hit” from the shutdown.

Singapore will gradually reopen schools and select businesses on Tuesday. Companies in sectors such as finance, insurance and logistics that meet safety requirements may reopen next month, while businesses including retail shops or entertainment venues will remain closed for at least another four weeks.

But it doesn’t mean we should all treat it lightly.",gpmi3o,FrozenHonors,1590310863,46,1,"I see a lot of recent comments on posts saying that we shouldn’t be alarmist, that it’s okay and not a big deal to get covid “because most of our cases aren’t even that serious, they aren’t hooked up to ICU ventilators and most of them can’t even tell they have covid in the first place.”

As a medical student I’ve done readings on research regarding covid and I can tell you this: people do not recover from covid without suffering permanent damage. There will be reduced lung capacity, and injury to the lungs. It’s like smokers: they look fine on the outside, but if you test their tidal capacity etc you will notice a lot of pathology and damage. You won’t recover and become healthy again. So let’s not pretend we can all get covid just because we are young and healthy. Yes, we won’t die. But no, it’s not good to get covid at all cuz it’s permanent damage.

So many people are demanding we end this circuit breaker, that we RESUME NORMALCY. But let me tell you this: there will NEVER be “normalcy” again. If covid becomes endemic, and we don’t have a vaccine, we will be in “heightened mode” for the rest of our lives. There may not be quarantine at home, but we will have to maintain social distancing and work from home where possible. Unless of course, you want to sacrifice yourself and get covid for the sake of proving a point.

Covid MUTATES. Like the seasonal flu. Meaning you can get it a second time even if you previously recovered from it the first time. Vaccines won’t be a foolproof method because we need to update vaccines to match the mutation rate (think of online games, you need to keep patching the game to keep up with updates).

The Government plans to announce a scheme to help fresh graduates get into new jobs or some internship or training opportunities, Mr Chan said.\n\n&gt; However, he said the labour market remains a concern for Singapore and the global economy in coming months, with major ramifications.\n\n&gt; “What started out as a health crisis has now gone on to an employment and business closure issue,” he said. “If these two issues are not handled well”, it could lead to a rise in protectionist measures, possible contagion effects and more pain in financial markets.\n\n&gt; It’s “too early to say if the worst is over for the global economy” as infection rates are rising again in some places where they previously were under control, Mr Chan said.\n\n&gt; Related Story DPM Heng to deliver ministerial statement on Covid-19 support measures on May 26\n\n&gt; Related Story Coronavirus cases in Singapore: What we know so far\n\n&gt; REOPENING\n\n&gt; Given that infected people may not show symptoms, a rapid test kit would aid in resuming international travel and many other activities, Mr Chan said.

Sectors like manufacturing, finance, insurance and wholesale trade will be able to restart more operations.\n\n&gt; Mr Chan said the authorities are looking at establishing travel corridors with other countries, such as China, Australia, New Zealand and South Korea, once they’ve settled on shared protocols.\n\n&gt; He also warned against countries resorting to trade protectionist measures and competitive currency devaluations as they try to revive their economies.\n\n&gt; The Government is set to release final first-quarter GDP figures on May 26 and may revise its current projection that the economy will contract 1 per cent to 4 per cent this year.

21,singapore,235057,COVID highlights the importance of STEM education.,gij4jy,riemannintegrable,1589313721,7,1,"I’m always a believer in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and math) education. I think Singaporean’s response to the COVID situation highlight the importance of STEM education. 

By STEM education, I don’t mean the hard facts about biology to understand the virus or differential calculus to know about the rate which it spreads. I think we need to put a real emphasis on:

1: The scientific method \
2: The process of research and clinical trials \
3: Reading statistics

**The scientific method**

By far the common response to articles announcing new findings by researchers goes something like this: “See, we all know long ago alr, last month we see [phenomenon X] and [phenomenon Y], sure link one! Why are these scientists take so long”

People need to understand that correlation *can, but not necessarily* imply causation. Moreover, researchers need time to gather the raw data, analyse them, and establish the statistical significance between the two. You can’t just have a pen and a pineapple and uh into pen-pineapple-apple-pen. That’s not how it works. The process of gathering these massive amount of data and establishing statistical link is also painfully long and they have to be careful of how they infer the data. 

Using a recent example, I’ve seen many talking about COVID-induced heart complications and why they aren’t counted. Yes we’ve seen a rise in heart complications and researchers are *currently working* on finding the link, you can’t just come to a conclusion that COVID cause heart attack as an outsider without access to those data.

(The point of whether to count them into the death toll is a matter of approaching death toll count and it’s not something I wish to discuss here)

And one key point we absolutely have to note is the rejection of null hypothesis. Scientist can not prove anything. They can only say that the hypothesis is significant to the data. [I’ll let the expert explain](https://youtu.be/bf3egy7TQ2Q)


**Process of research**

*Your anecdotal data isn’t proof of anything.* you need to trust the experts. As someone who went to what people regard as “elite school” and being able to work alongside actual researchers (not medical but you get the idea) under some of the junior programmes offered, I can tell you that their work looks like freaking alien stuff to me. And if you are not exposed to the research field at all, you literally know zero shit about their work. Not saying all research work is reliable but with time and peer reviewing, they usually present a more or less consistent recommendation for the public. Listen to them.

Another point to bring up is people bitching about vaccines taking forever. They need to understand the different phases and the significance of double blind trails. Developing a medication it’s not just feeding someone some chemical, see then recover and be like “he ate my medicine, he recover, therefore my medicine works”. The process to show that your vaccine or medication is safe for consumption and is effecting as a treatment is painfully long, and people need to realise that. 


**Reading Statistics**

Daily infection rates is not the be all and end all. It’s about looking at trends and looking at the context behind those numbers. It’s also important to know what information exactly you are reading from the media. It’s really worrying when people show me curves flattening and say xxx country is doing well on a LOGARITHMIC GRAPH. 

The numbers don’t lie, it’s either the people manipulate the way they present the number to try to cheat you, or you dum dum anyhow interpret to straight up don’t know how to read charts and graphs.

This [article](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2550-z) from Singapore research is far more useful.

There are 3 major arms to viral immunity - innate, humoral (ie antibody) and cell-mediated immunity.  The innate immunity defends you until adaptive immunity (latter two) kicks in.

We already know now that antibody immunity to a natural infection fades fast.  This will be bad news for the Sinovac vaccine which will only spur the antibody response.  **Unless the body responds differently to vaccination than a natural infection**, that inactivated virus vaccine will only provide a brief protection.  Singapore invested in [Novavax](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphar.2020.00937/full) whose vaccine candidate can be expected to have the same limitations.

That leaves a number of other vaccines that should generate both humoral and cell-mediated responses.  The Oxford and CanSino vaccines are based on engineered viruses.  The Moderna and Imperial College ones are actually adapted gene therapy vehicles.  Singapore also [invested](https://uk.reuters.com/article/us-biontech-placement/temasek-led-investor-group-in-250-million-vaccine-bet-on-germanys-biontech-idUKKBN2400PS) into [BioNTech](http://www.pmlive.com/pharma_news/us_trials_of_pfizerbiontech_coronavirus_vaccine_start_1339865)'s candidate which falls in this category.  All target the S protein.

What the Singapore work shows is that the earlier SARS outbreak established very long-lasting immunity against SARS that also covers SARS-2.  That also included CD8+ T-cells that play a key role in killing infected cells.  As SARS-2 as similar to SARS, there is reasonable hope that these other new vaccines could also elicit long-term immunity.  However, they did not study the S protein that those other vaccines are based on so we don't actually know if long-term T-cell immunity can be generated against that.  It will be a ""game over"" downer for all candidates if it can't.  Couldn't at least one effort have selected the NP protein instead?  Groupthink.

They also show that even some uninfected people have cell-mediated immunity against SARS-2.  This may have arisen from infections by other unknown coronaviruses.

So SG has two tickets in the vaccine lottery.  I think one is more likely to be a bust.  Better pray the other is strikes gold.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsv9yx/singapore_research_sarscov2specific_t_cell/,1.0,['Thanks for the info! Much appreciated!']

A successful vaccine could be a turning point for Cambridge, Massachusetts-based Moderna, which has never had a licensed product.\n\n&gt; In June, Moderna said it selected the 100-microgram dose for its late-stage study to minimise adverse reactions.\n\n&gt; At that dose, Moderna said the company is on track to deliver about 500 million doses per year, and possibly up to 1 billion doses per year, starting in 2021, from the company\'s internal US manufacturing site and strategic collaboration with Swiss drugmaker Lonza.\n\n&gt; ""It\'s a good first step,"" said Dr William Schaffner, a vaccine expert at Vanderbilt University Medical Center who was not involved in the study.\n\n&gt; ""There\'s nothing here that would inhibit one from going ahead to the Phase 2/Phase 3 trials,"" he said.

While waiting for their turn, they will be asked to fill in their personal particulars, medical information and declaration and consent on the vaccine screening form, said NCID in a fact sheet.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Before the vaccine is administered, the vaccinator will ask the staff member a series of questions related to vaccine eligibility, for the second part of the vaccine screening form.\n\n&gt; If they can take the vaccine, the vaccinator will prepare the vaccine and administer it intramuscularly into the staff member’s arm. After receiving the vaccine, staff members will receive a vaccination card and be observed for 30 minutes on site, to ensure that they have “tolerated the vaccine well”, said NCID in the fact sheet.\n\n&gt; The remaining NCID staff will be progressively vaccinated, alongside National Healthcare Group management and staff from January, the fact sheet read.\n\n&gt; Wednesday’s vaccination exercise comes after the Government accepted all the recommendations of the Expert Committee on COVID-19 Vaccination on Dec 27.\n\n&gt; A healthcare worker at National Centre for Infectious Diseases prepares to administer one of the first doses of the COVID-19 vaccine in Singapore on Dec 30, 2020.\n\n&gt; Public healthcare institutions – including acute hospitals, community hospitals and polyclinics – as well as private hospitals, will progressively arrange for staff members to be vaccinated within their respective premises, said the Ministry of Health (MOH).\n\n&gt; The health ministry also aims to start vaccinating the elderly, beginning with those aged 70 and above, from February next year.\n\n&gt; After that, other Singaporeans and long-term residents who are medically eligible will be vaccinated, MOH said. The vaccine is free for all Singaporeans and long-term residents, including long-term work permit holders.\n\n&gt; As outlined in the committee’s full recommendation to the Government, the “ultimate goal” of Singapore’s vaccination strategy against COVID-19 is to achieve as high a level of population coverage as possible.\n\n&gt; The committee had said this approach protects the maximum number of individuals possible, and will markedly reduce the overall proportion of people susceptible to the disease and the likelihood of uncontrolled chains of transmission in the community.\n\n&gt; “A high vaccination coverage in the population also indirectly protects others who may not be suitable for vaccination yet. When vaccines become more widely available, everyone residing in Singapore who is medically eligible for vaccination should be vaccinated, although vaccination should remain voluntary,” the committee said.\n\n&gt; Singapore began its COVID-19 vaccination exercise on Dec 30, 2020, with healthcare workers at the National Centre for Infectious Diseases the first to get the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.\n\n&gt; The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is currently not recommended for pregnant women, those under the age of 16 and immunocompromised individuals.\n\n&gt; The first shipment of the vaccine arrived in Singapore on Dec 21, making Singapore the first country in Asia to obtain it.\n\n&gt; Other vaccines are also expected to arrive in Singapore in the coming months, and the country “will have enough vaccines for everyone” by the third quarter of next year if all goes according to plan, Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong had said in his televised address to the nation on Dec 14.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\u200b\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

These include websites such as her ministry\'s HealthHub, the World Health Organisation (WHO), the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, and the European Medicines Agency. The vaccine is recommended by the WHO and other leading health agencies for the prevention of cervical cancer.\n\n&gt; Dr Khor added: ""Of course, parents ought to... speak to the doctors who will be best placed to give them advice and provide accurate information.""\n\n&gt; Mr Yam also said some parents have raised concerns that the HPV vaccine may lead to promiscuous behaviour.\n\n&gt; The vaccine is typically recommended for women who have not yet had sex, as sexually active women may have been exposed to virus strains targeted by the vaccine.\n\n&gt; Dr Khor said there is no evidence that women who have got the vaccine started having sex earlier or have more partners than women who have not been vaccinated.\n\n&gt; She said her ministry and the Health Promotion Board will continue to highlight the benefits, importance and safety of the vaccination to parents and students.\n\n---\n0.8.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Polio vaccine required?,dopbox,jasonrodriguez_DT,1572353389,6,0,"I checked a couple of sites including your Ministry of Health and I couldn’t find any relevant/recent information. However, there’s a bit of talk in the news here in the Philippines that SG might be requiring Filipino tourists to get a polio vaccine certificate before traveling.

I can’t confirm that 100% because I couldn’t find any actual advisory from SG-based sites.

Note: I’m vaccinated already, same goes for the rest of my family. But, that was way back when we were all kids. Also, the Philippines has been polio-free for almost a couple of decades until a couple of recent cases from the provinces popped up recently.

Note 2: Our Department of Health here in the Philippines notes that travelers leaving the country should get a dose of the Inactivated Polio Vaccine (IPV) and a certificate [*only if required by the country they’re traveling to*](https://www.doh.gov.ph/advisories/Polio-Vaccination-for-Travelers-coming-to-the-Philippines).

I'm just an NSF and they demanded I pay upfront for some package(didn't help that the one who recommended it to me reassured me that it would be worth it) and I stupidly did it. Only a few hours after am I realising that this is all a huge MLM scam (after reading online). On hindsight I should have researched during the meeting but oh well...

  


Question now is what can I do to prevent further losses?

I have already messaged my ""friend"" to get a refund but he sent me a stupid [ICS Vaccine Memo](https://vgy.me/TtG0sS.jpg) which confirmed my suspicions.( I had doubts put aside as this ""friend"" was from RI and seemed too intelligent to fall for such a trap)Now I'm left regretting my life decisions and feeling like a complete idiot.

0,NationalServiceSG,3589,Questions from a soon to be enlistee,hpr5uw,TheBrilliantBriton,1594543119,15,1,"I'm enlisting in about a weeks time (20th) and I have a few questions, sorry for the length and rambling. 

1. When do you find out who your superiors or ""coy"" mates will be? Remembered a post saying they didn't get a call from their commander? Before enlistment, do they contact us? Are we supposed to be added to a group chat or something? 
(update) going in in about a weeks time and no sign of contact yet. I am freaking tf out because recently I have been bombarded with spam calls and one day I was in the middle of something and I got a call. For maybe the first time in my life I hung up on a call before picking up. I later realised and am now kicking myself because what if I just hung up on my commander before even meeting him and now am missing out on information that could answer my questions and basically told him to f off. Help? 

2. What is the policy on phones in BMT? Saw a post about someone wanting to get their camera removed? Is this required to use it in camp?

3. Pre BMT starts from the ""very bottom"" right? Can do situps and pushups ok but not that many haha.

4. I know boxer briefs are a no go but any restriction on the colour of briefs?

5. Are still allowed to bring families with us when checking in? (COVID restrictions?)

6. I got an enlistment letter for April, but I was still in school so I deferred, I got a new letter and packing list but without the list of items issued to us, can I assume we are getting the same things?

7. How do phone searches work? Does everyone get searched or is it like random/suspicion based? Also what do they search? Saw a post about them looking at messages to friends and stuff.

8. Washing powder or liquid detergent, what do you think?

9. Is MMR vaccine required/how recent should it be?

10. The civilian clothes on the packing list can be casual right? The formal stuff we wear on the enlistment day right?

11. Someone recommended a USB fan for the bunks, do you reccomend?

12. I saw a post on power banks, its a limit on the mAh capacity of the power bank and we can bring as many as we want right?
