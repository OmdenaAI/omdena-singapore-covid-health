0,silverraptures,fr7euj,what is rational and what is paranoia in these times?,2020-03-29 23:17:02,singapore,378640,41,108,"I’ve been feeling outraged at people who treat healthcare worker in a discriminatory way. I felt angry at British landlords evicting NHS workers, or people refusing to sell food to ambulance drivers, etc. Today I felt this sense of righteousness dissipated when faced with threat (real or perceived) of getting COVID.  

This morning, I took a cab where the cab driver told me he had to pick up a minimum no. of clients per day to cover rent. so I felt sorry for him and asked him about how business was - he shared about how he needs the income as he has a son who’s graduated for a year but still unable to find employment, and he’s trying to make money etc. 

At the same time, I noticed he spoke with a very hoarse throat and was coughing. He wasn’t wearing a mask - but that didn’t bother me right away because long driving shifts are uncomfortable. 

A few minutes later, he told me his daughter works in NUH, and that her ward handles 34 COVID patients. rationally, I understood that everyone has their livelihoods to attend to or keep. However, behind this polite conversation, I was panicking and worried about potentially picking the virus up (and passing it on to others, especially my parents). Was intending to wear my mask when I boarded the cab, and felt it was too impolite to put it on after he mentioned his daughter works in NUH, and that she lives with him. 

Nonetheless, I waited for the journey to come to an end and alighted. I rationalised to myself: healthcare workers tend to be the *safest* - because they take extra precautions to be sanitised etc so they will not pose more risks to their patients. And with that, I tried to take my mind off it. Not trying to be a hypochondriac, but right now, my throat and nose feels very warm and heaty - and I hope all the cooling remedies will save me. 

I feel like every decision is somewhat morally ambiguous - should I have taken public transport? should the cab driver have worn a mask? And in this time of uncertainty, I think we tend to see everything through the lens of self-interest, anxiety and suspicion. Every intention can be reduced to “irrational” and “selfish”. While I was not part of the extreme toilet paper hoarding or unethical upselling of masks crowd - I, too, could not nitpick most actions of many. But anyway don’t worry, gonna self-isolate for the next few weeks to be safe...(and only take public transport after that)

EDIT: thank you redditors for your advice and tips; tldr post was about how there is no true objectivity or moral authority *per se* and as flawed as our actions may be on hindsight. we may react slower purely because of habits or patterns of socialisation etc.? i think as long as something is not done out of wilful negligence or against clear advice, please be charitable to the human beings making their trade-offs or decisions everyday",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fr7euj/what_is_rational_and_what_is_paranoia_in_these/,"['Just wear a mask yourself, follow proper sanitation process ie soap washing, and potentially wiping down some surfaces that could be affected (wallet etc).

Feeling impolite or paiseh is irrational.\n\nIt's not wrong per se, but you can choose to learn from this. One way is to think about how would you have done it differently. Not necessarily just one way but multiple ways: maybe wear the mask before boarding, say excuse me before you put on the mask, or just DGAF and put it on.\n\nThen keep this awareness with you and when a similar situation arises, do it the way you would have done it."", 'You can ask to have the windows rolled down', ""Since this is after the fact, nothing much you can do except to do what's recommended:\n\n1. Stay home as much as possible\n2. Wear a mask to protect yourself and others\n3. Don't think too much. \n\nYou don't have to care what other people think of you and your mask. \n\nNo need to value other people's opinion over your opinion of yourself."", 'I actually had this discussion with a friend and it boils down to this. When we say we’re being rational, it means we’re acting in a manner that mitigates risk instead of eliminates risk. This means you pretty much go about with your daily life while taking extra measures to be considerate and careful. Paranoia by definition is when there is a Low risk of infection but you still act in a manner that eliminates it completely anyway (staying at home, isolating). There is a stigma against acting irrationally/ with paranoia but in times like this, I argue that it’s better to be paranoid (to the best of your ability of course), than having to consider what is rational or not. \n\nAssume every person in the country runs on the rational mindset of reducing risk instead of completely eliminating risk. This means that for people, life still mostly goes on as usual. We go out, take public transport, go out and eat, go to small private gatherings as stipulated by the government. If we look at risk of infection based on the number of cases (which is honestly not the greatest measure of risk) we’re looking at a 0.015% chance of getting the virus. The average rational individual would recognise that their chances of getting the virus is actually pretty Low. However, if everyone in the populace thinks like that, then statistically there’s bound to be a bunch of people who keep this in mind, but still get the virus anyway. The problem then lies in the fact that the virus can spread at an exponential rate, and a new cluster would mean a large new number of cases in Singapore. This is especially the case in a country like Singapore where we are especially interconnected and have a high population density. The Singapore government has done an admirable job in containing the spread of cases. However, it takes just one person to slip through their stringent checks and measures, and it could trigger a whole new cluster of cases. I would argue that that is why governments around the world have been enforcing city wide lockdowns - it’s not intuitive for humans to think irrationally (Low risk, yet using a lot of effort to eliminate this risk anyway) - but the mindset of paranoia is needed collectively to eliminate the spread of the virus. I think the SG Govt hasn’t done so because it’s still manageable for them, and they need to drag this for as Long as possible so as to maintain the integrity of our economy for as Long as possible, but it doesn’t hurt if individuals adopt a more “paranoid mindset” and try to eliminate the risk of getting the virus completely. (I have no counter for public transport etc all I can say is that if you can stay home and have no strong reason to head out then stay home)\n\nNow I see how this could apply to panic buying but well, be paranoid but also recognise that this paranoia is in service to not just yourself but the people and society around you. Act in a manner that is empathetic and considerate, and I’m sure we’ll be just fine.', ""I heard that some of this year's graduating med students who are being asked to start their HO early are planning to rent places outside so as not to expose their family.\n\nSo no, while healthcare workers take extra precautions, they would also tell you to do likewise to protect yourself, regardless of any perceived embarrassment."", ""I don't intend to scare you but I think many people might have this virus already but it's just gone undetected. Maintaining hygiene and taking care of immunity is the key. Drink lots of water, get enough sleep, eat food good for immunity, wash hands regularly, cut nails regularly, use more soap in shower and so on. \n\nHaving a good immunity can buy time for the virus to wait and die eventually even one already has the virus. Of course, it would be the right thing to see a doctor being unwell with high fever or flu."", 'He should have worn a mask or not drive for the day', ""I have not taken a cab for a while.

4,xinjiaporen,eugb8t,Have you noticed the paranoia from some Singaporeans with regards to the Wuhan outbreak? What can I do about it?,2020-01-27 09:04:07,singapore,378640,26,0,"Obviously I have. This behaviour stems from that one or two uncles/aunties that tend to spread rubbish on family WhatsApp groups.

Some of the crazy things suggested by said aunty/uncle:

* Scold mainlanders or call police/ambulance if they cough without covering up their mouths. Someone added on saying they would spray their face with disinfectant.
* Don't buy food from stalls that are worked on by mainlanders, since they may have Wuhan virus. Don't use food delivery services, because you need to ensure that the chefs are not mainlanders.
* Refuse face-to-face interaction with mainlanders at work and ask boss for alternative arrangements (e.g. work from home).

and so on and so forth. You get the gist, it's always ""Don't do X with mainlanders"" or ""Do X to mainlanders to prevent spread of Wuhan"". It's like as though they are the manifestation of the virus itself.

They also suggested that government should deport all mainlanders till it dies down and stop the flow of mainlanders to Singapore.

I feel this is a little hypocritical, borderline xenophobic and best of all, too kiasi that you end up having a mundane, boring, crippling life. Not to mention, our older generations also don't practice good hygeine (like ""hack, p-tui"" into drains and sinks, which is gross).

I am also angry at those who started this outbreak, namely those buying/selling live animals at the market and the government officials for covering up, but I don't see how labeling everyone from China as ""snake/dog eaters"" is doing us any good and avoiding all of them to get that increase in survival chance is borderline paranoid.

Also, they have gone through SARS and they know what it's like unlike OP who thinks this is overreaction. \n\nSingaporeans, especially the young are extremely complacent in the face of this global threat.

8,Proper_1869,gk3pzm,[Uni] Rejected by all universities. And this is how I felt. what about you?,2020-05-15 14:15:09,SGExams,77661,91,411,"I will never forget this stage of my life. A period of constant paranoia that was fueled by the immense helplessness. For a prolonged period, I would click on my Gmail icon every morning, hoping to receive a response to my university applications. To no avail, my inbox was always empty though there were times when junk mails or Zalora would get my hopes up until I saw the sender. At this stage, there were moments when I felt angry at the admissions for giving me such a torturous suspension. The waiting period was unbearable, it was like an unreachable itch at the back of my mind and it would creep up on me whenever I was isolated or not doing anything. At that time, I just wanted everything to have a result, I just wish they would end my misery by cutting me loss. Thoughts like “just reject me already please” ran through my mind all the time,  I felt like a war warrior who just wanted to quickly get shot at the battlefield to ease the suspension.

Little did I know that suspension was way better than the reality, there was hope, at least. On the 14th of May 2020, 10 days before the first acceptance window deadline, I learnt that many of my friends had gotten their offers at the top three universities. And that skyrocketed my hope because I thought I might have a chance since I scored similar rank points as them. That night, I turned on my laptop and went on to the official student portal excitedly, hoping that I could share a similar fate as my friends. However, the results were not in my favour. I was bluntly rejected by NUS, SIT and SUTD, all the universities that I had applied to basically. That was when I started to appreciate the torturous suspension I had a few seconds ago and I realised my preparation for this undesirable outcome was merely a paper-thin bulletproof vest that could not defend the nuclear-like reality. The reality was much harsher than I expected. Looking at the glowing “Rejected” my mind went blank, my vision blurred, darkened and I spaced out.

Shock, sadness, disappointment, helplessness and shame, all of them colluded, turned into an iron fist and punched me hard right at my windpipe. To be honest, never have I ever imagined that was how breathtaking feels like. Not only was I unable to inhale at the point, but I was also overwhelmed by the immense sensation of pain. It was not a quick stab kind of a pain but rather a slow burn. It felt like a skilled butcher with a blunt blade, aimed at my chest, penetrated through my skin, my flesh, my bones and added a twist when it reached my heart.

A friend of mine asked if I was ok, I replied yes. “Yes”, just seemed to be the best candidate to describe this emotional turmoil. God knows how long had I spent looking at my ceiling before falling asleep but what else could I have done? Crying? Screaming? Leaping off a bridge? Nah. It was a moment of chaotic nothingness, I did not know what to do or where to go. My mind was just blank, blank, blank.

How now brown cow?

How now?",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gk3pzm/uni_rejected_by_all_universities_and_this_is_how/,"[""Well written. You should probably save some energy and spent it on your personal statement for an appeal. If your appeal has such caliber, maybe you might stand a chance. That feeling of suspense doesn't end here. You will feel it when you receive your uni results every sem, applying for hundreds of internship and get rejected by all, confessing your true love to a friend, applying for full time jobs, etc. Better start embracing it.."", 'I can kinda relate to this, i was rejected from my dream course to NTU, NUS and SMU back in 2017. \n\nI was working part time at an ice cream shop while waiting for my enlistment and I still remember when I whipped out my phone just to refresh my email one more time. It was already May and I still haven’t received even an interview from any university so I was pretty desperate. \n\nWhen I saw the email “admission outcome could be found here” I too felt the thrill, the adrenaline rush that comes with opening a document that decides the fate of the rest of my life. But the moment I saw the beginning of the email “thank you for applying to...” I knew I was rejected. I still remember slumping onto the cashier station, customers were still coming in but I was so shocked I couldn’t react to them. My supervisor asked if I was okay and I also said “yes”, I didn’t know what else to say. \n\nFrom then on I went into a short stint of depression as I saw all my other friends get into the uni courses of their choices. It became worse when I was in the army, I was rejected by SUSS during BMT which totally tore me apart. Not to disparage SUSS but it was my last ditch effort in getting into a local U. I felt totally helpless too, stuck in the army with no foreseeable future after ORD. \n\nBut i think the end of the story doesn’t have to be bad. Maybe private uni allows you to take a step towards your dream career? Or if possible overseas uni can do the same! Maybe taking the private A levels and reapplying would help! \n\nThere are still many other paths to what you want to do in the future. Yes they may be unorthodox or more convoluted but I think if they still help you reach your goal then no shame no regret. \n\nAll the best OP! I really can relate to what you’re feeling!', 'off-topic, but you write well.', ""OH my! Your writing was impressive!! Don't worry I know its the adrenaline that gives us the negative burst of energy when we encounter bad stuff happen to us :( \n\nNow, its important to consider few things!! I believe since you have just applied to NUS, SIT & SUTD you do have a course in mind you want to aim for, that I believe is not available/not good enough for you at NTU/SUSS/SMU? \n\nIf your rank points are low, then you might want to take the poly route? 2 years of poly get the diploma and considering you may do well at poly, you can even go on to get a degree from one of the local universities at a discounted number of years too!! **(2 yrs of poly + 2.5/3 years of uni = diploma+degree is better than 4 years = degree if you compare with your friends that are already matriculating)** :) cheer up man!! There are multiple routes to success!!\n\nIf your rank points are high/decent enough, then maybe take a gap year? Perform an internship? Re-evaluate your choices of courses at uni? You could do so much more that way and I believe you could still excel that way!!  \n\n\n**IN THE END, TO SUMMARIZE NEVER EVER GIVE UP ALREADY!! I WAS REJECTED BY MY PASSIONATE FACULTY FOR 2 YEARS, THIRD TRY I GOT IN!! :) SO HAVE HIGH HOPES ON YOURSELF AND DONT UNDERESTIMATE YOUR ABILITY!!!**"", 'Wow u write very well! i think u can try to appeal and stand a great chance. also can consider other routes like private uni/polytechnic!\ni hope u feel better soon and all the best! everything will work out one way or another :)', 'hey OP, I can understand how you feel because that was me in 2019. Did my appeals and was still rejected so I had to take a gap year. In the beginning, I was upset and my confidence had taken a hit. Each time you see your cohort mates start their uni life and all the y1 orientation story updates, it\'s like someone is stabbing a knife onto an already open wound. After some time, I didn\'t even bother with social media anymore because it sucks and hurts every time I see people post about uni life. It\'s like a physical reminder of ""you are not as good as they are. you can\'t be as accomplished as them."", which is complete bullshit by the way, if you have thoughts like that. People who haven\'t been rejected don\'t understand how it feels like and back then, all my friends either went to uni or are still studying, so only a handful could relate.\n\nThe only thing then that we can do is to mope, be sad, force ourselves to accept it and make use of the gap year wisely to supplement our working experiences and resume so that we are better equipped to face the uni application competition next year.\n\nIt\'s a bitter reality but over time (like idk after ?? how long; my self-confidence rn has only barely recovered so hey its ok to take ur time), you accept the harsh truth and you learn to embrace what you have now. In this one year, I did a marketing job for 2 months before I called it quits cause I realised marketing and sales ain\'t my cuppa tea. I also took up a python course in tandem. Then I went on to do accounts after a short break and I\'m here now. Y\'know what\'s the good thing about that? You get an extra year of working experience which = an extra year of having to act like you\'re Somebody and damn right son you better give me that job because I am qualified and you know it. An extra year of work politics and understanding the nuances of the working populace. You learn about yourself and how to sell YOU. That\'s the advantage you have on like 90% of the cohort when you get into university, which I believe you can. C\'mon, you write so well!\n\nAnyway, I figured out the industry I wanted to go into, which helped me out in knowing the right courses I want to apply for. So now that I think back on it, yes I\'m still bitter about being rejected (there was a whole drama) from the Big 3 last year, but I don\'t hate what I\'ve learnt in this gap year.  There was a lot of personal growth cause I had to battle a lot of things with me - self-confidence, laziness, friendships, etc. So, I\'m telling you that it\'s alright to be rejected and I\'m not saying it on a superficial level. Been there and done that. I still haven\'t received my application results from SMU or the other 2 (SMU is the one I really wanted) but I got an offer from SUSS and SIT, which is fine too.\n\nIt\'s okay to be lost cause everyone is at some point. Just because others have entered university doesn\'t mean they have their life planned out perfectly. You\'re right that crying and screaming won\'t work. Give yourself some time to accept this (idk how it takes it depends), move on and make use of what you have Now and what you can do. I wish you all the very best.', ""You should use this for your personal statement to some arts course, like English or Literature HAHAH it was surprisingly interesting and really captured my attention.\n\nAnyways, jiayou! Try again next year — my advice would be try applying to all 6 AUs + possibly spend your gap year building your portoflio for the courses you're aiming for. Hoping for the best for you! You can drop me a message if you need anyone to talk to :)"", 'You can still succeed in life without going to Uni. Dont get too demoralized over it. Its not the end.\n\nIf u still really wanna go uni, You should consider writing an appeal essay for all the unis.\n\nIf it doesnt work, you can finally try the poly route ( 2 years for JC students programme that they recently introduced) corresponding to the course you wanted to take in Uni. One of my friend failed JC, went to poly and he graduated with a final cgpa of 3.94 (made it to the Honours roll for 3 consecutive years and also made it Diploma with Merit [top 20% of the cohort]). He got offers from all the top 3 uni.', 'Try appealing agn!\nFrom what i see,your english is not only proficient but also possesses the ability to influence others. Personally while i was reading your post i can rlly emphatise with your situation. I felt like i was being channeled into that moment that you described. I believe you can use this flair in writing to channel the same desperation and sadness that you have felt into your appeal letter and the office of admissions may just accept your appeal', 'not exactly the same experience but i just received a rejection from nus today, although i do have offers from other unis they haven’t been my first choice and i was hanging onto the tiny bit of hope that i would get good news from nus... i never knew how much rejection would hurt until i got it, like you, while it was processing i wanted it to be over soon... now that it’s over i have no idea what to feel. \n\nmoving on i guess i’ll consider my other options, successful appeal rates aren’t high from what i’ve been reading. good luck to you, better days are ahead and i hope wherever you end up you do well. at the very least we both get a fresh start after As.', 'How i felt: Just got rejected by SIT today, & i know the NTU one will be coming soon. What can i do now? Delayed my uni studies for 2 years after graduation, figuring out what i want to do, and now that i know what i want to do, i can’t get in. I know there’s still appeal. I know i’m still young. But i have been pinning my hopes on entering uni these year because i have no idea what i can do now, after my internship ends. It all seems too far away and too scary to think about. Just wishing i had a community of people who also got rejected, and that we can all wallow is sadness together because sometimes, that’s what helps to make you feel better - that you are not alone. That’s my message to you, OP. You are not alone. I’m so so sorry for the devastation you feel, the hopelessness, the loss.\n\n- From a brown cow to another\n\n(Maybe i will make that group...but it’s probably not allowed in this sub)', ""Hello OP! Your writing is fantastic. Years ago, I was in the same place as you -- rejected by every university I applied to using my A Levels without even receiving any interview letters. It was financially impossible to study in a private uni/ go overseas to pursue a degree, so I decided to take a gap year and go to a local polytechnic the year after. Just graduated last week (supposedly, hello covid) with a diploma with merit when all my other same-aged peers are graduating this year with a degree, but I've never been happier! Now I'm currently accepted into every university I applied to, even NUS Medicine :) \n\nIt was a hard pill to swallow initially as I felt inferior to my peers. Was fearful of looking like a failure to those accepted into local universities, and hated that tongues wagged behind my back. But in this extended journey that I took, I worked on and for myself and learnt a crazy lot in terms of knowledge and education. It also revealed to me the actual colours of people and filtered out the true friends who supported me. Even if I'm slower by others by four years today, I am thankful for the journey of growth :) \n\nDon't be disheartened by your circumstance because you already coming this far through the rigours of the tertiary education system is worth celebrating. Don't let anyone dull your worth, value or tell you you're a failure bc you're absolutely not. There's so much more ahead of you! All the best, OP! Feel free to drop me a message if you'd like :)"", 'Hi OP,\n\nI hope you will open your mind to other possibilities over the “standard jc to Uni” route that many others are taking. I understand your dejection but there are many other options you can consider, depending on your interests, financial status etc. If you are going to NS, you can consider re applying, or taking your As again as a private candidate during your service. If you are a female, there are other private universities (SIMGE is a very common option) that is still relatively affordable, compared to going overseas, and can provide you with a good education and enriching student life as well. \n\nIt is understandable to feel dejected but I hope you can also see that this is just one of the many obstacles you are going to face in your life, I hope you will be able to fight your circumstances bravely and search for another path, even if it is an off-beaten one. Jiayou!', 'Ohh OP, I wish I could hug you right now :(( I can’t say I relate to your struggle now, but maybe give this some time? Sleep on it for now and discuss other possibilities with your parents? You could think about retaking A levels as a private candidate or you could enrol at a private uni, or you could take a gap year and develop your skills and work experience in that time! I suppose taking some time to think this through might help you arrive at a decision! Don’t give up hope yet, you will overcome this!! Godspeed to you :)))\n\nP.S. you write well!! A skill that I envy hehe', 'Just curious, how come you didn’t apply to SMU/NTU?', 'I can totally empathise with you. That was exactly me for a good two years back-to-back. \n\nI graduated poly back in 2018 May and enlisted in July of that same year. Only ORD-ed early this month. \n\nBack in 2018’s and 2019’s application periods, I was constantly rejected by all of the universities I applied to. Namely, NTU, NUS, SMU and SUSS. (I can vividly remember getting my unfavourable NUS application outcome on my first day of enlistment — on the damn boat to Tekong) \n\nI applied to business and computing courses in said universities even though I score poorly (GPA: low 3s). Mainly because I already knew what I wanted to do in the future and was prepared to go to SIMGE to study something that I want if things turned south. \n\nThankfully, this year, I managed to secure a spot at SUSS business analytics after being shortlisted for an interview. And I will forever be grateful for it. \n\nHence, I just wanna share this short anecdote to perhaps provide you (and maybe others too) with some hope. So hang in there OP, you got this! 🤗', ""Hey there! thank you very much for sharing. I believe there are many out there who share the same sentiments as you and they needed to this to feel sane. \n\nI for one went through the same phase. It took me around 4 years to eventually get out of it but I guess it was just another phase of life. Since then i have worked for two companies, dabbled in freelance and completed my national service.\n\nI applied for uni 4 times to 2 different institutions and all were unsuccessful. When it came to this year, I was rejected just again. (\\*side note my gpa in poly was nowhere near average and I only had my portfolio to fall back on) I was devastated but i didn't wanna let it go to waste.  I wrote something similar to your post in my Appeal Letter and redid my portfolio that very moment. I made clear of my interest, vision and goals. Everything good or bad that happened to me along the way that made me who I am today.  I sent it all in a few days after i got the unsuccessful outcome and had to wait for almost to 3 months for their reply. During that waiting time everything seemed horrible to me. All the unimaginable thoughts and 'whatifs' because I didnt know what to do especially in this pandemic and plus all the job offers were looking for full-timers?? I was stuck because what if i get an offer later yknow? I stayed away from social media, avoided replying texts and just made sure I was just comfortable.\n\nIts okay to cry. Cry the hardest because after this you are going to pick yourself up. Push yourself harder and keep your head high. I always believe that things happen for a reason and I find solace in that. Its okay to react badly to this. You are allowed to do that but promise yourself, you will soar even higher and work even harder after this. You can do it!\n\nI believe that good things happen to people who wait. I did it, for 4 years. This fall, i will be pursuing my bachelors in an institution I have always dreamt to study in since I was 15.\n\nRemember. keep going keep fighting. life is a long fight but it will eventually be worth it. Remember your purpose and your goals because it is what that is going to fuel you to the furthest mile. Sending my thoughts and prayers to you and everyone who are experiencing the same in this difficult time. keep going guys because you are worth it and always remember to be kind"", 'Hi there, I get how you feel. Just keep trying if you really want to get in. \n\nI was rejected 8 times by local unis, SMU SUSS SIT, not even offered an interview. Felt like shit, my friends were all getting their placings. I told myself fk it, decided to take a gap year and went to work instead and took this time to learn things that I’m interested in. \n\nBest choice I ever made, I made a lot of friends, connections and work experience. I get to talk to people from all walks of life. But the greatest takeaway I had was that nobody really cares where your degree is from. As long as you’re learning what you want to learn, any degree is as valuable. Honestly most companies don’t even take into account where your degree is from as long as you’re capable enough to add value to them. Go take up courses or self-learn skills that interest you. I have friends who only possess O level certs but they are still as successful as any degree holder. Just keep moving and don’t stop, you’ll eventually get there. \n\nI went ahead and applied for part time at SUSS and managed to get in. Taking my first semester now. So don’t be too disheartened. Jiayou!', 'I did not apply for any local unis because I know my gpa isn’t good enough. I planned to go overseas but due to covid, I will probably be going to uni in 2021 instead. \n\nIts kinda upsetting and strange to be a year behind my friends, I’m currently taking up jobs. I still feel that sinking feeling of fear, there’s so much I wish I could change and yet some of these factors are not up to me. \n\nWe’ll just have to make the best of what we have now and learn things along the way. Life is so long and education is just the beginning of it, it doesn’t define our future. \n\nCame from polytechnic route btw!', 'Bro. If your resolve to go local uni is strong enough, attempt to retake in NS. My friend and I retook in NS and did well enough to get into our dream course. It is the toughest thing I have ever done in my life but it can be done. All the best!', ""Hey OP! I was reading through your very descriptive post and I felt a lot of what you wrote because I was also rejected from all my choices many moons ago. (I wrote about it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f8qg59/a_levels_for_those_feeling_lost_and_down_about/) \n\nIf the appeals don't work out for you, do consider the many alternate routes that are available to you (Poly, Private Uni, Retaking, etc). I personally retook my As because I badly wanted to enter a local uni, so don't give up!\n\nLastly, don't lose hope, and all the best!"", ""Hello, even if you didn't get into your dream course, all is not lost. Accept the alternative offer and do well during your first semester of uni ( ie 4.6 GPA) and then apply for a transfer to your desired course. :-) Many local students do that and it's honestly easier because you're already in the uni. Thought this is important to share because I didn't know this when I entered uni but many students actually take this route. Don't loose hope! Giving up is for the faint hearted :-)"", 'Don’t let this get you down. Take a year off, work / travel / build up your resume to get what you’re after. I got rejected from NUS twice before being accepted on my third try. Just completed my masters at an ivy. A rejection isn’t the end, just forces you to open up other paths to get there. How you choose to deal with it now will have way more repercussions down the road than you might think. Take some time off, reflect and strategize a new path ahead.

I was immune to rejection letters at that point.\n\nAfter ORD i decided to get a job in the related field I studied during polytechnic for a year. \nJob was insanely underpaid and no OT pay with endless of OT amounting to about 46-48hours a week(slight rant: could have had earn more working part time, but it is okay as it made me more ‘hungry’ in a sense).

But I realize now when I look back that I should have taken a year to figure out what I liked and what I wanted to do. I mean this as in - if you want to go into banking, find an internship. If you want to do law in Uni, find an internship. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a paid one either - you can email companies and ask for unpaid internships but it is the EXPERIENCE that matters. \n\nAn appeal letter may help, but proper experience would go a lot farther when you reapply to the universities.

10,pinky_throwaway_2003,hctlbu,"[Rant] [O levels] Same ol vicious cycle, long post",2020-06-21 04:54:08,SGExams,77661,37,369,"Background: I took a year off to get my head straight after going through more than 3 years of living hell in sec school.

I never liked my secondary school. From the first day, the buildings just seemed to give off evil aura. My head just felt that something wasn't right, something bad was going to happen. A gut feel, as I would say. But, nothing happened. So I couldn't do anything but to wait like a sitting duck to what's to happen. In hindsight, I wished I had listened to my own gut feeling and transfered AWAY from the school. Hindsight always give you a 20/20 view, as they say.

It started with the small things, friends backstabbing. That's how I started secondary 2. Certain friend, who I shall refer her as W, wasn't happy that I was sitting with another friend in class, so she complained to the teacher, told her I was 'bullying' her. Forced me to go thru 'mediation' until my mother had it and told the teachers to 'fuck themselves' in a politically correct manner.

W and I patched, but that's not the end of the story. I had quit my former CCA, and joined scouts. W also did that too, so we ended up as CCA mates. I was... uncomfortable... so I just avoided her. W was the one who initiated the conversation, I just rode along. Hindsight again, I wished I had better taste in friends.

Scouts, oh darned scouts. That's when I met T, the 'golden' boy and fellow member of the CCA I was attending. Yet again it started with the small things, like him catcalling and him making all sorts of lewd comments about my body. I didn't think of much, as what the teachers said, 'boys will be boys.' 

I soon quit scouts due to even more drama brought indirectly by W. In my 'resignation' letter, I wrote about what W's friend did, as well as what T said. Yet again being the foolish sec 2, I didn't 'capture evidence' and just handed the resignation letter as it is.

It soon progresses into 'accidentally' or should I say, planned 'accidents'. Once brush, close an eye. Twice touch, it's a lie. I didn't know how to approach it. I don't have evidence, or even one witness. I chose to remain silent, which is something I still regret to this day. 

I started with a goal in mind for secondary 3. To get my 2 CCA points, clock as much volunteer hours and maintain at least As and Bs overall. Hah, as if I could achieve such godly goals.

Then, the opportunity came. The scouts teacher, Miss T, persuaded me to return, in exchange for a leadership position, in her words 'I guarantee you 2 points'. I bit onto her bait hard, like a trusting moron. I told her about what T tried to do to me in sec 2, because I trusted her. She told me she'll settle it.

She never did. 

The smaller problems snowballed from just words to action. T starts with random touches up the forbidden area. I couldn't scream for help, cause my voice just drowned out in a crowded canteen. The irony, I know.

It happened in broad daylight again, this time in front of my class. He rubbed possible human reproduction material onto my skirt. I went speechless. I... I didn't know how to react.

I, yet again, chose to be silent. Instead, I laughed away my sorrows with another mutual friend met thru W, I shall refer to him as J. Everytime I chased him around, and vice versa, I just forgot all about what happened. All the teasing and fun times. That was probably the reason why I didn't go insane.

Everytime it happened, I chose to stay silent. Because I believed that the scouts teacher would do something, she kept on promising and promising. Nothing ever happened.

T got bolder and bolder, the final time getting his group of friends to corner me in the canteen whilst I was queuing. T whispered in my ear, 'something something about my pantak (ass),' I didn't fully understand what he was saying, but knew he was talking about my body. All 6 of his friends took turns grabbing, until I snapped and slapped one of them before storming off. I had it. I no longer wanted to wait for promises that were never fulfilled. I decided it was time to escalate.

The final straw that broke the camel's back.

On the day I was supposed to tell the other scouts teacher, Miss L, about what T had been doing to me, I found out that Miss T had been making empty promises to keep me in the CCA. Remember she promised all sorts of 'positions' that'll guarantee my CCA points? That was a lie. Guess who they gave my promised position to? T. The golden boy. I wouldn't be so mad (maybe betrayed at most) had T regularly attended CCA. Fuck, no. He didn't even turn up for a single session the entire of sec 3. This sent me into pure hysterics, sobs and questions.

Why. What did I do wrong. What did T do to make he worthy of that position. Where did I go wrong. Why.

I sat on the staircase, sobbing and pretty much hugging the only emotional pillar I had, the railings. W and J came, W just stood there emotionless (she also didn't get a leadership position, expected, due to her attendance and attitude to scouts) whilst J tried to comfort me. It didn't help.

All the shit I endured. All the hours I poured into this CCA, the money I lost when I chose to forgo my holiday for a CCA camp that'll increase my chances of the leadership position. All the hours after session I spent practising on footdrills. The weekends I burnt memorizing drill commands.

I realized I only endured the harassment because of my ambition. My selfish goals. I didn't care about the price I had to pay, I only gave a shit about scouts, and my CCA points. I paid the final price with my sanity.

With my sanity slipping away, my only train of thoughts was to seek justice for myself. What I had lost, what another girl could have experienced because I chose to stay silent for the sake of my petty ambitions.

I approached Miss L, and told her everything that T had done. She was shocked, and asked me in chinese, when it happened. Just like what happened with Miss T, Miss L never did anything. They promised, yet nothing happened.

The mental abuse from my Chinese teacher truly broke the camel's back. Call it an unorthodox method of punishment or abuse, its up to your judgement. I was falling back on my homework because I spent every night in bed crying. As such, the Chinese teacher began confiscating my ezlink card and handphone. I was paying adult fare on a kids budget. There was even one time I had to BEG from a random stranger at a terminal for 1 dollar because I didn't have enough money. 

This pretty much pushed me to the edge. I stayed up for 72 hours (skipped school, got an MC) and finished every single essay I owed to her. On that Friday (remember it clear as day), I handed everything I owed to her. She said she'll return my belongings on Monday. Comes Monday, the chinese teacher claims I did NOT submit any essay to her despite having the class remind her that I did. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday passed. She found all my essays except one. She then claims I didn't write it, and CONFISCATES my entire SCHOOL BAG, and threatens to confiscate my uniform if I don't hand it by Friday. I was left carrying a thick stack of textbook, semi-sobbing before finally breaking down to my mother.

My mother then promptly writes into the school (at this point she doesn't know about the harassment), demanding that the teacher returns my belonging and compensate me for my adult fare. The vice principal made her return every item she took from me, and made sure she didn't dare to pull another stunt like that again. Lo and behold, she lost my spare ezlink card. So she just handed me another random NETS credit card card that doesn't belong me and told me to '闭你狗嘴' (shut my f*cking mouth) and don't complain.

I ended up flunking every single sec 3 finals, and only passing bare minimum to get me promoted. First time failing in my life. Still feels surreal till this day.

A TL;DR of what happened in 2019/2020 (idw go into details, not ready yet heh), start of sec 4: Searched for transfers, a school is willing to take me in provided the principal approves. The sperm donor (father) doesn't believe me even after I have a c** stained skirt as evidence. School pretends to 'investigate' case to lure me back to school. Both scouts teachers pretended as if I never told them about what happened, the CCA department 'mysterious' lost my resignation letter back in sec 2 that clearly stated what T had been doing. Principal traps me with other friend W (she was also looking for school to transfer) in a white room for more than 10 hours, starts interrogating both as if we committed some big crime. Starts yelling and told me 'it's a form of love to be stalked and touched' after I revealed that T stalked me outside of school (briefly mentioned to both scouts teachers). Makes W break down, fail to make me cry because I had already cut myself emotionally off. Yells again until she probably went out of breath before sending both out. Whilst all these yelling, I had recorded her actual meltdown and was planning to use it as evidence. W sabotages my plan (didn't know at that time), told the principal that I was recording her. Phone got forcefully searched, recording got deleted. School pretends to investigate the harassment case, a few witnesses step forward but was silenced off. Even HEARD the DM told another former scout member to stay silent about the harassment if he wants to keep his leadership position. Was forced to join another CCA, threatened to call the police on me if I refused to join. Placed in the middle of a class full of strangers, freaked out when one of them (later learnt it was an autistic kid, wished I hadn't publicly freaked out) came running at me at full speed and had a huge meltdown.

A rough summary of the 'traumatic' parts, without the gross details. Because I chose to come forward, the principal started targeting me. I was given a poor conduct grade despite never having any discipline/criminal case. My grades were 'modified', where I never passed again. I was forcefully placed into basic Chinese just because I failed in one test.

Thankfully, I managed to fought my way back to normal chinese. Luckily I had taken HCL back in PSLE and scored pretty much straight As in lower sec, or else I might have ended up permanently in basic Chinese and that'll screw my L1R4 score.

At this point, W was still my friend. My mother hated her. She apparently caught W in a lie: W claimed that she never did a mental assessment at IMH. In my mother's conversation with the principal, she was told W had gone to IMH, had a mental assessment, went up to the superintendent with this report and tried to transfer.

I was in denial. I started noticing things that were obvious red flags, emails between W's mother and the principal that had my name and J's, her mutual and only friend other than me. It then hit me, W will do anything and everything to get out of this school, even if it cost me.

Yet again, another few more weeks of crying and denial. I still remained W's friend, because I didn't want to believe she was capable of such backstabbing. I should have just unfriended her. If she can backstab me in sec 2, what is one more time?

In Science class, J and I started becoming closer. Occasionally we would talk and fool around. I started looking forward to Mondays and Wednesdays, because that's the days I actually had real company, away from my backstabbing horror of a class and W. We remained a row apart, because I never wanted to sit anywhere close to anybody after what had happened.

July. I remember this day as clear as day. After morning form teacher class, all the tables were joined back but they were short of my pair of table. So I sat on the left side of J's table. He just looked, I just looked. Nothing happened, I continued scribbling notes (kept on having flashbacks of what happened) and used my paper cutter to repeatedly slice the top of my paper. J asked if I was okay. Internally, I was a mess. On the outside, I just said yeah.

A friendship bloomed, only waiting for the flower to wither and die.

Over the next few weeks, I started becoming more and more paranoid. I enjoyed the company of J in class, but wondered if he was just my friend to seek out information like W. Yet, I still remained somewhat close.

I never fully trusted J, which is probably the reason why this friendship started to fall apart. I tried really, really, really hard to tell J what exactly happened in scouts but never did. It's just a gapping hole of trust that was broken that stopped me from trusting anyone again. I even forced myself to sit at the staircase he collects his lunch everyday, hoping one day I can finally tell him the truth. I never did.

Eventually I believe he heard half truths from the person that I had the most trust from, W. I only knew that W went around telling EVERYBODY about what happened in scouts when one of my acquaintance accidentally blurted out T's name and the skirt, which is only known to W, the school and I.

It was the date of MTL result release. I pretty much flew into a rage, almost punching W if I had one strand of self control less in me. After that, I just shut down and had a massive breakdown in a random unoccupied classroom.

Not even my MTL results made my day any better. By hook or crook I had passed. On a normal day I would have felt happy. Now, I was just murky on the inside and outside.

The rest of the year passed in a blur. Ever since that day, I had shut down emotionally and mentally. I distanced myself from J, and pretty much everybody. Nobody could hurt me anymore if I don't feel any pain, and that's what I did. Eventually J and I drifted, we sat for our O levels and left the school, leaving too many unspoken words between us.

The current

Mentally, I'm still exhausted because of my chaotic home environment. The sperm donor makes my life a living hell. Emotionally, I still don't feel things. I simply don't trust anymore, so I can't get hurt again. The closest I've came to feeling something was when I heard from my former classmates that T had touched another girl inappropriately. The only feeling I had was pain. If only I had spoken earlier that other girl wouldn't have gone thru what I had.

Part of me is looking forward to poly, yet my paranoid side tells me that the past will come back and haunt me. Yes, I'm worried that I will lose out opportunities because of what the evil principal had done to me (bad conduct grade). I used to get nightmares that W would be in the same course as I am. I'm scared that I'll trust the wrong friends, and see history repeat itself again.

I've been living as if I were dead for 2 years. I think it's time for me to open up and be a functioning human again. I think this post pretty much marks the end of me re-living everyday in this nightmare. It's time to let go. 

*A small message to J, whether you're reading this or not: I'm thankful that we met in sec sch, although it was in shit circumstances. I'm sorry for not trusting you. Thank you for leaving me with at least 1 good memory of sec sch. Also, I'm sorry that I slapped you. I wish I wasn't sensitive, I wish at that time I had known you weren't the bad guy. I wish my paranoia hadn't killed this friendship. I hope you're doing well wherever you are.*

Tysm for listening to my rant. It's just June and reality is hitting me. In around 8 months it'll be the end of my mental break year and it's time for me to face my biggest fears, trusting and people.

11,anon1234510887,jcyjyv,[Rant] emptiness,2020-10-18 00:46:51,SGExams,77661,8,24,"i am a j1 student waiting patiently for my promo results.

a few weeks ago, i was a j1 student whose life was completely engulfed by studying for promos: every waking moment was filled with worries about the exam, whether it be what else i hadn't studied yet, or paranoia of what will come.

the sleep that i so needed was eaten away by feelings of anxiety that strangled my heart until i had difficulty breathing.

i think i wasn't in my right mind back then. i studied from 9am to 9pm, save for a lunch break, but during which i stared at my revision materials while i ate.

yet, because my mind was only filled with thoughts of studying, nothing else could enter. (thankfully?) previous feelings of social anxiety etc. seemed meaningless. who cares about socialising when i had to revise 1000 more topics in a few hours?

unfortunately, thoughts still started to fill my mind. 

i remember that one of those nights, as i went to sleep, i started to feel my heart restricting. it continued until i felt like i wouldn't be able to breathe, but luckily this ordeal only lasted for a few seconds.

but in those few seconds, i remember feeling fearful and regretful. my last memory was memorizing for exams. i couldn't even remember the last time i smiled or had fun or genuinely enjoyed life.

i was scared. life is short, i realized. and at that moment to me, studying seemed meaningless. when you die, you don't remember the grade you got on that exam you worried so much for. that would be meaningless.

existential dread filled me up there - have i been toiling away for something i won't even remember? what should i do instead then? is it too late? did i waste too much of my time?

i struggled with such thoughts the rest of the time studying for promos. luckily, after promos ended, and i could finally breathe, those thoughts didn't seem to invade my space anymore.

but alas, life doesn't give you peace easily. i know i screwed up my promos and as promo results start to loom and crawl nearer and nearer, i know there's a possibility i might retain. legitimately.

but then again, what meaning does promo results bear? in comparison to the 16+ years that i've lived, what makes the grades on a piece of paper that will mean nothing to me in a year as i prepare for a levels, more meaningful than any other moment? on what grounds does my anxiety feed on?

and so on. such thoughts fill my mind now. this all just feels like a meaningless loop. what actually has meaning?

this is literally just a whole brain dump, but i needed somewhere to rant.

So I really wish I could get help on this: I'm welcome to tips, encouragements and really anything to give me that little piece of hope for hcl.  

To give some context, I took up hcl in sec 2, and I started out with B3 grades. Chinese o lvl came and I had gotten B3. Now as sec 4, my grades have dropped considerably to C6s and I got D7 for prelims. My current teacher always had reservations regarding my skills and told me that I had a chance of failing hcl in o's.

I really did not know why I have come to this horrible state and paranoia is really kicking in, till the point where I am like believing I would actually fail hcl. So I am not aiming for a distinction, but I really just want to pass.The bad thing is, I don't have the motivation these past few weeks and would procrastinate to even touch other subject's tys, which means I have not done anything for hcl.

15,TracingWoodgrains,g6f35b,"Lee Kuan Yew Review, Part Two: You are free to agree",2020-04-23 11:01:03,singapore,378640,40,91,"Yesterday, I posted [part one of a four-part review of Lee Kuan Yew's *From Third World To First*](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g5qot3/book_review_lee_kuan_yews_from_third_world_to/). Since a decent number of people ended up enjoying it, I'll be posting the other parts of the review over the next few days. 

As with last time, since I'm an ignorant American with no personal experience of Singapore and only LKY's word to go on for much of the detail provided, I'd be particularly interested to hear where I oversimplified things or where people would contest this interpretation of events. Note as well that, since I initially wrote this to an international audience, throughout the essay I assume rather less familiarity with Singapore than you all have.

With those notes taken care of, enjoy the review!

###You are Free to Agree

Are you a fan of free speech? Are you eager for everyone to have a platform? Are you in favor of an open, unconstrained press? 

Lee Kuan Yew isn't, and he's probably poking fun at you.

######Free Press

Here are a few of his choicest quotes on Western-style free press:

> My early experiences in Singapore and Malaya shaped my views about the claim of the press to be the defender of truth and freedom of speech. The freedom of the press was the freedom of its owners to advance their personal and class interests. ^\(186)

And: 

> I did not accept that newspaper owners had the right to print whatever they liked. Unlike Singapore's ministers, they and their journalists were not elected. ...I do not subscribe to the Western practice that allows a wealthy press baron to decide what voters should read day after day. ^\(191)

And, when he got into an argument with the US State Department:

> The State Department repeated that it did not take sides; it was merely expressing concern because of its ""fundamental and long-standing commitment to the principles of a free and unrestricted press""--which meant that ""the press is free to publish or not publish what it chooses however irresponsible or biased its actions may seem to be."" ^\(192)

All that's pretty straightforward, and clearly goes against the principles of free speech, right? Then you get to the next quote:

> *We have always banned communist publications; no Western media or media organization has ever protested against this.* We have not banned any Western newspaper or journal. Yet they frequently refused us the right of reply when they misreported us. ^\(191)

Here's a question. You're a tiny city-state occupying valuable territory, trying to stay independent. You are watching the cultural revolution sweep across the homeland of three-quarters of your people, and you [keep noticing them funding your newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/17/archives/paper-in-singapore-ceases-publication-red-link-charged.html). Meanwhile, other superpowers are locked in an all-out ideological struggle with those forces, a struggle that's shaping policy around the whole world. The country's dominant English-language newspaper at the time of gaining independence was ""owned by the British and actively promoted their interests."" ^\(185)

What's the right level of freedom of press?

Keeping in mind that the book is telling things from LKY's perspective and so naturally seeks to cast his decisions favorably, his position has some nuances that make it easy to be sympathetic. First, there's a different standard for local and foreign media: ""We had to tolerate locally owned newspapers that criticized us; we accepted their bona fides, because they had to stay and suffer the consequences of their policies. Not so 'the birds of passage who run [foreign-owned papers].'"" ^\(187)

Second, as he mentions above, he didn't ban non-Communist foreign press. Not exactly. Instead, every time a paper refused right of reply for a story he felt was misrepresented or slanted, he just restricted sales licenses to smaller numbers, with an eye towards reducing advertising revenue but not towards outright banning the ideas. This led to occasionally amusing exchanges. In one back-and-forth, after the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) published an alleged defamatory article and had sales restricted, the AWSJ offered to distribute its journal free to its deprived subscribers to ""forego its sales revenue in the spirit of helping Singapore businessmen"". Singapore's government agreed, as long as it left out advertisements. The paper backed out, claiming cost issues. Singapore offered to cover half the additional costs. When the paper refused, Singapore gave an official response: ""You are not interested in the business community getting information. You want the freedom to make money selling advertisements."" ^\(193)

Third, well, it's only paranoia if you're wrong. In addition to facing consistent attempts at covert communist influence, I learned post-reading that Lee Kuan Yew had [at least one memorable run-in with the CIA](http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Security-CIA-II/CIA%20II%20013.pdf) (h/t [/r/singapore](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2zzlz3/til_cia_tried_to_bribe_mr_lee_kuan_yew_and_got/)). In 1960, they offered him $3.3 million to cover up a failed attempt to buy information from Singapore intelligence officials. Lee's response? ""The Americans should know the character of the men they are dealing with in Singapore and not get themselves further dragged into calumny. ...You do not buy and sell this Government."" Never one to ignore leverage, he requested that instead of covert bribes the US provide public foreign aid. They complied.

Dystopian information lockdown, or prudent defense against foreign influence and misinformation? LKY is convinced, rightly or not, that it is the latter. Read with modern US politics in mind, it's easy to compare it to deplatformings from tech websites, concerns about Russian infiltration of social media, or the controversies around fake news. The context changes, the challenges stay the same.

######Free Speech

I frankly have much less sympathy for LKY's eagerness to sue people for libel. It's worth mentioning that Singapore has avoided one obvious concern about relying on courts here: [corruption is almost non-existent in Singapore](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018), and deliberately so. We may come back to corruption later, since LKY does spend some time on it. Still, there's something unsettling about the leader of a country keeping a hawk's eye watch for anything that misrepresents him, then turning the power of the courts on the individual or newspaper who went after him.

He talks about a fair number of legal battles with evident satisfaction, about taking this opponent or that who accused him or corruption or lied about him to court, then winning the battles. He anticipates the obvious criticism about this practice, and defends against it:

> Had I not sued, these allegations would have gained credence. ...Outrageous statements are disbelieved only because they are vigorously refuted. If I failed to sue, that ould be cited as proof that there was something in it. ...Wrong ideas have to be challenged before they influence public opinion and make for problems. ^\(130-131)

And: 

> Far from oppressing the opposition or the press that unjustly attacked my reputation, I have put my private and public life under close scrutiny whenever I appeared as a plaintiff in court. Without a clear record, it would have been an unnecessary hazard. Because I did this and also gave the damages awarded to deserving charities, I kept my standing with our people. ^\(131)

Left unspoken, though, is that *he's the one who's in charge of this whole system of lawsuits.* Vigorous refutation of an idea can happen in writing, in speeches, in any number of official channels. If he wants to keep his public and private life open to scrutiny, he can do so however he chooses. Electing to wage time-consuming and costly legal battles against people who put forward unsavory ideas is hardly the only choice for the most powerful man in a country, and it's a choice that I feel warrants skepticism.

I'm much more fond of his response to a London Times reporter who made accusations he disputed (emphases mine): 

> I wrote to invite Levin to a live television debate in London on his allegations. Levin's editor replied that no television station would be interested. *I had taken the precaution of first writing to the chairman of the BBC*, my friend Marmaduke Hussey, who had agreed to provide half an hour and a neutral moderator. When I informed the London Times of this offer, the editor on Levin's behalf backed off, arguing that my response should be in the same medium in which Levin had attacked me, namely the Times. I wrote to regret Levin's unwillingness to confront me. *When the* Times *refused to publish my letter, I bought a half-page advertisement in the British daily, the* Independent. Interviewed on the BBC World Service, I said, ""Where I come from, if an accuser is not prepared to face the person he has attacked, there is nothing more to be said.""

> Levin has not written about Singapore or me since. ^\(196)

There's something delightful about the image of a politician going up to a reporter and saying, in effect, ""Heard you were talking smack. Debate me, you coward.""

Another instance shows up, by the way, in which it's hard to make assumptions about Singapore. Given LKY's desire for control over media messaging, you might expect some sort of overreaction to the internet. Instead, his message comes with characteristic bluntness: ""Countries that try to block the use of IT will lose."" ^\(196) 

######On nanny states

One last topic remains to be covered here. From banning everything from drugs to tobacco advertising to chewing gum to [eating durian in public spaces](https://www.yearofthedurian.com/2014/10/llegal-durians-how-much-trouble-wi.html), Singapore has inevitably faced accusations of being a ""nanny state.""

LKY has this to say on the subject:

> Foreign correspondents in Singapore have no big scandals of corruption or grave wrongdoings to report. Instead they reported on the fervor and frequency of these ""do good"" campaigns, ridiculing Singapore as a ""nanny state."" They laughed at us. I was confident we would have the last laugh. We would have been a grosser, ruder, cruder society had we not made these efforts to persuade our people to change their ways. We did not measure up as a cultivated, civilized society and were not ashamed to set about trying to become one in the shortest time possible. First, we educated and exhorted our people. After we had persuaded and won over a majority, we legislated to punish the willful minority. It has made Singapore a more pleasant place to live in. **If this is a ""nanny state,"" I am proud to have fostered one.** ^\(183)

To rephrase: ""Yep, we're a nanny state. Works great. Any questions?""

I'll repeat my prior explanation of LKY's approach: Will a policy make people more self-sufficient, more capable, or safer? Ultimately, does it work? Oh, and does it make everybody furious?

Great, do that. 

On a world scale, I think I would be uncomfortable with this sort of standard. I believe in the importance of creating robust societies where a wide range of ideas can thrive, and this sort of deliberately limited culture doesn't really provide that. But part of creating robust systems is questioning assumptions and experimenting with dramatically different approaches. I'm from Utah, ground zero for Mormonism and its strict standards. As such, I grew up in a similarly self-restricting and proud ""nanny state"". While it wasn't right for me in the end, for a lot of people I'm close with, those unambiguous strict standards work *really, really well* in a way that ""eh, just do what makes you happy"" doesn't. A single city of five and a half million people seems to me just about the right size to run that sort of experiment.

###Interlude Two

While reading the book and looking a bit into Singapore, I came across a few pieces of info that don't fit naturally into a review but deserve at least a moment's attention. One is the matter of Singapore's airport.

You might recall from my first review a brief mention of Lee Kuan Yew's focus on first impressions so people would ""know that Singaporeans were competent, disciplined, and reliable... without a word being said"" ^\(62). Singapore's Changi airport takes that to its natural conclusion. He was determined to make Singapore a transport hub of the region and decided to write off their investments in an older airport to perfect Changi in a number of details. After seeing Boston's Logan Airport, for example, he reported being ""impressed that the noise footprint of planes landing and taking off was over water"" ^\(203) and adjusting plans accordingly. In the end, they spent six years and $1.5 billion constructing the airport in a sort of [anti-Brandenburg](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport) approach.

And (h/t [elsewhere on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/cam405/airport_in_singapore_has_a_slide_that_will_take/)): The airport is *wild.* Features include: [multi-story slides](https://i.imgur.com/cm4zskR.gifv), a massive playground of [climbing nets](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/changi-unveils-new-playground-featuring-ropes-nets-and-a-pole-at-t4), an indoor playground and [waterfall](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/04/jewel-changi-airport-pix.png), [hedge mazes and canopy bridges](http://mentalfloss.com/article/501651/singapore%E2%80%99s-airport-getting-two-different-garden-mazes), and, well, [just about everything else](http://www.changiairport.com/en/discover/attractions.html#/filter?tab=all). Oh, and it has airplanes too. It's been ranked pretty consistently as [the best airport in the world](https://www.worldairportawards.com/worlds-top-10-airports-2019/). 

Until next time.

If we take USA for example some news media is cowarding behind the first ammendment of thier constituition (fox news).

They will get away as if nothing happened. \n\nMedia has a huge influence on how people think and perceive the world. It will be dangerouse if thier words cannot be prosecuted. Freedom of consequence under freedom of speech is basically allowing disparity of power. Power can be in the form of money and it will allow the rich and elite to set a narrative that they want the public to see. In other words ""manipulation"" or ""brain wash"". \n\nIn singapore, you can criticise LKY and lee hsian long. But you better stand by your words and defend yourself in court. And your criticisim better have evidence and testimonials. Or you will be charged with ""defamation"". Nonetheless they are public figures. \n\nIt\'s not like LKY is compeletly bullet proof of criticism. Earlier during building of singapore. He passed a bill that would allow parents who are degree holders to get priority for thier child to enrol into elite schools. Of course he was met with alot of critiscism. And quickly the bill was withrawn. People\'s words can still be heard by the government. So i don\'t see the lack of platform that you mention. People can also elect thier member of parliament in singapore and allow thier words to be heard in parliament. You can even talk to these Members of parliament face to face. \n\nOnce again i would to like to mention freedom of speech is important. However, you should not be free from the consequence. Singapore should not follow the western model of freedom of speech. We are an independant country we have our own governance. We don\'t need to take advice from other country. LKY in his eralier days said it clearly “Freedom is being able to walk on the streets unmolested in the wee hours in the morning, to be able to leave one’s door open and not fear that one would be burgled. Freedom is the woman who can ride buses and trains alone; freedom is not having to avoid certain subway stations after night falls.” It is just that our value of freedom is much different to what the US people deem as freedom.

Seperate can of worms."", 'I don\'t believe that creativity is \'fucked\' solely because of state policy that prioritized economic development. Emphasis on \'solely\'. It\'s a struggle to make a living as a creative in Singapore, absolutely. But I personally feel the larger issue is that Singapore\'s origins have always been one of trade and enterprise, which built a culture where success was linked to finance, with little incentive to value anything else, even before LKY\'s time.\n\nFor context, here\'s a Straits Times article from 1946, that bemoans the lack of a vibrant arts scene, and the pedestrian tastes of the people in Singapore.\n\nhttps://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19460825-1.2.43\n\nIt\'s a pretty biased article, imho, because the author expresses shock that Singapore hasn\'t ""learned"" to appreciate culture, despite being exposed to the West. It smacks of superiority, and condescension over the purported inability of the Asiatic community to think beyond their base needs. But the observation is telling - he pins the lack of ""taste"" to a predilection to ""amass money"" at the expense of everything else.\n\nSingapore has allowed a materialistic society to flourish way before the boom years of the 1950s and beyond. It\'s not a fault of Singapore, it\'s just the nature of how cities work. People come for the money. They stay because they like the money. They create environments conducive to making money. And not much else.\n\nSo it boils down to this. Would a city built entirely on trade and enterprise allow creativity to flourish? Yes, it can. But it needs a positive feedback loop from the community. Other great cities of the world have a larger hinterland to fuel them, both in terms of economy and creativity. Singapore doesn\'t. And it\'s not the only one. Luxembourg is a fine example of something similar at play.\n\nI\'m not saying the state doesn\'t have a stake in helping the arts flourish, but there\'s only so much that can be done. Self-expression has to come from the community.\n\nEdit: forgot to address another key point - I personally don\'t believe Singapore is creatively bereft. Singapore\'s creative output is constantly made to match up against the global players who\'ve been at the game longer, and had a head start in getting better. The critical mass of the artist community isn\'t big enough to match what we see from elsewhere. Add to this the Eurocentric notions of ""soul-lessness"" because Singapore doesn\'t have the surface-level exoticism of other Asian countries, and we have a narrative that Singapore\'s creative scene sucks.', ""We see that it's *slowly* changing, but imo (and I think LHL is worried too) it's not nearly fast enough"", ""Finally found time to read your comment. Here I go.\n\nI'll agree with the fact that it is not just the Government's focus on raising our financial numbers that is to solely to blame for our lackluster creative scene.\n\nI'll also agree that our culture of being the first in everything and having the latest materialistic object is also to blame for our lackluster creative scene. When the average Singaporean works until they're seeing the light and then immediately crashes the moment they go home, you'd be hard pressed to find time to even practice your interests. From young, we were taught to not stray from the intended path. Any creative solution to a problem will be marked wrong while the tried and tested solution will always be marked correct. \n\nAnecdotally, I find that in Singapore, teachers are more likely to give high 20s to essays where there are frequent usage of difficult words, no matter how crowbar-ed it was implemented. One could have absolutely shoddy sentence structure but still do well due to what is essentially them playing Scrabble.\nI also find that argumentative essays tend to be marked higher than creative essays.\n\nOn the topic of our Government, yes. I will agree that the Government can only do so much with their grants. The grants are like fertiliser but what good is trucks full of fertiliser when you do not have enough trees? Ultimately, the individual has to step up.\n\nPersonally, I find Singapore not to be just another concrete wall but a blank canvas, just waiting for a painter and their brushes to touch upon the fabric of this country. Unfortunately, Singapore is simply too young to have a Beethoven, Van Gough or Charles Dickens yet. Or rather, her history isn't quite varied yet. \n\nCompare that with China with thousands of years worth of history and along with it, came with great works starting from the invention of paper which leads me to believe that art requires a long and rich history to flourish. Again, our country is simply too young and her history . Perhaps in a century we would have someone to shake up the creative world.""]"

18,cryptonitr,alqbjf,Our Reality (LGBT Youths in Singapore),2019-01-31 23:05:32,singapore,378640,216,424,"Why is this our new normal? Why does Singapore, a country I love so dearly, feel so backward? As a fellow gay Singaporean and JC student, this whole TMJC saga is legit outrageous.

For last few years, as I discovered my sexuality, each news story, every conversation about the LGBT community, becomes this huge deal. The TMJC boys being vilified on Hardware Zone just shows the worst of Singaporean culture. 

The reality is, we sit in our classrooms, studying the same standardized tests as everyone else, wondering why some of our teachers do not have open conversations about LGBT issues in General Paper (just as an example). Or should we be trained to see a “right” and “socially accepted” peachy view of the world? 

The reality is, even if our friends are LGBT-friendly, we do not have the tools, the capabilities to open up conversations with them. For fear of being outcast. And if we do, we soften our voices, for we are afraid of being too needy. Too attention-seeking. Too “gay-centric”. 

The reality is, that if our parents find a photo circulating online, where a partner shows a display of innocent affection, a simple peck on the cheek, we have to wonder whether they would back us up when the backlash ensues. When the online trolls burst onto forums, holding up this picture as if it was Simba from the Lion King, we have to wonder what our families would think. It’s a feeling of paranoia you would never shake off.

We need to face the hard truths of our generation. LGBT people feel disenfranchised. Left out.

At this point, some self-proclaimed “common sense logician” will stop me to say that this is all emotional jargon. That I am making a sob story out of this whole post. And so? Does an appeal to emotions not mean an appeal to the fundamentals of being human? Sentient beings who have the unique ability to feel, understand and connect like no other species. And yet, we choose to be divisive. Brilliant haha.

>Education Minister Ong Ye Kung said that there is no discrimination against the LGBT community “at work, housing (and) education” here in Singapore (TODAYOnline, 2018). 

I hold great respect for the Minister, but I am puzzled by his statement on this. 

For purposes of relevant discussion, I shall only talk about the TMJC photo. I do not wish to speculate, but if the story that a police report was threatened to filed against the TMJC boys, it is a clear act of fearmongering. To uphold a certain “moral value set”. It is doubtful that there would be any clarity on this matter for transparency is not the strongest suit of the system, but the mere accusation speaks volumes.

If and when a student decides to show support for the LGBT community, there is a clear mental block. We need to filter out our content to be “school-friendly” or risk some form of reprimand. I understand that profanity may be problematic for the school’s reputation. But a post on PinkDot? Or a post with PDA as a gay couple? Is that really “uncomfortable”? 

Does the statement where Goh Chok Tong mentioned that the civil service encouraged gays to join up in 2003 (mind you, I was 3 years old) still hold up (TIME, 2003)? Or do the beneficiaries of civil service, in particular students studying in MOE-approved and supported schools, not have that same freedom of expression? 

We are exhausted from the constant mixed signals. Growing up gay in Singapore is extremely confusing. I only knew Kumar when I was growing up and I thought that was the epitome of “gay people”. Turns out I was completely off the mark. I was taught also that having a certain stance indicated “THE BIG GAY”. Again, wrong.

It’s a well-known fact that LGBT youths are more likely to succumb to mental health issues as well. Sexual minority youth are 3.5 times as likely to attempt suicide as heterosexual peers (CNA/Reuters, 2018). This is no coincidence. It is a systemic pressure to conform to a sexual preference.

And I’m worried. For the TMJC peers of mine, whether they would have necessary access to school counsellors who may or may not disclose private information to the school administration if they need assistance. Is there confidentiality? Over the years, there have been many personal stories in my own JC where students (for a wide variety of issues) have felt unsatisfied and even betrayed by mental health assistance in schools. Eventually, a whole range of teachers would be informed. With no consent. 

It seems to the ordinary person reading this that I am but one of the “vocal minority”. However, I do understand why it takes time to implement changes or move forward on LGBT rights in Singapore. We are a nation rooted upon the basis of (generally) civil discourse and discussion. Yet, I feel it has becoming increasingly hostile in the midst of the LGBT debate.

On both sides, there has been too much vitriol. My own community has been increasingly pointed in language and rhetoric to those that do not agree. Comments dismissing others as “just homophobes” or “Low SES uneducated scum” are disgusting. These don’t value add to the discussion. You are shutting others out, when instead we should seek a dialogue.

We are all Singaporeans. That is the baseline. And we cannot allow ourselves to descend into an individualistic culture (I’m looking at you, America) where it is all he-said-she-said. It must be calculated and careful on both sides. As a society, we may not be perfect, but we have shown over the years that the majority can live harmoniously. What is stopping us from doing so now? (:

Furthermore, we all value love. And affection. Regardless of who we are. We value family, filial piety and hard work amongst all else. These are the same things any Singaporean, straight or a lil’ queer can identify with. I remember when the landmark decision – which granted two gay fathers in Singapore to adopt their surrogate son – came out (haha) in the papers, I cried. Because that’s my own dream. To have a family. To feel part of a country I love. To feel valued and respected.

Love doesn’t win if we cannot learn to love and respect the people we meet. For if we are so bent upon achieving equality and justice, we must do so we compassion. With dignity and pride in doing the right thing. 

My final thoughts? I hope that one day, these trivial matters like an Instagram post aren’t means for baseless and unproductive argument. And that Singaporeans can finally see that LGBT people are just like anyone else. 

For now, this is our reality. And I guess, tomorrow, I’ll still be standing at the Parade Square, proudly singing my national anthem and reciting the Pledge with my schoolmates. But silently, I hope one day, I’ll be the patriot that fully believes in his country. In the rights that he can be afforded.

*For now, this is our discontented reality.*

How can you say that in Malaysia Malays are all racially privileged when they earn less than Chinese, while at the same time you imply that blacks earning less than whites in America is evidence that they\'re underprivileged?\n\nI think the whole term is incoherent. In Malaysia Malays have more political power, while Chinese are richer. They\'re separate factors. Trying to rank ethnic groups in a hierarchy of who\'s more privileged is inaccurate and divisive.\n\n> Asians in the US would be a good example of a group that is richer than white people on average but still suffers racial discrimination. \n\nLiterally, a huge part of that discrimination is via AA. Asians are horribly discriminated against in universities and diversity hiring. How can you say that you need AA to combat discrimination, and then cite a racial minority that\'s discriminated against under AA? As I said, I believe that AA is a poison sold as its own antidote, ensuring perpetual sales and a toxic society.\n\nI\'d rather tell minorities to take responsibility for their own fates instead of relying on the crutch of AA. Set harsh laws against racism, and let meritocracy take over from there. Inequalities caused by historical differences will eventually regress to the mean. AA on the other hand devalues the achievements of minorities (""you didn\'t deserve that position by your own merit, you only got it because you\'re X""), perpetuating historical differences.', 'Racial privilege is tied more to both political power and being a majority in that society. Wealth inequality usually results from that (rather than is the cause of that), because those in the majority will subconsciously favour others of their race. This isn’t always intentional, but happens through things like favouring friends and family members who are usually of the same race. All that is *already* happening to Malays in Malaysia, and the reason it doesn’t translate well to income is down to a whole host of political and economic problems and corruption.\n\nIt cannot be compared to the US at all - their circumstances, histories, cultures and social systems are entirely different. Black people in America being poorer is one result of marginalization and discrimination from racist laws and policies that were dismantled very recently, and still have lasting consequences. There was no similar system against Malays in Malaysia, rather the opposite.\n\nIt is possible to be rich and still discriminated against - eg being called racial slurs by strangers, having one’s home vandalized, being threatened or assaulted in public, being treated unfairly in various situations, being excluded from social circles, and so on. That’s also more of what I’m referring to in relation to Asian Americans.\n\nWhile AA isn’t always perfectly implemented, it’s meant as a direct counter to racial discrimination in jobs and education (which is still pervasive in Singapore, including my own company). It is impossible to police that because hiring people is so subjective. Which means that without AA, qualified minorities will continue to stand a lower chance at attaining those positions.']"

so now that all my written papers for As are over, im part relieved and, a bigger part of me, annoyed (and disappointed). while I left the exam venue feeling that most of our papers were rather fine, i somehow end up making TONS of mistakes along the way. these can range from careless calculation errors to realising that i, in fact, do know how to do the question that I thought I didnt know how to do.

and the scariest part is, i can never resist the temptation to come on reddit after the papers to look at the discussions for the papers. because of this, I end up seeing the answers everyone else gets, and for some reason, the answers are never familiar to me. it's almost like I sat through an entirely different paper. I start having the feeling of paranoia that I screwed up my papers more than I thought, and the papers I thought I did fine in, are really not that great after all. which leaves the papers that I found horrible... well.

20,FinickyFrenchFries,ex4uca,Opinions on masks,2020-02-01 19:28:12,singapore,378640,21,17,"Sorry if something similar has been posted before.

With the spread of the Coronavirus, many people have been wearing surgical/N95 masks and buying them in bulk.

However, the government and other sources have been stating that masks should only be worn by those who are sick as they are not made to prevent people from catching the coronavirus. Some have even said that it provides a false sense of security. This does not stop many Singaporeans who still wear masks everyday and everywhere, saying it is better to be safe.

I’d like to know what your opinions are on wearing a mask in Singapore(Even in areas that aren’t as likely to be infected). Do you wear a mask? Is it necessary to queue up to buy them? Is the paranoia justified?",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ex4uca/opinions_on_masks/,"['If you infinite resources, everyone should be wearing masks all the time. But we don’t. The situation is not out of control in Singapore with no H2H spread here. The constant wearing of mask every day will only waste resources. At the moment, medical staff and front line staff (including F&B and other customer facing people) need it more. So it’s essential to ensure sufficient stock for them and also for us in case shit really goes out of the window.', 'Latest news seem to imply masks stockpile is only enough if it is used correctly, only those who are sick to use it. It is not sustainable for everyone to use 2 masks per day as protection.\n\nIf everyone continue to use it irresponsibly, we would run out of mask. I hope we won’t get into a situation where there is no mask when we need them the most.\n\nPerhaps, each of us who are healthy, should still have a mask with us. If encounter anyone coughing and sniffle continuously without a mask on in public transport, we should offer him/her a mask to put on immediately.', 'I’ve been going to work / out without a mask. Not because I’m a hero or trying to rebel, but - 1) I couldn’t get my hands on a mask 2) when my office gave out two masks, I decided to keep it for upcoming business travel. That being said, I wash my hands more frequently and try not to touch things in public. Keeping the masks for airport / airplane use, though. I feel there are too many people moving around and the air in the airplane is recycled. \n\nI feel that people who are sick, should wear masks - even if it’s not linked to the virus. I told off someone seated near me in the office because he’s been nursing a persistent cough since December. Do something about it, stop spreading your germs.

Quick and convenient.', ""It is probably not fair to say that masks do *nothing* for protection. It's still a physical barrier, and if nothing else it at least makes it harder for you to touch your face which is an actual risk. The problem is that the utility here is really not very much. If you are a healthy person not working in a high-risk environment, constantly wearing a mask is just reducing an already minuscule risk by a minuscule fraction. That same mask is much, much better served for someone who is actually sick, or someone much more vulnerable (medical workers, immunocompromised people, workers in very high traffic areas). There is already a global shortage, and even our stocks won't last if everyone is burning through masks for low utility. \n\nOf course this is the big picture view la, if you kiasu then even +0.0001 protection is higher than 0 and by that logic people will still wear."", 'Pardon my eyesight but I opened the thread because I read it ""Onions on masks"" and expecting some aunty putting onions on n95 / surgical masks.', ""it's one of those things that u can't quantify the results of. how can anyone tell whether the masks have or have not stopped further spread of infection? no one knows. it's better to have it on if you have one, rather than go into mrt and risk it all"", 'It\'s like buying premium antivirus software when you\'re using your PC to use Microsoft Office. \n\nIs it necessary?

21,harder2breathe,cr3tpt,"Dear Singaporeans, advice needed- Also best and most affordable places to seek help?",2019-08-16 17:09:13,singapore,378640,23,67,"There's a matter that has been disturbing me quite recently. I am a fresh grad and ironically, only just came to this ""realization"" that I may have way below average learning abilities- or even some kind of ADD that was never addressed. After reflecting on my life and considering the following points, I think it could be valid?

* The struggle with grasping mathematical and science concepts since primary school (In short, grasping logical concepts I guess?). For e.g., I don't understand why my friends around me can complete math and science worksheets given to them rightaway after a chapter is taught in class when I can’t do it rightaway. But I didn't thought much of that. Also, I remember my chinese teacher being puzzled about why I cannot memorising specific phrases within a short amount of time when others could although I was a “hardworking” student. And many similar recurring examples. I had the same difficulties in accountancy/finance/econs mods in uni - I always knew mods like this would be difficult for me but I thought I could overcome them by hard work. I knew what the most effective methods to study, and how exam rubrics are like BUT I just couldn't do it. And I don’t understand why I couldn’t. Even after evaluating what needs to be improved in my own studying process or planning through how I can tackle exam questions, results were like crap. It is also very difficult for me to ‘self-learn’ concepts before tutorials because I needed very precise detailed solutions to questions in order to learn. Hence I couldn’t get anything done until tutorials answers were given although I tried very hard. It amazes me that some of my peers were able to do the worksheets after going through learning materials themselves and I was frustrated with professors calling those who couldn’t do the work lazy.
*  However, no one has ever flagged this to me perhaps because I work very hard to compensate and thus achieving results that are in the slightly below average to slightly above average range. But I felt like I always deserved better grades for the effort put in in my O levels, A levels, etc. (which I’ve always thought due to my delusional + ineffective studying methods, but perhaps its more of not knowing that my learning methods should have been different?). 
* Great difficulties following step by step instructions verbally and through observation. When someone tells me instructions verbally, it is extremely difficult for me to follow or I easily miscomprehend/ find difficult to understand rational behind instructions given. I just find it difficult to pick up newly introduced routine tasks which most people probably can do in a shorter given time? (On the other hand, when given a task that requires much of my own discretion and flexibility such as designing an excel spreadsheet from scratch, I tend to do very well). On the point on having difficult following through observations- Sometimes, I “hear” what someone says but my brain takes a few seconds to actually understand what they say and I can feel this from the POV of a third person when this happens. And when I look back at what just happened, I feel frustrated as to why I couldn’t process the words quickly. 
* Very poor observation learning skills and memory- When I take very long time to remember or perform routines newly introduced to me when everyone else could remember and do with ease rightaway. When I look at someone demonstrating say, a movement or even guitar technique, I knew what they were doing but I couldn’t replicate what they do no matter how hard I try. I can only do it if someone is there to physically guide me to the extent of having to help me move my limbs to the exact correct positions LOL. (Ok this is pretty similar to my point above)
* My mum complaining about having slow reaction to things in life and not being able to learn things well. My brother has also way below average learning abilities but his is a case that is way more severe, have had official mental health related diagnosis.
* Needing to go out often and getting bored extremely easily, hence having to be “on the go” all the time or not I feel extremely restless. Colleagues at work also asked me why I like to take longer routes to walk to a certain venue when I could take a shortcut- But that’s because I want the time to fly, I rather walk than stand at a fixed place that kind of thing. Me discussing with others about having too many interests which is a double-edged sword? Always needing a change of environment very often.
*  The more I look back at my life the more I feel like perhaps something has been off the whole time but I just kept trying to overcome difficulties and blaming myself for all of these. On the other hand, I want to be as objectively as possible and avoid causing unnecessary paranoia to myself and eroding any of the self-confidence (I have left lol) so I think I will seek medical help soon even though many friends are saying that I’m overthinking (Which could be another possibility where I am too delusional to discern different things.)

She became a ballerina for the Bolshoi.\n\nOur education system isn't perfect as some people like you have difficulty grasping concepts that others can easily, but that doesn't make you less intelligent or less able to.

29,ScrubAyam8690,bc4fi4,[Polytechnic] Need some advice.,2019-04-12 04:01:52,SGExams,77661,2,12,"Hi, I am feeling depressed for quite a long period of time and i would like to ask some of you a few questions. I dont have a huge social cirlce either. I am also feeling worried that i might get outcasted like the past and i have social anxiety disorder,ocd and paranoia as well.

1. Is it normal to wish that a lot of people will care for you?
2. If you are to call Samaritans of Singapore to talk about your feelings, will you be tracked down? (This is my biggest concern)
3. Do u think i am suffering from Major depression? 
-Trouble Concentration
-Suicidal thoughts at times
- Feeling nauseous
-back and chest pain
- irregular breathing
- felt like no one cared about me.


Dont worry too much abt me thinking about death. I am still doing my best to think Positive and i know that life is precious despite feeling like this. I am also thankful to the reddit community for being supportive and Heartwarming.",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/bc4fi4/polytechnic_need_some_advice/,"[""I think what's important for you to know is to not depend on your happiness on your friends/ potential friends. It's about the quality not the quantity. Try to derive your happiness from doing things you like or maybe try to establish a good relationship with your family who are gonna be with you throughout your life rather than your poly friends who may or may not last throughout your life. About your social anxiety it's actually more common than you think! I also have it but I try to take comfort that I'm not the only one and that it's okay to feel anxious talking to new people."", ""Not sure if this will help u :-) you can start by finding joy in small things. Example, meeting a couple of your closer friends for some really nice dinners maybe like kbbq, hotpot etc. I'm a foodie so I like to indulge myself in food haha it makes me vv excited. Slowly you will realise u don't need alot of friends, there will always be that few closer ones you look forward to meeting.""]"
