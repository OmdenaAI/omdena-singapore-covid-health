meltantantantan,o86geo,If you have a phobia of needles‚Ä¶,2021-06-26 15:57:45,singapore,378757,73,244,"Me too. My last jab was 10 years ago when I was 14 and I have avoided going for any jabs since then. As you may guess I also avoided registering for the vaccination for the longest time possible and only did so last Saturday whilst under the perception that I would only get my jab maybe a few months later since i have heard from friends who registered way earlier only being able to book a slot in late July. To my horror i received the sms on Thursday with the only weekend slot being today/tmr. I just had my shot and though I wasn‚Äôt as fortunate as some people who claimed to not feel anything at all, it really wasn‚Äôt very painful. In fact I would describe feeling a dull ache following a small initial pinch. Please note it‚Äôs a small pinch and not an ant bite which everyone uses to describe jabs including the primary school nurse who I believe where my fear stemmed from. The worst feeling was honestly just my anxiety which kicked in when I sat down and the nurse told me to fold up my sleeve. Was on the verge of tears but thankfully no tears flowed out.

Have been looking out for posts here over the weeks in hope to find someone who has a phobia and went for the vaccine but couldn‚Äôt find any. Hence, just wanted to share if any of you guys are terrified of needles, if I can do it, so can you!

Some tips i collated from watching youtube videos till 3am because I was so terrified for the jab :

1. would you rather sit through 2s of a jab or risk getting covid, ending up in the hospital with several needles in you 24/7?

2. think of happy things

3. be honest w the nurse

4. ask questions for distractions 

If you‚Äôve managed to read through this, fellow needle fearing buddy, if i can do it so can you!",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/o86geo/if_you_have_a_phobia_of_needles/,"['As somebody who has a deathly phobia of needles thank you for this post. I‚Äôll be getting my first jab in a few days and I‚Äôm worried it‚Äôll be like when I blacked out getting my blood work done before ORD. \n\nThe phobia is strange as well, anything injection related is horrible but I‚Äôve sat through multiple tattoo sessions with no anxiety or fears. Wonder why that‚Äôs the case.', ""to everybody who is taking the jab, thank you for being brave!\n\nmy favourite one is to take your favourite sweet (preferably a chewy one) before the jab, so as you jab, bite on the sweet. by the time you release the bite, it's over."", ""I went with someone who has extreme phobia of needle. Just to reassure y'all, you can bring someone along to accompany you throughout the process. And if you need to, you can request for a bed to take the jab at the centre.\n\nThey also allow you to continue lying down after the jab for as long as you need until you feel better from your anxiety.\n\nThe people at the vaccine centre are very nice and understanding about it."", ""Having taken many jabs in the recent years (blood draw, flu shot etc), all the times they ask me look away and b4 I knew it was over.\n\nI'd say don't look at the needle for sure. Trust the nurse or just talk to them if they talk to you as it distracts you from the fact that you are taking a jab as they give it to you."", 'i was actually surprised how little pain the jab caused and how quick it was. felt like a sting at worst. meanwhile the tetanus jab i had a year before actually hurt and felt like getting pinched with fingernails', ""I have a phobia of needles, but genuinely this was the least painful jab I've ever received by far. It's like a 0.5/10, so don't worry!"", 'Thank you OP for sharing! I‚Äôm terrified of needles too. After my first jab, I felt dizzy not because of the side effects, but because I saw the needle and cotton wool with my blood on it üòÇ\n\nTo overcome my fear, I scheduled both jabs on weekday evenings so I wouldn‚Äôt have time to think about it when working. Before my first jab, I asked the medical attendant if it would hurt and they were very kind but also amused lol. I must say that the second jab was a lot less anxiety inducing, after knowing what to expect!', 'Hi, the first thing I wouldn\'t recommend is to watch videos about jabs or needles, it\'ll only make your thought process worst  \n\n\nSecondly, when I went for my jab, I asked the nurse how this differs to other types of jabs/injections, so that I can assure myself. She told me that the needle doesn\'t go in as deep as a typical blood draw needle and that it\'s very small and fast unlike the other injections.  I made that comparison and trusted the process.  \n\n\nWhen the jab was administered, it was quick - and within a few 2-3 seconds, it was done. After it was done, I was like ""huh? That\'s it?"" and the nurse told me ""Ya, that\'s it"".   \n\n\nFrom then on, I knew what to anticipate from my second jab! So please, strengthen yourself, and tell yourself that this is for the common good - protecting yourself and others from COVID-19!', 'was scared of needles as well, but times have changed. The medics/nurses can explain to you that they use much thinner needles nowadays (like in the past they used something like 0.5mm needles, for covid vaccination they used 0.3mm)\n\nCan hardly feel it now. if you are scared of needles, my advice is just to look away and read a poster on a wall or something.', 'If your phobia is debilitating, let the nurse know. If it‚Äôs not, I find staring at a clock helps a lot. Just don‚Äôt look at the needle la', ""Bro I have the same phobia.\n\nI was shaking so bad that the medic literally ask if I was OK before the jab.\n\nWORST part is that it was in a fking army camp, and everyone was relaxed af.\n\nFor the second jab I ended up slapping myself so that the pain from my face covers the pain from the jab. Might've looked weird af but, whatever does the job I guess."", 'I used to be really afraid of needles when I was a kid. I wanted to impress a girl when i was like 8/9(?) so i pretended to take the jab while smiling. \n\nFast forward a decade and a few years, I actually look forward to the ""infinite ant bites"" during tattooing. Whoever that girl was that I was trying to impress, thanks for helping me get over the phobia!', ""Mad terrified of needles (don't care whether blood test, flu shot, or any other vaccine), but surprisingly this Covid vaccine injection didn't really sting lmao\n\nTo those who have yet to get their vaccine due to fear of needles, I'd say: Go for it! It really doesn't hurt, seriously :)"", 'As someone who had to get blood drawn frequently when I was a child and had dengue (thus developing a fear of needles), I recommend looking away and taking very deep breaths or coughing when the nurse is about to inject you. Really can‚Äôt notice it if you‚Äôre purposefully coughing', 'Im terrified of needles too. \n\nAlong with cockroaches, jabs are my top phobia. SAF flu shot was the worst. I have never gotten a flu shot by the way. \n\nThe only time when im okay with jabs would be when im knocked out. Im still going for the COVID jab though to protect myself.', 'That ant bite thing was the biggest bullshit I ever heard in my life.', 'This reminds me of when I was in BMT and one guy in the front of the vaccination line passed out even before the medic touched him with the needle...\n\n....laughs were had back then, but thinking back (32 years ago), I feel sorry for the guy. ‚òπÔ∏è', 'I have massive fear of needles, I usually ask for an ice pack to numb the part where needles are going in. It helps.\n\nCovid jab truly felt like an ant bite though. The nurse who did me did it so fast that I felt like it was just 1 sec.\n\nBut I did warn her before hand I am terrible with needles.\n\nUsually I get scream at by nurses to stop moving or to calm down when I scream. Drawing blood is often a traumatizing multiple failed attempts as I move during the needle going in.', ""I've been afraid of needles since I was 6 (pri 1 jab) all the way till now and anyone's who has known me knows I'm deathly afraid of needles (used to have nightmares). I even tried to bargain doing route march than the flu shot back in NS days. However. compared to the army flu shot, the FFI blood work the tetanus jab, heck even the pri5 jab, this one hurt a lot less and most importantly, I didn't really feel it like sinking into my arm. It felt very shallow. I went out of my way to avoid needles as long as I have lived but the fear of long covid outweighed this. Have faith in yourself, you can do it! (can take panadol before going, you'll feel less :D)"", 'This is why nurses normally ask you questions while giving the jab at the same time, so by the time you are ready to flinch, the injection is already done.', ""I have a terrible phobia of needles. When I needed to get my wisdom teeth extracted they had to dig into the gums to get the fragments out, and I literally shook and shuddered throughout the operation, even though I felt no pain after local anaesthesia. It was an uncontrollable reflex that I couldn't stop for the life of me, and in the aftermath the dentist commented that I had the most extreme reaction he'd seen in all his years of practising.\n\nFlash-forward to when I got a deep cut and needed to have it stitched up, and I trembled through that minor surgery as well. Again, not painful physically. But it was the psychological ramifications that pushed me to the brink of near-panic.\n\nSo now that the gory stories are over, I think it's well-established that I have an extreme fear of metals penetrating my flesh, and injections aren't exempt. HOWEVER! I mentioned this to the nurse who gave me my Covid vaccine, and they were very reassuring, telling me to inhale on their instruction, and then exhale when they said to. In between those breaths, the injection was over before I realised, and virtually painless. Some vaccines like the BCG require larger needles (which caused primary school me to have a panic attack - even though I didn't realise I was having one back then - and almost pass out), but the Covid vaccine was a complete breeze, even to a needle-phobic wuss like me.\n\nSo don't let your fear prevent you from getting a life-saving jab! (And not just your life, but those around you as well.) Sometimes what needs to be done just has to be done."", 'The secret is to ask the one doing the jab to give you a heads-up just seconds before administering the procedure. take a very deep inhale and before you know it, it will be all over.\n\nI was scared of needles as well beforehand but I had to take my jab.', ""I'm also afraid of needles, but had to deal with a few jabs and blood tests recently for a surgery. I think it helps to avoid looking at the needle/equipment the entire time i was there. I didn't even know what the needles that went into me looked like. Also helps to focus on doing deep calm breaths. If your mind is running wild, think of what you want later for lunch/dinner. When the nurses drew my blood i told them i was afraid of needles, and they guided me on when to breath in and out (like meditation session). Jabs are generally way faster, it will be over as soon as you feel a prick.\n\nI'm getting my first vaccine shot next week! Excited to finally get some immunity against this shitty virus."", ""I was expecting the injection to be slow like blood tests but it was super quick i.e. 3 seconds(?) and I didn't feel anything. I don't have a phobia of needles but I also don't like looking at the needle either."", ""Thank goodness for this thread! (Makes me feel better of getting the vaccine) \nI‚Äôm getting my 1st dose of vaccine on Wednesday, 30 June. I‚Äôm really scared of needles due to an unpleasant injection experience a long time ago. So, now whenever I need to have an injection, I would always be on a verge of panic attack. üòî\n(Edit : Just came back from my vaccination,heart was racing and I'm trembling all over but the nurse was really friendly and patient with me. For me, there's a slight pinch that lasts for around 2 seconds when the nurse insert the needle but other than that I didn't really feel anything. And now my arm is just a bit sore.)"", 'How I overcome it was: look away, watch tiktok videos on your phone, and also have someone converse with you at the same time (ideally standing in front of and facing you). That sensory overload really helps!! When you have to use your brain to answer a question and also to watch short attention-grabbing video, it helps. (This is coming from someone who would cry, resist, bargain, have a mental breakdown etc years ago). never ever look at the needle because once you do the game is lost..', ""For all the jabs I had to take I just looked away for the whole time until the jab is over, and so far so good.\n\nDuring my first jab I immediately looked away when the person began to take the equipment out. Then she kept asking me to look at her so that she can prove to me the vaccine name and dosage are correct LOL kns I tried to just nod my head and say ok but she kept trying to make me look so bo bian I turned back to look at her while getting an eyeful of needle in the process. So just a heads up in case the same thing happens to you. If it happens again for my second jab I will just be honest and tell them I don't want to look lol. Didn't think of it at that time.\n\nGood luck man."", 'Needle fearer gang unite.', ""Thank you for bringing this up! I have a phobia for needles too (bursttttt into tears during flu jab in sec3 13years ago, got famous in my cohort because of that). Also cried and shouted during wisdom tooth anesthesia and got scolded by the staff haha :'(\n\nWas seriously thinking about skipping the jab but decided to go for it in the end. These helped me during a recent blood test and also the covid jab:\n\n1. Nurses would usually ask people to relax the hand taking the injection, and I think it just makes the anxiety worse because you cant channel it anywhere. So what I do is to clench my fist of the other hand that's not taking the injection, digging my fingers into your palm while clenching. As you start to feel the needle, you can clench harder. Because the jab is less painful than/as painful as your own fingers, you'll end up mentally focusing on your clenched fist more than the needle instead. I use this method for painful facials too. But of course do cut your nails before that in case you cause any injuries \n\n2. Distraction with video and audio, like what other people have commented here. For me, I watched videos of hamsters, my favourite animal :') and the cheerful accompaniment helped a lot with my mood. \n\n3. Comparing to past successes for any uncomfortable procedure. After using the 2 methods above to manage my phobia during the blood test, I could tell myself that if I could go through a blood test, COVID jab shouldn't be a problem. I also ended up realising the first gen of swab test (where they go much deeper into the nose) was actually worse than the covid jab in terms of discomfort levels\n\n\nEven though these helped me not not to cry/struggle during the procedure, it was still scary for me and I became quite light headed after the jab hahahaa. Glad I didn't faint :D"", ""I've had a deep phobia of needles since my childhood. My past vaccines always felt more painful than other people described them to be, no matter how nice or gentle the nurse/doctor was. \n\nGot my COVID vaccine this morning, and I must say this is the only vaccine I've taken in my life where I feel like nobody lied to me about how not-painful it was. In fact my fear of needles in general has *slightly* lessened after this experience. If you got through your compulsory primary 5 vaccination, you can do this. Good luck!"", 'The only bad thing about the jab is that the needle is cold, which kind of just numb the pain to me. I feel the cold more than the pain', ""I have this habit of always looking away or closing my eyes when they're injecting me or drawing blood. The nurse will know I'm scared and usually will inform me right before they do it. It helps when you take a deep breath as they were poking you."", ""Don't look, don't think. \n\nI plug in my headphones, look away and think about what I want to eat for dinner. It just feels like a very, very long and drawn out insect bite."", 'I think look far far away helps', 'I just read the pamphlet while they jabbed me heh', ""I just look away from the needle so I don't know when it's gonna happen.

I almost passed out.', 'I remember back in primary school, I didn\'t give a damn about vaccinations and wondered why all the other kids were going hysterical.\n\nNow that I\'m an adult, for some reason I feel a little bit worried about getting jabbed. Maybe because I actually realised how painful needles are. But man I was confused when I absolutely didn\'t feel the needle during my covid vaccination because of my...

I would very much prefer this to getting a blood test bcos the nurse usually has to take blood from the back of my palm (my veins aren't super visible) and the blood flows quite slowly."", ""Hahaha. Got vaccinated a few months ago.\n\nThe scary part of the needle is the fact that is freaking huge. Like absolutely massive. Like it could go right through me. But turns out he/she will just use the tip and you'll just be a little sore after its all over."", 'I got my ass jabbed last year because I needed antibiotics proto. Guys, this vaccination is easy stuff.', 'I too was hella afraid of needles. Having to draw blood during NS (for enlistment and ORD) was an awfully sweaty experience and I almost felt like passing out.\n\nAfter getting dengue last year and having to do a blood test for 5 days in a row (to check blood platelets level). It has definitely changed my mind and accept that getting jabbed by a needle is FAR from the worst thing that could happen to me.\n\nAs another comment had mentioned, the needles used for covid jab is extremely tiny, you will be just fine.', ""Tbh, what i always do is that i just tell them outright i'm afraid of needles and i dont want to look at it, and they should only tell me when they're done. Not sure if it helps u lmao."", 'I didn‚Äôt want to look at the needle so I said to the nurse can you let me look away first. Then she said ‚Äúsorry what did you say?‚Äù and jabbed me straight away with me looking at the needle LOL.', ""I feel the same as you do. \n\nDespite my parents' constant persuasion for me to register, I did not even attempt to do so because I'm really scared of the jab. Unfortunately, I received the SMS around the first week of June. \n\nI was visibly afraid and even told the nurse that LMAO. Anyways, the jab happened and it's really like nothing and I felt so embarassed of being so scared."", ""I tried to get it over with as soon as possible so the thought of needles wouldn't constantly live rent free in my head"", ""I'm extremely terrified of needles as well, the kind that will tear up even before the injection. Not sure why but I think I'm really sensitive to the feeling of getting poked. I can really feel the sting of the needle (ouch!) and even...feel/sense(?) the metal of the needle. Been this sensitive as far back as kindergarten. Not sure what they were but it was two really painful injections in my butt which led to my current phobia as it is.\n\nMy own methods of getting through them now especially if I'm by myself is to create my own distractions. Pretty much shutting my eyes and playing loud music with my earpiece on which helps me enough to sit through it. With that said, this particular vaccination went much smoother and easier than the previous injections I had. Needle felt thinner too."", 'I was talking to a doctor about injection fears and he just stopped and asked me ""Yeah it\'s scary, but *can you deal with it*?"" It sounds silly but it really made me reframe my fear of it.\n\nThe method that worked for me was actually staring at the needle when it went it. When you see what\'s happening and connect it to the (mild) pain you get a better grasp of what\'s going on and fear it less.\n\nThe final way is the easiest, just ask the nurse to jab you when you cough hard. You probably won\'t feel it go in.', ""I don't have a very strong phobia now but I used to be quite scared, I would usually scream at blood tests or any other injections when I was a kid. Eventually I had to go for way more blood tests, injections etc due to health issues and NS so I'm more used to it now but it still scares me a bit every time. For the COVID vaccine I got my first dose recently and it's pretty much painless when they inject you, the real pain if any comes after when your arm and muscles get sore. Just try to take deep breaths and hold onto something like the chair if possible, I always try to remind myself the fear of the pain is worse than the pain itself."", ' If tattoos doesnt trigger the phobia, have you tried closing your eyes and try to think of the injection as a tattoo session instead? Hearing the sound of a tattoo machine in your earphones might help with the counterconditioning. \n\nIt might not 100% cause the fear to go away, but might help you tahan through until the injection is over so that you dont tense up too much.', ""I think it's part of SOP to ask as well."", "">obia of needles thank you for this post.

element3254,msjmdg,"[O levels][Poly] Discussing Social Anxiety in Schools. To those with social anxiety, how did you fare in school?",2021-04-17 12:02:31,SGExams,77673,40,223,"Hello r/SGExams, I have been reading a book about social anxiety and it really showed me that people really have it worse and are often pushed aside or not really thought about it especially in schools. 

Disclaimer: I'm just putting my thoughts as what I have learnt about the anxiety people face and wish to produce a discussion here as I believe learning about the people around you helps you to be a better person in general. There is a tl;dr at the end  


**We all have some level of Social Anxiety**

That feeling of ""damn, shit. I'm nervous, what if I screw this up"" , the sudden increase in heart rate as you are asked to do something or worse present in front of class. 

The common advice we hear is to not just step out of the comfort zone and put yourself out there and most people can do that just fine. But there is that group unheard, and usually unnoticed. The super quiet type, not because they don't like people and don't like to talk but their brain is constantly scaring them from making the smallest step in interacting with people. Those are the ones with Social Anxiety Disorder or SAD for short.   


I kinda feel bad for these group of people cause I didn't really learn about them in school and who knows the people around you that are actually suffering from it. 

&#x200B;

**Shy/ Introvert vs Socially Anxious** 

It's very common to label these people or just shy or introverted because it is more likely. 

Introversion does not equal shy. Introvert gain energy through social interactions, if you feel tired after talking to people you are most likely introverted. You can be the most confident person in the room but also be the introverted one depending on your ""social battery"" 

Shy people are those who feel uncomfortable being nudged into social interaction, be it the presentation in front of the class or even feeling lost during conversation with friends because you feel like you have nothing to say.  But for one, they usually have experiences of being comfortable socially in their very close friend groups.

Those suffering with SAD are what I would like to call the socially anxious. They seem to experience anxiety in a very strong level.  The very strong feeling of what the average person might feel. They can find themselves thinking about a social interaction that day for the whole night, or getting a strong panic feeling once being put in a place where they have to speak up. 

I can't begin to imagine what it was like to have that feeling as I learn more about the disorder and what some may face. If you don't have social anxiety, imagine the heart racing feeling you might experience times 10. And having your own inner thoughts constantly judging you and thinking you will fail if you do something as simple as asking the time. 

If you think you might have SAD, do look up the [DSM-5 criteria of diagnosis](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/social-anxiety-disorder-(social-phobia)-dsm--5-300.23-(f40.10)).

**What can we do to help?** 

I believe the first step in just being a humane person is to just accept and acknowledge these people and not increase their feeling of constantly being judged by people. 

Don't ask ""Why are you so quiet"" that everyone hates hearing. If you do care about them, just ask how they're feeling genuinely

If you are friends with any shy/social anxious person, do acknowledge their attempts at interaction. To just acknowledge what they say if you hear it and not interrupt them and further push back their attempts socially. 

&#x200B;

**What can schools do?** 

I do believe when teachers encourage students to improve their public speaking skills or interacting with group mates in lessons is very important. However, it must be done in a way that is inclusive while lending a hand to people who really feel uncomfortable. 

Exposure to social anxiety is important (and mental health in general) To those unaffected, it will never cross their minds to believe that someone could be so anxious that they want to never speak. 

Lastly, teachers need to be aware that there might be people who are struggling and they really need the helping hand to push forward in their lives. Young teens may not even realise that they have a problem until it becomes too late.

**Things to think about**

Can you think of people around you that may have struggled with their social anxiety. 

Have you struggle with your own level of social anxiety? 

Is your level of social anxiety too much to handle? If so, find help in any way you can (friend or a trusted adult)

&#x200B;

tl:dr Social anxiety is something everyone faces but there are some that are unable to handle the load on their mental health and I believe learning about it can bring about better inclusion with others around you.

And I remember there was a time where I got so anxious I wasn‚Äôt helping enough to the project that I started tearing up in class.\nI would like to say thank you for this post OP, I agree with a lot of your points', ""I don't know and don't think I have SAD but I'm kinda socially anxious in certain occasion since primary school. I'm shy/introvert but I still want to talk to people but it's just so hard to express myself to friends until recently. I'm totally fine with my family though.\n\n**[Primary School]**\n\nIn primary school, everyone just feel so scary to me and Idk what my mind was thinking back then. I wanted to talk and make new friends, but I can't because I lack the confidence to approach. There were some kind classmates who either talked to me occasionally or once in a blue moon. But I can't help but feel like it's out of pity because no one else seemed to approach me. When my teacher gave me a high leadership role in class (ideky..), I hated it. \n\nI knew I wouldn't be able to do well and I wish people can just talk loudly, act normally like how they do with others but whenever I talked to the class, it was really quiet. I understand, they were just paying attention to this classmate who rarely talks but I don't like the silence. I'm happy though that sometimes, me and 1/2 classmates would go home together and just talk about our day. It seemed like that's the only time I feel like I can talk the most casually. Otherwise, there were actually days when I go to school speaking only a few words or sentences. Somehow, I managed to do well in school though but it feels kinda sad that my achievements was probably what people remember me for. Unlike many people who looked forward to school to see their friends, the lack of friends and social interaction made me look forward to school because of the teachers and the joy of learning.\n\n**[Secondary school]**\n\nSecondary school was much better though, especially in Upper Sec. Probably because I entered secondary level with the mindset of wanting to be more confident in talking to people and making friends. I like observing my class a lot, since I was at a seat whereby I can see what is happening around. It was to the point I know the character traits/personality of my classmates just through observing. Even if I didn't talk to them, it's as if I talk to them because I observe their interactions with others.\n\nSecondary school had a few group work tasks, so I guess that kinda helped me to be given the opportunity to talk? I realised I'm better talking in smaller groups but can barely handle it talking in a big crowd like in front of a class.\n\nIn Lower Sec, it was first time asking if I can join a group and it felt heavy doing it because I was scared of being rejected. But they gladly welcomed me and that might have had a positive impact. I also became good friends with one of them and probably the first person I hang out with after school hours. Though I don't like some of my classmate's personality, I'd rather be with them than any of my primary school classes since they seem more willing to approach this classmate. But I hated it whenever I'm seated beside someone whom I have no confidence to talk to and it's unbearably awkward when other seatmates can talk to each other normally and then there's me. It's not like I don't want to talk, I just don't know how to start a conversation and probably my seatmate didn't know how to either.\n\nIn Upper Sec, it was a smaller class but it feels more bonded though I hated some of their rowdiness. I feel more comfortable in this class and I'd say though I'm not exactly close with most of them and of course there's still awkwardnes to a degree. But most of them were a bunch of people who were willing to talk to anyone and act like themselves regardless of your personality. They'd be the ones starting a conversation first, which helps me to also carry on the conversation casually. There were many funny moments with my seatmates and also classmates approaching me for help in a subject (since I was one of the few in class who does very well in the subject) gave me the confidence to talk and help them. Man, I even put in extra effort to make notes that could explain the concepts in a much more simplified manner (since textbooks can be long winded and the English too chim to grasp). Just for them. And the look of relief when they finally understood the concept or question is an immense joy to me.\n\nI also made friends whom I occassionally contact or hang out with even after graduation. My Upper Sec teachers were also very nice and I appreciate the attention they give me though I feel very bad whenever I screwed up by not finishing my homework.\n\nBut outside of my form class, I still experienced this fear though and lowkey isolated myself whenever it's mother tongue time. Ideky, my batch of mother tongue classmates are probably some of the nicest and least problematic out there but I have this unreasonable fear of talking to them. They're mostly introverted too and well-mannered but we only talked occasionally and outside of class discussion, no one except for one or two seemed to talk or approach me. Whenever we wait to enter the class, I always feel very awkward because everyone else seem comfortable with each other and then there's me. Tbh I come to mother tongue class looking forward to my teachers and some funny classmates (imagine if they weren't there, my day would feel so boring üò©).\n\n**[TERTIARY]**\n\nI feel like it was back to square one in trying to gain confidence but at least I made some friends. But seriously, my fear of talking to people came back again though it wasn't as bad as primary school. I was more confident in talking to my CCA friends than my classmates and when I told my CCA friend that I'm not confident in talking, she was surprised because I seemed talkative/confident to her. \n\nI just have that fear of rejection or being talked over, that's why I rather do things alone not because I don't want to be with people, but the negative assumption of people (ignoring me) that I had in my mind, makes me rather be alone. Whenever I'm in groups, I feel like a filler member because the lack of confidence somewhat affected my willingness to put in more effort. I wasn't a confident speaker like the rest but I did try to practice rehearsing more and my groupmates did compliment everyone's effort no matter how good or bad we turn out, so that kinda gives me strength in a way though I still feel bad for them. \n\nI hated it whenever we have those personality or character traits game since my classmates don't know me at all since we rarely talked outside group assignmemts and we weren't too comfortable with each other. I was barely involved in the game and it was unbearable for me since I just put on a smile that was lowkey shivering just because I don't want to look aloof. \n\nBut somehow, in my last year of school, I managed to break out of my shell and got more confident in speaking. Thanks to a Kpop group lol. You might want to check out my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/mqrrm7/its_cravitys_1st_anniversary_and_i_have_many/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on how it helped me become more confident in speaking, writing and expressing myself. But all these years since primary school, Kpop has always been my coping mechanism after a day of dealing with unbearable awkwardness in school. But I'd also thank my groupmates too for finally wanting to put in more effort to know each other especiallly since we went through so much difficulties together."", 'I teared up bc i felt so heard. \n\nI feel like my social anxiety is a result of build-up over the years and it got more evident?/worse when i got to my tertiary education.

I feel like it‚Äôs bad luck for people to have me in their teams. \n\nI‚Äôve received a lot of feedback from teachers telling me to interact with my teammates more or made me feel that my part of the presentation was lacking. As a result my grades and gpa dropped and i skipped school as a form of avoidance which made my gpa dropped even more. Which is kind of awful bc i did wanted to go to uni but considering my gpa now i don‚Äôt think i can make it. I wasn‚Äôt eating in school and my weight got to 3x.xkg.

I just kept pushing myself to talk and socialise in Poly. The key mindset is that everyone is new and is learning in life so they are very similar to you. With that mindset I just forced myself to interact during Poly orientation and it turned out fairly well', 'I had always been quite a socially reclusive kid. From my primary to secondary school years I had always tried to mask it with confidence and nonchalance whenever I feel it creeping on me. Remembering the nausea, panic and stress that I went though trying to keep up my fake confidence and not wanting people to make fun of me. \n\nTo keep up this confidence I kind of turned to substances to quiet the doubts in my head but I think I just came out more fucked even after being sober because I never really learned how to cope with people staring at me weirdly and thinking that everyone is using me/hates me/gossiping about me because whenever that happens I just get high or drunk. Now I have no shield and it\'s getting pretty scary. \n\nI guess in my brain I thought of how much people hated me whenever I went to school. I always skipped school because I was bullied/teased quite a bit. I also never went for any camps or excursions because I didn\'t want to be around people/ sleep with strangers in the same tent in a foreign place because I was probably going to do something stupid to make them hate me.\n\nWith presentations. They sucked I remmeber I cried during my first presentation because I was so nervous and was shaking so hard. I still do this but on a lesser degree, I try to keep my deliveries confident but the only difference between now and then was that I don\'t cry anymore lol. But whenever I\'m up there presenting. The guy in my brain is like ""hey you fucking idiot, people are judging you for your shaky voice. You sound so stupid and uncredible, how do you even expect people to think you researched what you are saying if you can\'t even deliver it correctly?"" And I start to panic live with classmates watching. \n\nI got frequent anxiety attacks in school, I usually masked it quite not decently. When I have a attack I get extremely quiet and kind of catatonic? I don\'t speak or move until my brain stops buzzing, even when someone speaks to me. \n\nI find my whole ordeal quite hilarious because due to this I was too afraid to talk to anyone about how I was feeling. I had never been to a counsellor because that situation of being alone with a stranger to talk about my deepest problems isn\'t something I want to experience. Also thinking of going to therapy after I get a stable job with enough funding but I also don\'t want to go to my GP and tell them I need a referral. So I just live with it. I don\'t know if I\'m getting better but I pray it\'s just a chemical imbalance so I\'m waiting til my early 20\'s after my brain developed and my hormones calm down if I would be better. Because that\'s literately my only hope for the future rn.', 'I started showing symptoms of SAD in late 2016, self-diagnosed myself and had a psychiatrist confirm my diagnosis in 2017 (Sec 1) and as of 2019 I no longer have SAD. Here\'s what I have to share: \n\nTo start off, I\'m not a very sociable person. I frequently have trouble with social interactions. Sure I have some close friends, but most of the time I\'m pretty awkward when I interact with others. My psychiatrist said I might be on the spectrum, but I haven\'t been officially diagnosed. So I was (still am) slightly anxious when interacting with others. \n\nI think the incident which triggered for my social anxiety was when I was shouted at by my father\xa0 at lvl 1 of a shopping centre atrium(?) of a shopping centre for around 20 seconds (he had every right to scold me in that case, but he didn\'t have to shout). Everyone from the 1st to 5th story was looking at me. I\'m not gonna elaborate on the amount of humiliation I felt that day. \n\nSince then, I started to become extremely self conscious about everything I did. I was afraid of people\'s judgement of me based on everyday stuff like: \n\n‚Ä¢ How fast I was walking (afraid I was walking too fast or too slow)\n‚Ä¢ My speech (I sometimes speak too fast and mess up my pronunciation as a result)\n‚Ä¢Which part of the corridor or pathway I was walking on (whether I was too close to the edge or the centre, especially when someone else was walking towards me from the opposite direction)\n‚Ä¢ Where I positioned myself when on the bus/MRT (I was usually standing)\n‚Ä¢ The way I had to ask other people to make way for me to alight the bus/MRT when it was packed\n‚Ä¢ The way I ordered food at the canteen\n‚Ä¢ Any and all other actions I did during social interactions \n\nI started having anxiety whenever I left my house. The anxiety I was feeling was even more extreme when I was in school, since repeated interactions with people in school meant that I was more likely to be judged, and that people were more likely to remember any ""stupid"". things I did. To be fair, I\'m sort of a judgemental person, and I remember little details or actions people have done for years. So at that time I felt that my fear of being judged was justified. \n\nWhenever I was anxious, my heart would beat really fast,\xa0 I would sweat a lot and get sweaty palms, and my thoughts would be completely focused on what was causing the anxiety and I would have trouble getting a clear train of thought. I would mess up my speech even more than before. In extreme cases, I would have a mental breakdown and cry. \n\nMy social anxiety was at its highest in 2017, the year when Secondary school started. Orientation was pretty tough for me, since I knew no one in my class, and only had 3 people from my primary school (who I wasn\'t friends with) in sec school. I had anxiety throughout the orientation programme, especially during activities like sharing about myself, ice breakers, stage performance etc etc. I was afraid of asking questions in class and didn\'t seek consultation with teachers because I feared that I would waste my teacher and classmates\' time, and that people would resent me for it. I also had fear of talking to others, since I couldn\'t pronounce some words clearly and people had to ask me to repeat what I was saying (I was\xa0 recommended by a few people to go for speech therapy, that shows how bad my speech is). I hardly contributed during group discussions and project work out of fear of being judged for giving a stupid input. I was anxious while queuing up and ordering food because of my speech problem and how it would delay people waiting for their food. I feared PE lessons because I had poor performance in sports. PE games really spiked my anxiety because I was bad at some games and made my team lose. \n\nI thought that this level of anxiety was normal for people, and never discussed it with anyone. Sometime that year, I started realising that this anxiety was not normal and not everyone had such high levels of anxiety that I had. I searched up my symptoms and found out about SAD. A few weeks later, I had an anxiety attack in a movie theater that made me cry in the theater. I finally told my parents about my symptoms and asked for medical assistance. \n\nI went to the Child Guidance Clinic and was officially diagnosed with SAD. There, my psychiatrist gave me plenty of insight and advice, which allowed me to ""cure"" my SAD. \n\nFirstly, she told me that most people don\'t really judge you. Most people will forget any ""dumb"" thing you did in a day or two. And as for the judgmental people, she said that the judgment didn\'t matter. So what if people judge you? Why do you have to care about their judgement of you? How would it personally affect you? As I started thinking about it, I started realising that the judgement didn\'t really matter. \n\nThere was also the issue of my confidence. Being more confident really helps in reducing anxiety. One of the ways to boost confidence is to have proper body posture for something like walking. I started taking slightly longer strides, looking straight ahead at eye level instead of looking down, allowing my arms to move naturally instead of keeping them stiff at my sides, and walking at a pace that I was comfortable with. ""Facing your fears"" is also another way to improve your confidence, so I started getting consultations with teachers, then eventually progressed to asking questions in class when I needed help. I started speaking up more in class, giving more inputs during discussions and eventually managed to lead a few discussions in group/project work. But this exposure to our fears must be paced properly. You can\'t expect someone who has SAD to transform from speaking one or two lines for a group presentation to making speeches during school assembly in a few days. \n\nIt\'s important to have a support system as well. I shared my fears or any ""incidents"" with my parents and they supported me thoughout this part of my life. I also had a close friend in school who supported me. He frequently gave me advice on what to do in social interactions and helped me whenever I had an anxiety spike. \n\nEventually, I cared less about people\'s judgement, became more confident, and with support of family, friends and my psychiatrist, I no longer have SAD. I\'m still more anxious than most people when interacting with unfamiliar people, when being awkward in social interactions, and whenever I have group presentations. But I no longer have extreme anxiety and I\'m not afraid of leaving the house anymore. \n\nMy essay writing skills aren\'t the best and I didn\'t really proofread, so I hope that I wasn\'t too long-winded and that this helps anyone who\'s reading this!', 'Thank you for making this post\n\nI struggle with social anxiety and i used to be unable to post/write online due to anxiety. Texting was also bad for me especially texting to people I\'m not close with. (F2F is still bad even now) surprisingly multiplayer games with chats helped me to be able to slowly overcome my anxiety to type/post online since sometimes you meet people who likes to chat. (Being anonymous on the internet helped a lot)\n\nWhen I was in primary/secondary school I would usually skip if I\'m late for school. I guess I did ok in primary/secondary since I was able to graduate and go to a school/course in poly I wanted üòÖ\n\nThings like talking to teachers is also hard so most of the time I wouldn\'t ask for consultations unless I went with a friend. If I didn\'t know something I would just google or ask my friends. (Presentation sucks)\n\nI couldn\'t really ask help from my parents (and they are quite dismissive of what I\'m facing lmao) or friends cause like what you said they aren\'t familiar with mental health issues.\n\nI can\'t go to imh and get clincially diagnosed either since that required my parents knowing about it. So I\'m stuck with conselling (still good tho but no meds)\n\nEither way I did get help recently in the end but I wish more people were educated about mental health because if someone really thinks that they have issues what they are experiencing would be dismissed as ""oh that\'s normal"" ""nah you\'re just shy"" etcc and in the end they never receive help or just doesn\'t look for help since the person thinks they themselves are overreacting and that they don\'t need help.\n Source: me who struggled many years and not realising it wasn\'t just shyness\n\nSorry if it\'s a long comment', 'After seeing your insightful discussion about social anxiety, I really wish there were more people especially lecturers in polytechnic would be more understanding to people with social anxiety participating in class discussion. Personally I see my level of anxiety as pretty high as I was diagnosed with severe anxiety consisting of social anxiety and GAD. I would say participating in class has been really rare as the anxiousness and struggle to not breakdown and have an anxiety attack without thinking others are looking/judging is really hard.I would not continue with the details but everyday is just constant panic.As a freshman in my Polytechnic,my polytechnic emphasises on participating everyday for my class discussion for my daily grade,and I didn\'t write my diagnosis in filling out my details because I wanted to prove to myself that people who struggle can do it too or be even better.But with this invalidating doubt from others about mental illness especially some adults , it still is hard voicing about our mental health.Even with the notion ""you aren\'t alone"" , have we actually lend a listening ear and extensive care to someone who is alone and suffering , of course they are busy but this notion is hypocritical. But I agree with what teachers/lecturers can do to help students with social anxiety but I\'m just curious if the implication of you have to act like "" you\'re a business person"" have forcefully kicked mental health out of the picture as Im from a business course and I would like to hear your insight from it . But lastly i appreciate you speaking out on these issues so that people with anxiety has a voice to look out to, with that thank you :)', 'Hi, i\'m personally in uni rn, and I still face the same issue. Last time I used to be a girl who would stay silent and stand in front of the class when the teacher asks me to present.\n\nThe increase in heartbeat and anxiety attacks still happens for me despite the years of presentation experience. I try to ignore them while presenting, and just make sure I know what i\'m saying. \n\nIf you realise, most presenters do mess up when they are presenting, followed by a, ""sorry I meant this not that."" Realising this helped me put a lot less pressure on myself. It\'s the realisation that it\'s not only okay to screw up but it\'s perfectly normal. No presentations go perfectly. People honestly don\'t care about a minor blunder or you saying the wrong thing (even a major blunder is excusable sometimes) as long as you correct it afterwards.\n\nHowever, even though I say all these, my friends (and definitely the audience) can still hear my nervousness from across the room. My voice trembles when I speak, and my whole body also starts trembling. I\'ve learnt to tell myself it\'s okay to have my anxiety attacks, don\'t let it get the better of you. Let it happen and live with it, don\'t need to try to get rid of it! So every presentation now has me with a trembly voice - but imo if i present the content necessary, it\'s a success!', 'Thanks so much for this post. For 18 years of my life, I thought that I was just shy or introverted, but turns out I just have social anxiety (undiagnosed). Gotta thank social media for this one.\n\nI remember that in Pri 1 you had a lunch buddy for a few weeks, and despite my head saying ""talk to him! just say what you\'re thinking!"", nothing came out. It felt like a knot in my throat, and I never managed to say a word to him at all. He asked me what I\'d like to eat for two or three days and I stared back at him, and then he just gave up. I felt really bad but happy when he finally left me alone, as I couldn\'t order any food with him following me everywhere.\n\nThe same thing happened when I had a buddy when I was Pri 3. She asked me how to pay sixty cents to one of the stalls, and I could only stare back at her despite me wanting to answer her. I felt so guilty that I couldn\'t give her a reply.\n\nIn school, whenever the teacher students to each read one line of a paragraph according to the seating plan, I would count the number of students and try to find the line that I was supposed to read, and practice it multiple times in my head. It was worse when you had to stand up in class, because it felt like everyone was staring and judging you. It felt like I was in an unwanted spotlight. If you could leave after finishing a test, I would wait for someone (or two, or three) students to submit their papers before I dared to submit mine. Social anxiety also made me be more prepared. I would bring all the pens and tools I needed (eg. curve ruler, graph paper) so that I didn\'t need to ask from anyone (cause I can\'t).\n\nI don\'t really know how I got over a big 50% of it since then, but I can order food outside now, and ask strangers for directions instead of relying on signs and gut feeling before GPS was available (only when I REALLY can\'t find my way though), and being able to contribute in group discussions (still shuts down when I feel unwanted or unneeded though). I\'ve also noticed that my heart gets pumping really fast, hands get sweaty and I subconsciously start shaking my leg a lot before a big thing, eg. interview, presentation, etc., and I notice that my stomach churns and gets upset right before it too (probably a flight response). \n\nI think that before schools can start to help (teachers can be more lenient on such students), governments should educate on social anxiety and other mental health related issues. The lack of education in areas that play such a prevalent part in our lives can affect the way teens feel about themselves, rob them of opportunities since no help is sought, and in serious cases, be life-threatening.', ""I do not have SAD but am just shy and introverted.\n\nIn Secondary school, I had a small handful of friends that I'm close to.

Believe in your material, and assume a position or a role to do your presentation. For example, if your presenting solutions then u can pretend to be like a salesman making a pitch to a targeted audience! Reason for this is because sometimes although u add ur intonations and clarity and memorize etc.. but it still comes out weird and awkward. Your audience and hence your examiners will not feel swayed or convinced by your presentation (although the material is hypothetical) and view it as if its just words, not a presentation. Reciting back the script is just one component of a presentation, the key point many people miss out on is to be a convincing presenter. Believe in your material, and believe in what you are pushing for/selling/saying will make a whole lot of difference between a speech and a pitch\n\n2) Use eye contact to your advantage. Maintain strong eye contact with your audience/examiners, this will convey a feeling of confidence as a presenter, and will also be seen as more convincing and a better presentation overall. Also, smile more to seem more approachable and friendly \n\n3) This is something i do, it may sit differently with different people but i enjoy pacing around a mini area i draw up in my head in the area allocated to me, and move to different corners and rarely stand still at any one point in time. I do this for 2 reasons: to seem more ""down to earth"" and make a better connection and to prevent monotonality. I also vary the speeds at which i present my material, slowing down and emphasizing on certain words in important parts of the presentation to drive a strong message across.\n\n4) I use hand gestures, 3 actually on repeat. Usually ill use these only 3 and i copied them from donald trump (lol dont bash me its so intuitive HAHA) and occasionally speakers such as obama and lee kuan yew. Their hand gestures ARE NOT random, and are used at junctures to further emphasize on a point or on a statement. Overuse or underuse will only lead to ineffectiveness of the hand gestures and make you look stupid tbh (like some of the other members op i observed). ALSO DONT PAUSE RANDOMLY without INTENT, it looks so awkward. If need be just smile it off, look at your slide, point at it and continue\n\n5) About slides usage, for me im not a huge fan of slides because they serve as visual aids. For me i prefer to embody this visual aid, and my op had only 5 slides for my 5 minute presentation. Reason i choose to do this is because unless it requires heavy visualization, words are more often or not the preferred and better choice to use! ive seen so many unnecessary slides, like ""STOP DONT DO THAT"" or ""MONEY BAG PICTURE"" like sure u can use them but if ur not gonna refer to them why even include them. I always put big ideas on slides, and expand on them using script.\n\nIn summary, the trick to a good op is to be believable (by first believing it yourself), be convincing and persistent while maintaining confidence (eye contact, movement, gestures, intonations), and most importantly try to develop a connection within the 5 minutes with the audience. Use empathy and feelings in your script, no one likes an aloof speaker building their sandcastles in their air. Be a speaker that builds a sandcastle that everyone can see, understand and appreciate! Also, i always watch politicians, leaders and ted talks before a presentation. I rarely watch motivational pitches because those appeal alot to the audience; and its dependent on your personality how u wish to build this relationship. \n\nTo combat nervousness, for me i always tell myself before any presentation or in particular op, i kept reminding myself that ""i am a presenter pitching for a solution for this company, to seek funds and support"". I never ever go ""today op exam jialat"". hack your brain to believe that there is a purpose for your speech instead of being ""an exam"", and the words will flow much more naturally and consistently. No nervous jitters at all because ur not taking an exam in ur head!\n\nIf u need any last minute tips or help just dm me, im always available. Cheers!', 'I have the same problem your post actually reminded me of myself during pw I m really shy and I try to avoid presenting as much as possible but then when it comes to op who can avoid right \n\nDuring the ""prelims"" for PW I also flunked it so I was super anxious for it too and I just froze there LOL \nBut then one thing that helped was that me and my group mates practiced like crazy like we memorised and said it probs like everyday b4 the actual op and we practiced tgt. If you can try and get used to practicing in front of your grpmates cuz if u cannot overcome the feeling of them judging you its gonna be worse when u actually do it with them and an extra audience and more teachers HAHAHA\nIf you could find the other ppl in your shift through social media and practice with them it will help a lot \n\nDun bee stressed that you will look stupid cuz who doesn\'t feel like they look stupid when they do op mann with all the weird ass hand gestures and all pft\n\nTalk slowly too dun go too fast cuz you will tend to forget stuff. Once you find a pace your comfortable with, u will kinda glide through it super smoothly \n\nMy group also had the quietest girl in class and she also had a phobia like me but we both managed to get an A for PW so I believe u can too!!

I had to go through TWO blood tests after this incident (due to an unrelated medical condition) and I just told the doctor (different clinic) I‚Äôm scared and she let me play a game on my phone (with my other arm/hand) to distract myself. I still felt super terrified (to the point where my blood pressure shot up to hypertension levels for about 30-45min) but having a distraction really really helped me.\n\nedit: I also think getting that letter from IMH was a very smart move and I hope it‚Äôs accepted.', 'Used to have this problem too bk in sec sch, albeit not to the extent of fear of urs, yet I somehow managed to get dengue fever in sec 3 & had to go for a compulsory blood test.

Crineas,f46p71,"Redditors of Singapore, let's donate our blood!",2020-02-15 16:24:35,singapore,378757,68,268,"Hi! Just wanted to encourage others on the fence on donating amidst the n2019 coronavirus outbreak in the city. I went down to bloodbank@Dhoby Ghaut and it was right at the mrt itself located about a minute walk from the platform.

The venue was sanitized and there is a temperature screening station, it took about a 10 minutes wait for me to be registered and another 10 minute to go through a blood prick test to check my haemoglobin and a doctor screening to review my declarations. 

Waiting for a bed might take longer but I was ushered in immediately as there was an open bed, and the nurses was thorough in ensuring it was a smooth experience. 

I have a phobia of needles but it helped that the nurse attending to me exercised care and was communicative, just bring your phone and earpieces and close your eyes during the procedure of them setting up your intravenous line if you tend to get afraid too. :)

15 or so minutes later, and the machine started beeping to signal I was finished, and another nurse helped remove the line and needle. A short wait later and she bandaged me up and provided a small booklet on when I could donate next and a supplement tablet of iron. 

There's refreshment area for doners before you leave and I helped myself to oreo and apple juice after washing my hands and there was cookies and raisins available too!

It was a sanitized and smooth experience despite the crisis Singapore is going through and I would encourage anyone eligible and able to donate. I hope someone may find this informative and decide to do so themselves!

Here's the link to a page showing 4 locations administered by HSA in partnership with the red cross. The same page contains a quick questionnaire to check if you are eligible, such as being above 18 I believe is one major condition.

endlessdispair,g8adid,"I'm desperate already, need urgent housing options/mental health help.",2020-04-26 15:41:06,singapore,378757,40,87,"Diagnosed with depression for some years already, but still living. With Aspergers but dropout because of anxiety in school. Bright future gone, depression sets in FAST. Living with single parent (mother) in HDB rental, 1 room 1 hall nia. small but agreeable honestly, alive is good. Not optimal but not bad. Can get by.

But i think my condition getting worse, anxiety/panic attack started in 2019 December. Certain x activities started to become my triggers for the panic attack. When it happens i'm frozen in terror and need to sit around to make sure said fears don't turn out. Explains to mom, but she thinks i'm crazy, unreasonable. Continue to do said x things. Don't care about my condition. Continues life as if nothing has changed, continue to ask if i want x/do x.

&#x200B;

I think don't need to say, Mom is a bit narcissistic, a bit apathetic. University educated but not very interested in critical thinking, standard Asian mom don't like being spoken back to. Bad combination, cannot convince, cannot change, cannot even suggest she might be wrong. Her comments/suggestions/""life lessons"" are wild, random and often ungrounded in reality, but must take seriously or you're biased and ""always disagreeable to me"". She's supremely trigger-happy on blocking people on FB, should give inkling of what kind of person (apparently FB not enough of an echo chamber). 

Personally i think she has her own mental issues as well, i wont divulge here but she has tendencies of hoarding, as well as keeping rotting food around. Don't know if its the laze of disposing them or hoarding the food, even way past its edibility. But nevermind, no-one will know since she wont look for help and no-one will diagnose her. all is fine and dandy from the point of an outsider but i'll have to see/smell rotten food every once in 1-2 week or so. disgusted beyond words. Not even sure if phobia of x was sparked from this. 

&#x200B;

Then suddenly pandemic happen. Huat ar circuit breaker next, forced to be 24/7 with her (maybe not 24/7, she still insist to go out to mall for whole afternoon to blow air con). Go clinic ask doctor for letter to be ""excused from maskwearing"", cuz apparently she hates to wear. As the stay at home becomes longer, x becomes increasingly popular. Before CB, had verbal agreement that x is not very conducive to my welbeing so don't do x. Situation changed apparently, she doesn't care anymore. x is again back on the table, and any attempt to suggest not to do x is met with usual ""don't control me"" along with sprinkling of verbal abuse. Very standard asian parenting. I cry, she scream more. Scream even when i'm on the phone with IMH. IMH proceeds to tell me they can't do much, advice me to voluntarily admit myself to IMH A&E. Mom hears, immediately emboldened. Good job there IMH.

Apparently there won't be much mental health resource available, at least not from the hospitals. I feel like i'm on my own. very much on my own now during this period of CB, and ngl it seems like even beyond the CB. 

&#x200B;

I've seem a variety of professionals for help. Hospital, IMH, FSC, they agree got problem (other than the actual depression) but is family problem, so no active solution. Mom must willingly agree to talk. Mom ownself check ownself, no problem, no need talk. case closed. 

She's not going to change, my only option truly limited to moving out or on the lucky chance, someone with legal authority reaches out to her, with or without her consent (she can't block law, i hope). moving out is also difficult, i'm low income (more accurate no income atm), which really reduces open market options to essentially 0. Truly endless dispair with no real way out. She goes around touting me as a pity case to friends and needs money to take care of me but abuse me at home. Pui. Don't get me wrong, we do need some assistance, but she pockets them whenever i'm in the dark about it.

&#x200B;

I hope the sarcastic/comedic tone doesn't change the impression of how desperate i really am now. I only see bleak option ahead, no actual action to be taken except medication and beg that mother has the desire to be more understanding of me. Perhaps the lighter tone helps me grapple with the grim facts. 

Last 2 week ago i saw a post of someone's attempt. I'm glad he's alright. I always had thoughts but never really intent to. Its just scary to live life having to consider that as an out road. I take suicide very seriously, as permanent it is, it deserves its gravity. But i am the sort to be looking for a permanent solution from this nightmare, I'm just sure hoping it wont have to be \*that\* one. 

I hope this last ditch attempt for some attention for help will get me some. Because i seriously dk what to do already.

&#x200B;

I typed this last night and decided not to post; i hoped not to bring too much attention to myself.

And when you are too poor to take a trip overseas, buy your own house for separation or live with another relative, that means getting yourself warded at IMH and engaging the social worker to intervene. I\'m not sure how ""forceful"" they can get, but imo a forceful intervention is the only way to go. Ultimately, you wanna give yourself options and the fastest way is to get the relevant people involved than googling for it and trying to resolve it on your own. \n\n# If you think IMH can help, read on\n\nI\'m not sure what your depression diagnosis is, and I don\'t understand how IMH differentiate / discriminate(?) between their mental patients but some are allowed to go to MDU or EPIP (special programs with special treatments, in a totally different environment) while others can only stay in the general ward with general treatment options. The general ward is well... let\'s not even consider that unless you can afford B1 and higher. In your case, you wanna get to MDU which is the Mood Disorder Unit, and depression falls under it. MDU has C class and B class as well, and from what I understand is, what/how a world class mental health standard should be. MDU also provide better treatment options... but you have to be reviewed to be able to eligible for MDU. The website suggest that direct admission to MDU is available but from when I ask my reviewing doctor, she says general ward first then review for eligibility. And then also whether there is available bed. During my stay in the general ward, I was recommended for MDU but I never got transferred there so... \\*scratch head\\*\n\nThe A&E can be a little intimidating, try to ask a friend to go along with you. It helps, especially if you ask the friend to stay during the \\*cough\\* interrogation in the doctor room. Doctor will ask the friend to leave (for various reasons), but you have the rights to request for your friend to stay and listen. It also gives the doctor a chance to ask your friend for more info about yourself. Just in case the doctor thinks you are not yourself in this moment, they like to play mind games and make you doubt yourself. \n\nFinally there\'s the cost of your stay. If you\'re in danger to yourself / the public, the mental health act can be enacted by the doctor and you will be ""asked"" to stay for observation(warded), but actually you have no other choice to reject. In this event, its free. Your entire stay will be covered by IMH but it will be in the shitty general ward, C class. Good luck, odds of your condition going worse is about 180% guarantee unless you feel your house is worse and you enjoy horror movies in a VIP seat. But if you go to B ward, the costs is under you and only allowed after a financial assessment. Medisave is claimable but if you can\'t afford and can\'t tap onto your parents (I\'m lost at this process, sry) then you have to pay a deposit in cash. I tried to understand what happen if one can\'t afford, but IMH staffs are very good at dodging questions so all I got was ""Then we see la, case by case"". But my understanding is... the poor will likely stay on in C class ward. No such thing as free lunch in Singapore, even when you want help. Uniquely Singapore. Though I have spoke to some patients who ran up bills of 10k(?) in B class ward that they can\'t pay, so I am not sure how that happened but they seems to be social overstayer so its no longer free. I also seen someone went down to C class, cause of the bill issue but that might be voluntarily. Meanwhile his friend keep asking him to join him at EPIP instead which is cheaper, C class and with aircon some more. But that friend didn\'t realized that he was lucky to be selected \\*cough\\*, not everyone can go there by choice.\n\nThis ultimately brings us back to MDU, since MDU has both C class and B class ward. If you are going to be admitted, you wanna go there for your case. The MDU C class should be free under the mental health act. That\'s where you really get ""helped"", rest up get treatment to feel better about life\'s prospect while social workers try to intervene. But if you can\'t get to MDU, then you will have to wait and suffer in the general ward while begging to be discharged. It may sound scary but that\'s the unfortunate reality, Singapore government don\'t like for people to game the system but they still make sure that if you want the general C class ward, they can help you by making it free. Can\'t complain too much, it\'s taxpayer\'s money after all. Better to use those money for GDP.\n\n***P.S:*** If I have listed any wrong info, please correct me.

niiiveous,etbl8i,So uhh I had An Anxiety Attack Earlier,2020-01-24 23:07:30,singapore,378757,31,269,"**TLDR**: I sat on a public floor crying for a little over 2 hours before 2 guys helped me out of my dumb situation. So I wanna thank them! :D

I have a crippling fear of heights, like legitimately crippling. Any floor above 5 will send my heart beating out of control and I‚Äôll start crying if not removed from location is approx 5 minutes. 

So me, with this crippling phobia, decided to take the escalator to the bridge that connects MBS to Gardens by the Bay cause I figured ‚Äúah it won‚Äôt be too high.‚Äù 

It was too high. 

I tried going in the bridge, I really did, but I just... couldn‚Äôt. A few steps in and I honestly felt sick. So I sat in a corner and cried and panicked and... had the anxiety attack. I don‚Äôt know for how long but by the time I settled and checked my phone, it‚Äôd been almost an hour. 

And there were a few people who asked if I was okay but I... couldn‚Äôt quite breathe properly and was crying and no way I was going to be able to speak. And they were really nice, I was just... mentally crippled. 

And then I had another anxiety attack, then resigned myself to the fact that I might just have to stay in that corner overnight if nobody was gonna come. But I did have a little hope that someone would ask what‚Äôs wrong and help me down, so I wrote a short note with my shakiest hand and a skewed sense of perception (my mind was fried at that point, it was a last resort) that said I was scared of heights and I don‚Äôt want to cross the bridge, please help me down somehow. 

And these two Malay (?) guys asked if I was okay and I just kinda... shoved the note to them and they read it and helped me down cause a gate that was supposedly for ‚Äòauthorised entry only‚Äô actually wasn‚Äôt. A Chinese couple also stopped to ask if I was okay but I could barely speak English at that point, no way I was speaking Chinese, and I gotta thank them too cause at least they tried. 

And yeah, they brought me down to the taxi stand and I said thank you and they were really nice about it. A security guard did say we weren‚Äôt allowed there though but I‚Äôm gonna say it was an emergency. 

So I just wanted to thank the guys for helping me and preventing a possible third anxiety attack and just... being nice and kind. They brought me down to the taxi stand cause I said I was taking a taxi home, and I thanked them and left. Then realised I didn‚Äôt have enough money for a taxi, so I snuck to the bus stop. 

And I also wanna apologise to the guy who tried to talk to me. I was really crabby and sarcastic, not because of you I promise! Just kind of how I am after I stop crying.

ScrubLord6092,awubrj,[O Levels] Advice on whether to take Olvls or stay in PFP,2019-03-03 22:14:06,SGExams,77673,6,1,"Hi, I'm asking this on the behalf of a friend, who needs some ECG advice.

This friend of mine has always aspired to get into a JC. He took the N Levels examinations in 2018 and scored really well. Due to the fear of not being able to excel in his O Levels, he decided to sign up for the PFP program(Pharmaceutical science) and was successful.  However, he is now regretting that decision and is considering dropping out of PFP and enrolling himself back to secondary school to take O Levels in 2020 due to the following reasons:

1. He has a strong interest in geography and poly does not offer that subject.
2. He does not have a strong interest in his current course (because he has phobia of working in a lab?!? )
3. He is planning to pursue further studies at a local university and felt that JC would provide him with a better chance in doing so.

&#x200B;

**Do you think that this is a wise choice?**

&#x200B;

His N Levels results are as follows:

English A2

Humanities(SS/Geog) A2

Science(Chem/Bio) A1

Maths A1

F&N A1

Chinese B3

L1R4: 7-2=5

&#x200B;

Do you all think that he can score decently enough for O Levels given his N Level results? (I am well aware that there isn't enough info for proper guesses to be made)

&#x200B;

He also admits that he doesn't have the confidence to do well for his mother tongue. Thus, he would also like some advice on how to excel for it.

&#x200B;

If he decides to go for the O Level route, here is the subject combination he would like to take:

H2 Biology

H2 Chemistry

H2 Geog

H1 Maths

He would like to ask if there is a good chance that this subject combination would be offered as this is a rather rarely taken combination.

&#x200B;

So to sum things up, here are his questions:

1. Do you think that he can score well for O Levels L1R5 given his N Level grades?
2. Do you think that his subject combinations are common enough for a class to be formed?
3. Do you have any advice to scoring well for chinese?
4. And most importantly, **Is this a wise choice?**

&#x200B;

Furthermore, a word of advice would be to first think abt what he would want to take for Olvls, instead of fixating on what to take for A lvls :)\n\n3. As for chinese, try to read more (newspapers, model essays, etc) and speak more.

I would say that since he doesn‚Äôt have an interest in the course he‚Äôs currently studying, I would encourage him to pursue what he has a passion for (given that he has done sufficient research on the syllabus and content and not only scratched the surface). Do also take note that both Olvl Chem and H2 Chem in JC requires lab work, albeit ofc less than what he‚Äôs currently experiencing. I would also agree with the fact that JC gives a slightly better edge at entering a local uni as compared to poly bc as far as I know, the entry requirements for poly r much harder.

It‚Äôs blatantly obvious which option provides the best public good, or in this case, does the least public harm.', '>\tWe are all saying employers should do it but we are also aware that they will just pass the costs back to us. Of course, we can choose not to use their services. Eventually they might just lose customers and close down. Foreign workers lose their job and go back. Local employees also lose their job and file for unemployment benefits.\n\nThat is what‚Äôs known as Darwinism or survival of the fittest, no? Companies that cannot cut it without subsidies upon subsidies are by definition barely profitable. Why are we bailing these companies out? If we wanna talk about bigger picture stuff, is it fiscally responsible to be feeding leeches using taxpayer funds? Sure, there‚Äôs the argument about unemployment and its associated costs. But there‚Äôs also the other side of the coin that gets oft ignored. If a company goes under, and if there is demand for the services said company used to provide, either a new company would spring up to take its place, or existing competitors would expand to take up the freed up portion of the pie.\n\nAs for passing the buck to consumers, it‚Äôs already gonna happen either way.

Which was my main point actually\n\nAlso it doesn\'t seem to me that worker skill is the thing holding back labour productivity in manual jobs like construction. Given the same equipment, do construction workers really differ so much in productivity to make an appreciable difference in aggregate?\n\n> The levy is actually a relatively light penalty because the overall cost of hiring a foreign construction worker is still much lower than the wage that a hypothetical local construction worker might expect. You can estimate the latter from construction worker wages in places like Hong Kong and Japan where only locals are allowed to work in construction.\n\nWhat is the inherent benefit of having locals in construction, or what is the reason for explicitly setting ourselves a target of raising wages to the point that locals will accept?', 'That and age makes a massive difference.

Employers will cite rising costs and that consumers will have to pay a lot more. *Most* consumers obviously won't want that. Then we end up with the current status quo we've had for years in which no improvement gets made.\n\nI'd rather use the money we already collect from the employers via levies to subsidize the transportation issue because it cuts that excuse out of the equation and forces some change quicker.

Ask any NGO who works with migrant workers about how poorly enforced they actually are."", ""I agree with what you are saying. But are we bailing these companies out?

Which was my main point actually\n\nAt a higher salary, your construction worker is more competitive and \'upgraded\' in terms of skill and ability. He may have more experience, better English ability, be more educated and receptive to complex training, etc. Why do you still assign him to do the ""same work"" that is designed to be performed by a semi-literate ex-farmer from Bangladesh? Why not change your work processes to take advantage of his better skills?\n\nIt\'s like upgrading your printer to one that can do double-sided printing and then you continue to do one-sided printing.\n\n>Also it doesn\'t seem to me that worker skill is the thing holding back labour productivity in manual jobs like construction. Given the same equipment, do construction workers really differ so much in productivity to make an appreciable difference in aggregate?\n\nLet me give you a very shocking statistic. In Singapore, construction employs about 12 percent of the workforce but contributes only 3 percent of the overall GDP. Each construction worker is only 25 percent as productive as the national average. In Japan, construction employs about 6.3 percent of the workforce but contributes 5.7 percent of the GDP. Each construction worker in Japan is about 90 percent as productive as the national average.\n\nClearly, there is enormous room for productivity improvement. Some of it may be due to worker skill, use of capital equipment, efficiency in management, design of work processes, etc but the differences in skill is a major factor.\n\n>What is the inherent benefit of having locals in construction, or what is the reason for explicitly setting ourselves a target of raising wages to the point that locals will accept?\n\nThe benefits of having locals in construction are:\n\n1. In a major emergency (e.g. war or pandemic) in which access to foreign workers is unavailable, we still retain the capability to perform emergency repairs and demolition. This is why Singapore had a construction brigade between 1981 and 2001.\n2. The use of cheap foreign labor also results in low productivity, poor teamwork, social problems (friction with locals), and lack of commitment to Singapore , according Lee Kuan Yew who wanted to have a wholly local work force in 1982 ([https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19820101-1.2.2](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19820101-1.2.2))\n3. From an economic stand point, a locally dominated construction work force is more likely to generate a higher multiplier effect when you try to stimulate the economy through infrastructure spending in a downturn. When the work force is largely foreign, you lose a lot of the \'punch\' of the stimulus through leakages because the foreign workers remit their earnings overseas.\n\nIt is not possible to grow the construction work force indefinitely because of our size. That alone should be a reason to reform the construction industry and raise its productivity by weaning it off cheap foreign labor.', ""This. The problem isn't as simple as a lot of people make it out to be. I can imagine hundreds of SME bosses and even the bigger shots ('job creators') throwing a hissyfit over such actions so the change has to be gradual and incremental, and overtime it will look like an overhaul."", '/u/ceddya suggests using foreign worker levies collected by the govt to offset the increased cost of safe and proper transportation.\n\nI simply argued against this suggested move.\n\nYou then proceeded to form a counterargument that seems to be anti-anti-subsidies (hence pro-subsidy?) Idk. I think you‚Äôre just confused or something.', 'I prefer companies to bear for the costs. Because consumers have a choice to engage companies and companies can explore different ways using their own money on how to implement safety measures. \n\nSorry for the confusion.']"

It‚Äôs an all-too-familiar scenario for gamers like Jasman Choo.\n\n> At 15, he started playing Team Fortress 2 every day. The game rewarded him with mystery ‚Äòcrates‚Äô as he played, and he bought ‚Äòkeys‚Äô worth US$2.49 (S$3.35) from the in-game store to open them.\n\n> A CS:GO key to unlock a loot box costs upwards of S$3 on the Steam Community Market.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> He estimates he must have opened over 250 crates, each time finding items inside that were worth around US$3 to US$5 ‚Äî meagre by gamers‚Äô standards.\n\n> ‚ÄúI kept thinking the next one would be ‚Äòthe one‚Äô, since I did not get anything (valuable) in the previous 50 crates, 100 crates, 150 crates,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it never happened.‚Äù\n\n> Then he chanced upon a third-party website ‚Äî one that let him bet his in-game items on games like roulette, with a chance to ‚Äúdouble or triple‚Äù the items‚Äô value.\n\n> ‚ÄúI started off with (putting in) a S$5 item, then after about 30 minutes it became S$200,‚Äù Jasman said. ‚ÄúI kept winning, winning, winning.‚Äù\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> A roulette game on a third-party website for Counter-Strike: Global Offensive items.\n\n> What made it easier to throw caution to the wind was that these games didn‚Äôt involve actual cash, ‚Äújust pixels on the screen‚Äù.\n\n> GONE IN 30 SECONDS\n\n> But then came the time he lost real-world money.\n\n> \n\n> He had moved on to playing Dota 2 by then, and had just bought a S$200 ‚Äúskin‚Äù (the term for a cosmetic item like a character‚Äôs costume) from a friend. ‚ÄúThe first thing I thought of was the third-party website,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAll I remembered was how easy it was to double whatever I put in.‚Äù\n\n> Love CNA Insider videos and stories?

It doesn‚Äôt look like gambling at all,‚Äù said Jasman. ‚ÄúIt looks like opening a present.‚Äù\n\n> \n\n> Jasman Choo.\n\n> Game-makers incorporate concepts from the gambling world to ‚Äúmake their games addictive‚Äù ‚Äî they ‚Äúcondition‚Äù gamers the same way that a jackpot machine prize evokes ‚Äúa sense of excitement‚Äù, said Yeo Hui Teng, a social worker with Fei Yue Community Services.\n\n> She pointed out that the use of in-game currency is also a ‚Äúpsychological trick that game-makers use to create a buffer, so that you don‚Äôt realise how much money you are actually spending‚Äù.\n\n> There are other mindgames at play.\n\n> \n\n> Raja Khairulanwar, 29, used to play a Genshin Impact, a ‚Äògacha‚Äô game (another term for games with loot box features) that ‚Äúencourages you to keep gacha-ing for a chance to get rare and powerful characters‚Äù.\n\n> The base odds of getting a super-rare box are 0.6 per cent, but this does not deter players. And many gacha games purposely offer limited-time-only items to ‚Äúwork on your fear of missing out‚Äù, he added.\n\n> Ganyu, a prized character in Genshin Impact.\n\n> Then there is the peer pressure ‚Äî cited by several gamers ‚Äî when playing with friends, to try to obtain a certain skin for one‚Äôs character to ‚Äúfit in‚Äù with how everyone else looks.\n\n> That‚Äôs when one might turn to the third-party websites that entice gamers to trade in skins, wager them on esports, or gamble them on casino-type games.\n\n> Because players draw their ‚Äòearnings‚Äô as virtual game items rather than cash at many of these websites, they fall in a grey area not covered by anti-gambling laws.\n\n> \n\n> But what starts out seeming relatively harmless could lead to something that is not.\n\n> Example of a third-party website that exposes gamers to many forms of gambling.\n\n> ‚ÄúOur concern is that these gamers are very young, and this might end up normalising gambling for them,‚Äù said Nicholas Khoo, founder of the Singapore Cybersports and Online Gaming Association and a member of the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG).\n\n> And the more favourable odds offered in some of these social casino games ‚Äúmay give the false perception that if you took part in real gambling, you might end up winning‚Äù.\n\n> THE LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND ADDICTION\n\n> One warning sign that gambling within a game could become a larger, uncontrollable problem like addiction, is when one loses control of how much time and money one spends on games ‚Äúat the expense of other things‚Äù ‚Äî such as eating, sleeping and studying, said Hui Teng.\n\n> \n\n> Developing strong feelings for one‚Äôs in-game characters is another warning sign. In Genshin Impact, said Raja, ‚Äúthey make you feel for the characters by making you part of the story, then they slowly push you to the gacha mechanics‚Äù.\n\n> One example of these gacha mechanics: A coupon rewarding players with hairstyles for their character.\n\n> ‚ÄúThese games have very cute or handsome characters. By getting you so invested, you‚Äôre willing to spend your money just for a chance to build the image of your perfect guy or girl,‚Äù he added.\n\n> A third warning sign is when chasing the endorphin thrill of finding out what‚Äôs inside a loot box supersedes the reward itself.\n\n> Ryan Tan, 19, whose first encounter with loot boxes was in Counter-Strike: Global Offensive seven years ago, reckons: ‚ÄúI would have spent more than S$1,000 (on them). Maybe I only got back S$200 worth of skins? That‚Äôs a net loss of about S$800.\n\n> The chances of getting a good skin or making a profit are low ‚Äî but the thrill makes me want to try again.\n\n> \n\n> One explanation for this is selective amnesia, noted Raja. The feeling of being ‚Äúat your lowest low‚Äù when you‚Äôve lost is usually temporary, he said; once you recover, you‚Äôre ready and raring to go again.\n\n> Raja Khairulanwar.\n\n> REAL-WORLD CONSEQUENCES\n\n> For undergraduate Jen Tan, 23, an online role-playing game became her escape from real life, including when she had depression. ‚ÄúI would just play MapleStory instead of going to school,‚Äù she said.\n\n> ‚ÄúMy daily tasks were things I needed to do in the game.

Hamtata,kuuq5p,Discussion abt gaming addiction,2021-01-11 12:01:41,singapore,378757,81,24," 

Hello hello, am new here. This is open for discussion, or make fun if u want (be remain respectful la, if not ppl buey song shoot u left, right, center. I ok la, in army used to it liao)

I had this weird gaming addiction. but dunno whether can consider addiction.

Abit of background is, during schooling yrs, hardly study, even played games (NES, genesis gaming console) during exams. heng ah God have mercy on me, cos eventually I grew into computer gaming then to maximize my gaming experience with cheap hardware, i do my own study how to troubleshoot computer, which eventually lead me to working in the IT line as a job. So gaming was major part of my life, not competitively but usually to cope with my loneliness & emotions. a gaming addict I would call it

So today, thanks to the nature of job and internet, I hardly game. but when I DO game, I play back old games. I dislike new games not because of content but the nature of 'FREE' games now. I mean everyone knows these 'free' games always flooded with microtransactions. I do play a few, I studied some of these games in detail so much, i even wrote guides for it to help others.

Ok before i go off course again, back to my gaming addict topic.

The pattern of gaming behaviour may be continuous or episodic and recurrent.

He cited the World Health Organisation‚Äôs Expert Committee on Drug Dependence (WHO ECDD), which tabled six recommendations to the 63rd Commission on Narcotic Drugs to lower controls over cannabis and cannabis-related substances.\n\n> ‚ÄúThese developments are not desirable, and could lead to a normalisation of cannabis abuse.

It has shown to be more effective as society is healthier and there\'s less burden on tax payers', "">Yes, but customers are paying, not you nor tax payers\n\nReally? Taxpayers' dollars are not used to foot legalistic expenses?

So for them, maybe that is the right move.\n\nI just think that it doesn't hurt to blanket ban drugs because it makes it easier. You don't need to spend time checking the cannabis if there is no cannabis. Why do we need cannabis?"", "">Really? Taxpayers' dollars are not used to foot legalistic expenses? Didn't know that.\n\nFor the case of alcohol and tobacco, the importer pays for the license, and the additional tax are paid for by those who buy them.\nThis year 2021, from Jan to Apr, in just 4 months, the duties collected from alcohol and tobacco alone amounts to [779 Million SGD](https://www.customs.gov.sg/news-and-media/publications/statistics/) and its safe to say it covers any legal fees required, with enough left to put to good use, like income relief etc\n\nLets say, gov decides to blanket ban alcohol and tobacco, that is a loss of 200 Million / month of duties collected, and not only that, tax payers have to fork out additional money to do enforcement. That results in a net loss, additional burden on tax payers\n\nWhy do we need cannabis? Recreationally, its something people like, getting high is not wrong, nor is getting drunk. As long as no one is harmed, let them live their lives they want to, furthermore cannabis is safer than alcohol and is non-addictive. And to add, in the general western world, cannabis still had widespread use, and I don't hear of users becoming violent, they just become chill and hungry.\n\nWhich brings me to the medicinal side, Young children with epilepsy, many cases and counting, cannabis is the best medicine for seizures. War vets with PTSD, cannabis helps them lead a normal life as they wean off hard pharmaceutical drugs which incapacitates them. Cancer patients also benefit from the pain management and increased appetite cannabis provides. The elderly who have pain issues and lost of appetite, they do not need to resort to harmful pharmaceutical drugs that are usually very harsh and has side effects.\n\nI am against dangerous drugs, heroin ice meth etc, they are highly addictive and dangerous. Cannabis is not one of them, not even close, and it comes with medicinal benefits our ageing population can enjoy, plus profits from tax duties. Colorado (same population as SG) collected 387 Million USD from tax duties alone last year in 2020 from cannabis. That money can be used to create more jobs, or build infrastructure, non cannabis users also get the benefit even though they don't pay a single cent.\n\nI implore you to read up more about cannabis, and not just sources from SGgov (they are clearly biased, for one, they claim that there is no evidence, but somehow from no evidence they can conclude with confidence that it is harmful, its wierdly inconsistent)"", ""I don't know if we want to relax our stance though. Might encourage some dealers who think the country is finally safe to attempt drug trade in. But if you can prove the medical benefits, you can argue for its provision by medically trained professionals and hospitals."", 'Most would assume that tougher regulation would reduce ""drug trade"", but it is actually counter intuitive. Tougher enforcement actually fuels the black market. People are going to take it anyway, why not make it safe for them by properly regulating it. Look at North Korea, selling south korean media is a crime punishable by public firing squad, one would think there would be 0 crime for such a tough stance, but just a few days ago there was a public execution\n\nHistory has enough evidence, for example, colombia mexico and USA, the cartels. Not only that, the black market trade in countries that have legalised have been majorly stifled, and the money that used to go to the cartels now go to people\n\nAlso, counter intuitive but logical if you think about it, making it illegal actually makes young people want it more. Legalising makes the youths lose interest (-> cambodia, the netherlands). The dutch youths generally don\'t care about cannabis, even dutch adults.\n\nBut again, cannabis is not a hard drug. continue to be tough on ice heroin meth etc, \\[even ketamine was recently found to be effective to treat depression\\]([https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ketamine-approved-in-spore-for-treatment-of-major-depressive-disorder](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ketamine-approved-in-spore-for-treatment-of-major-depressive-disorder)) the drug that I remember was fearmongered decades back.']"

The first, non-controversial one is this: Porn addiction is just like any other form of addiction. And we already know how dangerous and harmful addiction is in general.\n\nThe article also briefly mentions about how families are not too keen on teaching their kids about sex, and that in some cases, there\'s some bad parenting happening behind the scenes.\n\nThe second implication and you have to remember that this is an article in a newspaper owned by the Singapore Press Holdings, is that ""porn is bad for society"". This IS the conservative talking point I was actually talking about. A very common offshoot of it is ""porn leads to rape"". And guess what? Singapore is a deeply conservative society!\n\nThe ""implications"" of porn, so to speak, are broadly divided into several areas, the main three I can think of are the addiction aspect, the business aspect and the social aspect.\n\nThe first one can be adequately explained by ""porn addiction is like any other addiction."" And we DO understand how addiction can destroy lives.\n\nThe second one is supporting porn as an industry. I don\'t really care about the moral or ethical basis of your objections, but there\'s a TON of issues with porn as an industry, like bad contracts, the fact that the major porn websites are run by ONE company, and the exploitation of actors and actresses in the industry. If you plan to talk about this area, at least read up on the issues.\n\nThe third one is the social aspects of porn. Yes, people can scream until they\'re blue in the face about how porn can enforce wrong thinking about sex and raise unrealistic expectations, but that\'s ignoring the actual elephant in the room: all the damn Hollywood movies. Hollywood has been feeding a certain narrative (the boy always gets the girl, to be successful in life, you need to have a female at your side, etc) and that sort of narrative is part of the reason why porn is so dangerous. \n\nGee, I wonder why incels are a thing? And their cringier, criminal counterparts, the darkcels?\n\nThe other, more Singapore-specific elephant in the room is this: our sexual education is, for lack of a better term, complete trash. We let fucking Americans, conservative ""Evangelical"" ones at that, to write our sex ed in at least one example. It\'s a lot more than just ""put pee-nees into vagina"", ""how to put on a condom"" and boring the shit out of teenagers. It also involves telling people that ""porn is as fake as Mediacorp dramas, and sometimes just as badly written"", ""prostitution is legal and seriously, go fuck a whore if you can afford it"", ""protection is very fucking important and there are a million forms of it"" and ""consent is hella good, please, please ALWAYS ask for consent"". And our trash sex ed curriculum is compounded by the fact that parents are either too embarrassed or not willing to spend time with their children about this.\n\nUnfortunately, instead of taking a nuanced view on porn, conservatives would like to inform you that porn is bad and can make you commit sex crimes, women selling their bodies for sex is even worse even though it is legal in Singapore, sex is only meant for marriage, and that it\'s not okay to explore your sexuality safely.']"

PC26678837,n8dr28,Saw the amount of support there was on the sexual assault post and wanted to share my own experience with racism.,2021-05-09 20:59:23,singapore,378757,389,1659,"Hello my Singaporean friends.

To preface, I'm not trying to compare anything to OP's experience being sexually assaulted. It just inspired me to share my story because of the overwhelming support I saw given there.

I'm a Singaporean Indian male. Parents and grandparents were both Singaporeans as well. Needless to say, as a Singaporean I should deserve to be treated as one and not unfairly right? As it says in our very pledge "" regardless of race, language or religion.""

I can't help but disagree. Throughout my entire life ( I was born in the 90s) I've been treated differently or patronisingly because of my race. It honestly feels like a crutch. Back when I was a kid, mother tongue was more of the norm so most of my friends were always speaking in broken English. It sucked because I can't speak Tamil and the Indian kids in my school bullied me badly and exiled me from their friendship. Needless to say the other races would call me ""apu neh neh"" or ""dirty/smelly"" and I literally got beat up bad on multiple occasions to which my mother would complain to the school and the principal gave 0 fucks. It was that bad.

I've been denied so many job applications because ""they prefer Chinese"" and I do understand the bigger crowd is the Chinese demographic here but that is part of the disadvantage for me. It sucks so bad that despite how talented I am I never got to try things because of my race. In secondary school I had a teacher use me as a example for so many stereotypes that didn't even apply to me. I had him straight up laugh in my face when I wanted to be a class representative (because I already struggled with believing I was worth anything so I wanted to prove to myself that I had what it takes). Not even a chance given. Immediately shut down. I cried and wanted to commit suicide on SO many occasions because of him.

I see other issues being taken so seriously in Singapore but then even til today there is RAMPANT racism. Seriously. I shit you not almost everywhere I go, no matter how nice the people are I'm bound to hear racist comments. I personally believe this stems from our parents generation. They push their beliefs onto their children and sometimes I can't really blame the Chinese people for saying the shit they say because it's so normalised. They don't even know it's wrong. It's not like they're bad people but they're just simply ignorant when it comes to this. It sounds very accusatory I know, but it's honestly an issue.

I remember there was a post about a foreign exchange student who did the ""chinese eyes"" and everyone was outraged saying Singapore absolutely does not welcome racists. In my heart I was honestly scoffing because a lot of these ""woke"" Gen Z people jump on the bandwagon to become a victim. Let's not sugar coat it, these days in spite of a lot of people suffering from mental health/assault etc. There is a HUGE fetishisation of being a victim. People just want in the sympathy for things they don't really suffer from or doesn't really affect them. Not saying it's right what the lady did, but how does that actually affect any of these people in Singapore. Majority of them here are still Chinese. Let's just put it into perspective for a bit:

Chinese people being racist towards Malays

Malays being racist towards Chinese.

at the end of the day, you have to understand Chinese people in Singapore are the majority. It's shitty to be racist on both ends but the one's actually taking the damage are the minorities.

In a class full of chinese and malay kids I was the only Indian in most cases. Same when I worked part time jobs, I'm always the only Indian. People being racist affects me the most because I bear the full load of it from multiple people who unforunately share the same mindset whether they're good people or not. A lot of it is deep rooted in ignorance and taught by ignorant older generation parents.

&#x200B;

Another shitty thing that these people do, they decide for you what's racist or isnt'. I remember getting upset as a teen at my friends because one of them said ""apu neh neh"" and I confronted him. Every one of his friends immediately got defensive/aggressive about it and said ""aiyah it's not even a bad word, is you dont know"". Like what the fuck? If I, an Indian, feel offended by a derogatory word directed towards people of my race, you have the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't be offended by it? This shit has happened on THOUSANDS of occasion I can't even keep count. How many times I got annoyed/upset by racist remarks and I had someone tell me I'm overreacting.

Controversial opinion: (Maybe I'm looking too much into this one)

Last year I told a malay friend of mine, if you look at ""Singapore ads"" as a foreigner, you'd think this was China. When I went to the cinema on multiple occasions there were 0 mainstream ads (at least from what I saw) that showed ""Singapore"" as a country with all the races. It's mostly chinese actors/actresses even if it was English speaking. But to my surprise, they had an ad about drugs and theft and it just so happened the thief was malay and the drug-addict was Indian. Like I said I might be reading too much into it but it feels like shit when you're already going through so much and so insecure and you see these things. They fuck with your mind.

&#x200B;

Everywhere I go it's so normal for me to hear at some point jokes like.

""Eh that Indian guy your father ah?""\*turns off the lights\* ""Eh OP where you go sia can only see your teeth?""

etc etc. It's not just ""a few people"" or ""the people I hang out with"". Recently after enlisting in NS I witnessed the same thing going down. How brazen some of these people are with their racism.

Don't even get me started with dating. I've had multiple girlfriends, all races. It doesn't matter to me. But whenever I was with a chinese girl I'd get the DIRTIEST stares I've ever seen in my life from other chinese guys or older generation uncles/aunties.

The worst one so far:At one point I had an aunty come up to my then-girlfriend and said in mandarin (yes i do speak a bit of mandarin):

Are you okay?

Are you sure you want to be with this guy?

You know if your baby come out ""hei hei"" not beautiful.

This bitch kept going and going. And my girlfriend didn't even say anything back to her I was just walking with my jaw on the floor and I absolutely couldn't believe this was happening to me.

&#x200B;

This fucking happened this year lol. In 2021. This is the reality sadly. I had a Korean girlfriend at one point, and one of my chinese male friends (Nice guy, just simply fucking ignorant) said to me after seeing her picture:

""Huh? When you met, she knows you're Indian anot?"" like it was some sort of disease lmao. What the fuck? How would I have been with her without her knowing my race. The concept of this relationship was so unreal to this guy. This is a perfect example of the ignorance most people have. They're not bad people they're just so ignorant.

I also had multiple people speak down to me as if I can't speak English. It was extremely condescending.

I had an autistic friend in school and whenever he heard Indian people speaking he'd just start laughing uncontrollably and not when other races spoke. How is it that an autistic person is wired to react this way? Basically our society's perspective on Indians here.

I worked on an occasion with an entirely chinese staff. And they had a secret dinner entirely without me. I found out by accident when I was looking for someone at work and I opened the door to their dinner and they all just looked so dumbstruck when they saw me.

From the constant bullying, denial of basic things and harassment. I just can't believe nothing's being done about this in 2021.

Something Indians do because of this that I can't stand:

Indian guys who develop a ""Chinese singlish accent"".

Singlish is Singlish. Chinese people sound chinese , Malays sound malay, Indians sound Indian when they speak it. You can tell easily right? There's a group of Indian guys out there who are so affected by this racism that they try to disassociate from being Indian. I guarantee you have that one Indian friend. I saw this Indian guy wearing a hypebeast looking outfit with the korean glasses and centre parting hair and his accent sounded so forced chinese I almost died from second hand embarassment. But this is the state of how things are based on how normalised racism is here. A lot of the Indians just accept it. They can't do anything about it either way right?

PS: There might be some hint of anger/hatred or insinuated accusations but I assure you I don't bear any hatred for my Chinese friends. In fact the ones I hang out with are actually amongst the kindest most sweet people I have ever met. It's just the reality of the struggle I face as an Indian in my own home. I deserve to feel like I'm entitled to the same thing every other Singaporean because I'm not just a colour. I'm a human being. I am absolutely not justifying the racism that chinese people face from Indians and Malays either.

&#x200B;

I just made this post to show you that from my days as a kid up til today I'm still heavily affected by racism and it's not just a few bad apples. It's a deep rooted in a lot of people and we really need to teach our kids in the future so they know better. I really hope this gets some traction so I can hear perspectives from others because I was hesitating posting this for the longest time out of fear but I have to get this off my chest.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I see a lot of people DMing me and asking stupid questions in the thread so I just wanted to point something out.  


Me saying I had a chinese/korean gf at one point was to show the racist reactions I got from my chinese peers indicating shock at an Indian being able to do such things. I don't understand how some people can look at it as a ""flex"" and the only way I imagine that happening is if they hold races above another which I DONT. That's why I don't see it as a flex. So those people who are making such accusations, stop projecting.   


Also, unrelated. I never had an indian gf because when I was younger the Indian girls treated me like shit and left me out of circles of friendships. As I grew older, indian girls were very scarce and I'm not seeking women by race. It just so happened that the girls I dated were chinese/malays etc. For you to come after me for ""not dating indian girls"" is bullshit gaslighting and you have no understanding of how things work. I have dated Indian girls in the past years fyi, it just didn't work out. Stop saying stupid things without knowing context.

We went to a Chinese restaurant and we had a reservation. It was for an occassion so we were all dressed up. Got to the counter and they gave their name and confirmed their reservation. Waitress then walked us to our table, half way through she turned around and looked at me. She then said ""Grab delivery is outside"". It wasn\'t the first time someone mistook me for a delivery rider, but like wtf, my drip was fire. Not something that would be comfortable to be delivering food all day in. \n\nAnyways, my parent in-laws took real fucking offense to it. Made noise and all to the manager, but what made me feel so much better was that they wanted to find out more about other times their race has made me feel horrible and what other minorities gotta deal with.

Those businesses who prefer a certain race over another shld be exposed about their discrimination and lose money. In a professional setting and in law, racism cannot be tolerated.\n\nHowever, law should not be used to control social interactions, which is what i ultimately disagree with the ""woke"" types. Stuff like banning racist speech won\'t stop racism, it would only drive them out from view to fester somewhere else.\n\n### On social interactions\n\nOne thing I\'ve been taught about by several people is how as long as casual racism is done as jokes in a two-way affair (i.e. u race X, i race Y, i make fun of u, u make fun of me, we both laugh) it can actually be seen as a strength in sg, in that we dont just push aside our differences we laugh at them and the false stereotypes attributed to them. Hell lets joke about it till it gets old, that would literally invalidate any power in that racist stereotype. Comedy is that powerful.\n\nHowever, I think this should not serve to encourage casual racism, but i think it should be made aware that sometimes the little things are that powerful.\n\nOften people who can dish it out can actually take it. So laugh at people\'s casual racism and shoot back at them, if they get offended, inform them they are hypocrites and disengage from any futher interaction if they dun get it, lest it become bullying. Hypocrites aren\'t worth your time.\n\nWhat you don\'t want is to have society slowly renounce your identity if you can help it, I\'d say an individual\'s identity need not only be of heritage, but its a convenient and natural identity to have as you find others that you can call your own.\n\n###  On bullying\n\nI must say that i dont have the answers for this case. But I\'d like to express some empathy.\n\nBullying on the other hand is where casual racism becomes toxic. Its one-sided social attacks which may turn physical at times. Even the most sensible of laws can only mitigate it. But that\'s not to say that authority figures aren\'t important to help fight bullying. I was also bullied before, it may not be for race but I\'ve felt the same hopelessness to see these teachers turn a blind eye and in the worst case, victim-blamed me for it. It has affect my grades, enough for me to spiral down from my ambitions.

Unless these uncles and aunties stop teaching their children this stuff. I don‚Äôt think the racism will stop.', 'yup, casual racism is racism. End of story.', ""First of all, very sorry to hear your experience with racism. As a Chinese person I've almost never had to put up with all this and frankly we don't really understand how it's really like to be faced with racism unless we go and live in a place where we become the minority. Racism sucks. Let me share with you my personal experience and understanding of such issues. I moved to China since 12 and have never been back to Singapore until the time came for me to serve NS.\n\nSo first of all there is definitely a correlation between racism and one's level of education. Back in BMT I was enlisted into a JC batch. People there generally were not racist at all. I never heard any casual racist remarks being thrown around ever. Not against indians or malays or 'chinamen' or whatever. Everyone was really nice, and the only people they would make jokes about were those selfish idiots who always got us into trouble.\n\nFast forward to unit life, I was assigned to a unit where the majority around me were from ITE or poly, with only 2-3 'JC kids', and all of a sudden it became very natural to throw racist slurs around on a daily basis. Well, maybe not just racist slurs. The jokes ranged from 'indians are so smelly', 'fucking indogs (when playing ml)' to '____'s face looks stupid sia'. Sometimes the indians would also come with up insults like 'fucking Chinese with small eyes'. 99% of the time everyone gets a laugh and no one gets offended, at least from what I saw. As someone who's 'from China' (technically Singaporean with half my family from China), I've also been the target of some Chinamen jokes, which, not gonna lie, were quite funny at times. They would say I run so fast because I was accustomed to the shitty air pollution in China or insist that I probably ate dog meat some point in my life although I said I have not. I'd say they did not mean any harm and were only trying to lighten the mood sometimes, since NS is so shag, but I've also gotten pissed at times if they make the same jokes repeatedly. So I guess I can relate to a limited extent, but I'm sure it's nothing compared to what you guys deal with, since I completely come off as a Singaporean Chinese until someone starts asking where I went to school etc., and it's at that point I tell them I'm actually kind of from China. I'm also relieved that I finished my NS pre-covid because I can't imagine what kind of shit I'll have to deal with as a 'China person' in Singapore right now.\n\nNow regarding cinema/ads, I'm not sure I see that in a racist light. I was a little surprised to see all the movies here in Chinese subtitles only (not even English) at first, but after a bit of contemplation it seems the reasonable thing to do, given that over 70% of the population speak Chinese and that subtitles in more than one language would probably block too much of the screen. I wonder if some older Malay or Indian citizens would struggle with understanding English movies without subtitles but I can't think of a good solution. Maybe it would be a good idea to allocate separate screenings for different language subtitles, similar to how subbed/dubbed movies are sold separately. And regarding ads, it's kind of just how the market works. They have to cater to their own target audience and more often than not, their targets happen to be part of the majority.\n\nI also knew an Indian guy who pretty much only hung out with Chinese people and could even understand/speak some Chinese. Maybe part of it is trying to blend in the majority, but under the currently extremely popular Japanese/Korean/anime/Taiwanese trends in Singapore, I would also not be surprised if they are genuinely more interested in such cultures. A significant portion of Chinese people also take an appeal to Japanese/Korean culture more than their own culture.\n\nSo at the end of the day, racism sucks, but looking on the bright side, the younger, more educated people are generally much less racist, and even those who appear racist may not be as mean as they appear to be. We can hope that things change for the better but change takes time so for the time being, I advise minorities to try not to actively look for how they are subject to racism in every aspect of life because the mind sees whatever it wants to and it just fuels more hate against each other."", 'There‚Äôs racism everywhere.

Seriously ... folks don‚Äôt make it sound like society is against you, there is no Utopia on earth .', 'I strongly emphatize with  you and can understand what you‚Äôve been through. Unfortunately this is an issue which wouldn‚Äôt be resolved in a day and here are some suggestions, especially for young kids but some apply to adults as well\n\n1) it‚Äôs not about just racism in school. Youngsters that age are just learning what to do - initially with first experiences of a mass social set up like a school, and later with raging hormones they don‚Äôt know how to deal with. Therefore they will always behave awkwardly with someone who is different. Not just race, but maybe fat or weird nose, stutters or anything. It is just one of the coping mechanisms to earn an alpha status in the peer group. This stems from an in brewing insecurity that given the person in front is different, I need to do something eccentric to stand out. However, the fomo then leads to others in the group joining in. But remember, the abuser is the one more insecure than the sufferer here. He is the one that needs help. Else this grows into what can be called downright racism where the person starts believing their jokes and taunts. \n\n2) As is insecurity grows low key in them, they become adolescent and then adults. Given they cannot outright body shame someone for their looks once they join the workforce, race becomes a form of weapon against jobs and promotions at work place. But this kind of obsession is not healthy, given it leads to unoptimised workforce and hence org performance. It‚Äôs a fact that only truly global companies which have a diverse mix of talent with a performance driven organisation make it big globally (I am not counting Chinese companies because most of them have regional dominance instead, with most of their revenues coming from China. Even the larger Chinese companies have a bug expat population with a healthy mix). \n\n3) The only way to ensure such racism doesn‚Äôt effect you is in your hands. Learn about your culture. Identify what you are good at. Op, Given you are of Indian origin you must know that a lot of global conglomerate CEOs are Indian origin. Having the power to understand where your own race has been, will dilute out the thorny statements made by others. Again, I am not saying racists are right, but just saying why shouldn‚Äôt it impact you because it is the insecurity of the accused and nothing to do with the victim. Again taking your example OP, the Chinese lady who spoke to your Chinese gf was really concerned about racial mixing and nothing else. Else why would a stranger be concerned on how the future child of a stranger looks? To be honest if I were you and I knew some Chinese, I would have told/ asked my gf to tell her that the beauty of genetically diverse children is that they take the best genes from both parents. So maybe the child would be good looking like the mother but have brains and confidence of the father. ;) you of course would need to believe in yourself to have made that statement and feel food about it. \n\nI know that racism is bad, be it against anyone (Indians, Malay, Chinese, blacks) but again we must realise there is something wrong with the one being racist rather than us. And it‚Äôs up to us how we take it. 90% of hard core racists just end up being like the Karen who end up recording videos in mrt. 10% will still be successful and be powerful positions to impact a job etc. but there also it is up to you to find a truly global workplace where promotions and jobs are performance driven. \n\nHope this helps.', 'To be honest, i was guilty of some of the acts when i was younger (like until before secondary school probably) and it was because some of my older relatives used to always warn us to not randomly run away because ""ar pu neh neh will catch you"" and because i always see groups of workers at night in the grass field drinking and stuff. The impression i had of the indians i know in my primary school wasnt good too, but it was mostly them as a person (eg. Being easily angry over little thing (not even anything offensive) and scolding people randomly, doesnt smell good (it\'s probably because she puts a lot of oil on the hair? And i could see white specks in there...), i once saw that the girl in class was reading and digged her nose before wiping on a storybook O.O\nBut ive never seen or done anything physical.\nIn secondary school i learnt my lesson and started to change my thinking and actions because im more exposed to what is wrong and what is right. And there wasn\'t much racism in secondary that i can remember. The indians there were fairly popular in school too. \n\nSo yea racism is still very prominent in Singapore, but i think because the younger ones are more exposed to it and also because of the pandemic racist attacks/campaigns, we are slowly progressing. The gov should also educate us since young about this too, since we are wired a certain way since young.', 'Personally experienced racism in many stages of my life\n\nSchooling: Teachers joking about how you don‚Äôt see many malays here because they lepak\n\nNS: Commanders asking if I‚Äôm malay (I get easily tanned under the sun).

So it was the same typical deal in those racist days that we\'d poke fun at his skin for a bit (I don\'t really remember, but I am very certain some slurs were dropped even as a joke), but for the most part people treated him as a Chinese because ""he\'s one of us"" or whatever.

Completely free. I think we have enough awareness campaigns and fear tactics about smoking. I'm sure smokers are not oblivious to it. But like any other disease, it's an addiction. So there's just a few ways to do it\n\n1. You make it very very expensive or outrightly ban cigarettes altogether. Doesn't work all that well bc then there's a huge contraband market and people will be afraid to disclose this information to their doctors, insurance companies etc. if its totally illegal\n\nIf you give people the choice (like clinics where they can get nicotine patches and help for their addiction, they're more likely to stick with it and recover.

I'd invest more in providing more tools to enhance the mental health of the world population so that we're better armed to deal with anxiety, depression, and other stuff.

Could even bundle in with financial incentives though I disagree and maybe even start the treatment for those in ITE or POLY that smoke. \n\nHowever, I am a very pessimistic person and I don't think smokers will willingly look for treatment. My rationale being if depressed and suicidal people don't seek help and if smoking is somewhat a mental issue they wouldn't seek help either. But maybe some slight push by the govt can help with the addiction clinic.

W_2001,ndo3du,[News]Never give up!,2021-05-16 21:14:28,SGExams,77673,8,105,"This just in: All primary and secondary students as well as JC and MI students are required to do HBL for 2 weeks.(https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/parenting-education/spore-schools-to-start-full-home-based-learning-from-may-19-amid-spike?utm_medium=social&utm_source=instagram&utm_campaign=stig)

Even I don't understand why they would do it now instead of during the June holidays and then keep July free or vice versa.

Anyways, I was an A level graduate from 2019 and I want to remind everyone to not give up at this moment. (Idk if MYE are available and whether Sec 4s have to rely on prelims)

Here are some tips I can give:

* mainly to reduce distractions from parents/siblings

1. Use headphones and earpieces.
2. Use paper/messages/texts as a way of communication (with family) while on HBL.
3. Ensure that the space you are using is clear of distractions(sometimes studying outside of your house may work e.g. at lift lobby.)
4. If things are SEVERE(Again. IF), lock the doors(esp for those with younger siblings and paste a paper on the door saying not to disrupt and "" will open at XXXX timing""
5. Talk to parents, siblings, discuss with them about youe situation and how you want to deal with them.
6. If you can find an alternate phone, use this phone as a ""study phone"" where you can do studying. If you can't, please put away the phone unless necessary.(Another alternative is using laptops for studying purposes only or deleting apps that cause distraction). (Recommendation: download apps like forest which prevents you from using your phone.)
7. NEVER DO WORK ON YOUR BED. Trust me once you get tired you will toh and sleep.


*health related(physical)

1. Eat healthily.(ah duh)
2. If you are having difficulty cooking at home, tabao if need to.(besides, soothe mental health by walking outside)
3. Exercise and play sports.(I mean sports with 2 people lah like badminton or ball throwing or running)
4. Clean your room(Extra burn of calories)
5. Get enough sleep. (Best to sleep at 10pm but most would end up sleeping at 12pm or later)
6. For my army enlistees for next year, please do not forget to train for ippt and prep for next years' NS phase.

*Boredom

1. Discover a new talent/hobby. Another course also works.(Check out coursera.)(p.s. some online course can give audit meaning the resources are free but no need cert. Cert requires money but the learning resources are free.)(Ironic but for me, I started script writing)
2. Take this opportunity to discover your neighbourhood. Who knows, you might find a new coffeeshop nearby under a few blocks away.
3. Have study sessions via zoom, youtube or discord.(Either w your own friends or friends from the other side of the world)
4. Volunteer more.

*Organisation

1. Make a timetable, schedule. Try to aim for 5 hours in the weekends.
2. Organise your study area/desk.
3. Get a planner to plan out what you want to do and assignments needed to be done.
4. If you have a hoarding problem(like me), put all those things that causes you to hoard in one area(e.g. notes and worksheets that you may not use, or subject files you may not use) and clear it such that you have a place to study.(aka your desk)
5. If you are a person who suck at highlighting and underlining, use sticky notes. 

*mental health.

1. For those who are smoke/drugs addicts, game addicts or masturbators.(Yes, I have friends who do this). Use this as an opportunity to curb your addictions and focus all your energy towards studying. (I mean technically, in NS you need to learn how to reduce your smoking addiction so....best to do it now right?). Use this as an opportunity to turn over a new leaf.(Same goes for those planning to lose weight.)
2. Use platforms like instagram and reddit to rant about your problems. As much as there are trolls, I believe that if you have any issues and you aren't able to talk to parents or friends...this is the viable option I can give for this case.
3. Sometimes, getting outside to chill can help one to relax.
4. Aromatherapy. Idk
5. Make a diary. Write about your issues.
6. Do look out for your classmates/friends. They may be suffering like you too!

*Money related(I decided to add this part cus this is my opinion. )

1. Aim to use this as an opportunity to spend less.(Especially since we are in a recession)
2. Find part time jobs, jobs such as online tutoring and etc.
3. Sell stuff to others.(Refering to those who have a hoarding issue)
4. Aim to spend less (Cook instead of tabao, exercise in parks instead of gyms, buy needs (e.g. stationary becus running out of pencils) instead of wants(e.g. stationary becus it is cuter.)
5. Use lesser electricity or water(e.g. use fan isntead of air con.) Because bills.

* Legit study tips for those with major exams(psle, n, o, a levels)

1. For those taking major exams, strengthen your weaker topics, follow by yearly tys and lastly prelim papers from other schools.
2. Before starting, always read up your notes. Scan through and then start. (P.s. recommended timed condition if possible. If not, break it up, e.g. how much should you spend on a section of a paper?)
3. While doing the paper, underline. For those with diagrams, recommend to use pencil on diagrams as it is erasable.(NOT PEN)
4. Pls mark your work after conpletion.
5. (IF CAN) try to reread or compile a corrections bk so that you can refer to it again before doing new papers.
6. (IF CAN) In the event where workload is too much, try to attempt to use short/point form (if cher allow). E.g. if my answer is Hitler should not be blamed because of XXXX and AAAAAA. Then short form answer would be: 

""Hitler is at fault as :
* XXXX
* AAAAAA""

7.For lecture/lessons whereby teacher is teaching new topics, if you feel sleepy or bored while watching, do other stuff involving the subject. E.g. if chem lecture and you already know what is the topic about, do chem related tutorials. (I USED THIS FOR MATH IN 2019). Either ways, KEEP YOSELF AWAKE through the lecture.
8.Please always ask qns if in doubt. Teachers, friends, other classmates, tutors, sibling and even reddit.

What I mean by strong outcomes is, what are you gonna gain by achieving your goal?

However, I didn't uninstall but I only played once my tasks are done and I'm satisfied with it or if I have free time to fk around.\n\nAlso I feel like selling your gaming pc is abit overkill unless you rly think you will reach to a point of addiction la if you keep it around. Btw what's the specs ah of ur pc? Just curious"", 'Delete all your steam games, when im addicted to a game, i delete it. Im sorry Europa Universalis 4 amd Crusader Kings 2, your way too addictive. \n\nAfter a few days, the urge to play will cease.', 'if you do have intergrated graphics just remove your graphics card that should stop you from gaming :)', 'Study in school or library', 'Study elsewhere to free yourself from distractions', 'There are many games which run on Macs.', 'This.

playinglife,n9qqga,[rant] no hopes in entering uni,2021-05-11 14:41:03,SGExams,77673,29,40,"well, I did A levels last year and honestly, my results wasn't really the best to have a chance to enter a local university. (Just nice 70rp if you're wondering) I was always a hardworking student with decent results but in JC2 I got addicted to gaming, to distract myself from the family problems and I guess that led me to obtain results that were below my expectations. On top of that, I messed up my choices for NUS and NTU(I put those courses with high rps as my top choice and those that I may have a chance to enter as my 2nd-3rd choice) I only realised I have made this big mistake recently.... After receiving the rejection letter from NUS yesterday and not hearing anything from NTU(I doubt I'll be offered admission), I was very devastated(more than you can imagine) and was questioning my life choices. I plan to give it another try to appeal into NUS but now I'm kind of having thoughts of retaking A levels next year(2022 since I missed this year application period), which is not ideal as I'm also struggling financially and unsure as to whether I'll do better without the help of any teachers/tutors. Another option would be to take the poly route and try for uni in another 2-3 years(which isnt a bad idea but it also makes me question myself as to why I didnt just went to poly in the first place)

What should I do and is anyone in the same situation as me? :(",0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/n9qqga/rant_no_hopes_in_entering_uni/,"['Either retake or appeal. Dont waste your time with the Poly route.\n\nWasted that you put the high RP choices knowing your 70 RP is capable of entering a relatively good number of courses', 'I would retake... you‚Äôre clearly an intelligent person who is a victim of circumstance. However, if you choose to retake A levels you need to make a promise to yourself that you will put aside your games just for the year get into NUS and continue on with your higher education journey', 'You are eligible for quite a few courses in NTU. Try to write a good appeal statement for a course that you are likely to get in. All the best', ""since you have some financial challenges, poly may not be ideal as it'll likely be even more expensive than retaking as a private candidate;; since your RP is still decent, i would suggest appealing for courses that you didn't previously put in your list of choices/ your 2nd/ 3rd choice (all of which need to be within range of your RP, ofc :) )\n\n\natb, OP! ^ ^"", 'I was in a similar position as you, twice. In contrast to what others are suggesting, I highly urge you to consider your strengths and weaknesses first before jumping on the retake option. Retaking is NOT a guarantee for success because I\'ve done one unsuccessful attempt and one successful.\n\nRetaking on your own should only be your first choice when:\n\n1. You know exactly what went wrong. Eg. You decided to push your luck and spot things that you shouldn\'t, or you did well in your H2s but you failed GP.\n\n2. It is a predominantly science combi, and you are familiar with the practical components. Wrong answer immediately is shown in the answer key. Humanities will hardly provide any answer keys and those that do give model essays or bullet points that cannot assess your own essays and language well. \n\n3. You refuse/cannot enter any lower RP options in local/private U.\n\nThe reason why the criteria is so strict is because if you blindly study on your own with weak foundations, history will repeat. In my case, I made the switch to an Arts combi and finished it in 10 months, as opposed to capitalising on the ""advantage"" of having 3 years of experience under a Science combi, because I knew what I was weak at. Additionally, you are currently at a respectable 70RP which is eligible for a number of local U courses. Retaking would mean you need to maintain a standard and improve on top of that.\n\nYou can take the next few months to think. Consider lower RP course and apply next year. 2 year poly is not a bad option. My tuition teacher failed his As, went to poly, then ended up NUS and then got his Master\'s from Oxford. Part time private U + working is another option. My (young) uncle has been operating his tutoring business for years, only with private U degree. Can work from home due to pandemic-related requests for online lessons. Can also consider sign on. My NS superiors that are not even Major rank start to buy house and car alr, also private degree. One person who has come to me for advice also wanted to retake. In the end I told him to focus on his business endeavour. He wanted to keikiang retake, in the end he shelved the idea and he is much happier working on his growing business.\n\nMy point is, A level is not the only way. People fail A level/didn\'t make it into local U doesn\'t mean the starve to death or die on the roadside. Don\'t tunnel vision yourself into this godforsaken exam. It\'s not fun to retake. It\'s lonely. It\'s alot of self doubt and worry. It\'s alot of self discipline and resolve to not get burnt out. If you are truly confident in your ability, go for the retake. Otherwise there is no shame in going your own path.', 'Retake A levels or appeal, if u are appealing, appealing to those 5-10rp below u', ""i think you can try appealing first! would you consider opting for private university? retaking a levels as a private candidate won't be easy"", 'What u would do is to seriously build  portfolio and work experiences. I have a friend that graduated from poly and is seriously good at programming.  He managed to secure a min salary of 4k even before he graduated which is amazing. He works as a software engineer. He didn\'t apply to Uni because he has all the experiences needed to progress further and he thinks that Uni would not benefit him that much as ""doors"" are already opened for him', 'You had made a terrible mistake putting courses with RP much higher than yours. That is the first step to disaster. Try again next year and not repeat this again.', 'I went into SMU wif 67.5 rp and actually got accepted into NUS and NTU too i juz rejected them. Don‚Äôt retake or go poly :‚Äô) you don‚Äôt have to.', 'Is SMU not in your consideration?', 'honestly ntu might still accept u. idk what courses u put as the first few choices but no news is gd news. there is also second window and appeals fr u to consider', 'i think you could either consider to appeal or take a gap year and get some working experience to boost ur portfolio & apply again next year!', 'Have u considered doing some volunteer work/ temp jobs this year and reapplying for courses in the big 3 + SIT allied health courses next year? Sometimes a gap year can help u have a better idea of what u want to do as well!', 'I took a gap year after my poly graduation in 2020 to gain more working experience related to the course I want to go to! It definitely helped me get accepted this year! You should go for some traineeship instead! :)', 'yo op same boat (62rp tho) but instead I applied to NTU history (igp around 67?? iirc) with aba and didnt bother with NUS at all. I also applied to poly and started school in april lol. honestly these people saying poly is a waste of time dont know whats going on.... if you have a course that you don‚Äôt mind taking you can def try poly + you could get exempted for 1 or 2 semesters. University aspects are also better compared to 70rp if you put enough effort into a good gpa which is doable! do pm me about the a levels to poly route lol\n\nedit also saw that you‚Äôre interested in health sciences think a solid 3.7 and above in a related course plus cca could definitely get you into uni you want! keep your options open', ""I'm in the same situation as well.. Got rejected from NUS by also putting an extremely high rp course as first choice. I got 75rp. If anyone's keen to give advice, please let me know as I feel extremely lost. CHS is my second choice, and I'm hoping I can get in through appeal."", ""Just retake As, you'll be able to do it!"", ""Actually, it depends on his family's financial situation. [Up to 95% of polytechnic fees](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/lower-fees-sit-suss-and-higher-varsity-polytechnic-grants-next-academic-year) can be covered by bursary depending on family income."", 'yes i did consider, but my current financial situation wouldnt allow me to even try private university and the fees are wayyyy higher than the savings my family has.\nRetaking is tough which is why i considered poly, as the school fees can be subsidised by the government :)', ""hi, could i ask which courses did you apply to? if you're uncomfortable to share it here, you could dm me :)"", 'Hi, I took A levels in 2020 and got 68.75 rank point. Just got rejected from NUS. SMU and NTU still processing. I‚Äôm interested in your choice of course as well. Do you mind sharing?', 'nope, im interested in health sciences and going into the research field, such as nursing and chemistry & biological chemistry but smu seemed to be offering just social sciences, business/accountancy and computer sciences.', ""yea im just trying to get my stuffs together and keep myself positive to have hope that i'll get an offer soon :)\nI put chemistry and biological chemistry(73.25) as my first choice followed by Biological Sciences(81.25rp) followed by bioengineering (71.25) and chemical and biomolecular engineering (77.5) \nI guess my choices and the order are kinda bad considering my grades do not even match the requirements :')"", ""I have not actually considered in volunteering or working in a gap year. I believe that the main reason i didnt got a chance to be offered admission was due to my results which were below their standards. I feel that my results limits what I'm able to choose, hence im kind of moving towards having a better A levels result or getting a good gpa in poly in the future. But thank you for suggesting this, it'll be something i'll put in mind"", ""i can relate because i come from a similar financial background and have no offers yet from universities either hence did some research. SIM has this 'ge bursary' as financial aid. it is indeed difficult with financial constraints as a concern... i hope you would receive an offer soon though! or you should appeal to other courses that you may not have listed in your choices before in ntu as their cutoff tend to be lower than the other two uni :)"", ""A lot of people who graduated with me (me included) ended up not working in the fields they studied for - because they either didn't know what they were getting into, or their passion fizzled out. So if you are planning to spend a few years trying to get into university, you need to think a bit on whether it's really worth it."", 'thankyou sm for the info!! hopefully we get some offers soon :>', ""oh i see, thanks for the insight!! :')""]"

i take huge breaks after not doing much, and there's a lot of family issues im going through rn so i feel pretty unmotivated, and my dad suggested i call people while studying or sumn, and i agreed until i realised i didn't really have anyone to do this withü§°ü§°ü§°

it's honestly extremely difficult to even start everyday, i feel extreme fatigue and i just keep thinking about going back in time (im currently addicted to looking at old pictures of myself)

whenever i realize how much work i have left i just get stressed and distract myself by watching shit and reading completely unrelated stuff, and then after that i feel like complete shit again and try to study but by then my dopamine levels get hella low because studying just isn't stimulating my brain enough, and i go back to watching shit and it's just a spiral from that point on

ive tried pomodoro, ive tried waking up early and getting shit done, ive tried watching study with me videos, ive tried using discord study channels but i always chicken out for no reason

i think what i need is like a few study buddies to share my goals with and idk just talk to during breaks, it's not even necessary to switch on your camera idk:((

While it is easy to see the good side of things, it would be foolish to completely discard the possible risks that comes with legalised cannabis.\n\nSure there is the argument about cigarettes and alcohol, but those have been too deeply entrenched in culture to easily remove without causing massive unhappiness at all levels of society as compared to those who want legalised cannabis, which is pretty much a very small portion of the Singapore society; and even then there are already restrictions in place to reduce their use even further.

Has anyone read the relevant articles (e,g, [here](https://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/CND_Sessions/CND_63Reconvened/Press_statement_CND_2_December.pdf)) and [WHO\'s responses](https://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/Scheduling_Resource_Material/Cannabis/Consultations_with_WHO_Questions_and_Answers_26_November_2019.pdf), or are people just jumping at whatever Shan says?\n\n*WHO is in agreement with Shan about the harmful effects on Cannabis on society.* This is mentioned repeatedly [here](https://www.unodc.org/documents/commissions/CND/Scheduling_Resource_Material/Cannabis/Consultations_with_WHO_Questions_and_Answers_26_November_2019.pdf) (see, for example WHO\'s response to Singapore and other countries in page 21). In particular, it produces effects on mental state and behavior typical of abused drugs, induces withdrawal symptoms and has adverse effects on cognitive ability, impairment of driving and psychosis (WHO mentions it isn\'t lethal though). WHO themselves mentioned that 1 in 10 users develop some form of cannabis use disorder. In page 22, the committee explicitly noted that ""the high rates of public health problems arising from cannabis use and the global extent of such problems‚Äù. Similar statements acknowledging the harmful effects of cannabis are littered all over the article.\n\n*How is it possible to take such remarks as a statement that cannabis isn\'t harmful?*\n\nThe vote (whose margins were razor thin, btw), was not about whether cannabis was harmful or not. It was about removing cannabis and some of its derivatives from Schedule IV, which, to the best of my knowledge, are mainly reserved for drugs which are dangerous and have *no known use in therapeutics*. Apart from supposed use in therapy, one of the main arguments by WHO was that cannabis was deemed as no more dangerous that the other drugs in Schedule I (and not in Schedule IV). What are some of these other drugs? Cocaine. Morphine. I think you\'d be hard pressed to convince many that Cocaine is ""not harmful"".\n\nUltimately, Singapore\'s drug policy is unlikely to change (and thankfully so, imho). From a practical perspective, international controls aren\'t changed by much either. My sense is that Shan\'s worry, founded or not, has more to do with *public perception*. Perception that cannabis isn\'t harmful, as suggested by this meme. Or the chorus on about how alcohol is a bigger problem --- maybe it is (I\'m personally doubtful), but why deal with 2 problems when we\'re having problems with just one? \n\nThis worry about public perception isn\'t just a Singapore thing. For example, in page 27 the representative from the USA says, ""The public perception of cannabis as not being dangerous is one of the leading factors contributing to the global increase in cannabis use/abuse"".\n\nIt\'s fair to discuss potential medical uses for cannabis in a way similar to morphine. Its also fair to criticize Shan for attributing the decision by the UN to be driven by corporations and money without evidence. It is, however, incredibly disingenuous to say that WHO agrees that cannabis isn\'t harmful.\n\nI know I\'ll be whacked for being a party pooper. But people, please read the WHO\'s recommendations and responses before jumping to conclusions!', ""One ban I seriously dont understand is vape..m WHY BAN IT its smells SO NICE for everyone not some toxic gas cloud which smells of cancer which fills the room after a person's smoke"", ""One of the reasons why Singapore is so wilfully blind to all the things mentioned in this post is that it if it accepts WHO and the UN's position on marijuana, what about the people and traffickers the state has killed over the past decades for bringing in capital amounts of marijuana."", 'People salty just because they want to smoke weed.', 'What about the tax dollars you can get from it Shan???? /s', 'Sick of smokers smoking everywhere in my hdb and that the government doing nothing about it.', '1.

So far I believe there are only 2 approved medical uses of cannabis (Lennox-Gestaut syndrome and spasticity in multiple sclerosis). The potential number of patients that can benefit is very limited, but at least having it available is great as these are terrible conditions with limited treatment options. There must also be adequate training of the prescribing specialist (in this case, only neurologists) and the hospital pharmacist. No other doctors who are not specialists in this field can be allowed to prescribe it so that there is strict control (no other doctor can manage those 2 conditions in Singapore anyway). \n\nDefinitely do not approve it for widespread consumption. The healthcare system is already overburdened by the consequences of alcohol, tobacco, benzodiazepine, opioid, and other substance abuse disorders.

I don't think there are studies regarding Singapore specifically weighing the risks and benefits to legalization vs non-legalization (cause we've never legalized it before for there to be an evidence based comparison), but there have been many studies showing how decriminalization/legalization has had overall positive effects on other countries societies where they went from one to the other.

I think a lot of things got lost when lobby groups in the USA picked up the Portuguese example and polished it into a talking point.\n\nIt is true that drug decriminalization was followed by a decrease in drug-related violent criminality and heavy drug usage nationwide. However, the drug policy change must not be seen in isolation. At the same time, Portugal was expanding economically and economic expansion is positively correlated with decreases in drug usage. This same economic expansion allowed for a significant increase in economic social transfers that lifted much of previous drug users from conditions of abject poverty.

In fact, I believe official numbers already show a deterioration in terms of heavy drug use in the present context of prolonged economic downturn.\n\nIt is also important to point out that the main public health problem in Portugal as related to drugs was the abuse of opioids, specifically straight heroin that found its way into the local market as the bulk of drug cargoes transited through the country and into central Europe.

It was his second bout of the disease, after being struck with colorectal cancer in 2006.\n\n> Ms Chan said her father died peacefully in his sleep on Monday morning, leaving behind his wife, 73, and daughter. ""I\'ve been given ample time to prepare for this day. But no matter how much time is given, when it comes, it feels like I have been hit by a truck,"" she said. ""Dad was like a crab, soft on the inside, firm and stern outside. My dad had a very big heart and he would give whatever he had to others. I will definitely miss him so much.""\n\n> A former drug addict, Mr Chan used to work as a salesman in his father\'s trading firm and led a self-described ""havoc"" life of drinking and drugs up to his early 20s.\n\n> He was introduced to Christianity and stayed at the Christian halfway house House of Grace, which was set up by his wife before they married and he kicked his drug habit.\n\n> The couple later tied the knot and renamed the halfway house The Hiding Place in 1978. It housed and helped drug addicts to turn their lives around while also assisting gamblers and those hooked on alcohol.\n\n> In 1992, Pastor Chan was given the Life Insurance Association Award, which honours individuals and organisations that have given others a new lease of life.\n\n> Mr Tan Hock Seng, 62, a former drug addict, had known Pastor Chan for 39 years, since he went to stay at The Hiding Place.\n\n> Mr Tan, now a pastor and also a staff member at The Hiding Place, said of his first encounter with the Chans: ""I couldn\'t understand why they were helping us as we were not the obedient kind and gave them lots of headaches. They did not gain financially from it.\n\n> ""I learnt that they did it for the love of God. They sacrificed a lot to take care of us, living with us and sacrificing their privacy. They also had to raise funds to keep this place going.""\n\n> He described Pastor Chan as a fatherly figure who was very wise.\n\n> Mr Caleb Tan said Pastor Chan was the father he never had. The 46-year-old, a former drug addict, was raised by his grandmother and had no idea who his biological father was. He was in jail six times for drug and other offences.\n\n> When he was released in 2010, he went to The Hiding Place as he was homeless and experienced Pastor Chan\'s compassion.\n\n> For instance, he was preparing jam one day to make the pineapple tarts that The Hiding Place sold to raise funds when he was badly injured in a kitchen accident. He suffered extensive burns, had five broken ribs and his lungs collapsed.\n\n> Mr Tan said: ""We have no blood relation but Pa (what he calls Pastor Chan) told me not to worry so much. He promised me The Hiding Place would take care of me. And even if The Hiding Place doesn\'t take care of me, Pa said he would personally take care of me.""\n\n> He said Pastor Chan helped him to get back on the straight and narrow and taught him what it means to be a trustworthy man and a good husband. Said Mr Tan, who now works as a cook at The Hiding Place: ""He always put others before him. And even when he was very ill, he still constantly worried about us.""\n\n> Social worker Benny Thiam, 35, was a former drug addict who stayed at The Hiding Place for three years. He said Pastor Chan was a very forgiving and generous man who was always willing to give others a second chance. ""I have learnt this from Pastor Chan - not to give up on someone and to give them a second chance,"" he said.\n\n> The wake is being held at The Hiding Place at 50, Jalan Lekar till tomorrow.

In the case of nicotine, it's only slightly physiologically addictive, but very psychologically addictive - could be the habitual behavior of lighting up, triggered by seeing or smelling someone smoke, or needing to have a cigarette in the hand. Gambling is another activity that has a high risk of psychological addiction, because of our hardwired response to intermittent reinforcement.\n\nSome drugs build up high tolerance, where you need ever increasing amounts of the chemical to get the same effect, and exacerbates both addictions. Narcotics are again terrible here because the body builds up high tolerances to them, which is why narcotic painkillers have to be used sparingly, and abusers inevitably overdose."", 'Gotcha']"

If hard drugs were legal tomorrow, I would say that the vast vast majority of non-users will not start consuming. The demand for drugs ( and especially hard drugs) is inelastic. Portugal, the Netherlands and others have demonstrated this. We could throw bricks of heroin from the top of UOB tower and the vast vast majority of people would not bother to pick them up. At the same time, we can lock our country down, hang the mules and make heroin cost hundreds of dollars a gram and that same proportion of users will still pay it. \n\nOur society and government has solved the problem of drug use by ensuring that the underlying social conditions that might feed hard drug usage don't really exist. So why continue to chase a policy that incentivises smuggling, makes drug consumption unnecessarily destructive and worsens crime? Why enforce this policy by killing people, destroying people's careers and families? Just because the government has framed the issue in a way that the costs are invisible to many Singaporeans does not mean they aren't there. We are also shutting out a lot of potential economic benefits that might arise from lower harm drugs. I want Singaporean vertical farming startups to grow cannabis, because if we restrict them to growing tomatoes and Strawberries, EDB's grant money is going to get flushed down the drain. Just because things look good when you look up from the bottom of the well does not mean there are not problems elsewhere. It also does not mean that we are optimally capturing opportunities.\n\nHere is the thing, we don't have to do everything at one go. If you are still panicked. We can keep drugs illegal. We can start by not hanging drug mules. We can start by mandating treatment for addicts and ensuring that they don't collect a criminal record so long as they obey an addiction specialists orders. We can provide opoid addicts with methadone and lower harm alternatives.*  We can start trialing medical CBD. If we are not happy with the results we can always go back. If we are happy, we can go a little bit further one step at a time. But here is the thing, there has not been a country that has gone back to hard enforcement because, as it turns out, working with economics and science tends to work better than working against with a show of force.\n\n\n*By the way, rich heroin addicts in Singapore already have access to a lot of these types of treatment via private doctors and the government has a stance of allowing it but not publicizing it. Meanwhile poor addicts locked up in a windowless cell and have their futures destroyed. Have a guess which group has much better results. Our current drug policy is an outlet for all of the worst aspects of our society with the perverse elitism, cruelty to the poor and love of punishment theatre. That alone is a good enough reason to not be complacent about this."", '""I am seeking redress, and so are most of my fellow citizens. Drug addiction ruins families and communities, and forces everyone to pay for the medical expenses incurred by addicts.""\n\nI think I have already pre-empted all of your nonsensical arguments. I am pleased to have predicted that you essentially believe that people are state property to be freely disposed of as the current hierarchy in society deems fit. It is good to know that I understand the opposing arguments well.\n\nHanging people, imprisoning people and ensuring people never find a decently paying legal job again is a strange way to ""protect and help"" your fellow man. \n\nThere is big reason why countries that have gone down the legalised/decriminalise route don\'t go back. Total costs to society goes down. And the negative externalities you are whining about are easier to address if we can tax and regulate it. You would be paying less than you do right now. Paying for drug enforcement l, all the externalities and 70% of our current prison population is not free. Maybe I should ""demand redress"" for this. And as a taxpayer I stand on better ground to seek redress for the harms of public policy than your stupid argument.\n\n\nBut here us another prediction, I think you prefer to pay more for the war on drugs rather than pay less for the alternatives.

Many features of the drug war even in Singapore are observably predicated on this. Such as people still bringing in large quantities of drugs through our border despite the lockdown to feed users who will pay whatever price for them. It is regrettable you think the intrusion of reality into your authoritarianism is risible.\n\nI think our values are slowly changing. And not in your favour. If your best argument for your garbage is that you can summon some plurality of a group of people recovering from 150 odd years of colonialism and many of autocracy to support you, I can readily see why you are so keen to have us under someone\'s thumb forever.', 'So what you are saying is the war on drugs is going against us, but we must double down on it even as we forget about ever winning it. You cite the US and their wars as examples of why we must never make a  keblakang pusing from disastrous policies? What madness is this?\n\nNote that \'asian values\' is in parentheses. There is nothing asian about that authoritarian ideology advocated by certain autocratic government in our neighbourhood. They just call it that to get uncritical racial inferiority complex afflicted people worked up and have their brains shut down. If you still identify with these \'values\' maybe you deserve to get demeaned\n\n""They can\'t even fight a simple virus""\n\nWell I guess, you are going to be principled and avoid taking western made vaccines. Western countries were never going to be good at the lockdown and enforcement. Of course without the MRNA technology ( Thank you university of Wisconsin Madison) that can rapidly generate vaccines to chase raipd chase a fast mutating virus, we might be locking down for a very very long time. Sinovac is likely good vaccine, but the process used to make it is old and slow. It may not be effective once enough mutations occur.\n\n""If the ""war on drug"" is ""unwinnable"", then its because the other countries are too lax and lenient on it. Our laws and enforcement ensure we don\'t have any of the same drug problem as elsewhere.""\n\n\nI think you have no idea how things work in other countries and are relying on ethnic stereotypes to shoot from the hip. You think other countries have not been just as harsh or thorough waging this stupid war? In the US drug trafficking carries life in prison or basically the equivalent of that. This used to also be the case in much of Europe. The US ended up locking up about 2.5 million people in prison at its height. Roughly 70% of whom were in there for drug related offences. That is an astonishing percentage of their population. Much of Europe has or had a similar level and composition of incarceration to us when they were fighting drugs like this.\n\nAlso what makes you think we don\'t have the same problems as elsewhere? Have a guess what percentage of our prison population is in there because of the war on drugs? It is also about 70%.--So much for being so different to the west. We ruin the lives of huge numbers of people over this. We kill a lot of people over a crime that unlike rape or murder has no victims.All for nothing. The drug trade appears to be unstoppable. If we had a more open society you would find research articles discussing the street prices of drugs, you will find them utterly stable. This is baked into the economics of this and is inevitable.\n\nYou might highlight that we don\'t have streets full of openly high homeless addicts. I wouldn\'t expect that. Our economy and society does well keeping people from becoming homeless. We have a robust healthcare system and it is easier to get the mentally ill trested. These are the ways we are different from the worst PARTS of America. It clearly works.\n\nSo here is the idea: What if we transferred the resources away from failed drug enforcement/ imprisonment and towards better safeguards against homelessness and better treatment for all forms of addiction.--the policies that we already do well.  We legalise Cannabis  and other low harm drugs so they can be taxed and regulated. We provide hard drugs with a doctor\'s prescription while steering addicts towards lower harm alternatives. Heroin now sells for lesd than laundry detergent per kilo. No more gangs. No more mules.\n\nImagine the reduction in total cost to our society if 70% of our prison population were out working to feed their families tomorrow? Imagine the new industries that will arise from a regulated medicinal and recreational low harm drug trade. Imagibe all the jobs that we can create.\n\nThere is a reason why there has never been a country that has legalized and then decided to go back to fighting the war again.', '[~73%](https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/over-70-cent-those-prison-are-there-drug-offenders)', '**[List of countries by prevalence of opiates use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of countries by prevalence of opiates use)**\n\nThis is a list of countries (and some territories) by the annual prevalence of opiates use as percentage of the population aged 15‚Äì64 (unless otherwise indicated).

Especially when you simply cite two sources, Netherland and Portgal. I absolutely agree on your stance on having a non-violent rehabilitation program.\n\nNevertheless, that statement is still bold considering that while homelessness is nearly non existent in Singapore which is a major contributor towards addiction, you\'re forgetting an arguably bigger contributor is mental health. I believe we can stand on the same stance that addiction is the mental submission of towards substances rather than it being physical. Simply put, people don\'t get addicted if they\'re mentally fulfilled. But Singapore definitely has an underlying mental health crisis. \n\nBut we are not talking about rehabilitation, are we? We are talking about the criminalization and decriminalisation of drugs. So your real metric of measure is simply Portugal and arguably Oregon (very recent though) \n\nThe idea with legal governance and providence of substances is that once given, it is very difficult to take it back e.g. alcohol, cigarettes. The idea that firstly, we are a democracy which means we do not have a one party system, just simply means the kind of irreversible consequences of decriminalising drugs just DOES NOT justify the risks. \n\nI still think having a good rehabilitation program and a rehoming system such as Netherland is good. But in no way should we support decriminalisation. You\'re making a lot of strong generalisation and assumptions of a few cases. The benefit of the doubt definitely acts against you. \n\nAlso I believe I mentioned decriminalisation of all drugs is a ""nuke all"" approach to ending the war on drugs considering the government legalise and control the supply of drugs.

My ultimate goal is to get cannabis legalised and regulated. I also want it to be pointless to smuggle drugs into Singapore because our addiction recovery policies are so strong. This necessarily means that hard drugs are going to be decriminalised.\n\nI think decriminalisation and rehabilitation go hand in hand. It is very difficult to rehabilitate people who have addiction if we also destroy their livelihoods and lock them up for years. But we can be selective and move step by step. Decriminalisation is distinct from legalisation. It can still be nominally illegal to possess heroin, but the key difference is that we are not imprisoning, caning, hanging and giving out criminal records to the people involved in hard drugs. Instead, We are giving addicts treatment in the same way that Rich Singporeans and foreigners already have access to. \n\nAs for evidence, to a more limited degree, States that have legalised or decriminalised cannabis ( and there are now a lot of them) have also basically demonstrated that demand for cannabis is mostly inelastic. Even beyond countries that have legalised, the fact that demand for drugs seems to be unaffected by enforcement even in Singapore ( the lock down provides a pretty good natural experiment) demonstrates that demand for drugs is inelastic and the punitive approach is costly and ineffective.\n\nWe have addressed the false idea pushed by the PAP that their authoritarian way of doing this is somehow always clean, cost free and super effective. Lets address the idea that activism in Singapore is ineffective. The government is not immune to steady pressure and is loathe to become the international odd one out no matter how much they push Shan out to talk shit in front of the media. In the case of 377a, we have gone from heavy enforcement to no enforcement to pink dot. I think that what happens next depends on how daring and 'hungry' people are.\n\nI am an engineering manager. I have seen, in the last 5 years, significant improvements in workplace safety and accountability. Many industries used to play the dirty trick of simply sending home all the foreign workers that got maimed or injured.--and the government quietly would side with them. Now all the workers know to call MOM and then call TWC2 ( the activist group, and yes, they are same guys that predicted that our worker dorms would become a pandemic breeding ground) to report your company if that shit happens. They call MOM to get enforcement and then they call TWC2 to ensure fucking Josephine Teo's Eunuchs do their job. It did not get this way because the Jo woke up one day and decided to not be a piece shit. It got this way because HOME, TWC2 and other NGO's kicked up a big fuss. They would form human chain at the airport to block companies from sending home workers without paying their medical bills. The companies responded by hiring bouncers and pai kia to try to push their way through. All this in front of foreigners at Changi airport This escalated until MOM realised that if they kept siding with the industry friends, there would be a very public scandal. Activism is effective even if the government here has a lot of defence measures to deter it and encourage learned helplessness. I have linked a list of other activist successes.\n\nhttps://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-commentary-advocacy-achieve-singapore/"", ""\n\n>\nWe, as a society, as a nation, have choosen to make a firm and hard stance against all forms of drugs. And I think we are doing pretty well.\n\nFirst off, who is 'we'? The British shoved the war on drugs down our throats. LKY opted to enormously expand it. He cut off jury trials when he found that it was difficult to get Singaporeans to vote to hang people. I am sure there is a hard nut minority of Authoritarian crazies like yourself, but there is no 'we' here. 99% of 'Asian values' authoritarianism is simply demanding that we blindly continue to do what we were colonised to do.\n\n\n>Enforcement. That's their weakness and problem. That's why drugs is such a problem over there. That's why they are struggling to control their own drug problems and are forced to consider legalization of drugs. \n\nMany if the places that are have decriminalised or have decided to legalise low harms drugs have concluded that the 'problem', as far as cannabis and others is concerned is a government invented one. They haved decided that most of the problems associated with hard drug use emerge from trying to prohibit it. So they have simply decided to stop. The have decided to stop ruining their societies just to keep demented people like you happy.\n\n\n>Yes I think they are not harsh enough and not thorough enough. They definitely should start considering using the death penalty. I mean death penalty already exists in the US, they just need to start applying it to the drug criminals. At least start applying to the high volume traffickers, unambiguous cases.\n\n\nDemand for drugs is inelastic and does not respond to enforcement. On of the reasons Singapore cand indulge Authoritarian fantasies about harsh enforcement is our low crime rate overall. We already execute a high percentage of our murder rate here over drugs. In past years we used to hang more people over drugs than were murdered here and we would still be doing this if we did not back away from the mandatory death penalty. The US has a higher crime rate than Sg. Can you imagine how many people they are going to be killing over this it us going to wind up in the many thousands? If Singapore is backing away from this failed crazy nonsense, who are we to tell them to go ruin their society like that. Even if they weren't deciding to decriminalise, they would laugh at us.\n\n\n>Looks good to me. It means law enforcement is doing their job.\n\nI can see that you view success in term of maximizing the number of people we imprison, cane and hang. I am not sure you would even find a majority of the PAP adopting this framing.\n\n>No, we did not ruin their lives. They ruined it themselves. They choose to trade or consume drug knowing full well the penalties against it. No one forced them to do this.\n\nOf course by this framing, any failed policy can be seen as a success if we just blame the people that we destroy over it hard enough. \n\nThese people are people' brother's, sisters, fathers , mothers breadwinners and employees.You say no one forced them and yet people keeping doing it and will keep doing it to the end of time. Maybe it would be better to try to manage this in a way that did not destroy so much human potential.\n\n>Cannabis is not huge problem here either. I understanding why there countries which are considering legalization of these drugs because they are unable or unwilling to control their use. Over here, we are still able to control it and very willing to ban their use. These drugs are not an issue here.\n\nCannabis is a huge problem here. We should be able to go down to the shops, show IC and buy it for our enjoyment. We should be allowed to create jobs growing processing regulating and selling it. We should be allowed to make money with this opportunity. That the government has instead chosen, predictably, to hang/cane/imprison people over this is stupid and a huge problem. \n\n\n>True. If you are going to use numbers here, you should know that the Singapore prision services also provide rehabilitation programmes to these inmates with overall success rate of 70%. \n\nI know how they got that 70% statistic.lt is really fake and lame. They aggregate all the 'drug addicts' including all the 'addicts' who are using things like,  Cannabis, that are only addictive in your social studies textbook. They counter check 5 years after they are released to see if they have been convicted for drugs again.  Liddat, even the US has a 70% success  rate. And they barely even bothered with rehabilitation programs. \n\nI wonder what your success rate is for the highly addictive drug users is like?

A few counties have already done this.

To have the freedom to seeing your own children injecting substances in their veins is a sign of progress? To see whole families stoned or addicted in their own homes a sign of progress?\nSomehow this does not feel like progress.

Or is there some grand conspiracy going on? I don\'t know if this is trolling or advanced stupidity.\n\nThe truth is that decriminalization makes the gangs disappear and ensures our addicts get proper treatment. It would allow me to go buy some cannabis to go enjoy myself.

The University of Wisconsin Madison is a famous party school renowned across America. I loved visiting them. They also have 20 Nobel prize winner and invented the MRNA method used to produce the Pfizer and moderna Vaccines.\n\nI am hardly anti-western. I too consume plenty of western media, writing and books. \nOr maybe you are projecting things? Perhaps you are anti-eastern and therefore assume that anyone who don\'t agree with you to be anti-western.\n\n\n> You can sit in your little well and wait for China to figure out exactly how effective their Sinopharm vaccine will be to the new COVID strains. Also, I hear that several key members of Sinopharms team are American educated.\n\nGood for them too. I hope they succceed. \nWhether they took drugs or not, I do not know and also I fail to see how other people doing dubious things is a good reason for everyone else to do the same.\n\n\n> Also since you like to highlight irrelevant negative elements of other people\'s culture to make non sequitur arguments about who we should follow, how many Nobel prize winners have our Universities produced?\n\nIf you are referring to what I wrote previously, I was highlighting that not everything western is right, good or effective and that we\nshould not blindly following whatever the West does. \n\nThe example I used shows the difference in how the different countries do things and also highlight what they can or can\'t do.\nWe can see how impossible it is to enforce mandatory mask usage and social distancing (or the equivalent) over there.\nFor these nations, if they can\'t enforce something as mild as mask usage across the country, they can hardly fully enforce their drug laws as well.\nI am not throwing shade at them. It is what it is.  For them it is understandable if they want to consider drug legalization. \nThough I am very sure, this is something that they are not very willing to do or they would have done it already.\n\nSince you quoted the University of Wisconsin Madison, I assume you are using them to comparing with the univesities here.\nWell good for them, although for a education institution with a 170+ years of history (much other then even singapore), \nthey should have the success that they have now.', 'Other countries are having success with legalisation. Many people have had success in an environment of light touch enforcement. This happens enough that it forms the basis of a scientific consensus on how to solve this problem. \n\nThe fact is that primary source of problems with drug use in society come from people like you trying to enforce prohibition. You are the primary problem.. For example, since you don\'t believe that properly quantifies the risks associated with drugs, both Cannabis and Opium have thousands of years of history of safe recreational in Chinese history. It was only banning the latter that made it so valuable that it enticed foreigners to smuggle it and enticed chinese people to part their solver to buy it. I think you know how that story ends. Yet the chinese chauvinist way is to look at this and conclude that we need more government gangsterism to make people obey. Imagine thinking the world revolves around a single traumatic cultural experience where your authoritarians fucked everything up for everyone. Imagine reading that cultural experience wrongly.\n\nYou want Singapore to be that same outlier, because naturally Chinese chauvinist like you learn all the wrong lessons from history. People like you think a government can ignore history, economics and science.\n\n""You can have so much fun over there. And the opportunities is so much greater over there then here. As an engineer, you would make so much more money over there too as well I think. Take your family so that your kids can get to enjoy drugs with you. Bonding time perhaps?""\n\nAll I am willing to share careerwise is that I shuttle back and forth and I am happy and well compensated. I free agree that I am more fortunate than most people here and much of that is not down to skill. And yes,my family is there and when my children turn 18, we will share cannabis and mushrooms with them. You seem so happy that engineers/creatives and innovators in Singapore stay underpaid and that there a few opportunities outside rent seeking  activities in our economy. The thing you treasure the most is this idea of a Singapore that is only good at obedience and that is happy to submissively watch every opportunity expand their wealth, happiness and horizons pass them by  out of fear. Read the room, no one is as happy with this as you are and Singapore will leave you behind along with all your beliefs.\n\nYou keep drawing a comparison between drugs and masks.\n\nPeople obey mask mandates in Singapore to the point non compliance is not a problem. This is our government informed by good science. Many of us started voluntarily masking up even before the government told us to. Society is obeying the science, not just government. Success in controlling the pandemic creates a self reinforcing cycle of trust and compliance. You think people will listen to the government just because they threaten to be violent and punitive?\n\nDrug enforcement in Singapore continues to be a losing hopeless challenge even though we are locked down. The government is fighting very fundamental forces of economics and is denying science. Failure us self reinforcing and we are completely outside a wide ranging expert consensus for this. No amount Qing dynasty magical mindset from people like you will change this.\n\nI went back to the US a few weeks ago. They have no cultural experience of a pandemic like this. Everyone in my circle is masked up. Unsurprisingly, no one I know has gotten COVID. I am told that nearly everyone is masked up now, but it is still a learning process.--They did not experience SARS. I think that if the pandemic stretches on compliance will improve. You seem to think people will only do what is good for themselves and others if the government threatens to whack them?\n\n What part of Duterte do you actually disagree with? Or are you just racist and don\'t like being compared to a Fillipino?', '> Other countries are having success with legalisation. Many people have had success in an environment of light touch enforcement. \n\nYou argue that countries that legalised drugs are having success. The question is success with what? And what were the reasons that lead to it?\nVery likely, they did so because they were forced to (crime, societal problems, HIV infection etc).\n\nNow look at Singapore - do we have high levels of drug related crimes? Are we really having so much problem with drugs that we need to consider\ndrugs legalization? I think not. Not even close.\n\n\n\n>  This happens enough that it forms the basis of a scientific consensus on how to solve this problem. \n\nIf you want to go the scientific route, one can easy find research that suggest otherwise.\nIn fact, the consensus appears to be mixed and unclear.\n\nFor example:  https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/ondcp/ondcp-fact-sheets/drug-decriminalization-in-portugal-challenges-and-limitations\n\nThere\'s even some evidence that legalizing drugs leads to more crime. \nFor example, Amsterdam - https://www.reuters.com/article/us-netherlands-drugs-idUSKCN1VI1OJ\n\n\n> It was only banning the latter that made it so valuable that it enticed foreigners to smuggle it and enticed chinese people to part their solver to buy it.\n\nOpium was banned because it led to widespread addiction by the Emperors. And it was greed by the other foreign nations that lead to the wars.\nOver time, even the Western countries started banning it as well because they too had the smiliar problems.\nEven they could see the problems with it. The problem was they could not really enforce the laws well enough.\n\n> You seem so happy that engineers/creatives and innovators in Singapore stay underpaid...\n\nYes Singapore is a poorer place for engineers etc. I do fail to see how this has to do with drug legalization. Unless you want to tell me that getting stoned or addicted will improve innovation and lead to higher pay etc\n\n> Drug enforcement in Singapore continues to be a losing hopeless challenge even though we are locked down.\n\nYou assert it so. I assert it otherwise. \n\n> I went back to the US a few weeks ago. They have no cultural experience of a pandemic like this. Everyone in my circle is masked up.\n\nYet somehow US leads the world in Covid deaths. \nAnd a huge portion of the population defies their own government\'s COVID requests/mandates.\n\n\n> What part of Duterte do you actually disagree with? Or are you just racist and don\'t like being compared to a Fillipino?\n\nI do have to say I do disagree with him inciting his own citizens to take justice in their own hands. That is not a very approriate way to do it. But then the Philipines is a complex place, for the people to elect and to support him, suggests that the drug problems must gotten out of hand over there.\n\nAre you so desperate to ""win"" that you have to resort to calling me a ""Chinese chavunist"" first and ""racist"" next?', '""The question is success with what?"" \n\nThey are having success in cutting all the negative aspects of drug use. Legalisation of Cannabis allows many people to enjoy themselves in a safer way than drinking, tobacco or gambling. It has created a billion dollar industry producing hundreds of thousands of jobs. Any reasonable objective person would consider this a great success.\n\nYOur Reuters article cites no statistics and no evidence to back its headline crime has increased in Amsterdam. You should read articles before you post them. \n\n The report it quotes is from political opponents of the Mayor within the city council. No one in Amsterdam would even consider resuming the war on drugs. I think they should take the next step and legalise/regulate everything that would make the most sense.\n\nYou also cite an ancient report from the ONDCP ( an organization with a vested interest in banning drugs) cherry picking edge statistics from Portugal to pathetically try to discredit a far more comprehensive and definitive report from CATO ( a right of center think tank) showing highly positive results from Portugal. Has Portugal reversed course? And what has the US electorate chosen to do since this report? egalising drugs is a bipartisan issue in America now. Only the police lobby and the fundies disagree. Everyone can see through the lies. No one has any regrets.\n\n""Opium was banned because it led to widespread addiction by the Emperors. And it was greed by the other foreign nations that lead to the wars. Over time, even the Western countries started banning it as well because they too had the smiliar problems. Even they could see the problems with it. The problem was they could not really enforce the laws well enough."" \n\nOpium had a 2000 year history in China at the time of the Opium war. Why all of a sudden did they feel the need to ban it? Also what makes you think the Qing emperors were so caring for the Chinese people they enslaved? It only led to widespread addiction when the Qing ran China into the ground, allowed China to stagnate and caused massive hardships for our ancestors. Blaming the foreign opium allowed them to avoid solving the hard questions about their misrule and about Chinese Feudalism.\n\nBanning Opium made the problems worse not better, because they incentivised smuggling and the loss of China\'s silver surplus. It turned an addiction problem into a nation destroying problem. Think critically. Everyone is greedy, not just the foreigners. If you require the whole world to not be greedy in order for your stupid Authoritarianism to work, you will end up always being humiliated. \n\nGovernments always look for outsiders to blame when they fuck things up for the common people. Looking at people like you, it works. I am amazed at how effective banning Opium is at making some Chinese identify with the people that oppressed our ancestors for 400 years. We should be happy that it led the destruction of the Qing even as we regret what it cost China. We should be happy that forcing China open allowed millions of our ancestors to be free to flee. We should be happy that it allowed feudalism to collapse. Your alternative is confused bullshit where you hate the white colonisers, defend the manchurian colonizers and love your ancestors being enslaved. Worse still, we were only taught to believe this bullshit in the 60s so that people like you can be pawns of government policy.\n\nAlso, your belief that the British banned opium while exporting it to China is fake news spread by Chinese racists in the 60s. Addiction was not a problem in the UK in the 1850s because their economy was booming and they had an amazing growth of a middle class. \n\n Opium was legal and commonplace in the UK until the 1920s when misuse soared due to the massive psychological, social and economic problems created by the first world war. Notice that drug abuse is always low when society is functioning well and becomes high when there is underlying turmoil? Notice that you cannot solve this problem by arresting enough drug users?  The British eventually responded to this by banning the illicit use of Heroin and implementing a system where "" these drugs were available to addicts through doctors; this arrangement became known as the ""British system"" and was confirmed by the report of the Departmental Committee on Morphine and Heroin Addiction (Rolleston Committee) in 1926.[1] The Rolleston Report was followed by ""a period of nearly forty years of tranquillity in Britain, known as the Rolleston Era. During this period the medical profession regulated the distribution of licit opioid supplies and the provisions of the Dangerous Drugs Acts of 1920 and 1923 controlled illicit supplies.""[2] The medical treatment of dependent drug users was separated from the punishment of unregulated use and supply. This policy on drugs was maintained in Britain, and nowhere else, until the 1960s. Under this policy drug use remained low; there was relatively little recreational use and few dependent users, who were prescribed drugs by their doctors as part of their treatment.""\n\n\nSo what changed? \n""In 1961 the international Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs was introduced. To control global drug trading and use, it banned countries from treating addicts by prescribing illegal substances, allowing only scientific and medical uses of drugs. It was not itself binding on countries, which had to pass their own legislation.[3]\n\nFollowing pressure from the US, the UK implemented the Drugs (Regulation of Misuse) Act in 1964. Although the Convention dealt with the problems of drug production and trafficking, rather than the punishment of drug users, the 1964 Act introduced criminal penalties for possession by individuals of small amounts of drugs, as well as possession with intent to traffic or deal in drugs. The police were soon given the power to stop and search people for illegal drugs.""\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_the_United_Kingdom\n\nThe UK was not the only country pressured into doing this. Have a guess when we started waging a war on Drugs? The Singapore misuse of drugs act only came about in 1973 in response to right wing American pressure in the 60s. We then had idiots wrapping this policy in authoritarian Chinese racial fake history so that even now that we have become aware that this policy is disastrous and that we adopted it primarily in order to carry Richard Nixon\'s ballsack, people like you will scream at any attempt to stop doing this stupid shit. The amount of racial pride you have at our ability to continue to enforce a failing policy that foreigners shoved down our throat is amazing. Ironically the people that did this to us learned faster than us. When we finally open up in a few decades time, it will be an American company selling us cannabis, all the scientific research on this will have been done by US universities and they will have made all the money and won all the Nobel prizes instead of us. \n\nAs for COVID, how about this? The US government failed at getting its lockdown to work. So why should we continue to listen to their 1960s advice to wage a war on drugs? Advice they no longer follow themselves? Governments succeed when they obey science and economics. They fail when they listen to people like you who insist we must beat our heads on a wall. Drug enforcement in Singapore continues to be a losing hopeless challenge even though we are locked down. \n\nYou can assert what you like. Tomorrow there will still be poor people in Changi prison over this and there will still be tons of drugs coming through the border. Even in this super compliant country that has mostly beaten COVID. This is what you get when you wage war on science and economics. You lose.', '&#x200B;\n\n\\> They are having success in cutting all the negative aspects of drug use.\n\nAll negative aspects? Now I think this is a bit too much.\n\nNo matter how you want to spin this, there\'s plenty of negative aspects to drugs be the soft ones such as Cannabis or the hard ones as Opium.\n\nNegative aspects (the most obvious one being that of addiction) that have convinently ignored in your writing so far.\n\n\\> YOur Reuters article cites no statistics and no evidence to back its headline crime has increased in Amsterdam.

My point is to show that there is hardly any conclusive consensus about drug legalisation.\n\n\\> Opium had a 2000 year history in China at the time of the Opium war. Why all of a sudden did they feel the need to ban it?\n\nThe simple reason is that opium addiction had increase to the point that it could not be ignored.\n\n[https://www.britannica.com/topic/opium-trade](https://www.britannica.com/topic/opium-trade)\n\n"" Levels of opium addiction grew so high that it began to affect the imperial troops and the official classes. The efforts of the Qing dynasty to enforce the opium restrictions resulted in two armed conflicts between China and the West, known as the Opium Wars,""\n\n[https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/opium-war-1839-1842](https://www.nam.ac.uk/explore/opium-war-1839-1842)\n\n""Although opium was valued as a medicine that could ease pain, assist sleep and reduce stress, by 1840 there were millions of addicts in the country.""\n\n[https://asiapacificcurriculum.ca/learning-module/opium-wars-china](https://asiapacificcurriculum.ca/learning-module/opium-wars-china)\n\n""By the early 19th century, more and more Chinese were smoking British opium as a recreational drug. But for many, what started as recreation soon became a punishing addiction: many people who stopped ingesting opium suffered chills, nausea, and cramps, and sometimes died from withdrawal. Once addicted, people would often do almost anything to continue to get access to the drug. The Chinese government recognized that opium was becoming a serious social problem and, in the year 1800, it banned both the production and the importation of opium. ""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBanning the Opium trade was what was any minimally responsible government would done in China. The levels of addiction had already began to affect court officals and vast portion of the military. To freely allow the further spread of opium could have eventually bring end sovreign rule of the country.\n\nAs a thought experiment, imagine having half the parliament of singapore becoming addicted to a drug of which the supply is controlled by a foreign nation.\n\nThen effectively, Singapore would be easily controlled by that other country.\n\n\\> As for COVID, how about this? The US government failed at getting its lockdown to work. So why should we continue to listen to their 1960s advice to wage a war on drugs?\n\nMy point is if the US is not able to control or influence its own people to do the sensible thing, then it is hardly of no surprise that is not winning its own war on drugs.\n\nYou can see another example of this based on what is happening in the US capital right now. If the US government can\'t even defend it own seat of power from rioters, then how can it defend itself from criminals?\n\nSo based this, perhaps you are right, the US government should seriously considering legalization drugs because it lacks the ability to effectively enforce its drug policies.\n\nSingapore, however, isn\'t like the US.

Which I heard is allowed under very strict regulation.', 'Even if it is just a mere recreational drug similar to nicotine, it doesn\'t address the question of why it should be legalised. The way I see it, there is no compelling reason to legalise cannabis and have it join the ranks of cigarettes and alcohol as a widely-available recreational substance. Why add yet another negative externality generating ""recreational drug"" into the fray? \n\nThere is no compelling reason because, firstly, legalising it brings no benefit to society. The medicinal cannabis argument is moot given that the compound in cannabis which is of medicinal value can be isolated, synthesised and sold as an individual compoud. That being the case, there is no need to legalise cannabis *as a whole*. There is also zero utilitarian benefit in having more pot smokers in society. \n\nSecondly, cannabis is not (I would think) as entrenched in society as cigarettes and alcohol are. If that is so, then the argument that legalisation would cut out the drug pushers and allow for better overall control of the substance would be moot too since legalisation in such a scenario would only encourage greater use of cannabis. Given that at present, it is only a minuscule fraction of society which uses cannabis, it is actually enforcement rather than legalisation which provides for better overall control of the substance. Put simply, the substance is *already under control*. There is thus no need for legalisation to ""regain control"" or whatever argument to similar effect. \n\nThere seems to be no practical need for cannabis at present. Legalisation also seems indefensible on utilitarian grounds. So why then are (what seems to be) sizeable chunks of people clamouring for legalisation of cannabis? The answer is probably that they just want to be able satisfy their wilful desire to smoke pot.

I was working in the US around a time where my state was busy doing a keblakang pusing on the war on drugs. They had dropped the penalties for possessing cannabis down to the rough equivalent of a jaywalking or noise complaint ticket.  One of the really interesting things about this was that the cannabis dealer began to scrub up and became far less open about selling all the other drugs. Afterall, if Cannabis makes up 80% of your revenue, why would you visit a customer with other types of drugs in your car when the the penalties increase severely if you are caught with the other drugs? It is a lot of risk for very little  reward. Why not double down and try to maximise your revenue from this by selling better and more upmarket goods?\n\nI observed that the cannabis quality increased significantly. You wound up far less leaf and twigs mixed into what you would buy.  My guy started selling cannabis in logo branded vacuum sealed bags filled with N2 so as to preserve freshness and colour.

I can\'t think of a single country that has decided, after decriminalization, that this was a mistake and that they needed to ban it and bring back life imprisonment or hanging or whatever punitive nonsense they had before. This is a vast natural experiment and they are arguing that we should trust them over the experiences of these countries.  Which is ridiculous.\n\nTo be honest, this is what they do for almost every sort of anti-authoritarian reform, from free speech a free press to legalizing homosexuality. This is so much so that their arguments for just about everything like this can be summarised like so:\n\n""You should trust limpeh, because no one else\'s experiences or science in the world have anything to teach us. Every other society is a dangerous failed state, where their citizenry live in terror, starvation and poverty without limpeh!

A lot of these changes were done with very little consultation and were done in the absence of the amount of research and societal experimentation done by others. Yet the government pushed through with a \'hold my beer, what could go wrong?\' attitude. Being autocratic and ramming through change is endemic to their style.

A lot of our problems stem from the fact that inspite of all of our fundamental advantages ( The massive port, well educated populace etc) , we are falling behind on the adoption of new technology and our efforts to climb the value chain have stalled leading to a dual track economy which overwhelming benefits people who earn a living by rent seeking and artificial creation of scarcity over people who actually produce value in the economy. Who do you think this governing hierarchy, whose science rejecting perspective you want us to defer to, represents and is made of?  \n\nWe need to get rid of that conservative delusion that policies and practices are free of costs because they have been around a long time. There is a direct way that legalising cannabis can help our stagnating economy. Shan is right that there is a shit load of money to be made from this. Legal Cannabis in the US and Europe is a multi tens of billion dollar revenue industry employing over hundreds of thousands of people. It would really help our bio-tech and urban farming industry to be able to grow and sell such a value dense and under researched crop. Given the artificial problems created by the war on drugs, being one of the early legalisers could give our economy a sizable first mover advantage on what is almost certain to be the next hundred billion dollar market. \n\nThe intangible way it would help would be what it would signal about Singapore. As you have essentially described, our government\'s is currently signalling to the world that our social stability has sensitive areas where we can easily collapse. If you a were a foreign investor looking to really invest in Singapore ( by building high tech production or R&D here), as opposed to simply looking for a tax haven, would you invest in a country whose government thinks that if they were to legalise cannabis/a free press/gay sex the society would implode? If that government is right, would you invest? If that government was wrong, would you invest in a country run by those idiots? \n\nHere is the thing the idea that we can stick head in the ground and keeping doing what we are doing is not going to work. The world is changing around us. The countries around us are slowly going to become more tolerant of this. Malaysia already has a significant decriminalisation movement going. Thailand has already legalised. This is going to make enforcement for Singapore difficult both logistically and because makes the conservative fearmongering about cannabis driven societal collapse look untenable to the point of undermining societal consent. These countries are going to grab all the early mover advantages. This is going to be worse than 377a where we are already the only country in Asia that isn\'t an Islamic state that still bans gay sex. I think change in Cannabis policy will become surprisingly rapid. There are significant soft power disadvantages to keeping both stances, but I think perpetuating the war on Cannabis is going to eventually be worse. You think LHL LIKES to come out to reassure foreign investors that 377a will never be enforced and that the talented gay people we need them to bring here in order to pump our economy will not be persecuted? You think he ownself felt the need to come out to give this talk because he cares about gay people\'s feelings? You think none of our foreign tech investors fed their concerns about this privately? You think this hasn\'t already cost us Singaporean jobs? 377a is slowly turning into a shitshow for us.

But I think if we dig deeper into this argument we can unpack and discover its flaws. \n\nThe first point is that cigs and alcohols are, unlike cannabis, so deeply entrenched into society that to suddenly outlaw them would generate a great shock. Sure, it can be done, but it would probably require a gargantuan effort from both society and the government. \n\nThe number of people who chronically drink and smoke isn\'t insubstantial, and if an insubstantial number of people might be up in arms because their ""life support"" is suddenly removed...well we might see some societal chaos. I think an outright sudden ban is simply not feasible given how entrenched in society cigs and alcohol are.\n\nThe second point is that if we recognise cigs and alcohol as vices that should at worst be banned like cannabis and at best heavily regulated (since an outright ban is not feasible), and if we accept that cannabis is also a similar vice, why in the world would we want to introduce yet another vice into society? We already have two vices which we are striving (maybe even struggling) to stamp out or at least control, why introduce a third vice? \n\nThink about it. If cannabis were legalised just because some kids want to smoke pot, now we\'re not just going to have to deal with nicotine and alcohol abusers, we\'re going to have to deal with cannabis abusers too! Of course, not every kid who wants to smoke pot will become a pot abuser. In the same way, not every chap who smokes and drinks becomes a nicotine or alcohol abuser, but every abuser begins as a chap who wants to smoke and drink (or smoke pot).', 'Just so you understand, I personally am not against same sex marriage. People should be allowed to live the way they want provide they do not harm others. I can agree with that.\n\nAs cannabis, you have already admitted it is a vice. A vice.

Its harmless, (technically not harmless but less harm than alcohol) but its justifiable to force someone into minimum 6 month rehab or max punishment death.\n\nThe question it is a valid reason but is it a good reason? Is it reason enough to legalize it and especially when it can lead to legalization of other stronger drugs over time. Once this thing has been legalized, there\'s likely going to be other people like you, who will be asking and arguing that heroin, cocaine are just for ""recreational use"", ""it is fine and harmless"" etc etc. Do we really want to go down this slope?

Ever since i entered secondary school, i realised i hated everything around me. I hated living, classmates, and sometimes even hated friends for no reason. Multiple times i have given up completely on myself, and these thoughts loom around my mind constantly. I met this guy from an online community, and for the first time in years i felt happy to be around him. He constantly encouraged me that i am worth something, and during my darkest times he was the one that helped me pull through. I never seen him in real life before, but I knew he was 22, and to me he is the only reason i continue living until today.  


\- Main

Months before O levels, he had always encouraged me to start working hard. However, due to my incompetence, i just disregarded his advice and continued sinking in my gaming addiction. This led to me screwing up my o lvls. On the day of results collection, the moment i saw my l1r5 i knew i was fucked. The whole cycle of me feeling i'm incapable of everything just came back to me. Up till now i still constantly blame myself for being this stupid and incompetent.  

That night, I shared with him my results. However, he told me it wasn't bad, and was encouraging me that I will do better next time. That night, he left me a text message saying, ""Good luck, i will see you in a few months."" and blocked me on all platforms i had previously communicated with him on. I knew he was going to university, but i have no idea why he completely blocked me off on all platforms. If you were to backtrace, that is about 1.5 months ago.After getting my JAE posting results i have become even more disappointed in myself as i did not make it to the JC i put as my first choice, and instead made it to a poly despite hitting the cop. This further killed me internally, as i feel i have no face to meet my relatives or anyone in general. Seeing where all my relatives kids go, ""RI, HCI, VJC"" just further fucks me over and I just feel i'm literally not worth this earth.

\- After

Recently, i have been getting fucked up mood swings and random noises of me talking to him.  Just yesterday, i fought with random people online after them saying a supposed joke, and broke a year long friendship. I feel like at this point i am just creating more trouble for everyone and I just don't know how to fix anything. My sleep schedule has been completely fucked up with me waking up at either 5am or 5pm. I have no mood to do anything anymore, I don't feel like gaming, studying, coding or doing anything.  It's like the guy who previously helped to maintain the balance in my mood just disappeared, and I'm left hopeless. I don't know if i will ever see the guy again, and deep down I know I won't anymore.  


I don't know how to proceed on with life anymore, at this point i just feel like i want to escape everything in existence. I don't feel like killing myself  seeking professional help as I have bad experiences with anything that is related to ""professional mental help"". I just don't know what i'm supposed to do anymore.

While cotinine remains in the body for a day, if you are a heavy smoker you\'ll feel the effect of nicotine withdrawal within 1 hour.\n\nThat doesn\'t mean we just drop dead after the first stick. Only after regular use will you start noticing the withdrawal after prolonged absence. I\'d say 2 days we start to feel the effect but we still can maintain, albeit with shakiness and lower mental focus, for another 2 months before starting to mentally recover from the effects. It\'s this 2 months that will really test us, because the willpower to want to continue smoking is stronger than not wanting to smoke.

Rather than having to deal with the public support towards criminal syndicates of imported tobacco, you would be better off having a legal but highly regulated tobacco economy.\n\nAlcohol prohibition showed that if you suddenly strangle a sizable portion of the population from their vices, then they\'ll seek alternatives. When alternatives come in the form of unregulated black markets, those running it will gain both power and support. Also worse still is, if minors can get access to smoking when it\'s this regulated, imagine unregulated smoking - even harder to detect and undermine. Also this is where crime syndicates will target: making youths interested or inclined to try smoking. Now it\'s hard because legal cigs are restricted  in adverts and design and flavours that may attract curious youths. Without regulated cigarettes, the demand of illegal cigarettes without regulations will arise, and the amount of these ""tainted"" cigs become more commonplace. So you will end up with a problem down the road.\n\n\nIt\'s similar to drugs, just because it\'s illegal doesn\'t mean that druggies don\'t exist. The only factor that differentiates drugs from cigs is that surrounding countries also prohibit drugs but not cigs. So it\'s harder to smuggle in, but if cigarettes are available across borders then so will the availability of smuggled cigs, which only purpose as of now is to sell to underage and/or those who need cheaper untaxed cigarettes at the risk of being caught - that\'s why smuggling cigs is not so prominent since it\'s not so lucrative when people rather buy taxed cigs at shops instead of pay for your sketchy smuggled duty free ones unless they are sold at a loss. Ban smoking and you\'ll have a lot more wanting then, which will be easily met with illegal imports, at exuberant prices.', '[deleted]', 'Hmmm.\n\nI\'ll break it into 2 parts - how to deter youths from smoking the first stick, and how to get smokers to stop, from smoker\'s pov:\n\n-----\n(1) **stopping the first stick:** *education targets those that are more body-conscious and think ahead, while taxes target those who are more concerned over day-to-day living, rather than the future*\n\n Coming from a JC environment, when I started smoking, my NS pals (incl smokers) all mention the same detterant, ""smoking is expensive, don\'t do it"" (ie the taxes doing their job); my jc pals tho (excl smokers) all say ""hey its bad for your health Wtf man"". JC pals who smoke revert back to the ""expensive"" argument.\n\nSo in terms of dettering youths, both education and health does the trick. I notice that the JC ppl are more health conscious, and all have done bio classes in secondary school and have gone through the effects of smoking (ie the emphysema and nicotine addiction).\n\nBias tho: jc kids that I know tend to be very guai and/or rich so to them money isn\'t the issue but the health aspect is a bigger problem. So nurturing strong moral stigma against smoking is a good way. You see that the same bunch tend to be ok with alcohol, tho they may not be addicts (or may be addicts too) because we don\'t get lectured on how harmful it is. So you can see a difference in reception towards the 2 different vices even tho both are harmful to your body, mind and relationships. Smoking is also not ""cool"" compared to drinking. Smoking makes you stink and old.\n\nAmong poly kids and ite kids, firstly there\'s more exposure to smoking because there\'s a huge group of people from many walks of life, both good and bad. This is similar to NS. (for me, even though I picked up the habit from my father, definitely NS played a role in making it feel less taboo). Moreover, since institutes and poly are more individualised and self-catered than JC and secondary, there\'s less ""spoon feeding"" opportunities and hence lesser chances to educate on these kinds of moral educations lest everyone is forced to complete some mandatory course.\n\nThen comes the money. Poly n institutes (ite + MI + private schs) have everyone from the rich to the poor. But jc tend to be filled with slightly more richer ppl. The atas nature, and lack of knowing the pinch of wasting money away despite not being financially stable, tends to make these ppl focus on the health issues instead. Institutes and poly, where the fees are higher, bursaries are harder to get, ezlink no longer student price, etc means that as an functioning adult of society they have to factor in the daily costs, without having the luxury to just focus on education alone. So ye, definitely money does play a bigger role here over health. These folks are more concerned about what happenes to their money. Health is something they can mind afterwards in the future.\n\n-----\n(2) **pushing smokers to quit:** *education won\'t do much here since smokers are aware their bodies are not benefiting from the cough-inducing smoke, though some may not realise the long term effects. So taxes do help reduce how much they smoke, even making some choose to quit because they can\'t afford it. Also I would like to introduce another factor: inconvenience of smoking. As a smoker, this keeps me from smoking more than 5-8 sticks a day*\n\nYe. We know we gonna die smoking. But the addiction makes it seem not worth giving up smoking, only to die without enjoying a puff. But those gory pictures and big yellow box text do form as passive education. Even if young you stated smoking cos it was cool or because it helped Calm your nerves, maybe when you\'re older, the labels and warnings and depressing solid colour box and the pictures of dead babies and cut-up cadavers might make you think, ""hmm maybe it\'s not worth to continue"". I think a very important thing to educate is that **it doesn\'t matter if you\'ve smoked for 2 or 20 years - if you quit now, you can still reverse damages and live longer than if you continue forever**. Now that\'s an important education for current smokers. Another one is quit line and NAMS support for quitting because its not easy.\n\nNext is money. Self explanatory - too expansive to continue smoking. This largely helps to reduce the smoking frequency, so that, if the smoker starts contemplating quitting smoking, it will not be as big/daunting of a thought, compared to a heavy smoker who will never in his life imagine dropping from 40 sticks to 0. Combined with only being able to buy a box of 20 and not just a stick or 5 when you want to, means that either you run on that one box for as long as you can while it doesn\'t Lao-Hong, or just forget about smoking.\n\nLast is inconveniences. Last time one could smoke out in the coffee shops, under shelters, etc. Further back, one could smoke in pubs and indoors, in malls too. Even further back, you could smoke on open air buses. But now, everything is no no. In mall? No. Under block? No. Under shelter? No. Also there\'s a lot more pedestrian shelters popping up, so that\'s lost real estate. Near schools? No. Near hospitals? No. Busstop? No. Near busstop? No. Orchard? No. Suntec? No. Everyone must stand in the yellow box and smoke. There\'s even talks on banning smoking near windows in HDB flats because the smoke enteres the neighbours houses. (which I can confirm, is pretty shitty. Also ppl don\'t know this but even as smokers, the smoke we breathe in is nicer and strong, but the smoke we release, together with the smoke from the burning tobacco paper in front, is very shitty, stings the eyes, and is smelly. So 2nd hand smoke is essentially 1st hand smoke without the nice parts, only the bad parts)\n\nFor me, at home I smoke in the toilet, which can get sweaty. But outside, unless I\'m by the road, it\'s very **inconvenient** to smoke. I have to walk outside shelters, which is not nice under hot sun. Rainy times people close one eye but still need to smoke by the edge of the shelter so that the smoke leaves the shelter. If I\'m in a mall or building, I have to walk out, then continue walking to the road, then smoke, then come back and sgsafeentry myself in, to which I would rather hold on and smoke later instead. Seriously if it was 1990, I think I\'d easily smoke a pack everywhere, as though it was normal habit like drinking water when thirsty. Combine this with the same concept of taxes reducing frequency of smoking, and you get a greater chance of getting a smoker to quit.\n\n----\n\nSummery:\n\nPretty long comment, but it\'s 5am and I\'m not sleepy.\n\nThe concept of reducing smoking is not ""you can\'t smoke"" but ""you don\'t wanna smoke"". The more you prohibit something, the more it provokes citizens to rebel. Instead, you\'d want to convince citizens and give them the free will to choose, giving them the power while getting them to proactively stop the bad habit. It\'s why hitler was so successful in gaining support and followers in his campaign against Jews, not because he forced everyone to hate Jews, but because he got convinced everyone that Jews had caused the downfall of the nation and weimer Republic in WW1. Speaking of hitler, he was the first government to enforce national policies on tobacco restrictions. \n\nThis includes convincing how harmful, short and long term, smoking is to health, mind and beauty. To smokers, it\'s convincing why quit, including reducing smoking frequency to make quitting less undesirable. \n\nThe govt is definitely concerned with reducing the national demand of a product with a large external cost (= smoking doesn\'t kill just the smoker but also that once-useful contributing member of your workforce). They know that regardless of how much a smoker values a pack over their life, they are also costing unnecessary burden to healthcare capacities and contribution to national income, since an unhealthy smoker is less competent to work and is less efficient when they\'re coughing blood, and the government will have to end up caring for their family. So govt definitely plans this, whether they care for your wellbeing or not. \n\n Here\'re the factors that the govt can /does consider, that I think does impact me as a smoker:\n\n1) deterrent education: making youths appeal less to the ""cancerous smoke"" and the dangers of trying. Important because before you realise the addiction yourself, it\'s too late. (personally I think we are taught as though after the first puff, we become zombies diving through the dustbin ashtrays looking for smoke to eat lest we chop our pp and smoke it to satisfy the craving. The real danger is you\'d smoke one or two, realise it\'s awful but not that addictive, and then be more receptive to smoking, and before you know it, that social habit turns into regular habit)\n\n2) persuasive education: educating those already smoking on why they should quit. You can\'t educate smokers to not smoke because its too late, but you can educate on why it\'s a good idea to quit. This includes the warnings and potential risks that can be avoided if you quit, the toxins that you\'d no longer put in your body. Why does it matter and what\'s the use if you quit now, even if you\'ve been smoking for ages. What are the myriad of options to choose to make quitting a pleasant and smooth experience.\n\n3) deterrent pricing: the high tax means its so expansive to buy cigs, so you\'re less inclined to try one. Also harder to steng a stick to try when the stick\'s getting pricier\n\n4) inhibitory pricing: those already smoking are not able to buy more cigs, or less inclined to, so they smoke less. Some choose to give up smoking, some will start to ponder on the feasibility of quitting.\n\n5) policies of inconvenience: smoking is legal but more troublesome. Although the purposes are different, the side effect is removing some of the appeals of smoking. Again reduces frequency. Also makes quitting more appealing\n\n-----\n\nSo ye. More education more tax more prohibitions. But how, what types and how much - these are important.\n\n\nCheers. üö¨ üö≠', 'Not a smoking ban for all. A smoking ban for people born 2000 and after.

ADULTERANT\n\n> Dr Munidasa Winslow, senior consultant psychiatrist at Promises Healthcare, said drug dealers sometimes cut heroin with fentanyl to add potency.\n\n> \n\n> Like all opioids, fentanyl is addictive as it gives a ""euphoric rush"", he said, although he warned that it is ""a lot easier to overdose and have respiratory depression and die"".\n\n> \n\n> Dr Gomathinayagam Kandasami, senior consultant at the National Addictions Management Service, said fentanyl abusers commonly inject the drug, but in the process can frequently overdose and die due to its high potency.\n\n> \n\n> ""High incidents of reported deaths related to fentanyl abuse in the US have been linked to illegally made fentanyl which can be adulterated with other illegal drugs,"" he said.\n\n> \n\n> THE SPREAD OF ILLEGAL FENTANTYL\n\n> While there have been no reports of widespread abuse of fentanyl in the region, Reuters reported that Myanmar had seized a huge haul of liquid fentanyl last May.\n\n> This was the first time the drug had been found in Asia\'s Golden Triangle drug-producing region, the report stated.\n\n> With the fentanyl seized in Singapore arriving from Vietnam, CNB was asked about the flow of illicit drugs from the region.\n\n> ""The worrying regional drug situation, coupled with Singapore‚Äôs close geographical proximity to increased trafficking activities in the region, has adverse downstream implications for our local drug situation,"" the spokesperson stated.\n\n> \n\n> ""CNB will continue to partner our foreign law enforcement counterparts to conduct joint operations targeted at drug trafficking and manufacturing activities overseas, and work closely with the other Home Team departments on border control measures to detect and prevent the flow of drugs into Singapore.""\n\n> \n\n> MEDICAL USES\n\n> Nevertheless, Dr Winslow highlighted that fentanyl has medical uses, noting that it could be used by pain specialists as patches for breakthrough chronic pain.\n\n> \n\n> Dr Ong Say Yang, pain service lead at Alexandra Hospital, said doctors may add opioids to existing painkillers for severe pain that is ""difficult to control"", like cancer pain.\n\n> Pouches of the dangerous synthetic opioid fentanyl at a US Drug Enforcement Administration laboratory AFP/Don EMMERT\n\n> While morphine is more commonly used to treat severe pain, Dr Ong said fentanyl, in the form of a slow-releasing skin patch, can be prescribed if the patient\'s pain does not respond well to more commonly used opioids.\n\n> \n\n> ""Fentanyl can also be given in an injectable form by trained medical professionals for pain relief and sedation during procedures such as colonoscopy, or together with other sedatives to induce general anaesthesia for surgery,"" he said.\n\n> \n\n> POTENTIAL ABUSE\n\n> In 2018, Australian news channel 60 Minutes published a segment on the dangers of fentanyl in the country, highlighting that addicts looking for their fix simply had to get a prescription for fentanyl patches from their general practitioner.\n\n> In Singapore, Dr Winslow said pain specialists here ""are pretty aware (about fentanyl) and keep a tight reign on the prescribing patterns, with supervision"".\n\n> \n\n> The Pain Association of Singapore had in 2013 published guidelines on how to prescribe opioids, including monitoring patients regularly through urine and blood tests to ensure they are taking the right doses.\n\n> Doctors should also look out for tell-tale signs of addiction, including the forging of prescriptions and requests for higher dosages.\n\n> \n\n> Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid that US authorities blame for more than 100 deaths a day in the United States AFP/Don Emmert\n\n> Dr Ong said patients are carefully assessed on suitability before being started on opioids, and are given follow-up appointments at shorter intervals so that smaller quantities of opioids can be prescribed each time.\n\n> ""We look out for signs that could suggest drug misuse, such as obtaining addictive medication from multiple healthcare providers or frequently asking for early refills of such medication, and refer such patients to our colleagues in addiction medicine for further management,"" he said.\n\n> \n\n> The doctors said that fentanyl addiction is treated same way as any other substance use disorder.\n\n> \n\n> ""The person with fentanyl addiction would need to go through an inpatient detox programme to give up their dependence on the drug, followed by either community or residential-based long-term rehabilitation interventions to stay clean,"" Dr Kandasami said.\n\n> \n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

InsufficientStrategy,mkn4nf,[Rant] need advice.,2021-04-05 23:19:54,SGExams,77673,9,46,"I keep losing motivation to study.


At first I thought the first time I decided to spend an entire weekend procrastinating instead of studying when I had 3 tests, it was a fluke. But it wasn't.


Every time I have one productive weekend it's immediately offset by 2 weeks of unproductiveness. And other than studying my other habits are regressing as well. Heretofore I'd never slept later than 10pm if I didn't have homework I needed to finish, and now it's 11pm and I just spent the entire day other than school watching Youtube.


I wish I could just - idk, say that it's an addiction that I need to rid but. I literally do anything other than study. I don't know why. Even during O levels I had this problem but not to this extent. And I'm realising now, at 11pm and on the verge of breaking down, that I'm not motivated anymore.


There's more to it. I recently started questioning a ton of things, and I'm starting to realise I don't actually want to go into science like I thought I did even though I'm currently in a science stream. I think it's partly why I feel so unmotivated as of late. I'd say ""I regret bio and I wish I chose physics"" but right now? I feel devoid of anything. Not regret. Just nothing.


That's kind of my state for the past few weeks. Even when I'm engaging in my hobbies I feel so empty afterwards. After procrastinating by playing video games / watching youtube / reading I don't even feel like I'd enjoyed that so it was a waste of time anyway. I feel like I can't ever find joy in anything I do anymore even though I was the complete opposite before JC.

Maybe I'm exaggerating. I don't know. But A levels are coming and I'm wasting the weeks away.


I need advice. Secondary school me would have pressed on anyway because she enjoys learning and finds something to like about studying a subject she doesn't like. I can't do that anymore. I wish I could. I can't find the motivation to study or even keep up my other habits. How do I find joy in what I do again?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mkn4nf/rant_need_advice/,"['Hiho! I had that feeling back when I was in secondary school- I\'d be motivated one day and then I wouldn\'t be for the next few. I don\'t know if this is a normal thing but just know you aren\'t the only one going through this. Here are my methods that helped me on my journey through Os:\n\n1. Have a study buddy. You don\'t exactly have to study  with a friend physically, just have someone you can rely on to make sure you\'ve been studying. Update each other on what you\'ve learnt at the end of the day, with details and preferably without looking through your notes. Helps if you ever need something memorized! + if you ever need help you can ask your study buddy :D\n\n2. Making notes. I used to get teased for making ""aesthetic notes"" because it seemed like I was only making them to look pretty as opposed to learning anything, which isn\'t true at all! If anything, me wanting to make pretty notes gives me motivation to study as I\'d be looking at the textbook more often when making them + I\'d rather look at pretty notes than plain old text with aerial font lol\n\n3. Study With Me on YouTube. Because of the pandemic, we weren\'t allowed to go back to school to study and we were advised not to go out with friends either as this creates a risk for us. Also I just didn\'t have a lot of friends to study with in the first place lol so what I did was find study vlogs on youtube (you can search ""study with me"") and there would be so many to choose from. My go-to channel would be [gutsy studygirl](https://youtube.com/c/GutsyStudyGirl) as she has plenty of videos to choose from + she takes hourly breaks in her videos too\n\n4. Most importantly: TAKE BREAKS!!! I\'m sure you\'ve heard of study burnout. I never knew what that was like until I experienced it on my own and, oh boy, does it take a lot out of you. Whatever motivation I had would simply go down the drain, and it didn\'t help when my tuition teacher told me I had no hope for Os. So please remember that every once in a while you need to step away from your work space to get some fresh air, as relaxing is very very important.\n\nI hope this helps! Of course, not everyone is the same, so what has worked for me may not work for you, so try a bunch of other methods that other people may suggest! Also, idk if you needed to hear this, but even just 10 minutes of studying is progress. Teachers always give students sh*t for studying only the day before a test, and while I agree that is a pretty bad habit to have, it is better than not studying at all. All the best in your studies!\n\nEdit: edited the link lol\nEdit 2: omg I\'ve never had an award before so thank you ü•∫', ""Here's the truth, most academically inclined students do not find joy in study - they merely do it cause they acknowledge that it is the most guaranteed method to secure their future. This is applicable to many areas of life, you don't like to exercise, but you still do cause you want to remain fit and not die early etc.\n\nSame thing here.  My advice is man up, think of your future, and study like hell if where you want to be requires you to have good grades. If not, then just chill. Just make sure you can live with your decision"", ""Hi!  I had the same sht back in college, finals week.  O the Bloody Hell.  No sleep.  Had the flu.  Four finals, five papers.  I broke down and cried- way past midnight, in the lab, alone.  There was no way out.  Just had to grind through it.   Motivation?  Not Joy, but Fear.  Fear of failure.  \n\nAnother way that could've helped a lot was a study partner.  If you find one that could help."", ""Not in jc but currently in ITE\n\nIts good that you are realising it. Better now than later and regret!\n\nI get you like though i don't have much usual sch subject but I usually have multiple project/reports going on at the same time. I do lose motivation and not want to do work.\n\nLike i totally disregarded my first sem and end up gpa 2.6 (not even the min for poly admission)\n\nSo what i did for change was:\n\n1. I listed all of what i need to achieve \n\n(Eg, i open a sticker in my macbook and wrote down all the pointers i need cover for each report. I also pre plan review dates for teachers to check our report.)  \n\nFor you, could be writing down what homework you need do for the day and also pre plan - what day to revise what subject and topic.\n\n2. Tbh just watch your shows while studying\n\nI also watch my show while doing work and revise with music. Maybe you can revise with your fav gaming music to hype you up?\n\n3. It fine to not be productivity\n\nI too was burnout badly after 2-3 project back to back and totally didn't really revise for my test, so i just speed read to revise and just remember what i can. \n\nCause sometimes, we just can't control what happens to us.

I know some of you will reprimand me for not using it wisely, but idk if its an internal conflict but the more i hope to do my work the more i will give excuses to not do it.

anyway can anyone tell me how to curb phone addiction in general (like 17 hrs a day that kind) and achieve better sleep schedule, should i go for an addiction therapy or something? im feeling abit lost lol feels like im take drug  :( 

oh yeah i feel abit self conscious retaining too (like i feel abit uncomfortable with the special treatement for retainee) and considering the opportunity cost (if i were to earn 2000 a month in the future thats 24k at least ) its alot but then i could also retire one yr later so...idk

can anyone give advice to this lost soul (thank u so much)

You can try adding bits of time hand writing notes(not reading cuz you'll prolly just forget when you go back to game) and condition yourself to only go back to gaming once you've done atleast part of the notes for a given chapter i.e Functions: part1) inverse functions part2) composite functions part3) piecewise functions. This worked pretty well for me, though I was still gaming like 6months before As I had converted about half my gaming time to writing notes/doing papers, Ik I prolly gonna sound like a huge nerd but completing papers was kinda satisfying(even if I didn't do well). The point is to start somewhere, once you build up some momentum it'll become  more natural, just like how you find gaming to be second nature hopefully you'll be able to convert some time into studies.

But perhaps you\'re treating it as a surface level as just ""I like to play games"". I think, generally speaking, nobody simply just likes to play games for so many hours on end everyday even when they\'re probably not enjoying it (unless to pass time). \n\nI recommend you try and understand what you\'re escaping from first hand. Perhaps its anxiety, stress from school, or anything that might be uncomfortable and you using digital tools as an escape. Addiction therapy is also a good direction, they\'re trained to help you understand yourself better on what makes you compulsively seek these outlets.

(assuming u take 11 hrs for sleep and eat etc)\nso i would game or chill wit friends then\n\nduring sch time i would study in sch aft class wit mt friends until nighttime then we get dinner and complain abt our lives (first world problem)\n\ni kept this up until prelims, by then i was quite sien and i was pretty much done with everything other than econ so aft that i jus mug only econ. during a levels itself i didnt study too much becos i think its better to jus chill aft exam.\n\nat the end i got 90 + h3 dist so im quite grateful to myself for not starting too late and being very focused when studying\n\na part of me wonders if i dropped out of school and grinded fortnite would i be the world cup champion instead of bugha\n\nbut we make choices and we will never know the other path, so i jus carry on with life\n\nbut back to you, i think you should form a vision of where you want to be in 5-10 years. ultimately it makes no sense to put effort into anything unless there is an outcome you envisioned for yourself ( in my case it was that i wanted to be a physicist and thats not happening unless i get a scholarship because no money )\ni think you would feel much more compelled to work when you have something at stake\n\nalso you need to find a place where you define as your work space, and one where you define as your rest space. compartmentalise these different spaces so that your mind doesnt mix them up. for me i absolutely could not study at home because of the computer whispering sweet nothings into my ear. so i went to library or mcdonalds to mug. when i went home i gamed my heart out. \n\nset clear goals of what u want to accomplish in a day/week/month. set deadlines for yourself. it doesnt need to be on paper, i just had a mental timeline of when i needed to be at what stage of my revision.\n\ni took my a levels in 2018, and ive been an nsf tutoring a level students for the past 2 years. ive tutored the brightest gep rj kids to average kids and ive concluded that the A Levels is a very structured syllabus and its unlikely youll get below 75rp unless you are not putting in a solid effort consistently. the skill cap of a levels is honestly not that high and if you have done your due diligence you should get a minimum of a B.\n\nif you have any qns u can dm me', 'You sound like me when I was in Jc 2-3 years ago, I couldn‚Äôt have survived on such little sleep like you, I slept more but I was a chronic procrastinator too, and in an unhealthy, crippling and self-sabotaging way. But I‚Äôm really feeling :/// reading your posts and I‚Äôm very scared for you , i don‚Äôt want u to end up fucking up the big thing like me. \n\nI first started procrastinating at the start of j1 because I was a perfectionist ( unironically enough) and I was a ‚Äúall or nothing‚Äù type of person, so i didn‚Äôt try at my homework at all because I was afraid and resistant to the feeling of failure and having to face inevitable obstacles along the way. So to avoid that feeling, I didn‚Äôt try at my homework at all throughout the year+. I procrastinated by playing games as a way of escapism from my anxiety from not doing my homework and knowingly fucking up my academic journey, which just builds up as the years went by in Jc for me. My procrastination was beyond the point of the average student claiming ‚Äúoh I procrastinate coz I watch kdrama‚Äù, it was a whole other level, kinda like Hamlet in Shakespeare‚Äôs text ( my h2 lit text). When I was playing games, I knew I should stop and start studying but I just couldn‚Äôt help myself.  My procrastination stemmed more from issues dealing with FEELINGS and personal emotional landscape mismanagement , rather than with time. At that time I didn‚Äôt have the maturity to face up to this real reason of my procrastination and just kept escaping through games. It was my coping mechanism to deal with the snowballing work, anxiety and stress. At that time I already knew what I was doing was toxic, but I just couldn‚Äôt help it. I was living in a self imposed prison, in which the ceiling just kept getting lower, the walls kept getting narrower and when I tried to get out, life would try to kill me. \n\nEveryone just thought I was stupid, lazy, too stoned in classes( I daydream in class a lot and never do homework), but I‚Äôve always felt very misunderstood by others. I knew I could have done  well if only I had applied myself and worked consistently like a normal student. And ya, it is very annoying to know that others are judging you ( inaccurately especially), back then I‚Äôd be Super annoyed when people were treating me as if as I have a 2 digit IQ. \n\nSo you need to ask yourself, what‚Äôs the real reason why you‚Äôre procrastinating? And yes, i personally think you should consider therapy. I was too egoistic and childish back then and stubbornly refused to go in the past, in hindsight, I really wish I had gone for it. \n\nBecause your rather severe procrastination could be a symptom of a much larger and deeply rooted problem.  And if you don‚Äôt properly address this and tackle it, repeating also won‚Äôt help much, even if you do pass and scrape through with bare minimum grades throughout , you wouldn‚Äôt be able to achieve your fullest potential. \n\nLast minute chiong/‰∏¥Êó∂Êä±‰ΩõËÑö worked for me for O levels but in A levels didnt( start rushing only less than a month before final exam) even if you get past A levels scraping through , mediocre A level grades will give you a very very very very very hard time applying for unis and not worth the heightened mental torture before As. And if you fail As( not to scare you it is a very big possibility if u don‚Äôt change, and you have to face up to this), I can tell you when u stare at your results slip in the school hall and see that you‚Äôve failed, it will be the worst feeling ever. Your heart will sink and a painful wave of emptiness will engulf your mind, and you will wish so damn hard that you had studied harder and wonder what could have been if only you had retained in j1. You will feel even worse when u see your heartbroken parents and in contrast ... many other people rejoicing because they‚Äôve gotten near 90 rank points. \n\nI‚Äôm not saying there is no path to walk after one fails A levels, you will eventually figure sth out, but on that day when u take back yr results, your internal world will come crashing down and your heart will feel like there‚Äôs a corpse rotting in it, so don‚Äôt put yourself through that.\n\nSo it is definitely better to give yourself another chance to start afresh and repeat J1 provided you address your procrastination issues and improve on it, instead of fucking up A levels if you move on to j2 ( high chances of this happening). Ofc theoretically, it is possible to Chiong and pull your grades up if you address the problems now and continue with j2, but it‚Äôll be a mad rush and u may not achieve your fullest potential, because it‚Äôll take a lot of self-discipline and realistically it is hard to change your gaming addiction thing within such a short time. So for now, repeating as a j1 is the seemingly harder but better choice in the long run tbh. Repeating as a j1 also gives you time to slowly adjust your gaming hours . \n\nOne extra year in the grand scheme of life doesn‚Äôt matter at all, so don‚Äôt worry about that.

The reason I believe this is because I had zero issues coping during BMT and had no withdrawal issues whatsoever since every day was packed with activities. After some reflection, I realised that I gamed every day primarily because I felt bored and couldn't be arsed to do my homework. I felt like I could understand concepts in lectures and tutorials but couldn't remember them or reapply them accurately for exams (and therefore scoring rather poorly while having a misguided belief that I should do well with a bit more effort).\n\nI started searching for a solution to this problem after feeling a mixture of panic (somewhat like your current feelings) and a sense of urgency as the As drew closer (sometime in May). My solution was rather simple --- set targets for yourself (which concepts to cover) and set a deadline for that, and to also minimise the temptation to game.\n\nThe first part of the solution is rather self explanatory. You can choose to start revising lecture notes and redoing tutorial questions, and then start to spam the TYS during the June holidays. The second part was to revise in school or in a public library. Even though I brought my laptop along, I found myself to be much more productive in an environment that was dedicated to and more conducive for studying. (I strongly advise against using your phone to aid you in your revision because the temptation to just pull out your phone and game in a library is much greater than switching on your laptop and playing DOTA or something in the same setting. If possible do not use your phone when revising if you mostly play mobile games. My solution may work for PC gamers but I'm not sure for phone gamers.)\n\nI continued to game to relieve some stress even during the exam period but only after I was sure I understood the concepts tested and finished my scheduled revision. Overall I didn't feel as if I cut down on gaming that much but there was an actual reduction once I started counting the hours. I don't really recommend doing this unless you are very confident in your understanding and are starting to do well for your mock papers. There is always a chance you might relapse or even give up on revising completely.\n\nOverall I think its good that you are starting to think about your situation and start planning. It is far from too late to start revising now if you plan your schedule properly and adhere to it. I was still able to get a decent result (though I was personally slightly disappointed and felt I could have done better if I started revision earlier). Do some deep reflection (BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF & DO NOT BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC) and try to find the root cause of your studying woes. Wishing you all the best for your A levels and may you get your desired results.\n\nIf you have any more questions do feel free to DM me."", '[deleted]', 'You should probably seek a teacher‚Äôs opinion on whether you should retain. Btw, getting a B for GP at promos is a pretty impressive.\n\nAs for your gaming addiction, I wouldn‚Äôt say you should stop entirely. Having some fun in moderation is no harm. You may try practicing delayed gratification. If you are using an iPhone, let a parent/sibling set screen time password on your device. You can also look for blocksite applications to lock certain apps and websites. Set aside time to study in a quiet room with minimum distractions. While doing that, leave all your devices outside; heck lock them up in a safe if you need to. After finishing up your tasks, feel free to indulge yourself a little.

I also struggle with procrastination everyday and when Os were nearing I felt guilty as hell everyday and never felt accomplished. Tobe honest I don't really know how I got over it.. it might be the last month before exams that I actually saw the urgency to actually start studying and worrying about my future. During the time before I was slowly limiting myself to an hour 30mins of game instead of 4hours. (Not including my social media app time) this gradually forced me (not successfullly everyday) to stop the games and do some studying. Another thing that really helped is the wifi restriction that my parents put on me. And having little data per month I had to go around that restriction and plan my time wisely everyday. \n\nHowever all this is my personal experience and I don't know if u can even do what I did.

The sentences are to run concurrently.\n\n> At his trial, Ler claimed he provided massage services, not ‚Äúslamming‚Äù, and the methamphetaminestained syringe found on him was from Farrera-Brochez‚Äôs study room.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutors Nicholas Wuan and Desmond Chong showed that he had lied, basing their case on Sim‚Äôs evidence and explanation of the various messages through the Line messaging app involving him and Ler, among other things.\n\n> The judge, in dismissing Ler‚Äôs ‚Äúsham defence‚Äù, described his explanations as illogical and unbelievable. He added: ‚ÄúLer was a man clutching at straws.‚Äù\n\n> The judge also found that on March 2, 2018, after being hired by Sim, Ler had a syringe to inject methamphetamine.\n\n> ‚ÄúThis was a paid service. As a medical doctor, he would have known that these acts would cause harm to those that he provided the service to by continuing to feed their addiction.\n\n> ‚ÄúThese were, in my mind, aggravating factors,‚Äù said the judge, adding that Ler was unrepentant.\n\n> He also noted Ler made use of his medical skills and expertise to fuel Sim‚Äôs drug abuse, committing the offences for greed and while he was out on bail for other offences.\n\n> This is believed to be the first case of a doctor convicted for ‚Äúslamming‚Äù an addict in Singapore.\n\n> The judge ordered the sentence to take effect after the end of his current two-year jail term for helping his HIV-positive former partner Farrera-Brochez cheat the authorities into issuing him a work pass.\n\n> Farrera-Brochez was at the centre of an HIV registry scandal in which details of 14,200 HIV-positive patients were leaked online.\n\n> He was convicted and jailed by a United States court for extorting the Singapore Government, using the HIV registry.\n\n> Two further charges against Ler are pending.\n\n> One is under the Official Secrets Act, for allegedly failing to take reasonable care to retain possession of the information relating to the HIV registry. He had access to it as he was then head of the National Public Health Unit.\n\n> The other charge is for refusing to provide a urine specimen to narcotics officers.\n\n> District Judge Christopher Goh, in dismissing Ler‚Äôs ‚Äúsham defence‚Äù, described his explanations variously as illogical and unbelievable.

After some arguing and shouting my brother confessed to taking that money from my wallet (bear in mind this has not been the first time that money has been stolen from me). Eventually my brother confessed in front of me and my parents that he used that money to buy drugs. Honestly I‚Äôm sick and tired of this, I‚Äôm studying at a local uni and doing part time jobs and this is my hard earned money. I am at my wits end already so I wanted to call the police. Yes I‚Äôve had enough of this nonsense going on at home and this was all the money I had to tide me over till my next pay check. 

My parents on the other hand begged me not to involve the police as they don‚Äôt want my brother to have a ‚Äúrecord‚Äù and go to jail, etc. I was insistent at first but I decided not to involve the police for the sake of my parents. 

Can any Redditors please advise me? Honestly I‚Äôm sick and tired of this, but I don‚Äôt want to report my brother only for the sake of my parents. I‚Äôm totally broke now and I‚Äôm thinking of borrowing money from a moneylender (I don‚Äôt know any options other than this). I know they charge exorbitantly high interest rates - does anyone know any reputable, fair (legal) moneylenders they could recommend?

If he decides to leave the facility before his duration is up, he WILL have difficulty trying to get another appointment.

razxchrome,kvf5m4,"[O-Levels] Congratulations, those who received their results today.",2021-01-12 07:36:07,SGExams,77673,36,263,"[Repost because I accidentally violated some rules in the subreddit. I'm really sorry, mods =w=]

The title says it all. Congratulations.

I didn't do greatly on my exams. I failed four subjects ahha. I have six recorded subjects. Or rather, had. I passed two of it. A C5 in English and a B4 in Design and Technology.

How do you say this..? I can't really blame anyone but myself. I'm disappointed, but also rather happy that I have at least courses to apply for in ITE.

=====================

A list of some of the things I did in 2020.

- After three years of slacking off, I decided to just study at the last moment. It worked in the common and semestral assessments, so it should work in O-levels, amirite?

No, it doesn't. My work ethic was nonexistent, and I had a serious addiction towards gaming.

- I got my EAE Application, nice. I don't need to study.

Yes, you do. Thinking back, EAE was more of Plan B than Plan A. Don't rely on it *too much*. I couldn't tell the difference between arrogance and confidence, but this serves as a wake-up call.

- Online lessons = holiday

No, no and no. Sleeping through important lessons are detrimental to your studies. As boring as it seems, listen. Down a mug of coffee if you have to, because it's difficult to mug with the presence of Covid-19. Sure, they took out last common topics, but it probably won't be the same this year.

Trust me, it's unpleasant to wear masks during the exams. Your ability to think on the fly will be halved because the other half of it will be concentrated on your breathing patterns. Uniform's already thick enough as it is. Wear mask even more sian. Singapore already so hot then mask amplify the effect.

=====================

So, what do I do now?

To start things off, I'm two years older than my batchmates, because I had to pause my studies in my home country.

Yeah, I had a great family and all, but outside of it I was ostracized pretty much everywhere for not knowing how to communicate, and for being too reserved. The environment I was in, if you aint talking, get the fuck out of here. It's the same in the academies I attended until Primary 5. We don't have the same ideas? You're excluded. You're lying to us? You're excluded. This and that, and more things to be annoyed at.

As a result, I'm always on the defense. Both mentally and emotionally. If I had emotions, I'll just suppress them, no problem. If someone was going to approach me, I'd be super suspicious and push them away as soon as possible.

What individuals would normally experience in their secondary school years, I had only experienced after leaving it (I don't know. I mean, what's the norm of secondary school's social life?). I let my guard down in front of some strangers, and they went in not to lunge at me, but to hug me instead. They're my best friends now.

I'm a failure now, but not in the future. Fuck the chances of taking O's again and the stigma that comes along with attending the Institute of Technical Education, I'm heading straight to ITE and I'm not looking back.

I scored 30 points for my O's (ITE ELB4-A, ELR1B3-B and ELR2B2-C all 30 points ah) and it isn't going to feel nice when your mother decides to tell the rest of the family. I disappointed her, and it's completely fine if she decides to tell them. She's a single mother, and the rest of the family is back 'home'. Still, the feeling of knowing that your family is aware of your results, it's suffocating to say the least.

It's nothing compared to what my mother is feeling right now, because she had placed her faith in me, only for me to destroy that. I have serious problems regarding my attitude. For the first time in my life I'm owning up to my mistakes, and it's literally in the lowest point in my life. I always had it easy, so I find it hard to take in all of this. Still, I think it's better for me to take this all in *now* instead of neutralising the effects of the hit, in order to condition myself.

To my juniors, or rather those who came after us. Don't be like your senior here. If you're looking for someone to laugh at, laugh at me if it makes you feel better. Don't end up like me. Failing is alright, but don't fail until you have no more room to fail. Online lessons are boring as fuck, and sorry if your teacher abit the guai lan, but the moment I failed o's looking back I should've just paid attention to my teachers. I legit just went back home to get told off by my mom, and probably by the rest of my family soon. I kena sai already so what more can I do right?

In this world, where your results define you and dictate where you go, save for the few outliers who broke everyone's expectations, your only option to be set free is through education.

That being said, congratulations if you made it to this point in the reddit post, and if you took the O-Level exams. Whether you passed or failed, I care not. And just to confirm, my intention is not for anyone to feel bad for me. As pathetic as I am right now, my end goal is to improve.

studymatcha,mc4q1t,[o levels] how to be more disciplined to study?,2021-03-24 20:41:34,SGExams,77673,13,19,"hi im taking Os this year and im feeling a bit hopeless. My classmates seem to be so on top of everything, always finishing homework early and getting so much revision done while i struggle to even complete the homework on time. When im in school i make these grand plans about going home and finishing assignments and making notes and doing extra revision etc, but in reality when i get home and see the huge list of things to do, i feel overwhelmed and im already quite tired and i end up doing almost nothing. Even if i plan less tasks, i get complacent and go like ""oh i have plenty of time to do it"" and end up not starting anything until around 10.30pm. I know it sounds pathetic but i dont know how to stop this. Also, i am quite addicted to my phone but unfortunately i need my phone to do a lot of my homework because my teachers use things like google classroom and padlet etc, so hiding my phone is not an option. I do use the Forest app, but i end up just mindlessly waiting for the timer to end so that i can use my phone again. I tried deleting distracting apps, but sooner or later i cave and download them again. 
Many people in my school are doing really well in their studies, but i didnt score very well for my WA1 and its only a few topics compared to MYE/Prelims/Os which is 2 to 4 years of content. I feel like i should make a study plan, but then again im not good at following the plans i make üòÖ
I think i really need better self discipline, but i dont know how to do it. Any tips?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mc4q1t/o_levels_how_to_be_more_disciplined_to_study/,"[""Same for me last year, maybe even worse since its cb. But really you just have to discipline yourself. I too was addicted to twitter last year cuz you know, twitter. My math teacher was extremely strict with homework so thats the only reason why I hand in my work on time. You really just have to find reasons motivation to get through hw, whether its a toxic reason or not. Maybe try to make a completely new YT acc and just use that acc to watch study with me kind of videos. I feel like that method motivates me a lot during prelims. And if you use your phone to do hw, then why just not finish those first then go on social media after. Like make it a goal for finishing hw or something. Theres a method of constantly putting yourself under stress and pressure to get things done, but not recommended. And if you're overwhelmed by the plans you made, just simplify your plans or not make one at all. Ask your parents to nag at you everyday to get you to finish hw. Thats all I can give you, everything comes down to self discipline actually"", ""hey,im also a sec 4 here ! always tell yourself to own time own target, u don't have to finish everything within a day, so take things slowly.. I realised a lot of my friends became way more serious about this year's exams so I guess maybe peer pressure can motivate u :) (the same way it did to me). also think about it, if u study hard and smart now, you will be able to get a good spot in jc/poly/ite. I guess its like delayed gratification? also maybe studying with friends would help you"", ""1.  Delete away all the apps that wastes your time.  Eg.. tik tok, insta, Twitter, etc.\n\n2.  Find a study buddy.  Someone whom you know want to study but not disciplined to do it alone.  Promise to pressure each other to study.  Create friendly competitions.  Eg. see who can memorize more facts for geography.  Or.. who can finish maths paper1 first in a given time.\n\n3.  Fix a place for study.  Always go back to the same place to study.\n\n4.  Fix a time for study.  Everyday same time same place.  \n\n5.  Study time, study.  Play time, play.  Exercise time, exercise.  Meal times, eat.

I‚Äôm not sure about your school but my school‚Äôs WAs were mainly based on specific topics and not a mix of everything hence, if i‚Äôm weak in a certain topic, I end up failing everything.

You may not even tell that someone is abusing drug. My family member slimmed down drastically and came home drunk a few times, but we assumed that he was back with his basketball peers and thus was hanging out and slimming down more. \n\nBut that doesn't mean that there's no other damage. In my case, my family member was involved in gangs activity, he was caught consuming and peddling drugs, he was caught put in jail end of story? Ofcourse not. \n\nAs some have rightly pointed out, rehabilitation scene in singapore is not the brightest, even if we tried to support him, there are so much stigma on him and the kopitiam culture happened to become a gateway for him to get back in the scene (not drugs, but other illegal stuff). It's hard to revert, you don't start a fresh entirely. \n\nIf the person was involved in drugs, likely he's not the top dog. The one who provide the drugs is some top dog who expect money in return. Being caught and goods seized means money lost to the top dogs. And who do you think they pester for money? The guy in the prison? Ofcourse not, they go to the family members. Calling our phone numbers, showing that they know our address, you think the government is bad by using fear mongering tactics? Try getting a phone call from them. \n\nSo there you have it, drugs is not the only thing killing people or destroying lives. It's everything else after drugs. The stigma, the chance of stepping back in, the gangs, the money problems, the family breakups, the divorce, the suicides. And remember, just because you don't see it doesn't mean it's not happening. \n\nThe government doesn't hang people easily, my family member is still alive though I wished he was hanged. So that we do not have this dead weight pulling us down and sucking our savings dry. So for those that try to make light of the situation, I strongly urge you not to take this lightly, addictions of any form is bad, some is easier to catch on early, some is hard.

The people who keep defending China's Opium War narrative are simply ignoring this simple fact: the Chinese were growing and using plenty of opium themselves. Moreover, the rule of law concept is entirely foreign to the Qing Chinese legal system, i.e., law enforcement is selective. From the British perspective, the ban on opium could have been a cynical attempt by the Qing government to monopolize and profit the opium industry (which it did after opium was formally legalized).\n\nFurthermore, opium had many legitimate medical uses (anti-diarrheatic, prevent menstrual cramps, pain relief). There were very few pain relief options then, which is why its ban was universally ignored by government officials, **Chinese doctors prescribed it for many conditions**, and ordinary Chinese people continued to buy it. If you think that pain relief before the advent of modern medicine is unimportant, I suggest you try surgery without anaesthetic.

QualitativeEconomy,kzrdw6,Criticism of data interpretation made in MSF's first local study on intergenerational effects of divorce on Children.,2021-01-18 17:29:07,singapore,378757,17,53,"I was watching the Parliament records wherein MOS Sun Xueling was going through the MSF's study on Intergenerational effects of divorce on Children. MP Carrie Tan brought up concerns regarding potential signaling effect the study would have in stigmatising divorced families, especially when combined with the lack of actionable insights the study actually provides. I.e, if the study produces nothing very useful (no insights on causation, which can be acted upon) why say something that may be misleading? Possibly making divorced parents which had to make a hard decision feel even worse about a choice they are often forced to make. 

I found MP Carrie Tan's comments quite interesting and decided to look further into the study itself. I think there is sufficient reason to render MP Tan's concerns valid, especially with regards to a lack of useful insight, but also on another point regarding the way MSF is using this study to justify certain policies.

If you wish to look at the study yourself the link is below, or you can Google MSF Divorce study

http://go.gov.sg/intergenstudydivorce

The facts from the statistics used by the study are that children of divorced families do perform lower on a number of metrics, not alot (<10%) but also not in significantly either (>2%). On the surface this does imply that divorce leads to negative outcomes, and hence the existence of a ""divorce penalty"" which the study repeatly deems to exist as a result of the evidence. Hence the study advocates for the policies regarding the prevention of divorce and/or the addressing of issues following divorce. 

However, MOS Sun clearly stated that the study was correlational rather than causational, and this was acknowledged in the study itself. This means that it is possible (and depending on further study, likely) that lower performance is due instead to a common confounder, such as a common factor that is simultaneously causing higher divorce rates as well as lower performance by children but with seperate causational chains. One such common factor might be emotionally abusive grandparents (on either side) or a gambling addiction by either parent.

To further elaborate, it may be the case that the common factor (let's use emotionally abusive GPs) leads to lower performance for the child through one path (destruction of Grandchildren's self esteem) and divorces via another path (abuse of spouse). In fact it may very well be in many cases that divorces increase because divorces are used by parents as a strategy to resolve such issues before they harm the children more!  (Many divorces happen because parents want to protect their children rather than because they don't care) 

In the lack of even any minimal attempt for a causational study (such as analysis of divorced family narratives and histories), it is thusly rather reckless for MSF to assume that there is indeed a ""divorce penalty"" and use it to back up a slew of marriage protection policies. For if it was a case of misdiagnosing the social issue, and divorce-avoidant policies cause greater harm on the relevant children (who may have otherwise been protected through the institution of divorce) then that would be plain bad. 

It is irresponsible to claim causation without proof. It is even worse to recognise that a study is correlational rather than causational... then interpret it for policy as if it was causational anyway! 

Because human beings always think in causational terms and there is a tendency to act on correlational data as if it was causational. In the lack of minimally sufficient causational insights, MSF should have not publicised the data in the form that it did (perhaps directly issuing it to public research institutes for follow up instead), or at least included much more significant interpretational warnings in the study itself (such as examples of possible confounders)  so that readers won't come to faulty conclusions. Most importantly, it should not be utilising this kind of study to justify its policies, for if the government wants to invoke the virtues of science in its management of its peoples' lives, it ought to be more rigorous science than this.",0.83,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kzrdw6/criticism_of_data_interpretation_made_in_msfs/,"['First off, I disagree with your characterization of the effect size as being not that big. A difference of 9.2 percentage points translates to being 25 percent lower when the base is 37.8%. That is large, which is why it\'s important to differentiate between percent and percentage points. \n\nSecond, they actually did try a method for establishing a more causal connection, which is to match children of similar family backgrounds. The question then is whether the set of variables they match on is sufficient to eliminate the influence of confounders. \n\nThird, ~~I\'m surprised they didn\'t probe the causality of their results further.~~ (edit: they did but it\'s not in the linked paper. See my final paragraph.) A quick search of the literature tells me that timing of divorce matters, which is why some studies look at divorces that happen when one child is of adult age and another child is not. The idea is that adult age children are much less affected. Just how much is the so-called divorce penalty affected by the child\'s age at the time of the divorce? To the extent that the matching is done well, we should see the penalty disappear for children who are working adults at the time of the divorce.\n\nEdit: I looked up the parliamentary records and Sun Xueling said that ""[there] was no clear finding suggesting a relationship between the child‚Äôs age when the parents divorced and the child‚Äôs outcomes at age 35."" So it sounds like the matching wasn\'t good enough to give a causal interpretation to their results. Omitting those results from the paper seems to me like an sly move to make their findings sound more causal than it is.', 'Any social scientists on this sub can comment on the challenges of establishing causality for social determinants of health? In my mind it appears very difficult.', ""As you acknowledged in another comment, it's not like they are making up a bunch of draconian marriage protection policies. Stuff like counselling is different as it doesn't merely avoid or delay divorce, counselling actually aims to improve the quality of the relationship.\n\nThis study _does_ produce actionable insights, by the way. There is a second way to try to avoid the 'divorce penalty', as you seem to call it, which is to support those families and the children with additional resources. As a matter of fact, that's what is actually being done, once again as you acknowledge! Regardless of whether the penalty is because of divorce or some other confounding factor, it is still possible to use the study to determine how much of these 'additional resources' should be allocated to this cause, versus other types of social aid. Because the aid is purely in the form of resources to help the families in need, they should provide some benefit in a relatively agnostic fashion, though, sure, further study could help refine the specific intervention. Sure, perhaps divorce isn't what harms the kids; perhaps the issue is that divorce is a proxy for toxic relationships! Well, guess what, marriage counselling would likely help diffuse that too. \n\nI don't think the problem is that the government erred. This is but one study; it lays the groundwork for future more detailed studies. The fact that the effect size is broadly similar to what is observed internationally also allows one to cautiously (and with low certainty) imply that the causative mechanisms might be similar too\n\nIt's important to not make perfection the enemy of the good, and if you worked in research you'd understand this point very clearly. Even if the study isn't useful on its own, which is categorically not the case here, it can still be useful in laying groundwork for future studies. Instead of having one mega-study, it's better to just conduct more targeted studies and publish as soon as you have data. That helps dissemination of information, and also helps your research be more flexible as later studies' design would be informed by earlier studies.\n\nFinally, it's important to understand that social workers aren't stupid. They're usually very cognisant of the reality on the ground, and a study of effect size can likely help inform their more qualitative understanding of the situation."", ""Even if there is a confounder, divorce will still function as an indicator of that confounder's presence. The divorce penalty will still exist. MSF isn't claiming that there is causation anyway - policy is based around the fact that children who are divorced face a harder time and they're gonna need more support. In the link you provide, MSF says that this is evidence that helps inform policy on how to support these children, which is pretty important imo."", 'what are some examples of marriage protection policies?', 'Think you are overthinking this. \n\nIn the long run this means we should try to reduce divorce rates, and if divorces are to happen - the children need appropriate support to reduce the divorce penalty. \n\nThe one that is lacking is additional divorce support for the children', ""That is indeed quite wise: Do not let Perfection be the enemy of good.\n\nIn that aspect I do relent, most of the fault here wherever it is, lies with the study's writing and not with the government Ministry. In that we view the Ministry's function as primarily policy based (rather than research based) they have shown prudency in their policy design, implementing in force only policies that they are confident will have benefit even considering the flaws of the research, such as improvements of marriage conditons and direct help to divorcee children. It is the even temperedness that calls for respect and acknowledgement.\n\nBut we must then address the flaw of the study. My contention arises in the way the study jumps from results to conclusions (points 14-15 in the study). Usually social science studies, to the extent I am exposed to within my field, contain a discussion segment where the possible interpretations of the results are discussed, usually in conjunction with relevant theoretical literature or qualitative insights from accessory data. Such sections also usually call for additonal studies to confirm possible interpretations. Instead the study jumps straight into \n\npoint 14: These findings suggest that divorce may affect children negatively even into adulthood, in \r\neducation, finances and relationship outcomes.(which effectively implies a causal relation for all save the most detailed readings) \n\npoint 15:  In addition, upstream interventions to help couples build strong marriages are important. (note the possible misinterpretation of such a factual proposition) \n\nOnce again to the study's credit this time, both conclusion points are qualified with examples of policy actions which are rather restrained. It actually seems to be that there very well have been that a discussion on the results was conducted, used to be between those components as a qualifier, then edited out before final publication for some strange reason. For otherwise the jump from a strong conclusion to a moderated policy stance wouldn't make sense.\n\nHowever the point remains that the study lacks nuance, detail and self-criticism regarding possible causal relations because of the absence of such a segment. Such information would be material to the Parliament which it was presented. It would caution the bravado of certain MPs suggestions, such as MP Louis Ng's suggestion to make certain voluntary assistance programs compulsory. It might also invite more constructive suggestions from MPs familiar with the qualitative aspects of the issue, such as from MP Carrie Tan who is a leader of a relevant social service. Most importantly, it should contain within itself a self criticism and thusly a call to the same Ministry to necessitate those more detailed studies (which is key since the Ministry has the access to sources of qualitative data). The overall point being that these elements which are missing from the study are necessary for the discussion of possible refinements of policy, both where it ought to go further, where it out to show restraint, and where it ought to look differently, refinements often enough made through suggestions in Parliament to the Ministry. \n\nIn the absence of these elements being contained within the study itself, it is the onus of the critical outsider to raise them. Though admittably that is perhaps better done through journalism or academic response rather than on reddit. But I like reddit, it's has alot less red tape. \n\nI do not mean to say that the Ministry should do nothing in the absence of full data, it has done much good with what it can credibly ascertain, which is applaudable. Yet there is room to do better, to provide pathways towards even more effective policies, which may either be performed by more rigor by the study itself, Parliament's critic of it, or public debate such as this or from more institutional sources. And as someone to which this issue affects both myself and many of my friends/family, I reckon Singapore eventually deserves better.\n\nI admit in the moments of passion I had been too intense and reckless in my criticism, and I thank you for the strong counter arguments made in response that point out the critical flaws of that positon."", 'Yes.', 'SXL said to determine causality will need longitudinal studies and tbh it‚Äôs very expensive to run these kind of studies.', 'Im actually in the field and yes I agree full confidence in causality is difficult.\n\nWhich is why some degree of minimal evidence usually suffices, to the extent that no extremely salient counter evidence arises. \n\nThe function being that the quanti correlational data provides the ""proof"" and some on the ground qualitative reports (usually by a few of the subjects themselves) provides the ""reasonable hypothesis"". The combination of both provides a relatively safe measure of truth. The quanti ensures that the quali is not solely anecdotal, the quali ensures that the quanti not terribly misinterpreted. Hence while full confidence is not achieved, a signicant confidence can be. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that this was not performed by the study, despite it being not that difficult to phone in a few divorcees or their now adult children, who would usually have grandmother stories to tell which can serve as a decent enough guide.', 'Usually social determinants of health do not prove causality. Because it‚Äôs incredibly difficult to do so. You can‚Äôt easily put people in RCT like medical sciences but have to observe people in natural settings. \nBut what we do is to prove high correlations, reverse causality doesn‚Äôt happen (aka dependent variable - low income doesn‚Äôt affect independent variable - divorce) and ruling out any other cofounding variables that OP already explained. \n\nAlso this study is more likely following population demographics methodology. -> closer to sociology/public health than psychology although i haven‚Äôt read the full paper.', 'Tbh to the Ministry\'s Credit their policies are well crafted considering the inadequacy of knowledge, but whether this is because of their natural conservatism or because of they are self aware of their studies pitfalls remains of question.\n\nMarriage protection policies include stuff like courses for marriage advise, provision of marriage counselling, intervention by ""first responder"" social workers.\n\nThese have been matched with Divorce support policies such as co-parenting schemes.\n\nThe only policy which may explicitly deter divorce (tho conditioned upon whether the marriage is deemed ""salvageable"") would be the compulsory (for Muslim couples) Marriage Counselling Programme for Divorcees run by the Syariah Court. \n\nThe cautionary way these policies are drawn up are... alright. My issue is that if these policies are backed up by this kind of poor study there may be, at best, a misallocation of resources as we fail to address the core issue and hence not perform the welfare functions the Ministry was tasked to perform and for which those resources were budgeted for. At worst, because of the ""soft"" nature of counselling, advice and social work, the operations may implicitly deter divorce when divorce is actually necessary. Parents trapped in terrible marriages that are bad for their children may also hesitate to divorce out of fear of subjecting their children to such a ""penalty"". This of course being the signalling effect that MP Carrie Tan was concerned about. \n\nLink for government source on policies \nhttps://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/Pages/First%20Local%20Study%20On%20The%20Intergenerational%20Effects%20Of%20Divorce%20On%20Children.aspx', 'I agree in the long run we should reduce divorces.\n\nBut being a child of a divorcee myself, I attribute most set backs in my life not to the divorce itself but to my dad being financially reckless (a matter which would have caused greater set back if not for the divorce)\n\nIf the causal focus is on divorce rates alone, we risk reducing divorces but not treating the issue. Which has an annoying issue of making the vulnerable children ""invisible"". It\'s kinda like taking panadol for COVID-19. You address the symptoms and hide it, which makes it harder to treat the underlying disease.\n\nHowever I whorl heartily agree that additonal support for children you have mentioned are direct repairs, that rectify the damages already done. I don\'t think anyone should have anything against that, and regardless of where the debate goes that should be the minimum done.\n\nMSF said they were going to do some things to provide help for the children, but I\'m don\'t know what being a kid is like now so can\'t judge if it\'s enough or not.', 'Actually that‚Äôs what OP is saying, it shouldn‚Äôt be tied to divorce and reducing its rates.', 'Nice, thanks for the insights!', ""Given that the phenomenon of divorce has probably been well studied internationally, I wonder if there are reasons why further research may be difficult. And even if we could discover the ultimate causal factors, aren't they likely going to be social issues that are already being addressed by the government in their own right like problem gambling? \n\nIn any case deciding whether or not to go through with a divorce is probably a decision best made at the ground level considering the different circumstances families face. Social workers who deal with issues like this on a day to day basis are best placed to judge whether a marriage can be salvaged or not. But I think most would agree that the default position should not be immediately jumping to divorce as the first option."", 'it is tied to divorce so that we can deliver more support and  ensure better outcomes for children of divorcees']"

momochan14,hrorgl,[Trigger Warning] Singaporeans who fell through the cracks of society... How are you now?,2020-07-15 22:40:12,singapore,378757,337,2133,"**Economic downturn is here and more Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. I hope we can share our experiences with each other.**

**Here goes my story...**

Ever since early 2000s, my family struggled financially after my father was retrenched, due to the economic downturn. No companies wanted to hire him, despite his experience and capabilities, because he was deemed too old (in his 50s) and over-qualified for junior roles, couldn't even get past the recruiters.

After my father's start-up attempt failed, he took up any jobs possible that barely keep us afloat (Warehouse Executive in the day, Cook at fast food restaurant at night), because if he didn't, we would not be able to cover HDB loan, bills, debts and other expenses. He put up with the bullying from his boss (heavy workload, deducting his pay whenever something goes wrong) because he really needed the job. When he went to Social Services for financial help during the most desperate times, he recounted that the process was very demeaning and felt like a beggar. We got some financial aid, but it was far from enough.

Prior to that, I was blessed to have had resources (for enrichment classes, tuition etc..) for development, went to good schools and received good grades. As a result, my parents pinned high hopes on me that I would be the one to ""rescue"" the family, that kept them going during the difficult times. During the worst period, we nearly lost our home and had no money for our meals.

During my JC years, I was giving tuition to earn my pocket money. My parents didn't know I was struggling inside, I couldn't tell them, they had already crumbled under the immense pressure. They were miserable and started buying 4D, because they thought they could buy ""a hope"", they were happy only when they strike. I was crumbling under their heavy expectations, stress of going hungry, sense of shame from not having enough money to eat, maintaining my grades in a top JC. I was exhausted and had no one to confide in, even though I had people to hang out with.

I was falling into depression and couldn't absorb what I was studying. As expected, I didn't do well for the A levels, that sense of failure spiraled me further into depression. (I internalised the stigma of seeking therapy, because I thought the record would become an obstacle in my future, and if I hang in there, it would go away) My parents told me it was ok, but I know it's not from the way they behaved.

I refused to go down like that, I started working while my friends enter Uni. I thought I can save enough and pay for my own education (no one could be my guarantor for school loan), I was very clear about what my strengths are and what to study. I survived on less than $5 a day and enrolled in part-time degree after work. My mother would ask me for money for family expenses from time to time, I would give it to her to see her worry less. I was pushing myself very hard, lack of sleep and irregular meal times, my physical and mental health deteriorated. I went to Feiyue for free counselling service, the counsellor was kind but the only thing he could advice me, was to leave my family. It's impossible because I couldn't afford anymore financial burden to myself (rent. get my own household items etc..).

One day, my mother told me my father was going to get into big trouble, if I didn't help him pay off his debt. I didn't have the heart to let more misfortune befall him. I was totally crushed, that was my last straw. Even when I worked so hard to save, I couldn't study as I wanted, all my savings gone, just like that. I was very dejected and lived like a zombie, my parents said I should pull myself together and pressured me to do something productive.

>!I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just too overwhelming. I was standing by the window, almost ready to take a dive. My sibling pulled me off the window, we hugged and cried. I know I need professional help immediately (because if I don't, there is no future to talk about).!<

I went to the polyclinic and got a referral to see a psychiatrist at KTP Hospital, diagnosed with depression and given medication. Experience with my doctor was poor, he was uncaring and insensitive, but I carried on, took my medication because it worked for me. I asked if there was any support group I could join, he said ""nope"" and that was it.

I returned to work after I felt ready again. I had a hard time looking for a job, the recruiters questioning about the gaps in my resume, the tone as though there I did something wrong. I was especially afraid of a section on the form that required me to declare whether I have any mental illness. (thankfully this section is no longer around) When I finally found one, I cherished it and did my best, got praises and then the bullying from co-workers started. I hanged on and stood my ground, but gradually it took a toll on me, and my depression relapsed. I told myself that I have to fight the right battles in life, and I quit my job.

This break is the turning point in my life, as I started going for psychotherapy and working out issues that I had. **I strongly recommend anyone who is suffering from any trauma to seek therapy ASAP, don't bottle it up until it becomes debilitating, because the body keeps score and it will always win.**

I'm in recovery and felt better than before I had depression, with a newfound understanding of myself. I convinced my parents to seek help for gambling addiction, and the financial situation improved. I am very proud of them for doing that.

However, I'm struggling with fears of being asked about the gaps in my resume when I apply for jobs, how people feel about working with someone with mental illness. Now in my early 30s, my struggle is far from over, I have problem finding a sustainable job without degree, and now I also have to worry about my parents' medical bills. I want to love and marry someone, have my own family, but I don't think I can afford to do so (My bf of many years broke up with me because he saw no hope in my situation).

A very big part of my life revolved around my personal battles that I cannot put onto my resume to add value, and too afraid to tell others because I don't want to be labelled as a failure by societal standards, or that I'm trying to get sympathy. Life is about spending time with your loved ones, having enough food to eat, a place to stay, doing meaningful work. I still want to work towards it.

I don't know how the future will turn out for me, I'm lost now. I was unemployed before Covid-19 hit, and did part-time job on and off, now my source of part-time jobs is gone too. I don't dare to sign up for jobs that has a lot human contact, because I'm afraid of passing the virus to my 2 elderly parents. I am trying to self-learn digital design (through free courses), and now I heard market is bad.

(TLDR: Bipolar, PTSD from near-death experience. Zero support network earlier in life because of various reasons. Pressures from everyone to be somebody, from Day 1. Anything less than 91/100 was deemed a failure.)  But here\'s the bit that may be relevant to you - the path I took to reinvent myself and build a new career.\n\nWas life science student in JC. Didn\'t get a scholarship, but that\'s ok, because I had a bunch of research internships under my belt. I\'d find something once I finish uni. But, I knew I had zero passion for the field, and would thus either flunk out at uni, or just be super mediocre and unhappy forever. (I only went into that field because it was what ""good students"" did.)\n\nThen, I watched a whole lab get fired at my research institute. Watched the phD students scramble to find new labs; some of them were young parents and the stipends they earned were hardly generous to begin with. That sobered me up and jolted me out of teenagerhood real fast. (Note: This was at a point in time where the govt was driving everyone to life sciences.)\n\nSo, I postponed going to uni. (Pretty much unheard of at a top JC. So, I\'m sure you can imagine how everyone responded.)\n\nI had a decent design portfolio by 18, so I found a job with that. Worked for 2 years, while studying part-time and doing multiple side gigs. Just so I could figure out what I wanted to do in life, and to finish uni with minimal debt.\n\nHad near zero personal life, it was 9 am to 10 pm of work/studying 7 days a week. There were days where I felt so burnt out I simply teared up silently at the back of the bus on the way home. (What helped: Knowing my goal, and spending so many hours out working away from judgemental parents.)\n\nKnowing what I know now, I\'m glad I did it.\n\nThe clue lies in what you do. What you\'ve always done.  \n**What do you do when you\'re sad? What is the one thing you do well?**  \n**All day, every day?**\n\nIn my case, it was writing. (I started with fanfiction writing almost 20 years ago.)  \nSo, basically, I found a way to **monetize that skillset.** (I\'m now literally a professional keyboard warrior.)\n\nRather than jump at the free courses out there, I suggest you look at what you have a real talent for and build from there. (Data analysts & coders are the new PMETs.)\n\nThen build a portfolio. (Since getting a degree is out of your reach.) It will get you either paid freelance work, or proper employment.\n\nIt won\'t feel like it while you walk through the tunnel, but the tunnel does end.  \nJust set a direction and keep going, u/momochan14.

There's certainly a social stigma for people with mental illnesses in Singapore and not enough support for them.\n\nPersonally I think as a society, Singapore is a lot more cold compared to other countries.

But I think everybody actually has a story to tell, just that it's not exactly easy to open up (another consequence of how our society functions). There is a need for openness before love and kindness can kick in after all."", 'Hey momochan, gambatte!', ""Not Singaporean, but an immigrant kind of?\nSo I moved to Singapore from Malaysia at the end of 2017. Since I was a child my parents have been moving to and fro from Singapore to study, work etc. So this is my 2nd time coming back to Singapore. Unfortunately I was rejected for government school entry, because my scores for the AEIS exam were less than other people. My parents found me a small private school so that I could continue schooling. My dad found a job in 2018, and my mom found a job at the start of 2019. All was good for about 2 years, and then at the end of 2019, my father quit his job because of coworker harassment and pressure, among other issues. Now, my Dependent's Pass was tacked onto my dad's Employment Pass, so since he was out of a job, I was out of a Dependent's Pass. My dad and I have been passless since the start of 2020, and before Covid started, we were moving in and out of Malaysia to reset the visit pass duration (tourists are allowed to stay in Singapore for 30 consecutive days and 3 refreshes, so in total 90 consecutive days). After Covid started, we started to apply for visit pass extension, and surprisingly we got to extend until 150 consecutive days as of now, presumably because of Covid. Now, we're suck at home, but my education has been put on hold. I was already demoted to one grade lower than my actual grade when I went into the private school, and now I am 2 whole years behind my peers. My dad, disillusioned because no one has hired him yet, began to dabble into investment again with my mom being the sole breadwinner, so naturally my mom disliked that. He had lost copious amounts of money to investment scams before, and even got my grandma's money scammed by a fake trading company. But he's not stopping. He's already too deep into the rabbit hole, and he and my mom argue everyday about this issue. To add more bad news, we've been renting a flat (relatively old one with squatting toilet) to live in since we came to Singapore, and the owner just informed us that when our lease expires in 2021, she wants to sell the flat, so we need to move out and find another place to stay.\n\nIdk, I know tons of people have it worse than me, such as OP, but for my background and upbringing, I feel like Im in the worst situation in my whole life for now. I'm scared that I wont be able to graduate on time, I'm scared that I wont get a place in Uni/College, I'm scared that my parents will divorce, I'm scared that we'll be homeless, I'm scared other people will look down on me for my upbringing, I'm scared that I wont get married because I've always been rejected and I've never had a good first impression to anyone(I've asked), and most of all I dont know what to do. I've been trying to bury all that stuff by playing video games and learning languages and other stuff, but these questions always nag my mind. My mom asks me why I've looked so down recently and I just say I'm just tired coz I dont want her to worry about me.\n\nI've thought about suicide tbh, but I'm afraid of the pain and also of the suffering it will bring to my parents. My friends probably wont mind it too much though, because I drifted from everyone else since I dont go to school anymore."", 'Hi momochan!

After we graduated, we forced our dad to really stop gambling and limiting his expenses (as he no longer working, and we are his only support for expenses), and slowly turn the situation back to normal life.\n\nHopefully you can make it through your life, and become better in coming future.', 'Was reading everyone‚Äôs posts and It‚Äôs really insane how much a lot of you have been through, especially OP. \n\nI thought I could maybe share my ‚Äúsuccess‚Äù story to encourage everyone who‚Äôs younger (am actually only 28) and inspire those stuck in a rut. I‚Äôm not successful per se but I‚Äôm in a better place so I hope you guys can continue being resilient.\n\nI grew up in a upper middle class family. My father wasn‚Äôt born rich but worked hard to become an entrepreneur and had a thriving business. Up to the age of 14, I was living comfortably, had a helper in our house, always got what I wanted, and at one point of time was living in a condo too. Only issues I had were perhaps toxic communication issues with my parents. My mum is overbearing and my father is simply the stereotypical silent distant figure.\n\nThen my father‚Äôs business failed and everything went downhill. He was in debt, got my mum involved as a guarantor and before I could process what happened, my family was homeless and both my parents were bankrupt when I was 14. Our apartment literally got re-possessed and we had those officers coming in placing stickers on whatever was valuable so they could sell it. It was pretty traumatising & I remember my mum asking me to hide my laptop and tech stuff so they can‚Äôt take it.\n\nMy father then ‚Äúsemi-abandoned‚Äù the family with ‚Äòbusiness trips‚Äô to China where he would fail and not send us any money at all. My mum was in a senior admin position earning about $3K which wasn‚Äôt really enough to single-handedly pay debts, rent, and raise 2 teenagers. But she also didn‚Äôt qualify for a lot of subsidies because they deem her salary as ‚Äútoo high‚Äù. This is where I think gov policies can be more flexible in helping families with different circumstances but, topic for another day.\n\nMy mum fell into depression and would threaten to commit suicide everyday. Both parents couldn‚Äôt make a decision about where to live and I literally went through the classifieds section to find rental apartments, dragged my mum to viewings, and we finally settled in a rented hdb flat. My mum also struggled to give us expenses and she would go hungry at times just to make sure me and my sister still had meals and tuition. By this time, I was already jaded about school. I was a decent student but with so much going on, I did poorly in sec 3, scored single digits for tests, and had to repeat another year. I didn‚Äôt really realise it then but I was depressed because I had insomnia and was constantly unhappy and angry. \n\nAll repeated students were made to attend compulsory counselling sessions in my school and this only made it worse. As a teenager, the last thing you really need is extra attention drawn to you when you have to skip classes for your counselling sessions. The counselling itself was horrible because I don‚Äôt remember much of it. I just remember feeling disconnected from everyone and distrusting everybody so much so that I don‚Äôt think I had a proper conversation with the counsellor. The last 3 years of my sec school education are a blur because I think my brain is trying to protect me from trauma by blocking things out and I‚Äôm still working on processing them till today.\n\nEventually me and my sister motivated each other and I did well for O‚Äôlevels to get into a decent JC. But it was tough focusing cause my mum lost her job, had a new one which paid lesser, then Singapore‚Äôs property market entered a crazy boom and the rented hdb wanted to increase rent by 2x & we couldn‚Äôt afford it. Throughout this period, my dad was just absent. I honestly didn‚Äôt really cared much about him but it fucked my Mum real bad and she was emotionally abusive and manipulative to me and my sister. We were almost going to be homeless again until an aunt(dad‚Äôs side) decided to let us use a spare room in her hdb.\n\nWorst aunt ever. She charged us high rent for that space, was stingy, turned off the main aircon switch in the night to get us to use less electricity. This made JC stressful and I did badly for A‚Äôlevels, couldn‚Äôt enter any local uni courses based on my grades (B,C,D) Luckily I got a B for literature and my JC teacher helped me with a recommendation letter to NTU where I managed to major in literature! I worked as a teacher to support my expenses for Uni, had some help from grandparents for Uni fees, helped my mum with her divorce, and eventually she managed to apply for a BTO so we are no longer homeless.\n\nCurrently, I‚Äôve been working for 5 years in the digital marketing space. It hasn‚Äôt always been easy but I‚Äôve found my niche and have had to forced myself to adapt (I‚Äôm bad at math but I work with data and analytics now). I also managed to land myself a job overseas and was based there until...COVID-19 happened and I was taking a holiday in singapore and am now stuck here while working remotely for my employer based overseas. I‚Äôm living out of a suitcase, and have uncertainty about my employment. For years, my goal has always been to migrate out of Singapore with my partner as it‚Äôs not LGBTQ-friendly so I was working really hard towards that (making calculated career choices and saving hard to migrate). With COVID-19, my overseas residency application is in jeopardy so it‚Äôs been a shitty time but I still have my job and I think I‚Äôm in a privileged position compared to many others.\n\nI‚Äôm just taking each day as it comes, and still looking to upskill because I want to stay relevant & competitive. It‚Äôs not always easy cause sometimes your circumstances don‚Äôt permit you to just take a course on the side but I definitely would encourage everyone to at least try. Digital marketing, coding, and data analyst skills are very employable skills with Low barriers to entry! \n\nI haven‚Äôt seen a therapist but the Internet is amazing and I‚Äôve found support in other positive ways (Parks and rec, the office) and have learnt to be honest with myself about my feelings and thoughts in order to process things better. I definitely think that a proper therapist during my growing years would have helped but oh well, still not too late! \n\nAs Captain holt from Brooklyn 99 once said, ‚ÄúLife is unpredictable.

Not all of them include a professional too! But it depends on your situation and, in short, how long you've been suppressing your feelings etc.\n\nFirst, I recommend you either verbalize your feelings, or write them down. That too in coherent sentences. When you put your feelings into words, you realise how your situation may not be as bad as you initially thought. We humans normally magnify our problems and think the worst situation possible through everything. Once you put it into words, often times you'll see how skewed your thoughts would have been before.\n\nNext, I'd suggest you could try to talk to someone about your situation. It doesn't need to be someone that'll give you solutions to every problem, we often just need someone to listen to us. This could be one of those online helplines where you don't know the people you're talking to so it's more anonymous and you won't feel pressured to put on a front for them. But I should tell you first that this isn't a long term solution. Once you feel comfortable talking about your situation and you reach a situation where you just need help, it might be time to see a psychologist or professional. \n\nThe simplest solution I have is for you to talk to your parents or close family in general. Family, above all, will look to act for your betterment. Therefore however your situation might be, if you're able to put it into words and tell your family and ask them for help, it can only get better from there. This does not discount the fact that they might not see eye to eye with your choices and decisions, they might be angry initially. But they will help. \n\nA word of caution though. If at any point you feel like you might end your life, or something along those lines, please do seek professional help. Once it gets to that point, getting help from a professional will make the process easier for you, because they will guide you through your recovery. \n\nThese are just some ways that you can reach out.

W_2001,ksjad2,[A LEVELS] Advice for J2,2021-01-08 02:27:52,SGExams,77673,13,204,"Hi, so you might know me from the O levels result release post and I feel like talking about this today because some of my friends suffered during this period. So a bit of background, I was from YIJC and graduated in 2019 with double cca, took PCMe.

Term 1-2:

* Focused on events(orientation, SYF, A divs, event planning, etc), may see grades fall which is normal, esp since H2 Math ahs vectors, H2 Chem has org chem and transition elements and H2 econs has gloabalisation and macro econs. Here is some advice I would give:

1. Buy a planner for time management and write down hw due dates, events and goals you can set on the planner. Try not to make it too rigid and adjust accordingly to changes.(e.g in case got wedding, hospital etc.) 

2. Revise J1 topics as early as you can. For GP, start memorising content ans examples. Try to take about 1h to look thru J1 topics.(For now, I guess maybe just looking thru the notes and relooking at corrections and tys, maybe even additional qns too, mostly for H2 physics and Chem in YIJC). Oh and btw, yes, it is normal to start doing Math Yearly TYS at Term 2 since most would have finished 90% of syllabus by then.

3. Start reading J2 topics before lecture. It could be on the way to school too. And even if your lecture sucks, pls dont skip lecture. Rather, do your tutorials while the lecture is going on. And do ask your tutor for any doubts durig tutorials. Always do hw.

4. CCA is important so please don't skip them unless you are sick or any valid reason. Plus they can be good for portfolio(scholarships, competitive courses and jobs) Never miss out. For events like CNY and CCA farewell, pls try not to lose out on them, especially if they involve bonding as it is your last year in JC before studying hard core for A levels. And also please never use CCA as an excuse for those doing coursework e.g. H2 Art, Music and China Studies.

5. Be healthy and exercise. For those dieting for A divs, please at least eat a light meal in school. And do try to exercise, especially for the guys who are going to do IPPT. And if you want to, go for flu vaccinations especially sicne you need to study across flu season as well.

6. Please spend June holidays wisely. I have seen people using June holidays as if it was a time to party and play Mario Kart. But be aware that you have 4 to 5 mnths at this pt for A levels in Oct and Nov.

7. PLEASE pay attention to practicals as this is the only chance that you will be using the lab. Pay attention to what to write and how to do things.

Term 3-4:

*At this point, whatever you do during this limited time will affect your A levels. No CCA but you may be called back to do CCA stuff sometimes, especially those with Exco positions. Social life may be affected and reduced but there are other who will COMPLETELY ignore the situation. 

1. For those studying at home, find a conducive space to study. It can be outside the corridors or downstairs. Please NEVER study on bed as you may be more inclined to sleep when studying. If you feel like the house is super noisy, try using earphones or earplugs if it works. Else, maybe a sleepover at someone's house may work. 

2. Addicted gamers may be affected so please do not attempt to download any NEW games.(There was a time when Mario Kart came out on Sept which was prelim period. At that time it made me realised how addicted I was.) If need to, uninstall the phone. But promise me when ai say this. NEVER NOT USE YOUR PHONE. Teachers are becoming more inclined to use technology to make things easier, especially for homework and communications so please NEVER remove your phone or at least use a seperate phone for studying purposes.

3. Should I bring an Ipad or laptop to school? Not necessarily. You can print documents out. If you are reading notes from there, it is ok. But do try to find a way to print them out to prevent anyone from losing any devices. (Again, I said not necessary but you can still bring them if you are doing hw from there and if you feel that you study effectively from there.)

4. REDUCE but NOT ELIMINATE social life. If your CCA is doing something like alumni stuff AND you can still handle studies(maybe a B), then do it. Do try to meet friends once every 2 weeks and if possible, you can make study groups(unless they disturb you a lot then nvm.) And do note that with graduation, please do not ignore this occasion as this would be your last chance to be with the people you love.

5. At Term 3 and 4, I have to warn you that you should be doing practice papers at this time. And not just DO practice papers, but also under TIMED condition. Try to set a day called ""Study notes day"" where you scan through the notes and recall from your notes to see which topics are you still horrible at. In my JC, they do give timetrials after term 4 so do try to attempt timetrials given by the JC. Also do try to study/read up your notes first before attempting the paper. And at this point, do your yearly TYS or prelim papers.

6. In terms of school,(may or may not work) if you want to adjust the timetable, try to.(Idk how to explain this but I use my experience. So during Chem class, we asked the teacher whether we could bring our chem slot(arnd 2-3pm) to lunch period(10-11am). With agreement especially from the Muslim guys in our class, our class ended on 12.30 on fridays instead of 3pm.(MAY OR MAY NOT WORK). Also for consultations, do book them IN ADVANCE and PREPARE for the consultations as tutors still have the authority to decline a consultation if you do not prepare anything. If you dont know what to prep, create qns that you can ask the tutor.(Why am I not allowed to say ""XXX""? Can I write it in another way? I don't udnerstand why I cannot say ""XXX"", Is my working wrong? So far I know how to do this working but I dont know where to continue on from there. Am I allowed to use this format? etc). If you feel that you think ""your tutor is useless""(not saying they are), my opinion is just try out first. And if that still does not work, try consulting another tutor and consult with a friend under that tutor. It can be useful. If not, try asking a ""smart"" friend for help as well.

7. Do try to study for practical for H2 Science students as they contribute 20% of the score.

8. Find out what is your study method. Do not insult other people methods of studying as not everyone has the same studying style and environment. 

Few days before A levels:

1. At this point this is where I recommend compiling your corrections as you can reread the corrections again and understand what went wrong. Please do not attempt too much prelim papers without marking. 

2. Eat healthily, to prevent yourself from an upset stomach. Exercise but dont overexercise, to prevent strains or cramps or dislocation from affecting you.

3. Figure out what topics you are missing or weak at and cover the gaps. Read through your notes again(There was one time I reread my Physics notes in which I realised a topic that I did not study (Momentum of Photon calculation.) Luckily studied it and it came out during physics application question about gravitational holes lol. 

4. Identify which resources are missing that your require. French curve? Ruler? Graphing calculator? E dictionary? Most important, do try to print out your entry proof(NOT THE RECEIPT) as this can help you be able to find the stuff you need(unless you rather buy a $1 copy from GO). Most importantly ensure that you have entry proof, NRIC and FILLED PENS(looking at you humanities papers and GP.)

5. Know when your papers occur and for those having scholarships, check out whether APPLICATION DUE DATE occurs before end of A levels.(SUTD early admission.)

During A levels:

1. Come to school early and know your exam venue. At least an hour. Dry and calm yourself. Please do not dye your hair. And turn mobile to silent. Ensure all pockets(esp jacket) do not contain any information relevant to exam. Tissues are fine. Do bring a jacket due to air con. And most importanly, listen to the instructions of the invigilator. 

2. In any case that something makes you uncomfortable or fearful (e.g. calculator spoil, nose bleed, water spillage.) Do inform the invigilator as immediately as possible. They are there to at least ensure things are fair. Don't be nervous when asking for fulscap immediately.

3. Never give up. I have seen a student sleep during exam before he gave up on H2 Math. That should not mean you should give up. EVEN IF you screwed up a previous relevant paper, it could be a minor mistake which makes you lose a few marks. Esp for GP for essay  and Math which require working. Never lose because of a mistake you made. 

4. Eat something that does not cause gastric pains in stomach. I recommend water and a sandwich or at least something for morning papers.

That is all I have to say about A levels for J2s. I wish you all the best and hope that covid does not affect how you study.

I‚Äôm not sure if this is the best place to ask but I‚Äôm getting desperate after spending close to $100 on ghee after multiple unsatisfactory or failed recipes. 

I was wondering if anyone has a good sugee/suji cookie recipe to share? I‚Äôve been trying since CNY to recreate the sugee cookies that are sold at NTUC during the festive period(attached below). 

I tried all the recipes on Google, but they somehow all turn out very bland/dry/tasteless?

I don't remember the name but the channel ONLY shows a gameplay that seems to be a multiplayer mode. No commentary, no ads, nothing. All they show is a gameplay. 

As far as i can remember, the gameplay shows a map of parking lot and stadium. Sadly, I don't remember what they actually played on stadium but i do remember the parking lot. It shows a team of red and blue fighting with a bumper cars. The more points they got, the higher chances of winning. 

My memory is vivid but that's all i can remember. I am 100% sure it was on Starhub because i never own a phone at the time until 2009 but even then, i rarely use it and it was a dumbphone as well.

poppraline,hwl2do,My dad has been self-radicalising every night with extreme pro-China/anti-non-China propaganda videos. Anyone experienced similar behaviour? What should I do?,2020-07-24 02:27:50,singapore,378757,398,865,"I write this from a point of fear and exasperation. My life at home revolves around avoiding and fearing my dad. But in the last year or so he has gained a new habit that scares and triggers me. 

Every night (and every morning + afternoon since WFH started), he plays a series of videos about China. They are usually either videos with robot voices, or videos with a human talking angrily. (Added: Most videos are in Mandarin, and some are in American English.)

The views and content I've heard from these videos include: 
- China is a lion, that is only sleeping right now
- The islands in the South China sea are China's, because China got them first in a past dynasty. All other countries opposing China are flawed, barbaric, have violent histories, etc. and they should be ashamed; or they used to be under the barbaric rule of the west, and so should side with China instead 
- Back when the Hong Kong courts overturned the mask ban last year, one video said about the judges involved: ""Foreigners are not Chinese, they don't have Chinese blood, that's why they don't care about China""
- If I don't pay attention, all I hear is ‰∏≠ÂõΩÁöÑ (China's) and ÁæéÂõΩÁöÑ (America's) on loop

All this began when our Chinese TV channels started showing mainly shows from China, and removed most shows from Taiwan. He got interested in watching those shows online, and got steadily into angrier-sounding videos via recommendations. Now every day and night I'm bombarded with anti-US videos with strident robotic voices, and my dad has been making increasingly extreme and hostile comments, like: 
- Spouting conspiracy theories about SARS and COVID being a western weapon targeting Asian races/genes and leaving non-Asian races unaffected. He could not believe it when the first Germans were reported to have contracted COVID. (Edits for clarification)
- Using ""angmoh"" as an actual slur against any European/Australian/American white people
- Gloating that more angmohs are dying from COVID, meaning they are inferior to the Chinese
- Joking about invading the US because they seem weak right now  


My mum is gradually being influenced too (she also gloated about the COVID deaths). I'm a major pacifist so all this makes me struggle to live peacefully at home. 

I think that this behaviour is self-radicalisation, no less harmful than the kind promoting ISIS/terrorism that got people in trouble with ISA. Has anyone else observed those around them getting similarly radicalised? And does anyone know what I can do about it? I have been frantically searching for a suitable de-radicalisation video/article to drop into the family group chat, but most content I find discussing biased or rage-inducing media is US/UK-centric. Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

Note: In case it's not obvious, I am neither pro- nor anti- China.  

Second note: Can y'all not downvote comments unless they're really irrelevant? I'm not looking for an echo chamber. I'm willing to hear the other side as long as they're not ads or trolls.

Third note, 2 days later: To give context on why I am troubled by this, here are three reasons. 
>1. My safety: Peace in my family depends on my dad's moods. Between periods of calm, he can have unpredictable outbursts of anger, violence and insults, and I am usually his main target. These videos are making him angrier, and reducing my space of ""safe"" actions and opinions I can express. I don't currently have an acceptable excuse to move out that definitely won't trigger some backlash.
>2. Social impact: My dad has turned a lot more racist since starting this habit, and is influencing my mum. I've also been reading that others have seen their family members get addicted to such videos, forgoing other activities. 
>3. Possible future consequences: Is there a risk that some like my dad may act further on their beliefs, possibly ending up like [Dickson Yeo](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hxeqe4/how_a_singaporean_man_went_from_nus_phd_student/)?  


...............


Edit: Adding more anecdotes as I remember them. Plus more context in response to the comments here: 
- My dad is tech-savvy (tech career). His devices are controlled by him.  
- He's English-educated, but didn't have much education in the humanities and critical thinking.  
- He was pro-Trump not long ago. And I think my parents occasionally watch Dr Oz
- My dad has been to China a few times with my mum in the past year, to see scenic mountains.
- I think some of the videos are from Whatsapp as well

What I'm trying:
- My preferred way to take action is non-confrontational, so I'd be most grateful for any links I can drop into my family group chat! Like [this one](https://www.chinafile.com/conversation/our-daily-media-consumption-completely-different)
- I have read about [deep canvassing](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/29/21065620/broockman-kalla-deep-canvassing) as a good method to reduce prejudice, and am trying out the ideas (non-judgmental listening, sharing more personal stories, nudging towards reflection)

One day later: 

Thank you everyone for your comments, suggestions and stories! I've learnt some new things here and will continue reading through all of these. 

I've concluded sadly that my observation is not uncommon, and also not the most extreme. I see that others are also struggling with inter-generational conflict. I might find time later to compile a list of good resources and ideas here.",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hwl2do/my_dad_has_been_selfradicalising_every_night_with/,"['My dad has also been watching those videos at top volume at night with the generated robot voices. I suppose they share them in their whatsapp group so there‚Äôs a bunch of old Singaporeans watching them? But my parents are all bark no bite, so..', 'This kind of shit very hard to handle.\n\nEspecially considering that your dad probably follow Confucius teachings, I assume. So you literally cannot say anything to him because it goes against one part of Confucius teachings.\n\nThe only solution is to inform his peers like his siblings or friends and hope they help.\n\nIf they all kena radicalized then ho seh liao. Might have to go the hard way using arguments and shouting liao.', 'I have noticed more of such videos played by my mum, especially after Covid-19. I think some people are too free and are mass generating such content D: Although the content she receives does not contain as extreme of a content you have listed, but nonetheless with robotic voice-overs and sometimes odd & very loud music.\n\nMaybe it is still early days for my mother, but I think my mum has always been a very rational person. I told her point blank that such videos are fake news, and show her actual information, facts & reasons when I have time to source for them. If I am busy, I will at least quickly give her all the reasons I can recall off the top of my head, and follow up later if necessary.\n\nAfter some time, she start to realize who are the people in her chat groups that tend to forward ~~rubbish~~ nonsensical content and I think she is starting to ignore them.', 'My dad is a polar opposite. He is brainwashed by American right wing media, and he praises Trump, hates on China and believes most liberal politicians around the world are secretly pedophiles.', 'Don\'t bother arguing with him, he probably thinks you\'re brainwashed by america and won\'t listen to whatever you say\n\n\n\n\nYou should treat it as if he\'s in a cult - you cannot force him to leave, he has to be the one that makes that decision. \n\n\n\nThere\'s 2 things you can do:\n\n* Stop him from being radicalised any further\n\n* Reverse whatever indoctrination your dad has already\n\nFirst ones kind of easy, try to block him from accessing these videos. Like others say, just clear his watch history. Secretly remove him from those pro china groups. Shouldn\'t be hard if he isn\'t tech savvy \n\n\n\n\nThe second one is much harder. You can try to ask questions genuinely, not sarcastically, about these kind of news. Confirm will have some kind of hole. Just be a sincere person that found something he doesn\'t understand about the news. Like maybe for the corona virus being a USA weapon, just ask something like ""didn\'t they get hit by the virus too?"" or like ""other countries got hit too, how come they didn\'t say anything and attack USA?"". Just be sincere when you ask. It\'s not gonna work the first 10 times, but the trust will slowly erode away. Even die hard fans will realise their reasoning sounds bullshit. Whatever you do, don\'t argue with him or call him stupid. That\'s never gonna work and he will just dig his heels in deeper each time you do that. At some point, you can start sharing anti chinese propaganda videos by a non-american source without him dismissing it completely. \n\n\n\nHonestly though you\'re probably screwed. From personal experience in army, its fucking impossible LOL. Especially if they are less educated and lack critical thinking skills. They basically see you as a naive youngster that doesn\'t know the true cruel nature of the world. Good luck though', ""My father is very pro-China and anti-Western. My mother was very anti-PAP but now very pro-PAP. I find that the best thing to do is to discuss all types of current affairs with them and look at the issue from at least 2 sides. For example, I sometimes share links from CNN & Fox News when discussing US. When faced with obvious fake news, I will always call them out for it and provide many other sources to show that it is not true or not proven.\n\nSimply consuming media from a single source will also definitely cause a sharp swing in either direction. What's most important is critical thinking. That needs to be trained and actively reinforced. \n\nUnfortunately, I think many of the comments here are anti-China. The reality is that China has done a lot of good and also a lot of bad. The same applies to every other major power. It's funny that Singaporeans do not realise this as that's pretty much the definition of PAP. The propaganda machine for China and Singapore are government sanctioned whereas in the West, it's done by the media conglomerates. It is hard to find news that isn't actually propaganda nowadays. Only way out is to educate people to read beyond the hidden messages in all news. \n\nGood luck with your parents!"", ""In the old days, people like your father would have been accused of being Communists, sent to Pulau Ubin or put on a slow boat to China. \n\nBut seriously, it's good that you want to deradicalise your father. On the other hand, seeing that he is probably quite elderly, he shouldn't be too much of a problem as far as national security is concerned. Young people getting radicalised is a more worrying problem as they are more likely to turn radicalism into action. I doubt the ISD will start knocking on your door.\n\nAnyway, deradicalistion usually works by appealing to certain emotions of the radical. These can include things like religion, family, culture etc. During the Al Maunah crisis in Malaysia (the one where a bunch of radicals stole weapons from an army camp), the authorities got family members to appeal to the radicals and played Islamic songs and prayers on loudspeakers. \n\nThe British during the Malayan Emergency literally paid people to stop being Communists. \n\nSo it all depends on whether there is something more powerful that can convince your father to change his views. Is he more pro Singapore than pro China? If so, maybe subtle notes of how China's encroachment on the SCS is a threat to SG. Or remind him of cases like the Terrex incident."", 'Same here. Apparently this is quite common among the older gen circle, and intensified by whatsapp sharing. They are already in an echo chamber and sadly has been brainwashed. My best suggestion is to not discuss these topics with him, and instead talk about other non political subjects.

They fight over the most idiotic shit. One thinks US leaked the coronavirus and the other think China Wuhan lab has the virus. One thinks China is fucking amazing with the peace they have while ignoring the CCP atrocities, and the other thinks Trump is doing a good job saving America.

Usually these programmes surfaces on YT right? One way is to log in to YT with an account that you have access to, then you can always remotely clear the watch history/cache so that these videos don‚Äôt get recommended. \n\nThere are videos that report about actual news that happens in mainland China (the devastating floods happening now and such), reported by Taiwan media. My mother somehow managed to watch those and funnily YT recommends nothing but these kinda news channels nowadays. Maybe you can play a few of these and let the algorithm take care of recommending the rest.', ""Does anyone else notice local social media (mainly FB) is flooded with these hardline pro-CCP uncles and aunties with extreme/Chinese nationalistic views on world politics? \n\nLike they're constantly praising China and vilifying the US/Europe. If you bring up any criticism of China, they suddenly become really toxic and resort to nasty ad-hominem or whataboutism to defend their pro-China views. For example, if you bring up the human rights abuses committed by the CCP such as the Uighur oppression in Xinjiang, they either dismiss it as western anti-China propoganda and/or call you a brainwashed 'US lapdog' (the irony lol). Their other commonly used retorts are 'you're just jealous of China's economic success!' or 'don't forget your roots, traitor!' If you're a Chinese that's critical of CCP. It's futile arguing with these folks.\n\nJust take a look at ST/CNA comments section on news articles about China/HK/Taiwan/US and you know what I'm talking about."", 'I don\'t know if this will help you to convince your parents, but one important distinction to make is that China and the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) are two very distinct entities.\n\nChina is country with a history that is over 3000 years old.\n\nThe CCP is a Communist regime that happened to take control of China about 70 years ago. Even if the CCP were to fall from power some day, China as a country and the Chinese people would still continue to exist under a different form of government.\n\nMuch of the criticism that you see levelled against ""China"" today should in fact be attributed to the CCP regime, whether it was the fact that they withheld information on the virus from the international community, or that they are mass detaining Uyghurs in Xinjiang and forcing them into labour camps.\n\nAnd the CCP loves nothing more than for people to conflate China and the CCP, because that lets them galvanise people into thinking that these criticisms are aimed at the Chinese people.', ""Thanks for this post. My dad has been exhibiting such traits in our conversations. As he has always been very patriotic to Singapore and China, I thought it was him alone. Now I feel less alone and have also contacted him to warn him... though he's more likely to be the one trying to brainwash others.\n\nBy the way, i have tried sharing these content in the hope he can see alternative views:\n\n1. Heartwarming acts of kindness in Taiwan \n2. Headlines from HK about SG (i see his zealous patriotism relies on blind faith to a single party, that's why CCP and PAP are very appealing to him)"", ""Some of it is just straight America bashing, which is little bit odd considering some of those programs are Taiwanese. \n\nYou can't help wondering where their funding comes from."", ""Sounds very similar to the way many American parents got filled with hate by watching Fox News.

They voted republican because they believed in their fiscal policies, but they were reasonably open minded on social issues. Slowly they bought into the anti immigrant hate,  the lie that the democrats secretly want to destroy America, and now they think Trump is the savior. They are hard to be around, because they can't stop flinging their outrage around. It was sad to see it happen.\n\nI don't know what the solution is. Nobody does. I guess you could invite your father to watch a nature documentary together, or a tv-series, just to distract his mind with something soothing or relaxing?\n\nBTW, I've also lived in China and Taiwan for many years.

China has Ministry such as Ministry of State Security where they monitor and actively curtail any medium and information that will cause issue to the party leadership. You will never hear them mention any bad news about themselves in their news outlet, there's only good news and neutral news (sugarcoated bad news), otherwise, no news.\n\nIf you observe the kind of harsh actions that they are willing to take against and companies or individuals, you would rethink about what kind of country they are. Just look at Animal Crossing in China, and it's just a game. {TODO: Insert better examples}\n\nRemind him that this is the same country that sent Huang Jing to influence our Foreign Policy.\n\nDuring this stage, your goal is to establish credibility about understanding geopolitics and bolster your image, while also discrediting his source of information, be it china or the channel he follows. This step is very important as when not done well, will reduce the effectiveness of the following steps.\n\n2. Showing alternative viewpoints\n\nTry influencing or watching Foreign news media dealing with the same information that they are watching, show that there's an alternative viewpoint. It should be from the perspective of the third party to the same issue.\n\nFor e.g. \n\nI've observed, that my parents can relate to Taiwanese news and so sometimes they will pickup things along the way about how things are moving with a view possibly biased against china. As mainland media rarely mentions their personal failing, it shows the usefulness of alternative viewpoints. They also need to understand that most, if not all media outlets are biased.\n\nDuring this stage, your goal is to show that there are alternative viewpoints that they should look at, and that they should look at things from a rational and centrist POV when it comes to geopolitics.\n\n3. Remind them of their Identity\n\nRemind them of who they are and the identity that they associate with. As Singaporeans, we should take the stance and POV that are aligned as our Government (Maybe just me being patriotic). Singapore is the Switzerland of Asia and will remain so. The day we stop being neutral might be the day your cai png have to deduct 1 meat. We are too small and too fragile to not have a neutral stance.\n\nExperience: So during this period of time, was when Ho Ching pulled the 'Err...' stunt, and i found that my mom was somehow taking sides with the Taiwanese media, this was when i reminded her that we as Singaporeans, should take the stance and have our own personal interest at heart. The important thing is to rationalize with a slight bias to our personal interest. If we don't look out for our own interest, who will ?\n\n4. Providing sources of Information\n\nAt this point of time, they should be a lot less staunch on their viewpoint and is more likely to take in new sources of information. It's a good time to introduce to them our local think tanks that could provide curated information in a neutral basis. e.g. RSIS and LKYSPP, they hold talks and send mailers on their commentary every now and then. Even Zaobao and Straits Times could be good sources of information (Subjective, but for Foreign Policy i think its still fine).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcluding\n\nI feel that regardless of age, people tend to be complacent when it comes to things like FP where it's easier to just echo the same opinion as what's popular. I think it's important to think and reflect on the various viewpoints and the root cause of issues, rather than take things at face value. If you haven't thought it through, don't say you know.

ISIS aimed to get people to follow them, support them financially, carry out attacks in their names, or move to the Islamic State. The Islamic State was aspiring to be a real and legitimate state, so it wanted inhabitants, skilled workers, and so on (it wanted to have an airforce, for eg). Now these video only aim to influence people\'s perception of China vis-a-vis the anti-China countries. It doesn\'t ask people to do things that are illegal or harmful to their countries in the name of China, for eg. It may influence the domestic politics atmosphere of the ""radicalised""; but even then, it\'s very indirect. Then the logic and geostrategic interests of the elite ruling class usually override the domestic wills.\n\nIt is only harmful in the sense that if the ""radicalised"" start to talk about their ideas very loudly and vocally in the wrong companies and become a social pariah or something, which will not be a problem since the Chinese Singaporean population is quite sympathetic to China, pro-China, and anti-Western views.\n\nSo at the moment, I can see that right now, it\'s just a personal annoyance to you. You can put boundaries: to make them into ""social pariahs"" to *you*. Only by imposing a cost to a behaviour, you can discourage the behaviour. Things like: please don\'t put that on loud speaker, I need to work or something. Or rules that if you start talking about that at the table, I will leave. Be very firm, and they shut up. Then you can also go on the counter-offensive. ""You got so much time on your hands, ma? Go get an essential service job or sth"".\n\nOn the other hand, the ease of radicalisation of a population is also sort of an indication of how unstable people\'s lives are. I particularly like the 1994 essay ""[Why Fascism is the Wave of the Future](https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v16/n07/edward-luttwak/why-fascism-is-the-wave-of-the-future)"" and the book ""[Turbo-Capitalism: Winners and Losers in the Global Economy](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/006093137X/)"" (available with [Singapore National Library](https://catalogue.nlb.gov.sg/cgi-bin/spydus.exe/FULL/WPAC/BIBENQ/80100475/5707909,1)), which quite accurately predicted the mechanism for the disenfranchisement and ease of being radicalised in developed countries.

It is also common in paris to be mugged and there are certainly areas that tourists should absolutely avoid. Valid concern imo.\n\nAlso, i think you should ask for his definition of communism.

Examples include being against illegal immigrants, unfavourable trade deals, contribution to world organisations, being focused on local production and jobs.\n\nOn foreign policies. He is a good check on the rise of china as a dominant global superpower. Relatively more open to discussions, for example, with NK. Relatively less aggressive in foreign wars.\n\nOn culture. Well, good for those that are more aligned to him. In american terms, anyone not on the left.\n\nOverall, i think he's a bad person and lousy politician but acts in the interest of americans.

Not that CNA is very neutral, but Channel 8 is literally more tilted towards China. On the same issue, both channels can actually offer a different viewpoint. Even on translation, channel 8 is increasing leaning towards China ones. For example, Singapore refer to Korean War as Èü©Êàò, but not long ago, during the Korean War armistice anniversary, Channel 8 referred to Korean War as both Èü©Êàò and ÊúùÈ≤úÊàò‰∫âÔºåa term used by PRC more often.

There are concerns that this pro-China thinking might feed into Chinese chauvinism.

This has nothing to do with foreign affairs per-se and everything to do with domestic harmony.\n\nIn fairness, I don't know if anyone in China is specifically trying to undermine Singapore's racial harmony... that might not even be on the radar of Chinese IBs or whoever's cranking out YouTube videos.

WowzLife,kx3ebb,[O Levels] Dear O Level graduates,2021-01-14 18:49:27,SGExams,77673,4,65,"Hey O Level graduates! Congratulations on completing this milestone in your life. I know that it was a difficult period to study in with home-based learning and various measures put in place which affected school life so no matter the outcome of your results, I really think you should give yourself a pat on the back for simply persevering through that entire ordeal. 

Even if you might not believe me right now, trust me when I say that the school you enter, more specifically JC, does not matter in the long run and what is actually of concern is your personal character and drive to improve. 

To those who envy their peers who have performed better, having access to higher-tiered schools with fantastic distinction rates and being upset with yourself for not achieving that standard, please do not beat yourself up over it. Reflect upon your journey and utilise this energy to fuel your drive to better yourself. No matter which school you enter, use the O Level experience as a reminder to start clarifying your doubts earlier or to perhaps curb your gaming addiction. Your educational journey does not simply end here after one major examination and there will always be moments for you to show your growth as a person from this tough experience. 

Furthermore, just because a person had entered a top-tier JC does not completely guarantee his success in the A Levels. Many like to focus on the glitz and glamour from these schools, the majority who excelled during the examinations without realising that there are still individuals that slip through the cracks. 

A close friend of mine did quite well for his O Level examinations and managed to secure a spot in a top-tier JC and I had imagined that his intelligence will allow him to have a smooth time there. However, once lessons began, he became complacent and soon realised that he was falling behind his classmates with each lecture, tutorial and practical. This pace of learning was too fast for him to handle and he was constantly pressured by his peers who were not only keeping afloat, but also thriving whilst he struggled to keep up with his studies alongside his CCA commitments. 

In the end for his A Levels, his inability to stay on track accompanied by the pressure to perform well given his school‚Äôs academic record ultimately caused him to crumble under the pressure. Since the first examination, he was constantly leaving the examination hall feeling dejected, constantly berating himself for making careless mistakes or for not writing things properly. Despite my constant encouragement for him to look past the papers and continue pressing forward, I think that the expectations placed on him had already taken such a major toll that he was not in the right frame of mind during the examinations. Come results day, whilst seemingly everyone else was celebrating their almost perfect Rank Points, he had to face the reality that he had only achieved a score of 72.5. Whilst this might be a good score to some, coming from such a prestigious school, it was a very hard pill for him to swallow.

On the other hand, another personal friend of mine who did not perform up to their expectations, had to enter a mid-tier JC which he had no intention of going beforehand. I remember him being really devastated over his results and felt like the future was very bleak for him. However, once school officially started, he was consistent in his work and soon forgot about his O Level score, focussing instead on doing well for A Levels and sure enough, he did obtain 85 Rank Points and was among the top 10% of his school.

The reason why I decided to share this personal experience I had witnessed first hand is not to criticise my friend for doing poorly, but because I do not want anyone to feel like they are doomed to perform poorly for the rest of their lives and that there is no way they can recover from their situation, that they will only be mediocre at best. 

From this, I hope you realise that a better school does not always guarantee better results and just because you are not from a higher-tiered JC as you did not do as spectacularly for O Levels, it does not guarantee that history will repeat itself. Everyone will be taking that same national examination again during A Levels no matter what JC you come from and thus, there is always an opportunity for you to bounce back and enter the course of your dreams. 

Even for those who are not taking the JC route and are receiving backlash from their family or friends who perceive other educational pathways as less than ideal, do realise that it is only a matter of time before everyone‚Äôs educational journeys go their separate ways and hence the idea about not following the pack should not necessarily be worrisome. No matter which educational institute you end up in, I hope you have the confidence and grit to excel in whichever course you choose as what truly matters is yourself and your own individual effort moving forward from this point onwards. Your level of success would ultimately be determined by your willingness to look past your current grades and the effort you put into improving yourself, be it adopting a more positive attitude towards life or stopping yourself from procrastinating all the time. 

Life is like an examination with countless problems to solve. However, what most people fail to realise is that everyone is given a different question paper. Hence, everyone actually faces different challenges throughout their lifetime and the way to solve them is to not necessarily follow others, but to listen to one‚Äôs own heart and forge one‚Äôs own path. Do not feel pressured to commit to something or go to a school you feel uncomfortable with just because others have told you to go to the very best school your score allows for. Remember that there are a myriad of factors to account for and to always trust your gut. 

If you would like more help with your choice of school and more about school life, I do have a blog about it but I think self-promotion is not allowed on this Reddit page so if you are interested, do PM me about it. I also have not updated it in a long while because of NS being such a hassle but I hope my previous posts would help guide your decision.

donteatbeansprouts,jrl2lr,[Rant] How anxiety led me to my U Grade,2020-11-10 21:38:47,SGExams,77673,24,254,"hello everyone. i know it might be weird to share personal stuff here but I just wanted to share my story. I feel that we should introduce the narratives that different students have and I will share with you the perspective of a student paralyzed by their anxiety.

Firstly, I'm in a JC and I'm here just because I met the cut-off points. I have no family members who have went down the JC route so I came in completely blind. When I first came in, I was relatively motivated, I did my tutorials and paid attention in lessons. However, the moment CB struck, I was completely thrown off. I couldn't pay attention to lessons as I had no laptop/computer so I had to juggle between google/zoom/drive on my 6 year old android phone that overheated after 3 lessons. I would get distracted by the loud construction noises and lose focus on important notes and deadlines. Furthermore, my notes made no sense ! Due to constantly flipping between apps, I would always struggle to keep up with what goes on and I just write whatever I hear. After attempting to be on par with my classmates for weeks, I just got sad and stopped. I tried so hard to do well online but it was demanding. I started to come to online lessons late, skip lessons to take naps and just eat while my tutors talk. I just gave up, it was too exhausting. That shitty attitude was brought forward when CB ended. I came to school and just existed, living life carefree and moving with the flow.

***Here's when it goes extremely downhill.***

Late July, I started getting addicted to caffeine. Every time I drank coffee, ate chocolate, my heart would race like mad, I could feel it against my chest and I would lose focus so badly. It was such a insane experience but I couldn't stop. One day, after drinking two cups of coffee, I temporarily passed out in the toilet. No one was with me then, and luckily it was during break. Disappeared for 30minutes and came back to my friends and said I had a stomachache. It fueled my anxiety. As previously mentioned, my attitude became shit, and I just didn't do my tutorials anymore. Till today I have 30 pending assignments on google classroom and I am not proud of them.

When I came back home, I shut myself away in my room and just cried and smacked my head against the wall. I didn't do it too violently but it was repetitive. I don't know what happened but I just couldn't do work anymore. In August, we had a Maths test, and our tutor was so insanely kind and told me I should try and I did. I went back home, took out my GC and notes and then vomited. I couldn't even look at my schoolwork anymore. Every time I came across Maths especially I would get nauseous. I started to cry in my sleep and would wake up with crusty eyes.

Everyday, I came to school and just existed, put a smile on my face, make everyone laugh, but deep down I truly just wanted help. I have two leadership roles (one of them being a scholarship) and I feel so disgusted every time because I am supposed to be their role model, but look at me. Disgusting. I couldn't ask help from my tutors because I felt guilty and ashamed for not doing their tutorials. My class is full of smart muggers with rbf so I restrained myself from asking for help, cause why would they help and pity a poor peasant like myself.

Everything finally came together near promos, I vomited, cried and had anxiety attacks everyday, I felt like a zombie, coming to school with foundation and eyedrops to cover the dread beneath my eyes. But, I knew that no one is here to help and I could only rely on myself so I brought plastic bags into my room and just dry vomited whatever and forced myself to retry my assignments and do some questions, read some notes and just do it. I only had a week left but I just tried. **Here are my promo results.**

**H2 - U/ E/ D H1 - U GP - D**

I got 2 inevitable U grades. I'm probably capable of promoting but honestly, I don't want to.

I know this has been long but I just wanted to say that I think I did ok for my promos, seeing what I've been going through, I think this is ok. I just wanted to share it here because I know no one around me would understand why I'm actually glad with what I got.

I hate being anxious, I hate that feeling and I hate that I allowed it to paralyze me so badly. I want to retry, I want to give this route another go and I want to retain to do it.

So my dear friends, please be sympathetic to the people around you. Legitamately, you have no idea what someone might be going through. Anxiety can really pull you down. I know you shouldn't blame your failures on mental health but for me it definitely was a fundamental reason for the way I acted. I'm trying to change and build better coping mechanisms so here's to that lol. Hope you have a good week ahead and thank you for reading this far, absolute poggers.

*^(p.s. since im here, can anyone recommend cheap h1 maths/h2 history tuition/advice. i have to pay using the money i saved up lol so im tryna get it as at low a price as possible ahhhh)*

**edit :** a lot of different perspectives coming in and im currently gathering info and hearing all of your experiences and legit thank u for that,, i didnt really expect to get so much responses but everyone's words of encouragement really made me feel assured and willing to try harder ! i also realized that when I typed this, it was relatively myopic and i guess thats the consequence of not talking to anyone about it. so thank u for your views, it really helped me to see beyond my tunnel vision. i hope yall have a good day !!!",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jrl2lr/rant_how_anxiety_led_me_to_my_u_grade/,"['Hi I‚Äôm JC2 and currently taking my A Levels.

The issues you face because of how you feel are definitely valid, and I‚Äôm really proud of you for fighting through it even when it seems like it‚Äôll never end.\n\nSometimes it feels like you can‚Äôt talk to anyone, some won‚Äôt fully understand, and I can relate to the guilt of not doing assignments for like months making me unable to face my teachers.

So take pride and motivation in that, because it‚Äôs a symbol of your determination to get through this and get better.\n\nSome people see retaining as a failure but it‚Äôs really not like that at all. Making the decision to retain is one in which you recognise that life is not always about speeding ahead, and instead considering what‚Äôs best for yourself. I do think that giving yourself another year will give you time to focus on your mental health without the added stress of national exams.\n\nAll the best I‚Äôm rooting for you!', 'Hey. Thank you for being so strong. Strong enough to post this and spread awareness about anxiety and the struggles we go through it whether it be at school or at work.

Look at yourself, being proud for the milestones you‚Äôve achieved. As long as it‚Äôs enough for you, it‚Äôs more than enough. Keep fighting. \n\nOn a side note for me, some things that really helped cope with my anxiety during that period was to tell actual say our positive affirmations. Something like ‚Äúpeople can speak of their opinions unnecessarily, I should not let them get to me. I should shut them off and keep the goal still in my mind‚Äù was something that kept me going.

Is it necessary tasks that require your attention, or are you watching stimulants to entertain yourself such as Instagram feeds, memes etc? 

Also do you see this as a problem or an addiction? I talked to someone and they actually seem quite disturbed by it as they recognized it as an addiction. Even confessing that she brings it to the toilet to browse and wondering about the solution to it.

I heard in JC u have to write your own notes. Does anyone have any idea how to write your own notes effectively and not time consuming? What else do I need to do if I want to do well in JC?

shersucks,k08fio,[Rant] need some life advice,2020-11-25 00:39:20,SGExams,77673,16,9,"Hello, I'm a sec 3 student, taking n levels next year. Firstly, I'm actually trying to study during the holidays but honestly it's really difficult to constantly study for about 5h (plus small breaks) a day on weekdays (I take breaks on weekends btw) plus I'm studying outside because I just cannot get my work done at home (I mean I did try that but I only studied like a few minutes or at most an hour which indeed sucks)

Secondly, my procrastination and laziness. Honestly I really hate that I'm not doing what I'm supposed to do. Even though I told myself mentally that I will go to study outside on weekdays, I ended up going only 2 or 3 days in that 5 days. Honestly I don't want to study, I just want to watch my shows and games but I don't have a choice since I'm forcing myself to study. 
My fte aggregate score is 19, which honestly I hate and regret not revising during pre exam periods. I'm actually aiming to go for pfp which needs to be 12 or 11 points below (excluding leadership and cca points) I don't even know whether I can even score since my humanities are seriously horrible, my course work is in a mess, despite doing quite alright at emath (it's becuz the paper was quite easy) I know I'll failed badly, English was so so but just somehow cannot get a B for some reasons. I'm not that really worried for my MTL since it's doing okay, I'm just trying my best to get at least B3 & if better A1/2

At this point, I really want to give up, I hate my brain from being stupid, I hate how every one can study productively but not me, I hate how I cannot control myself from my addiction to my phone (if I will to delete those games and social media or like entertainment apps, I don't think I can survive), I just really hate myself. No friends are even helping me at this point, my mom doesn't want me to go outside studying and I just cannot lah...

Lastly, I have a lots of things on my mind but just somehow cannot let it out here in this post. But those are my main concerns and stress. 
*FYI I did seek for teachers and counselors in school during the second half of the year, it did help me but I just cannot rely on them too much.
Anyway thanks for reading this post. I know it's all over the place since I cannot organise anything haha. 
Plus pardon my grammar and spelling all those stuff, my English not so good (not that good in chinese too hahaha) 
It will be great if you can give some advices for me and I hope everyone is doing alright! Stay safe yall!",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/k08fio/rant_need_some_life_advice/,"['Hello, ive been in your place before and sorry to burst your bubble though 11-12 points will make you eligible for PFP the courses available may not cater to your interest. Thats my first point\n\nNext is that having the thought that dramas and shows are above academics is the wrong mentality. Yes, watching dramas is fine and no one is stopping you, i did the same, but do it in moderation, because at the end of the day, dramas wont be the one helping you through your exam questions.\n\nYour mother barring you from leaving the house isnt a punishment etc, it was in a bid to have you to revise and study, since locking up at home basically screens you from things like playing around when youre outside, basically you may get distracted a whole lot easier when youre out. I personally did the same to myself and soon felt its definitely a much appropriate learning environment.\n\nThinking that you have a ""stupid brain"" is just demoralising, youre restricting yourself to basically be more accepting to mistakes, get rid of that mindset and im sure things will fall into place, you have sources like your teachers, even if your peers refuses to help you. I believe at least a few teachers out of your schools teaching commitee will help, just whether or not you want to seek help with certain chapters.\n\nProcrastination is fairly easy to overcome, just requires a tad bit discipline and a little mind games with yourself.. just tell yourself ""im doing this chapter for a moment"", then when you feel lazy, tell yourself ""one more question"" just basically the grit to push through..\n\nAs much as this thread appears to be condemning your actions etc, its really just about how you are willing to change your perspective of studies and mentality. Its not easy, but just push through and discipline will set in. Trust me. All the best...', 'Hi OP, \n*probably the 1st step to mitigating the problem of procrastination would be identifying the reason.*Even thought easier said than done. Our bad habits can be changed by changing our reaction to the triggers of the Problem, such as seeking for instant gratification from use of the internet and our electronic devices. \n\n***Then about the part of unable to reach your study goals.***\n*U may wish to consider these ;*\n*1) what time are u most productive? Use this time to study the subjects that is hardest to u.* \n\n*2) the goals u set to achieve for the day. Maybe it might be blogged down with lots of goals but unrealistic. The inability to achieves the objectives by the end of day certainly demotivate ppl.* So maybe can consider focusing on a few aspects or specific subjects for a day. Space your revision of a difficult or content heavy subjects over a few days to make it more manageable. \n*A framework I suggest for goal setting would be SMART goals. S: Specific ,M:manageable, A:achievable/attainable  , R: realistic , T: time bound.*\n\n*3) use of applications or methods to reduce distractions,* I am an avid forest user, used it since Sec 1 , it has helped in boosting my productivity. And helped me conquered my internal and national exams especially during the strenuous preparation period. So u can try this or distraction blocking apps.\n*Internally , put aside Some self-limiting thoughts or negative self talk and focus in the present.*Never underestimate the small sessions , be it 5 minutes or more, Less than an hour. This sessions will accumulate to a better understanding of the subject or skill. \n\nPersonally, I am more of a goal-oriented person so it helps. But the key is building a system that enables u to achieve your study goals yet not compromising on your well being . Certain compromises have to be done to attain your goals. As Long as u are committed \n\nLastly, review your studying methods, if possible can identify the method that works best for u, allow u to reap more understanding from the subject matter given the limited concentration time span u have. Active studying rather than passive studying even though some memorisation is inevitable.\n\n*Final words: performance during internal exams does not determine your actual performance during the national exam. In fact, I have seen lots of people experiencing a large leap from their internal exams to the actual national exam. So keep grinding till the end! Life is indeed full of uncertainties , the best thing to do is to control what u can and let nature take its course*\n\nJiayous, all the best for your endeavours! May your hard work pay off!', 'So imma try help you out, I was a N level students and I just finish my Os(waiting for results)\n\nSo I do have a problem with procrastination like you too, I did manage to tackle it but not completely I mean being completely honest with you, it impossible(maybe) for a 15-16 year old to not use social media at all. Therefore I suggest that you don‚Äôt take breaks AT ALL, I say study until you cnnt tahan or you don‚Äôt want to anymore, because your breaks will slowly extend from 5 minutes>30>1 hour or maybe you won‚Äôt study at all lol.\n\nSecond of all assuming your studying at the start of year, that kinda a lot and the preparation is definitely enough to get at least B+ even with procrastination. Therefore I am assuming that your just doing without really any real understanding or you lack help.

I wouldn‚Äôt mind helping you with SS/History/F&N since I am quite strong in those(excluding Os F&N written)\n\nI can‚Äôt help you with your main problems, but just atb.(same for English, from B3-B4 NA jump to borderline pass Os) btw you can choose to drop a subject, it doesn‚Äôt rlly matter I dropped Chinese bc I legit can‚Äôt write shit. You can choose to completely ignore one subject but you have to be really strong in the rest and have a consistent pass with min B4 or B3.\n\nFYI Side Note \n\nNs aren‚Äôt hard and they mark quite lenient.

Are you crazy?\n\nOn a more serious note, 5h a day is not for everyone.\n\nI used to think that it was something i should aim for, until I realized that my personal limit was 4 intense ('the zone') hours a day, sustained over at most 1 month. After that, I will just simply crash.\n\nEveryone has a personal rhythm. This is not only about how long you study, but how quickly you can enter into 'the zone' where you are most productive. I can handle about 4 hours of intense work, but to get into 'the zone' usually requires 2 hours of 'lighter', less focused work. It gets better towards the exam / essay deadline, but it is hell in the beginning.\n\nOn the other hand, I have that ONE friend who can only do his best when under intense panic. (i.e. their last minute work (e.g. Uni essays) is strangely better than their work done in advance - he felt it was strange, so he kept experimenting, only to find that he keeps getting better grades when he submits work done under intense pressure)\n\nBut such people are EXTREMELY RARE. I think of the hundreds of people i came across, only 1 person fits the bill.\n\nThe point here is not to encourage reckless last minute work.\n\nThe point is that you need to find your own rhythm, and stick to it. Following the rhythm of other people and what works for them might not be the best thing for you. Find it, and stick to it, no matter what others say.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSecondly, pay attention in class. Full attention. That is actually worth about 2-3 hours of extra study time a day, IMO.\n\nFinally, write down every question you have IMMEDIATELY and clarify it ASAP. Do what it takes to do that - whatsapp your teacher at the end of every day if necessary. Or ask your teacher directly in class. \n\nIf you don't write it down - you can forget.

llalala123,ipc41u,[Rant] family rs worsening :(,2020-09-09 16:29:42,SGExams,77673,54,239,"hello :) i'm quite active here as in commenting on posts and helping others but i've never posted here. i've come to the conclusion that i can't take it anymore and i needa vent sldjslskd

some background info : i'm a j1 and what does that mean? yes, promos are coming soon weeee i'm not exactly doing very well (ESC/EE for mycts LOL) but i've been trying my very best.

one problem.

my brother (9y/o) has probably the loudest voice on earth and omg i really have no idea how i'm still tolerating it. i'm generally not easily pissed off but ohmygod. and its not like i didn't ask him to lower his volume. but whenever i do he will ""oh so i cannot talk ah ok lor"" and like give me some whiny attitude (tbh r00d but sure)

what about my parents? my mother is heavily addicted to a mobile game and never listens to me. always throwing stuff that she has to do (as a mother) to me. i'm not trying to be a spoilt brat but she literally put her games over us. i used to be super close to my mum and she would know all the friends i have because i always talk to her about them. now i don't even want to waste my energy bc my one sentence has to be repeated more than 3 times as she's not listening. sometimes i'll talk halfway, realise she's not listening and not even bother continuing what i want to say and she doesn't even realise i was trying to talk to her. 

my father? he's aight and im closer to him now because he's the only one that actually cares about what i want to say but he's working almost everyday and i rarely see him.

because of all this, i can't focus that well bc i'm always frustrated and can't rant to anyone about the stress i have in school. yes i have friends but i always thought family comes first so i always relied on them. since the rs between my mum and i is deteriorating, i lack the motivation to even study anymore but i really wanna try and make the most out of my jc life (i didn't want to go jc but got persuaded to by none other than my mother ://)

Academically, JC1 is a tough year as you are being introduced to alot of new concepts and content for the first time, so dont be too alarmed if your grades are low. Give yourself the benefit of doubt and know that you can perform better when you are more familiar with the content yourself in J2. I suggest you journal down new things that you learn weekly or daily, with so many things going on it can help you retain new things that you learn easier. On family side, I may not be able to speak much as im not in your shoes. But speaking from my own experience, as you grow older into your adulthood, you start to see your family differently, things that you didnt see before might become more apparent and critisisable. My advise to you is to take this as a cue to learn to adult or parent yourself, and be a role model/ guide for your brother. As a 9 year old, he may not be seeing the bigger picture like you do. I would also advice you to recognise that changes are happening, not necessarily in a threatening way but in the sense that as time passes we all change abit and become less recognisable from our older selves. Do not take it upon yourself to change others, but rather accommodate to your environment. Try your best to have a clear channel of communication with your family, but also learn to built a support base for yourself that is less dependant on others. Build stronger relationships with your friends too and build up trust. With truly trustworthy friends, there are no problems that you would be afraid to share.

unsavvythoughts,iy1h4k,Any approaches for reducing drug sellers and mules?,2020-09-23 10:11:51,singapore,378757,47,3,"The ongoing topic of the deferred hanging of Syed and one of the comments about coercion and duress got me thinking.

I‚Äôm writing my thoughts here.

I understand that for historical reasons and because bad people exist ( drug kingpins will keep trying to make money), the death penalty exists in Singapore. The drug kingpins and middle men will therefore always seek and identify - and also be approached by - people who would be willing or unwilling sellers and mules. 

Are there enough safety nets in Singapore that would help a person push back on being a customer-facing seller/dealer or a mule?

For those that take up such work because it is ‚Äúeasy money‚Äù - I can think of daunting roadblocks such as:
- think of the people you want to see before you are executed after being caught someday, because you will eventually be caught ( tip off by jealous people, for e.g.)
- build up skills now and you can get honest employment and can also explore doing business.
- being taught the impact of their actions on users ( who themselves need help to understand they should not take drugs in the first place)
- meetings with others already on ‚Äúdeath row‚Äù to get dissuaded ( how to identify those vulnerable)
- other ideas?

For those that take up such work because of coercion or duress:
- what are the things that they can do? (For example: approach police or some NGO)
- safer alternatives to loan sharks ( are there any?)
- how to deal with blackmail ( e.g if their personal pics and videos fall in others‚Äô hands, then how to disclose parents or family and deal with the first wave of anger and ridicule them them).

Have such discussions happened in Singapore?

Are there organisations or ministries that think about and identify and help those who have slipped through support nets?

How would a person who feels helpless know whom to approach and what to tell?

I realise also that reducing the demand for drugs is another approach, but there would be the bored people who need something new. I haven‚Äôt thought that through.

This is all that I‚Äôm capable of thinking of. There are much smarter people than me in this sub and in Singapore. I would like to learn their thoughts. 

Thank you.",0.55,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iy1h4k/any_approaches_for_reducing_drug_sellers_and_mules/,"['The biggest argument against drugs is not just its overall delitibating effect on health, but how addictive it is to the point where you will to go great lengths to procure your next hit. That\'s the main reason why drugs are not as controlled as cigarettes or alcohol\n\nThe people who fall into drug abuse AND subsequently fall into the role of drug mules are primarily the ones who don\'t have the financial means to upkeep their habit. Either that, or the drug mule was already in an unsustainable financial situation (no income, or debt) and saw drug muling as a quick and easy way to resolve their debt issues/ get ""rich"" quick while not doing very much. In both cases, there is no logical weighing of the pros and cons. You can\'t go to the drug dealer and say, hey I only want to mule so-and-so amount so that if I get caught the penalty is lower; you mule whatever amount of whatever drugs you are given. \n\nAs for legalising drugs, ok here\'s my wistfully-educated take on it; we generally live in societies where we are urged to be law-abiding, ""pliant"", and productive citizens. To that end, on a personal and societal level you are urged to continue onto a lifelong climb up to educate, upskill yourself to be valuable to whatever profession you\'re in. Drugs, recreational or hard drugs, erode that ambition and work ethic, both on an individual and societal level. \n\nCigarettes and alcohol also do so, but on a smaller level. But precisely because ciggs and alcohol seem to have a lower immediate impact (cause seemingly not THAT addictive and harmful to health in the short term), people end up developing a ciggs/ alcohol habit. Economically speaking, think of how much a pack a day adds up to; thats how much its taken off your earnings - consumption that is ultimately unproductive and even harmful to health (as compared to spending on anything else). Now take this paragraph; drugs do this on a totally different level because of how satifying and addictive it is. \n\nIt can be argued that consuming recreational drugs might have a positive effect on mental health (stress reduction). But we know for sure that especially for the subset of the working population who may not be inclined to trek that lifelong climb, they just wna have a chill life maybe engage in the SMOKE WEED EVERYDAY subculture, you totally erode whatever remnant of productivity and ambition, they are just going to stay in that certain strata of society as long as they want to.\n\nMagnify that to a whole population, and it is easy to see why Singapore or even Asian countries would be extremely resistant to legalising recreational drugs - it goes against the ""typical"" Asian culture of industriousness and society/ community above self. As opposed to Western cultures where the emphasis is on personal sovereignty, free will, civil rights (therefore less clampdown on recreational drugs cause MUH BODY). \n\nWestern cultures HAVE tried to push back on this, but the political pressures were chiefly religious in nature (we can cite American Prohibition as an example; the overriding force came from religion. A good number of politicians were reluctant to enforce it, going to great lengths to procure large quantities of alcohol themselves, or at least doctors who would issue them medical prescriptions for them to exploit loopholes)\n\nJust my opinion on why this MIGHT be the rationale behind not legalising recreational drugs. The argument of recreational drugs being a slippery slope into hard drugs... ehhh i dun rly buy it in Singapore\'s context but I could see how it might snowball into a huge societal concern in less disciplined societies, especially in countries where theres a urban-rural divide, or cultural enclaves, that eventually turn it into a YOU\'RE JUS DISCRIMINATING/ OPPRESSING us when the hard facts may simply be that that specific society is not as competitive as it could be, if not for stratification followed by decline in economic potential, exacerbated by drug use and the cost of vice that follows.', 'To completely eliminate the harms caused by the drug trade, the simplest solution is to legalise all drugs.\n\nThe drug trade only survives because it\'s illicit. Drug ""kingpins"" would lose all their money and power. Drug users would be free to seek help without fear, and their supply could be produced in a more reliable and safe manner without the risk of deadly contamination.\n\nAll the money wasted on enforcement could be utilised to improve everybody\'s life so drugs aren\'t appealing. (You\'ll rarely meet a user who had a happy and prosperous life before using.)\n\nIt\'s a very unpopular opinion, but I have never heard a good logical argument against it.', 'focus on detecting users and collapse the market by directly managing/providing for their habits', 'there will always be people willing to take risks as their desperate need for money outweighs the risks\n\nand this is not just in the realm of drugs', '[deleted]', 'Poverty is normally the starting point.

But what about the foreigners? We can\'t possibly alleviate poverty at another country right?', ""Further examples we can use to measure the impact on drugs:\n\nMexico being a major drug production facility, simply because there is demand from neighbouring US.

The British government insisted on the principles of\xa0free trade, equal diplomatic recognition among nations, and backed the merchants\' demands.

You can go to 7-eleven right now and buy yourself a bottle of vodka to wipe yourself out for the next 48 hours with no legal repercussions. Most people don't do that, because they have other things to spend their time on. (We laugh at what the Americans tried to do with prohibition. I have a feeling a few generations from now people will wonder what the hell we were thinking.)\n\nAs for higher medical costs, a lot of the harm would be reduced. Illicit substances tend to be higher in purity to maximise value to volume ratios. (Fentanyl on the black market is an excellent example.)

If the concern is the external social costs, wouldn't the reasonable response be to tax/regulate it like all other vices?"", 'nope. conservative governments do not want to legalize drugs because that is political suicide when the majority of their electorate are conservatives. ditto for gay rights etc.', ""One could argue this is a great argument against prohibition.\n\nThe background to the opium war is interesting. Basically the British wanted tea, but China didn't want any of their stuff since, by comparison, it was crap. (Chinese textiles, pottery, etc. were far superior.) The British had some luck with silver, but that quickly ran out.\n\nLuckily the British had a neat little colony producing more tobacco than they could ever consume, so they got the Chinese hooked on smoking. As a result, smoking was outlawed in China, punishable by death. Now the British had to get the Chinese traders hooked on something even more addictive to get them to risk death to trade. Hence, opium.\n\nWe can only wonder how different the world would look if smoking hadn't been outlawed in China."", ""Drug rehab is not suggested by me. There are a lot of articles and people who don't support death penalty say drug traffickers need to renhab. My question therefore is how to rehab drug traffickers.

It makes sense because we want our laws to be sensible and fair, i.e. ban this bad thing means should ban all bad things.\n\nHowever I am pointing out that from a govt perspective there is no incentive to ensure 'equity' in our laws on substances. Also, the prevailing narrative is drugs are way more addictive and destructive than alcohol. \n\nAdditionally I think it is quite impossible to measure potential benefits of legalising/justify potential benefits to the populace, so govt will probably just keep the laws in place."", '>My counter to this is alcohol.

I'm just pointing out the counter-argument that seems most reasonable to me (cos OP asked).\n\nSecondly, the evidence would have to be very strong to be convincing.

However the prevailing narrative is that drugs alter your behaviour and priorities + the addictive nature makes it such that people will just resort to crime to fund their drug habits, so taxes will not encourage responsible use of drugs.\n\nNot saying I agree with this narrative, just saying that is what I understand to be govt's reluctance to legalise drugs."", 'I\'d like to think it\'s less of malicious ""lets get them hooked onto something stronger"" but more of ""what can we sell more of that they\'ll buy"" \n\nAs to why the Daoguang Emperor wanted to ban opium: (Taken from First Opium War Wiki page)\n\nThe Qing imperial court debated whether or how to end the opium trade, but their efforts to curtail opium abuse were complicated by local officials and the Cohong, who profited greatly from the bribes and taxes involved in the narcotics trade.[38] Efforts by Qing officials to curb opium imports through regulations on consumption resulted in an increase in drug smuggling by European and Chinese traders, and corruption was rampant.[43][13] In 1810, the Daoguang Emperor issued an edict concerning the opium crisis, declaring,\n\n    Opium has a harm. Opium is a poison, undermining our good customs and morality. Its use is prohibited by law. Now the commoner, Yang, dares to bring it into the Forbidden City. Indeed, he flouts the law! However, recently the purchasers, eaters, and consumers of opium have become numerous. Deceitful merchants buy and sell it to gain profit. The customs house at the Ch\'ung-wen Gate was originally set up to supervise the collection of imports (it had no responsibility with regard to opium smuggling). If we confine our search for opium to the seaports, we fear the search will not be sufficiently thorough. We should also order the general commandant of the police and police- censors at the five gates to prohibit opium and to search for it at all gates. If they capture any violators, they should immediately punish them and should destroy the opium at once. As to Kwangtung [Guangdong] and Fukien [Fujian], the provinces from which opium comes, we order their viceroys, governors, and superintendents of the maritime customs to conduct a thorough search for opium, and cut off its supply. They should in no ways consider this order a dead letter and allow opium to be smuggled out![44]\n\ntl dr; \n- undermining good customs and morality\n- opportunity for bribery, corruption, especially when everyone wants in on it.\n\nEdit:\nI\'d further like to add on that you\'ve haven\'t read my comment when you said in your final sentence: ""We can only wonder how different the world would look if smoking hadn\'t been outlawed in China."" We have a clear answer. Smoking was NOT outlawed in our reality. There\'s even a term for it. CENTURY OF HUMILIATION. \n\nIf smoking wasn\'t outlawed, the local administrations would become further and further corrupt, weakening the rule of law, and providing a breeding ground for vice and organized crime. Plus beholdened to a foreign power.', 'also, as an aside. maybe you think legalizing drugs would eliminate the economic ills of an illicit trade. but you\'ve completely neglected to consider the devastating effects on a family when a member is suffering from substance abuse. \n\nyou don\'t have to go very far. nicotine addiction is insidious. alcohol abuse exacerbates parental and familial issue. beyond our shores, substance abuse in its several forms takes its toll on the population. Even Vice Media\'s page is called ""Drug Addiction"", not ""Drug Use"" https://www.vice.com/en_us/topic/drug-addiction\n\nYou mentioned in an earlier comment that you think you wouldn\'t be interested in using heroin. But I\'d bet you\'d try, someday. And in your scenario where heroin, or any drugs, are legalized, I\'m quite willing to bet that the certain percentage of youth who experiment with these drugs upon turning legal, and then involuntarily get addicted, and ruin their youth away in a revolving door of usage and rehabs is a substantial percentage. \n\nAnd this substantial percentage of people who we\'ll lose is absolutely not worth the legalizing of drugs just to attempt to cease the illicit profiteering and nurturing of organized crime. We can directly affect and cease this illicit profiteering and nurturing of organized crime in a simpler way; the ultimate threat of capital punishment.', 'i see. but OP question is towards the mules, not the traffickers... the traffickers obv are motivated by $$', '>It makes sense because we want our laws to be sensible and fair\n\nJust to clarify, I\'m not suggesting that drugs should be legalised out of ""fairness"" but more from the point of view that the legislation may be causing more harm than it prevents. (I\'m also not proposing we legalise everything tomorrow. I too have concerns, but it seems strange that this idea is always completely off the table just because it ""feels wrong"".)\n\nThe reason I raise alcohol is because it\'s one of the examples we have where historical attempts to prohibit its consumption were more harmful to society than the problems those laws were trying to solve. It\'s also a drug which can be very detrimental to some, but effective regulation and management has been shown to reduce harm, without the damage full prohibition can cause.\n\nI agree with you though, I don\'t see the laws changing any time soon, and Singapore would never be an early adopter of such a shift. (It would be quite a drastic leap!)', 'Check out Portugal for instance.  The impact can clearly be measured if the political will is there. There is also a clear incentive for government, lower incarceration rates, HIV positive cases, enforcement costs, healthcare spend, the list goes on. \n\n [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug\\_policy\\_of\\_Portugal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drug_policy_of_Portugal)', 'The problem with your argument is that right now weed and heroin are equally illegal. As such a rebellious kid, someone down on their luck or even a successful professional looking for fun might end up trying heroin instead of experimenting with much safer drugs.', '>Look what effectively legalising opioids (painkillers are relatively easy to access) did to US - 130 deaths from opioids every day, over 10m people abusing them.\n\nIt seems like a lot of the harm here is the ""effective"" legalisation. People are provided with enough legal opiods to get addicted, and are then cut off by the system. A high percentage of the deaths caused by overdoses are those who turned to the black market, buying substances with poor dosage and quality control.\n\n> Legalising all drugs makes no sense because you just can\'t trust people with their decision making. Average person is actually incredibly dumb, for the lack of a better word. \n\nI\'ve heard this argument many times, and I\'ve used it in the past when I was on the other side of this debate. However it doesn\'t quite fit with how we otherwise legislate behaviour. There\'s any number of ways to screw up your life, and the vast majority of people manage to avoid these successfully.\n\nGambling is a great example, since you can seriously ruin your life in an afternoon at RWS. This is why effective measures are put in place to minimise harm, and support offered to those who fall victim to it.', ""Could you please provide me with the facts to back up your assumptions? Education, legalization and policies keep things in check typically. People that want to use will use, legal or not. Just because you personally disagree it doesn't mean you're right."", "">However people are not generally known for taking good decisions.\n\nSure, which is why we see people make bad decisions with legal substances. However we generally acknowledge that a complete prohibition of those substances would cause more societal harm. My argument is that it seems we're in this situation now, and regulating behaviours in some of the ways you suggest could be a better approach for everyone.\n\nLegalising drugs does not mean you have to make them socially acceptable. It's legal to be drunk all day long, but it's far from acceptable behaviour.\n\nAs for whether it increases healthcare burden, I'm not sure there's any evidence here. However with decriminalisation of softer drugs like cannabis (which I'll happily admit is very different from meth) elsewhere, most research indicates very little increase in usage."", "">pointing out the counter-argument that seems most reasonable to me (\n\nI can see that, but my view is that the counter-argument needs to be applied consistently across all arguments it covers.

For sugar, because it is so cheap, it doesn't make sense to start stealing, but in places where they are scarce, you see the value skyrocketing (eg in prisons where candy are traded as currency and stealing them make sense)"", "">I'd further like to add on that you've haven't read my comment\n\nI read it. My point is that most of the harms you're referring to were caused by the prohibition itself.\n\nThe corruption and subsequent undermining of the ruling body were a direct result of the prohibition. While other harms may have occurred without prohibition, these harms were caused by its existence."", "">You mentioned in an earlier comment that you think you wouldn't be interested in using heroin. But I'd bet you'd try, someday.\n\nThis argument has no foundation.\n\nMany people (myself included) grow up in cities where drugs like heroin are easily accessible, and contrary to popular perception, very cheap.\n\nWhen I was a teenager, my friends and I would get together some money and find an older sibling to buy us some beer. For half the price, we could have gone to a neighbourhood dealer (who by the way doesn't ask for ID) and gotten ourselves plenty of heroin for all of us. Never did, never had any temptation to.\n\nWhile this is an anecdote, it's obviously a common experience since most people in places with accessible illicit drugs don't take them.\n\nHonest question, if you could try heroin legally, would you?"", ""But these effects pertain to drug users, e.g. uptake of treatment, reduction in HIV due to sharing needles, reduction in drug-related deaths.

ik its mostly my fault that I retained cuz I struggled with shows addiction (ps If you have any tips to overcome this it would be great ) but I feel that having a suitable learning environment more suited for my learning style would help too.

tiredpandax3,imcr4s,What should I do at this point,2020-09-04 17:16:09,singapore,378757,22,60,"TW: Problem gambling

I don't know if this is the correct sub to post this at but I am really at my limits and a loss.

So a little context about my family, my grandma have 6 sons and 3 of them (my father, Uncle S and Uncle M) are gamblers. The problem started from my grandpa who is a heavy gambler himself too. Gambling tore our family apart, my youngest uncle and his family cut their connections off completely from us because of my dad. Uncle S and my family is divorced because of the gambling. My custody is with my mum but I am living in my dad's house with Uncle S and my grandma taking care of me.

Uncle S is the most problematic gambler out of the three brothers, he used to quit gambling for a while but it started again back in 2015/2016 and it escalated in 2017. His daughter (cousin A) used to live with us but have moved to another country with her mum a few years back. Even though I miss her a lot but I am glad that she's no longer in SG because of how violent and scary my uncle would treat her whenever he needs money. He used to be more reserved towards my grandma, but these days it's as if he got possessed or something, he would shout and scream at my grandma every single day for not lending him money. Which broke my grandma's heart a lot, she is 80 already but she still needs to worry for her lousy pathetic son who don't know how to pick himself up even after his ex-wife and daughter ran far away from him to another country. And whenever he needs money he will keep bothering my grandma non stop like a mosquito who won't give up bugging you until you give him your blood (money). I called my dad to step in to help, but in stead of asking my uncle to stop he tries to convince my grandma to lend him the money in stead...... We tried getting NCPG to help but it was quite useless, they didn't solve anything. A few years back we did get him to impose a ban on himself from entering the casino but within a few months the casino allowed him to unban himself (?????). I am powerless to do anything also because I am not a direct kin, but my ahma is reluctant to do anything also because 1. He's her son and she can't bear to do anything serious to him 2. She is afraid he'll go crazy and attack her or do silly things.

I really don't know what to do at this point anymore, if not for the gambling my uncle is actually a very responsible and hardworking man. He raised me more than my actual father did and took care of me, cousin A and my grandma all the way until now. But because of this gambling addiction I really cannot stand him and sometimes I want to just run away to my mum and cut myself off from them completely but I cannot do that obviously because that's very selfish and I would leave my poor grandma with him. Not to mention my grandma fell down in the toilet a few weeks ago and now she's very weak, but my crazy uncle don't know how to stop and let her go and will only break her heart everyday. What should I do at this point???

tl;dr my uncle is addicted to gambling and keeps harassing my grandma for money. I can't do anything as I'm not a direct kin and my grandma can't bear to do anything to him. What should I do?

I wrote this when I was feeling really down and terrible, and your kind comments made me feel better!

OldProtectionism,iu089a,Singapore's dismal action against sexual crimes committed by students,2020-09-17 01:31:48,singapore,378757,24,26,"Now, before you label me as a ""feminist"" or ""SJW"", hear me out. **Warning though, relatively long post ahead. Might be rant-y in nature.**

In just the past year, we've had multiple prominent cases involving students who commit crimes that are sexual-related nature.

One of the earlier ones involved NUS student Terence Siow Kai Yuan, originally sentenced to probation in September 2019 but had his sentence later upgraded to a two-week jail term in April 2020. He was charged for molestation. His case sparked the rise in popularity of the use of terms like ""minor intrusions"" and ""potential to excel in life"", albeit sarcastically.

In December, NTU student Chong Yen Bin was sentenced to 18 weeks in prison, after ""pleading guilty to six counts of insulting a woman's modesty, with another 20 similar charges taken into consideration for sentencing"". He had taken upskirt videos of women over a period of months in 2018, apparently because he was stressed over studies and wanted to satisfy his addiction.

Then we had the case on Yin Zi Qin, who was studying Dentistry at NUS. He was handed ""community-based sentences"" for voluntarily causing hurt and criminal trespass, after sneaking into his partner's home, strangling her, and causing her to become temporarily blind. In a surprising and rare move, PAP Women's Wing also came out to ""voice concerns"" over the incident on its Facebook page.

Most recently, the name Shaun Ho Yan Liang has popped up. This NTU student pleaded guilty to taking 469 obscene videos of 335 women, both on and off university campus grounds. Deputy Public Prosecutor Seah Teh is seeking 10 months and 3 weeks jail for him, but we won't know how the sentencing goes until September 23.

A Reddit post over Shaun Ho's case can be found here: [NTU undergraduate admits to taking illicit videos of 335 women, including victims on campus](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/itsalr/ntu_undergraduate_admits_to_taking_illicit_videos/)

Enough damage has been dealt over the perceived light sentencing university students receive for their sexual offences. Worse still that these aren't isolated incidents, and that there has been a noticeable trend that has provoked so much outcry that Shanmugan and MHA has to come out to announce that they'd ""review penalty framework"".

Lack of deterrent makes all these university students unable to keep it in their pants, knowing full well that they'll likely get away easy even if they get caught.

When will the concerns of female students in Singapore actually be taken seriously? Why do we even need to wait the big and powerful (like PAP Women's Wing) to come out and make noise?

Enough is enough. Will Shaun Ho's sentencing on September 23rd be a change in the trend? Or will it just be another disappointing continuation of the trend of university students getting away with their crimes?

So far though, it's been really, really disappointing.

Edit: Took out a part on comments made by Shaun Ho's own lawyer, as per u/Black-footed_Cat's advice. Thanks!",0.62,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iu089a/singapores_dismal_action_against_sexual_crimes/,"['I would like to look at this problem from a different angle, that of the sorely lacking and dismal state of consent education in Singapore. I did not study in a local university, and so perhaps someone can enlighten me as to the consent education that exists, and how wide reaching and well embedded it is in the lives of college students here. I can only speak of how cursory it was up till pre-university, and how little was done to reiterate the parameters and definitions of consent.\n\nOP\'s examples have served to show that unless there is a reporting bias, a large majority of sexual assault cases seem to be arising from college campuses, and it speaks volumes of the severity of the problem especially within college campuses. Punitive statutory mechanisms are necessary, but a lot of the mediating factors in these cases seems to arise from the pity that is elicited from destroying a ""bright student\'s future."" There seems to be some tacit knowledge of the students somehow not knowing better at the point of committing these crimes, and hence we need to seriously consider giving them second chances since they now understand the gravity of their past actions.\n\nIf we ensure that every student learns through and through the meaning of consent, the consequences of not obtaining it, the types of action that can constitute sexual harrassment and assault, etc., i think society would be less forgiving of such behaviour. Universities need to lead the way and set very very high expectations for themselves and for their students. Expecting young men to know these things while doing little to nothing is a failure of the system in eradicating this problem through every possible avenue.', ""While I agree with the majority of your post. I find it disturbing that you are highlighting a comment from Ho's lawyer. It's LITERALLY his job to do all he can to help out his client (even if he personally disagrees with the client's act) so of course you will expect these kind of comments from him."", 'So what type of deterrence are you looking at? \n\nIn my uninformed opinion, a lot of the problems stem from too little sex ed and too much porn. I‚Äôm not saying people shouldn‚Äôt watch at all - but I think too much of it is a problem and the lack of sex ed means people can‚Äôt draw a line between what‚Äôs fantasy and reality...and the reality is women, like all humans, have boundaries and want to be treated with respect. Feel free to correct me.\n\nYou can fine, jail and cane, raise penalties - even make it as severe as rape - but people with warped minds will try their luck anyway, believing they won‚Äôt get caught.', 'Looking at the other comments about porn consumption and sexuality education in schools (or the lack of), I offer a different perspective. \n\nWhile I agree that education is a powerful tool to prevent such crimes (as opposed to deterrence), do we just push this responsibility to the school? What about education at the family level?\n\nOne might confuse acting with real life as pornography is increasingly accessible. At best, you have schools ""teaching"" that ""Actors behave differently in pornography to entertain and earn money. Don\'t expect superheroes and super villains on the streets either"". \n\nIn my opinion, morals and values are best nurtured at home. With dual income families being a norm, is family education becoming increasingly ignored? What happened to the ""bird and bee"" talks? If current working adults are unable to educate their own kids on such matters, what makes you think that they can educate a class of 20-30 strangers? A great portion of teachers have yet to be parents themselves either. \n\nOn having strong laws to deter such crimes, I think that this will only be effective on someone who is informed about and respects the law. Are we going to make the same argument that schools should provide education on such legal matters as well?', ""Whilst i think the sentencing penalties have been relatively lax so far, notably in the Terence Siow case, I dont think drafting draconian new laws that would heavily punish sexual trangressions or regulate sexuality is the way to go. There are limits to how much the state can and should intervene into peoples' lives and our consultative authoritarian state already intervenes too much as it is. Furthermore, imposing new laws or punishments does not address the underlying issues that are leading many young men to commit such offences, it might just make it that offenders will do more to avoid being caught.\n\nInstead there needs to be greater sex ed in secondary schools regarding sexuality, gender and consent as well as exposure of society at large to media that carefully explores the nuances of sexuality. NUS students groups such as the BDSM discussion group are actually steps in the right direction imo and the university's cowardly response to public outrage shut down any kind of progress that might have been made. Pornographic consumption alone isn't the issue, it's that Singaporeans lack the media savvy to distinguish between fantasy and reality when consuming media, or how to navigate interpersonal boundaries (I view the endless amounts of chinese/korean soaps to be largely porn for middle aged aunties, feeding them fantasies of child filiality and rigid hierarchical structures).\n\nSingapore society as a whole needs to be having more conversations about sexuality and so that people can understand what boundaries are and what they themselves as individuals may find arousing. The state has historically imposed excessively authoritarian controls that limit such public discourse around sexuality including strict morality policing via the MDA, an overly academically focused education system (instead of something more holistic to develop social skills), strict bans on almost any kind of art that might provoke public conversation and policies that directly link benefits such as housing and healthcare to heterosexual marriage.\n\ntldr: harsher sentencing wont solve the fact that singaporeans are sexually repressed. State needs to be encouraging greater public discourse instead of being asked to regulate what should be personal."", ""Laws are made to be broken. Why wait for it to be breached before coming in heavy handed with punishment?\n\nIn Japan a lot of pervyness comes from an oppressive work culture as well as intense societal pressures to meet all sorts of KPI's -- social life, family, etc.\n\nIn Singapore, it's not much different. Sexual repression, 2 years of military regimentation, educational and societal pressures, and more.\n\nThese are the more crucial problems to solve to address the general health of our population, not just guys."", ""While heavier sentencing won't solve problems by itself, it Is a serious deterrent. This is evident from the fact that Singapore has very low availability of drugs.\nSex ed and consent education needs to be coupled with a reframing of laws around sexual misdemeanours. The punishment handed out for crimes relating to sexual harassment/voyeurism should be much greater than that given for other crimes such as theft. An NTU student is given 18 weeks in prison for 6 counts of outrage of modesty plus several counts of voyeurism, but the act leaves so many women with a sense of insecurity and danger for the rest of their lives..\n\nThe aim should be to demonstrate a No Tolerance approach to such crime, the way it has been done for drug use. (don't mean with death penalty, rather with how society views these acts)"", '[deleted]', '[deleted]', ""No amount of consent education would have prevented those 4 cases from happening.

Hell, in our local unis, no one gives af about who plays sports most of the time.\n\nAs an indication, I don‚Äôt think NUS whispers talks about sexual assault regularly.

I would say that stricter laws brings greater deterrence. Some might still try their luck but I believe many would back off.', ""I do agree that sex ed in Singapore is quite laughable and really needs improvement. Right now sex ed seems to be more of hitting some government quota and whatnot, more of actual inculcation of the right value system in youth.\n\nHarsher sentence, of course, is only one part of the multi-pronged approach to reducing the prevalence of sexual crimes in Singapore, at least in my opinion. As you mentioned, curbing pornography (either through outright ban and censorship or through education), and revamping sex ed in Singapore, are other ways to tackle the problem.\n\nRehabilitation can also help as well. Give offenders a decent sentence to satisfy the public and the victim, but also make sure they are well rehabilitated so they can re-integrate into society and refrain from doing the same shit when they're released.\n\nSo yeah that's my two cents on this.\n\nThanks for leaving your input!"", 'I agree with you that education at home is important, but I believe it is only effective until a certain age. We can discuss what that age is, but my personal opinion is that it ends right about when children hit puberty. As a young adult myself, I still cannot imagin myself having a proper conversation with my parents about this even at age 16. Perhaps it\'s my personal upbringing, perhaps it\'s the sense of rebellion or independence I sought for at that age. Either way, we must be open to different avenues of education for different types of students.\n\nIn any case, we are talking about adults in their 20s here. Talking to their parents about the ""birds and the bees"" is hardly what consent education is about. Young adults won\'t stand for moral lectures from their parents, and neither should parents make their adult children\'s action their responsibility any longer. Even if the education started at home, universities need to continue emphasizing this while students are literally enrolled within their campuses. That\'s the reason why schools have to be way more proactive about this. Workplaces too. You can\'t be relying on mama and papa to educate a grown child, it\'s quite embarrassing tbh.', ""Drug laws in Singapore aren't the be all and end all of our drug deterrent policy. Sure, theyre among the strictest in the world, but we also spare no expense in telling every little kid from the age of 7 that drugs harm every living being in society. It's literally the most sustained PR campaign in Singapore. That's how we got society to change our view of these acts. The government didn't just create a bunch of strict laws and keep them under wraps. So yes, while i do agree laws need to be enhanced and strengthened, how do we fundamentally get people to view these crimes as wrong and not just illegal?"", ""I know for a fact that desires can be controlled at will. Part of that will comes from the threat of punitive punishment, but part of it also has to come from internalising how morally wrong and repugnant such behaviour is. Till we make consent education a mainstay of college life, we would never know how these 4 people would have behaved, differently or otherwise. You're right that they were aware that it was wrong, but a lack of knowledge on how wrong it is or why it is actually wrong must have contributed to their dismissing of such conscience checks."", '>Don\'t know if ""a large majority of sexual assault cases seem to be arising from college campuses"" holds true,\n\nI\'m not sure about the statistics too, but if it wasn\'t true, what gets reported in the news definitely make it seem to be true.

flossyourteethkids,if45pz,[JC] Feeling guilty in JC,2020-08-23 22:31:37,SGExams,77673,13,24,"I'm posting this because I don't know where/who to go to. 

I don't know if I'm the only one feeling this way but my promos are in a month's time and I feel guilty for not doing any revision or proper studying. All I have been doing is homework and I hear my friends starting on revision while I'm trying to complete my homework.

I don't think it's logical to approach my friends on this topic because they're probably facing problems of their own. I tried going to my CM but all she did was to tell me revision tips which didn't really help as I'm busy trying to catch up with homework. I tried telling my parents too (my parents are really nice and generally try not to pressurise me) but they didn't go through tertiary education back then so it's really difficult asking them for advice.

Almost every weekend I will question myself and why I'm even in JC. I always tell myself ""I chose this path so I ought to fulfil it"" but how to fulfil when I'm barely 20% there? I have lost interest in many of my hobbies and all my worries are ""am I going to promote?"" or ""what if I retain but don't do well and get kicked out?"" I know I am thinking too far ahead but thats the nature of who I am. I'm aware I may be giving myself too much stress at this point in time but my coping mechanism to this is something very detrimental to my studies - watching youtube/using my phone and I can go for 3/4 hours at a time. So I guess I can call that my addiction. 

I'm not too sure if anyone has/is going through what I'm feeling but it's been around 6 months and I'm still not used to the rigour of JC life. My days in school ends the latest at 6pm and on average per week, end at ~5pm so once I'm home every night I just ram through school work without much learning (eg copying straight from notes) 

This is just a rant, I needed an output somewhere. Thanks for reading if you've reached here :)

I would also advise the O lvl students who may be reading this to not be affected on their choices of going to JC or not because I'm sure I'm only one of the very few who is feeling this way.

purrrish,jrdlkf,How do I know if I am blacklisted from entering SG after this incident? Tourist here.,2020-11-10 11:45:43,askSingapore,44636,16,0,"So long story short, my ex is Singaporean. And I'm Indonesian. He dumped me over text and I flew to Singapore last year days after it happened for closure. I went from Friday - Sunday. 

Friday, I met him and I got my closure. I was fucked up and all. That night after, I went to Marquee to have some drinks with my friends who live in Singapore (I didn't stay with them, I had my own airbnb). Then the next thing I remember I was in an ambulance, laying and restrained. I remember crying about my ex- boyfriend tho. (I was drunk) and the next memory of mine is when I'm in Singapore General Hospital. I don't remember much, only crying in the hospital because I was mad and emotional, why would they need to bring me. I don't remember the exact causes why. Then they gave me back my bag and passport, I then took a cab back to my airbnb. Went out the Saturday night with my friends, and Sunday got back to Indonesia. 
Nothing happened, I think I was there for a few hours. They didn't charge me also.

Question Is, I'm concerned if I'm banned from Singapore for future travel because of that incident. I'm guessing why they took me in an ambulance and restrained was because I had cutting scars on my wrist (which was still very visible and it was still fresh cut, and I couldn't cover it with makeup because it sting.) and I didn't self harm in SG. The scars are from days ago when I'm still back in Indonesia. My Singaporean friends told me, if they didn't detain me in the police station then it should be fine. Since on Saturday till Sunday I was still ""free"" in Singapore. 
Or because I got too drunk and emotional? And maybe they thought I am a drug user from the cut? Cause I heard heroin addicts cut themselves. 
I was alone when I got into an ambulance and the hospital, it all happened to fast, my friends didn't know.


Will I get banned for future travel for that ""trouble?""
I need to confirm what my friends say is true or not.

Thanks!

Cannabis does get you high but is a lot safer than alcohol. Alcohol toxicity is real while no one have ever died of cannabis overdose.\n\nAlso, the idea of preventing people from getting high simply doesn't make sense. So what if someone want to smoke cannabis, eat space cakes or drink vodka, why should we waste tax monies stopping, jailing and killing these people. The government shouldn't be involved in what a person does to their own bodies.\n\nThis is a valid argument as well but not an urgent one.

OxySempra,hof2v9,Guide on How to Save Money During NS by u/OxySempra,2020-07-10 08:40:50,NationalServiceSG,11078,10,84,"During the two years you are in NS, it is the perfect time for you to save money!

Many of you are probably pursuing a further education after NS, some may even be thinking of starting their own business, or some may just want to kick-start their savings for their future: marriage, house, car, children, or even retirement!

Personally, I am going to be enlisted in about two weeks time. I just want to give thanks to all the guides posted here, and the helpful people in the Discord for answering all my chao recruit questions. I hope this guide will help pay back for some of the help I have received.

This guide will explain the basics of financial planning and literacy.

**1. Calculating and Optimising Your Expenses**

First things first, what you need to do is to calculate and total up the amount of money you spend in a month. Everything from your telco bills, down to your bubble tea addiction. This shall be your ‚Äò*Fat Expense*‚Äô.

Now, obviously, there will be a ton of stuff that you usually spend your money on that during your NS, you probably won‚Äôt be spending much on, if at all. So, things like transport (especially for those Grab addicts out there), food, and even things like computer games/IAP will be scaled down naturally without any effort from you. (MINDEF will help out in that department.) So, with that in mind, amend your ‚Äò*Fat Expense*‚Äô accordingly. This shall be your ‚Äò*Lean Expense*‚Äô.

***The following is optional, but you can go ahead with it if you are dedicated enough:***

You can further cut back on your ‚Äò*Lean Expense*‚Äô by actively limiting your spending. Ideally, it should only consists of your basic expense and *very* little luxuries. Some examples:

* Limiting all taxi rides, only go for public transport
* Limiting dining expenses outside, eat only while in camp or at home. Your parents cooking won‚Äôt be there for you to enjoy forever, you know. (Morbid, but true.)
* Downgrading or canceling unneeded/superfluous subscription plans like Netflix 4K to 1080p.

Congrats on making it this far! Keep those two figures in mind as it is important, and we will move on to the next step.

**2. Emergency Funds**

Emergency funds are basically your ‚Äòrainy day piggy bank‚Äô.

In a perfect life, you will never need to touch this piggy bank, but life is not perfect. You or your family might get into an emergency, be it financially or medically. It is also handy for, in the future if you lose your job, you can take your time finding a new job while having 6 months of living expenses already saved up to rely on.

All of this is to protect you from debt. (Which is something you never, never, never want to get into.)

This is how much you need in your emergency funds: 3-6 months of your ‚Äò*Lean Expenses*‚Äô stored in a high-yield savings account with high liquidity. (Don‚Äôt fret over these cheem terms, I will to that next.)

**3. Optimise Your Savings**

Right, so I mentioned earlier a ‚Äòhigh-yield savings account with high liquidity‚Äô. It is basically a bank deposit account that has high interest and absolutely no fees.

I am sure many of you probably have a POSB whatever account that just gives you a debit/ATM card, and pretty much no interest. (Something like $0.02/month)

This is basically that, but better in every way.

The following is the list of accounts I recommend, and the purpose of the account:

*I. Emergency Funds*

I store 6 months‚Äô worth of expenses into my Singlife Savings Account.

* It is capital guaranteed by the SDIC. (Your money is as safe as it is in the bank.)
* It has a non-guaranteed interest rate of 2%. (What it means is that it is not always 2%. But, based on my past history with this account, it has an average interest rate of around 2%. )
* It is very liquid. You can instantly deposit and withdraw money via FAST.
* ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! No fall below fee, no etc.

[https://singlife.com/](https://singlife.com/)

&#x200B;

*II*. Savings Account

I store a month‚Äôs worth of expenses into my Standard Charted JumpStart account.

* It is capital guaranteed by the SDIC. (Your money is as safe as it is‚Ä¶ wait, it IS a bank, so‚Ä¶)
* It has a guaranteed interest rate of 1%
* It is very liquid. You can instantly deposit and withdraw money via FAST.
* Debit card linked to the account has a no frills 1% cashback on all debit transactions (with some limits of course, check their TOS)
* IT IS ALSO ABSOLUTELY FREE!!! No fall below fee, no etc.

[https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/jumpstart/](https://www.sc.com/sg/save/savings-accounts/jumpstart/)

&#x200B;

*III. ATM Account*

This account will pretty much be empty almost always. It will exclusively be used for cash deposit and withdrawals. I use DBS My Account.

* Access to all DBS/POSB ATMs nationwide
* And need I say it again? ABSOLUTELY FREE!!!

[https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/my-account](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/deposits/savings-accounts/my-account)

&#x200B;

*III part 2. Optional: Expenses Account*

If you do not mind complicating things up, you can apply for the SAFRA card and link it to your ATM Account.

This is for you to stretch every dollar, as it provides you with a slightly higher cashback (of an additional 1%, total 2%), and some other SAFRA privileges.

The downside (or upside if you are like me) is that every time you need to spend money, you must transfer the required amount to the DBS account. (This allows me to be more conscious of my spending though, so it is up to you.)

[https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/debit-cards/dbs-safra-debit-card](https://www.dbs.com.sg/personal/cards/debit-cards/dbs-safra-debit-card)

&#x200B;

*IV. Long-term Savings*

For long-term savings (timescale of >3-5 years), you should park your money in an investment vehicle.

Unlike the rest I mentioned above, this has some risks involved. So if you are not comfortable with it, feel free to skip this step.

I personally use StashAway for my long-term savings. I won‚Äôt go into the nitty gritty details of these kind of services, but if you would like to know more details, this is an article from a finance blogger that I really respect:  [https://www.firepathlion.com/a-bet-on-humanity-why-index-investing-works/](https://www.firepathlion.com/a-bet-on-humanity-why-index-investing-works/)

* Much lower costs than traditional brokers
* Completely automated and passive investment (Meaning you don‚Äôt have to do anything, just pump money in)
* No minimum investment required (You can invest $50 one month, $200 the next, and nothing at all the month after)

[https://www.stashaway.sg/](https://www.stashaway.sg/referrals/ansontdq8z)

(If you would like a referral code which allows BOTH you and I have up to $10,000 managed for free for 6 months, PM me. Details below.)

&#x200B;

**4. Splitting Your Allowance**

I am sure many of you, by now, have this question in your minds. ‚ÄòThis guy talking what cock? I only get paid $630 during my BMT, still want me save this, invest that.‚Äô

My answer to that, my little turnips, is the 3:2 rule.

Once you receive your first allowance, do the following:

1. Set aside the money needed for the month‚Äôs expense and put it into your JumpStart (or equivalent) account.
2. Split the remaining amount 3:2. Assign 3 to the investment account, 2 to the emergency fund account.

So, for those who suck at math, let me give you an example.

I will be using $300 for this example:

$300 divided 5 = $60 3 x $60 = $180. This will go to your Singlife (or equivalent) account.

2 x $60 = $120. This will go to your Stashaway (or equivalent) account.

If you are risk-adverse and do not want to invest, then just put all of it into your Singlife (or equivalent) account.

That is pretty much it for now. I will come back in the future and post more finance tips.

If you have any questions, do not hesitate to comment here, PM me, or ping me on the National Service Discord channel. I will do my best to help you.

While harsh penalties surely have their influence, I think the main reason for low drugs usage in Singapore are cultural, economical and also geographical.\nLet me explain.\n\nSingapore is a rich city state with low unemployment and poverty, both triggers for drug addiction. \nCulturally speaking Singapore has a strong focus on family, education and career, all things that shape the perception of intoxicating substances of all sorts.\nGeographically, the country is small and with few borders which are easy to control which incredibly boosts the efficiency of police enforcement.\n\nBelieving that death penalty and caning alone solved Singapore's drug problem is very naive and reductive. Many other countries have harsh drug laws but are suffering from severe drug addiction issues.\n\nCompare that with alcohol. \nAlcholism causes catastrophic problems not different from drug addiction (it's addictive, broken families, health issues...) yet it is not a major issue in Singapore despite alcohol being completely legal. \nYou don't see alcohol addicts in prison, no one gets hanged because of alcohol trade. \nWhy is not an major issue in Singapore? Because of the above mentioned reasons and the fact that the legal status of the substance helped develop a discussion about its effects, thus making people aware. \n\nThat said, starting to soften the stance on addicts (who, we should remember, are victims and not perpetrators) is probably not a completely wrong thing to do."", 'My thoughts: \nSingapore = Boat, Large Western countries = Ship. \n\nWith 10people onboard of a tiny boat, every movement from a person can have serious impact of the sustainability. 1 not paddling? The boat is slower by 10%. 1 play mischief? You find a hole at the bottom and boat sink. \n\nThe above ideology was the core behind many of Singapore\'s policies and laws in the early days since independent. By enforcing tough and result orientated policy, citizen are guided to work on common and very specific goal, and it result in Singapore rapid growth since 70/80s till now. This is also why many Singaporean are still accepting it\'s law now. \n\nIronically, the key advantage and downside of this ideology is the same thing! It eliminate ""mischiefs""! ""Mischiefs"" can be read as Creativity. Not keen in school, turn into tattoo artist. Hate a 9-5 bank/engineering job, turn into a travel blogger.

However, the difference lies in the severity of the punishment. You might get 12 months behind bars for dealing significant quantities in most OECD countries (depends on class and amount) where as in SG they send you away for 25. \n\nHeres my hot take. Drug dealing is a serious crime, but it shouldnt be a life ending offence. Most of the guys that deal are just meeting the demand in the market, which unfortunately will always be present. I also think that the drug trade often captures the most vulnerable members of society, those with precious few options left on the table.

Stephen Lyng (1990) theorised the concept of ""Edgework"". Also known as ""Voluntary Risk Taking"". So basically, from just googling, Edgework is "" The\xa0concept of edgework incorporates the notion that voluntary risk-taking activities are about exploring the edges that exist along cultural boundaries. These boundaries may include those between sanity and insanity, consciousness and unconsciousness and life and death."" (1). I\'m lifting from websites because it\'s easy. But if anyone is more knowledgable and knows that I\'ve misspoken, please do tell me!  \n\n\nSo in essence, for some, it\'s more of pushing boundaries. The experience. But if we look at it that way right, then it supercedes the notion of rational choice (theory). Because rational choice theory assumes that the individual weighs the pros and cons. So logically speaking these drug users would know that they would face the music if they get caught.   \n\n\nSo why still take drugs? That is to me, where Edgework comes in. Because perhaps the first time they took the drug, it was on them. Because MAYBE, they made the conscious choice to take the drug. BUT, subsequently, perhaps due to addiction, the reason why they are taking the drug is because of that ""high"" they get.   \n\n\nIt\'s not easy to think of it this way\\^. But I think we should also be more open to other options rather than blaming the drug users themselves. A fellow user mentioned we should punish the dealers for targeting the vulnerable users. And also rehab the users. I agree. But then again that depends on what the government wants and how they see drugs and users in Singapore.   \n\n\nNow if you\'ve read this far without thinking ""So you mean drugs is ok la?"", then thank you. Don\'t get me wrong, I do not think drugs is right (as the typical Singaporean). That doesn\'t mean that we shouldn\'t explore how we look at drugs and treat our drug users. Edgework, as a theory offers the chance to look at various taboo topics differently. And the theory has helped me realise that how we see certain matters around us varies from our culture and upbringing.   \n\n\nI think, as a nation, we should revise how we see things. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nOk thanks for reading, back to my readings.

Yes you might think that it takes a a bigger hole to sink a bigger ship but that analogy is misleading - what we really have is a series of dominoes where different institutions are dependent on each other for support. For larger countries, it may be even more difficult to diagnose and deal with a problem when a domino is struck- the government is less agile and these problems get to  a much larger scale very quickly. The size of Singapore has made dealing with certain holes easier - a good example is how we dealt with the 2009 economic crisis, which larger countries would find problematic to pull off. \n\n\n\nThe reason why Singapore has enjoyed low amounts of drug abuse, I would wager has almost nothing to do directly with our \'tough\' stance on drugs, but rather with the fact that we are an extremely small island nation (easy to patrol borders), have a nearly incorruptible civil service (esp. to prevent the propagation of large criminal organisations), and have had decent economic growth for the last few decades(people don\'t turn to drugs). If tomorrow the drug laws were changed to give criminals lighter punishments, I don\'t believe that you would have a much higher rise in drug abuse.

The strongest case against  drug  control is the violence and corruption associated with the black market. The main problem is not that drug control efforts have failed to eliminate drug use, an aspirational goal akin to the  elimination of war and poverty. It is that in attempting to do so, they have indirectly enriched dangerous criminals, who kill and bribe their way from the countries where drugs are produced to the countries where drugs are consumed.  \n>  \n>Drug addiction represents a large social cost, a cost we seek to contain through the system of international drug control.  But this system itself has its costs, and these are not limited to the expenditure of public funds. International  drug  control  has  produced  several  unintended  consequences, the most formidable of which is the creation  of  a  lucrative  black  market  for  controlled  substances, and the violence and corruption it generates. Drug  control  generates  scarcity,  boosting  prices  out  of  proportion to production costs. Combined with the barriers  of  illegality  and  prevention  efforts,  scarcity  and  high  prices  have  helped  contain  the  spread  of  illicit  drugs. This has kept drugs out of the hands of an untold number of potential addicts. At the same time, however, high  prices  allow  transnational  traffickers  to  generate  obscene profits, simply for being willing to shoulder the risk of defying the law.\n\nFor a more balanced viewpoint, the first link leans towards limited legalizing of some drugs like Marijuana, and the second link leans towards keeping the status quo.\n\nBoth sources agree and acknowledge that drug trafficking is a crime that's exacerbated by harsh drug penalties.  \n\nBut hey, based on the replies I have received so far, it's not going to matter how many sources I post here, PAP's drug disinformation campaign clearly works, and people blindly believe in it.

Which is precisely what happened in the west.\n\nSingapore's drug scene is heavily skewed towards Amphetamines and Opoids which are addictive, potentially lethal and damaging. In most other countries , drug use is skewed towards cannabis, which is very low harm. One simple reason for this drugs have to be smuggled past heavy enforcement into this country. The lowest risk drug to smuggle into Singapore are drugs that have high potency in relation to their volume. This is how you get this sort inverted pyramid. Prohibition makes using drugs in Singapore much more dangerous with danger coming from all sides. This is the same effect that you see in the west. When the US began to increase policing on its border, the drug use profile shifted from cannabis and cocaine to Amphetamine and synthetic opoids, because these were dense and did not need to be smuggled from South America.\n\nNeither of us are drug addicts. The system 'works' for us because we don't see any of its downsides. We don't see the wasted lives and the wasted taxpayers money.

It is perfectly logical to not encourage any form of drug tourism.\n\nThe only case where this would be different is if a country forces people visiting it to take drugs.

I see the point in them. It is in the interest of everyone in the criminal justice process to help drug addicts move beyond their addiction, and consequently cut the drug trade off at the demand end. \n\nBut I do not agree with the most recent developments in the arguments, because fundamentally the goalpost has shifted from trying to figure out how best to deal with a problem, to defining it as not a problem. The social ills of drug addiction haven\'t suddenly cured themselves just because they remain inconvenient, and legitimising the drug trade basically hand waves the problem away. \n\nThe removal of the mandatory death penalty has rightly and properly returned the mandate of judicial sentencing back to the Courts, instead a mandatory penalty with no room for addressing different circumstances. The ethical issues associated with the death penalty remains an open debate in my book, and the ills of misapplication is addressed by placing the discretion back with the judiciary (because why else do we trust our judges to decide our punishments but for our trust in their judgments?). My personal view is that given the social ramifications of the drug trade, imposing the death penalty on traffickers (as it is the case now anyway) is arguably proportionate.\n\nI\'d be open to more initiatives to support those struggling with drug addiction. Perhaps there can be a case to be made that certain harm reduction programmes can be introduced at the rehabilitation phase, if there is a good chance such programmes would reduce the rate of recidivism.

Happens all the time with countries like Singapore, Indonesia etc"", ""The inherent problem of drug addiction is that there is very little that external forces can affect recidivism. The statistical fact of how our prison population is predominantly drug offenders and (also) reoffenders reflects that very uncomfortable and unfortunate truth.\n\nThat is not to say that rehabilitation is pointless, but I would think that the right approach is to continue to try to help those in need, while doing more to penalise those who bring new people into addiction. And that means continuing to take a strong position against the drug trade. The point that is constantly undervalued by legalisation movement is that the state cannot be seen in any way to be encouraging or ambivalent to the harm created by the drug trade. How can it? Doing so is an abdication of its responsibility to protect its constituents.\n\nAnd all of this is constantly reviewed and debated amongst policy makers, political advocates, social workers and legal professionals. Just because there is no visible change happening on a constant scale doesn't mean arguments aren't being put forward and considered. But if no new argument is put forward, how can any persuasion take place? The last impactful social study on the perception of the death penalty by Singaporeans was conducted a few years ago. That was well debated and considered. What else has been new since? "", ""Very familiar with the stats you've put up. Perhaps a bit too familiar for my own good. Thanks for highlighting those, too, because it reflects exactly the problem and insidiousness of the drug trade.\n\nWhich sensible government wants to actively incarcerate its citizenry for no apparent purpose? If you're talking about a government with the reputation that Singapore's has, you'd think that we'd do everything we can to straighten drug addicts out so that they can become productive little economic drones like the rest of us. Why bother throw them into jail for such long periods of time? That costs money, land, manpower, and all that jazz, ya know.\n\nThe uncomfortable and unfortunate truth is that drug addiction yields very little improvement from external intervention. That is not to say that rehabilitation is pointless, but the lure and draw of recidivism is too damn powerful. Once someone starts down that path, the statistical likelihood of him righting the course of his ship is depressingly low.\n\nThe question becomes what can we do about that? But the answer clearly cannot be to legalise the damn thing, because which government in its responsible and right mind would tell its citizens that something is no longer a problem because *it says so*. Everything else is just frills and icing. You can't run away from the problems that the drug trade creates.\n\nThe sensible path is to continue to find ways to help those already in the clutches of addiction, and to continue to send a strong signal against those who profit by dragging new people into addiction. And that means, as part of the multi-pronged approach that is going on right now, continuing to send a strong stance against the drug trade. Which is exactly and precisely what the existing system continues striving to do.\n\nAnd it is again cognitive dissonance to claim that whatever success we've been having is due to our small size and relative ease of enforcement, but then turn around to say that we've not had any success, or that we should stop what we're doing because somehow it's not working for other people. The Singapore position has never been that we're a role model. We've found something that works, or minimally produces tradeoffs that we can live with. Just because others found their own solution doesn't mean that would work for us, or that our solution is somehow inferior.\n\nThink also about where and what we are in South East Asia. Recall the heroin flood back in the 1950s-70s, and the Golden Triangle up in Thailand, Laos and Myanmar. Reflect on the drug problem in the Philippines, and how that has opened up to Duterte's policies getting so much popularity despite its deep philosophical problems.\n\nThere's a cause and effect to all things. Think carefully about what some positions really mean. But hey - if you're perfectly alright with those deals with your devils, more power to you.

By the time the Opium war began, the problem had become completely out of control.--not all of that is down to prohibition, the Qing dynasty was rotting from the inside and had a million problems it could not solve.

I thought, why the hell ban chewing gum? Why the hell ban soft drugs? Why all the fines here and there? Educate its people instead. But when I saw the results of their strict approach -the most visible was the gum-free pavement, the social harmony between different cultural groups- I admitted that I was willing to let go some of my so-call liberty rights, in exchange, for this.

It is hard to know what the factors are and how they work and how they work together.

At the same time, they enjoy having their safe and clean homeland. The Asians are pragmatic.

The opinions regarding drugs and drug use are generally a very Singaporean thing across the races, drilled into us from a very young age (like from 7 years old). At that age we aren‚Äôt reading scientific studies - we basically swallow whole what we‚Äôre told, so trying to reform the (typically) hardline way we think/feel about drugs is difficult. \n\nPersonally I do think there is a difference between doing drugs at festivals or for one-off events or situations, and being an addict. The trouble is that it gets very difficult to ensure that social use doesn‚Äôt become addiction, and given our country‚Äôs past with the whole opioid issue and even gambling (it was illegal for decades until they discovered it‚Äôs a great money generator, then the government built our 2 casinos AND introduced the problem gambling help line all at once), it‚Äôs pretty much a knee-jerk reaction to ban things that can cause social problems. \n\nUnless they can be heavily regulated and taxed, like tobacco and alcohol. ;)\n\nSo when you have something which has had its vices and ‚Äústereotypes‚Äù drilled in since 7 years old, science has a much harder time changing or modifying/adding to that mindset.

I think that we have successfully dealt with many of the root causes of crime. I think this works and should be emulated everywhere because it reduces the percentage of people who would become dependent on drugs by 100 fold. This is simply amazing. On the other hand, I think that we deal with that 0.1% who do get addicted in a most unproductive, immoral and wasteful way. This is our failure. As it stands, we have accidentally created a drug scene that is full of the most dangerous drugs. Unlike most other countries most of our addicts are addicted to opoids of one form or another. I am very afraid of what will happen when the fentanyl derivatives finally show up en masse here and gets into the hands ( and veins) of this reserve of people we have built up over the years. I am deeply concerned about how the system and a people used to authoritarian quick fixes will react to this. Our society can be complacent and inflexible. Our success might turn out to be brittle overnight.\n\nSo why would an otherwise good government do this? That is easy.  Many of the decisions that shape the policies that we have today on drugs were heavily influenced by colonialism and by the west.  I don\'t think our government has has faced the push factor to devote serious thoughts on this. Afterall the people most affected are a fraction of a percent of the population and reconsidering policy in this area is painful because it requires concessions on points of fact that have been used to kill thousands of people.\n\nYou talk the talk about stopping the drug trade. Lets us talk about specifics and Lets think carefully about cause and effect. What about destroying the incentives for it? We already do that by having a strong economy and a good education system. Why not go that one step further?  \n\n--Legalise cannabis and study drugs that have a similarly low potential for harm to be treated in the same way. Sugar makes people fat. Caffeine makes people\'s breath smell. No one should die or have their lives ruined over these things. You should consider this carefully, with legalizing proceeding apace internationally, there will soon be a lot of s\'poreans who will become exposed to cannabis culture. The best time to show a positive regard for truth and science is always now. The alternative path will breed a lot of distrust for the system. It would be best to avoid getting forced into having the legalization debate under the same terms as the west where is usually and successfully framed with a message of far-reaching distrust for law enforcement and the justice system. \n\n--Allow for addicts to get diverted out of the penal system so that rehab without a career destroying criminal record. ""I am saving you from ruining your life by ruining your life"" should not be an accurate description of government policy.  \n\nLook into the careful use of subutex and methadone as opoid replacements on a case by case basis. They have powerful disadvantages, but I firmly believe that simply banning them is completely shortsighted. If we cannot end their addiction, replacing it with a less harmful substitute that allows them to work and take care of their families while also draining that reserve of addicts that would become susceptible to becoming fentanyl users makes sense to me. \n\n  ""There\'s a cause and effect to all things.

It's that the taboo hinders medical development in a way that is inconsistent with a (in SGs case otherwise very) scientific approach.\n\nWe could have this argument (including the necessary studies) on a recreational basis, e.g. that the scheduling system, which determines death-row or not, it completely arbitrary and against scientific findings, but that wasn't my main line of reasoning.\n"", '> science cannot be the end all arbiter of public policy\n\nI do wholeheartedly agree with you that science isn\'t the ultimate tool to shape public policy, as it is often too simplistic to grasp the complexities of societal functioning. It can also not capture the individual hardships of a (scientifically speaking) ""outlier case"" of a family where abuse has gone terribly wrong. \n\nBut wouldn\'t you agree that science as an input for discussion is necessary, and that blocking out entire topics, is as bad as junk science? I specifically entered the argument on the basis of the problems created in the medical field, to emphasize how the ""taboo"" around the topic has concrete, isolated, negative implications. As another example I mentioned the stigma and subsequent maltreatment of HIV, because it has negative implications, unrelated to civil liberties or the validity of science in policy making.\n\nThe destroyed family is as much an existing, yet politically overused case, as the person that ""jumped out the window on mushrooms"". The drug abusing parent destroying a family probably happens regularly, but -and here comes the annoying argument of any drug discussion yet again- if this is reason enough to ban, what about all the families of alcoholics? How do we protect those? With taxation?', ""It doesn't achieve that goal but that doesn't mean that it isn't useful. Harm reduction is also a valid reason to vape over smoking.

That is true. That is also almost the only reason I can\'t find arguments against. I would still love to hear a policy-makers well reasoned opinion on ""why alcohol, then?"" \n\n> I mean, if we were only talking about marijuana there\'s a lot you could nitpick\n\n:D and here it falls apart, my friend. There are really only two positions, which can be defended without the notion of hypocrisy. \n\n1) Zero tolerance to any intoxicants, including alcohol and tobacco.\n\n2) Scientific approach to medicinal value (for medicine), and recreational value on the basis of clear evidence. Under this approach, Alcohol is strictly out. The people arguing for weed, are usually users who are caught in the ""soft/hard drug"" categorization (including its moral superiority) of two decades ago. \n\nI honestly wonder why the hardliners never argue for the inhibition of all intoxicants. That would be a very easy to defend position. \n\nP.S. Economically there is nothing better than taxation and regulation. The evidence for that is overwhelming. Playing into the hands of underground cartels is only economically great if one (again) blocks the topic out. \n\n', '> What medical development is being prevented by this climate?\n\nTo name an example. Ecstacy has been found to be a very effective medication for psychotherapy. I want to see the psychiatrist that dares to try to initiate that study at an SG university. Its neither going to happen (stigma), nor going to be allowed. That is potentially blocking the door for medical progress.\n\n> What is this scheduling system you are talking about?\n\nThe drug scheduling system. A classification system that puts drugs into categories ""of danger"", e.g. ""medically sometimes valuable"" such as morphine for surgery, ""no medical use"", in which they often have cannabis or MDMA (in stark opposition to current science). etc... \n\nThis is not a singaporean thing alone, but SG copied it from the brits, where it is similarly arbitrary. The scientific findings in this case would be (among others) that many of the substances in the ""no medical use"" category, do in fact have plenty of medical use. \n\nAnother more social implication would be, e.g. that certain psychedelics are consistently in the worst categories, together with your average ""family destroying"" substance. While there is literally not a single piece of evidence for the validity of that categorization.', ""The inhibition of all intoxicants would be a disaster and literally nobody believes that would work.  Social demand for alcohol in particular is higher than every other drug combined.

There's thousands of years of history to prove that responsible drinking is possible.  But on the other hand there's no such thing as responsible meth or crack use.  So, yes, gradations are necessary and it makes sense to allow alcohol.  It's not hypocritical, it's a practical and useful distinction.  (Edit: clarify wording) Marijuana having an argument for being allowed, and alcohol having an argument for being restricted, doesn't mean that these distinctions and criteria are useless (end edit).  All or nothing is a strawman.  \n\nIn many or even most countries, taxation and regulation may be preferable.  But in Singapore?  Pretty easy to control influx and minimize criminal cartels.

Weed is easy to home-grow, mushrooms can be homegrown, cough medicine is not a dangerous material. \n\n> So, yes, gradations are necessary \n\nCorrect\n\n> ...and it makes sense to allow alcohol. \n\nAlcohol is a cytotoxic and neuro-toxic carcinogen with an incredible societal and personal risk-profile. This is dangerous on all accounts.\n\n> There\'s thousands of years of history to prove that responsible drinking is possible.\n\nIf you consider the typical british saturday night ""responsible use"" then I am sure you wouldn\'t have to be concerned about drugs. For everyone who just sips a glas of Merlot, you\'d find your equivalent in other domains.\n\n> But on the other hand there\'s no such thing as responsible meth or crack use.\n\nTechnically wrong, including the many applications for meth as medication. Yet, tendencially this is of course correct, in an unrestricted context. However, the area between weed and crack is wide and colorful. You named the extreme argument a ""strawman"" further up.\n\n> The position doesn\'t fall apart because marijuana has an argument for being allowed. \n\nI agree, the argument is a relatively safe profile, hard to overdose, and non-aggressive users. How about LSD?\n\n> All or nothing is a strawman.\n\nThats absolutely correct, but the all or nothing argument brings out the fallacies in reasoning of most people. Because they proclaim to know whats good and what isn\'t, based on PSAs from their government or interest groups that they have been unreflectedly swallowing since they go to Kindergarden. And thats exactly what I\'m saying -> back to my initial argument -> hurts advances in the medical field, because all medicine is poison at the wrong dose, and almost all poison are medicine at the right dose. ', 'Preface: We are not going to change each other\'s minds, but idea exchange is still awesome to me.\n\n>Because its legal, not due to preferences. This is a circular reference\n\nIt is the drug of choice by law, by history, and culture.  Saying ""well, I think everyone would really love (other drug X) if only it were legal"" is hypothetical, unscientific, and unrealistic.  Booze is the drug we know and its effects are well known to everyone. Your grandma got drunk.  Her grandma did.  You can\'t change that with a law.  It\'s not a circular reference, it\'s reality.\n\n>Although true, this isn\'t a policy argument. Weed is easy to home-grow, mushrooms can be homegrown, cough medicine is not a dangerous material\n\nYou can control cannabis and mushroom imports, and their only use is to manufacture drugs.  You can\'t control potatoes, grapes, plums, or many grains used in alcohol production.  Do you want to be the guy who tries to outlaw rice in Singapore?  The other drugs which can be extracted from pharmaceuticals require labs, which requires expertise and are generally hazardous to the person making it.  In contrast, distilling liquor is easy and low maintenance.  So yes, outlawing alcohol is less politically likely and more futile than outlawing most drugs.\n\n>Alcohol is a cytotoxic...\n\nYes, it\'s dangerous.  It probably is a net economic/health negative.  But it\'s not going to go away, and some absurdly high percentage of people don\'t want it to go away.  Countries should eliminate cigarette usage, but can\'t do that either.  None of that has any bearing on whether we should allow new potentially harmful substances to a country when they are currently  nonexistent in that country.  If you say ""X is already here, so Y should be too"" -- well, great, but that\'s not how it works.  In practice you don\'t open the floodgates because you have a drip that you can\'t patch (or a stream, or a torrent).\n\n>Responsibility\n\nI agree with a lot of what you say (not too much personal experience with a bunch of it, so will take your word for it). I think you are saying that a key factor is that alcohol by and large is a slow poison (and hard to od) and the addiction process is also fairly easy to avoid.  My understanding is that some of the ""scary"" lab drugs can have immediate addiction effects on the brain and aren\'t as well studied.  LSD is kind of in the gray area for me - I guess a case could be made for it but it\'s nowhere near as well understood as alcohol and weed, right?  Policy on the whole would be conservative if there\'s a\npossible public health risk, so for me personally I\'d be pretty cautious- it\'d have to be pretty well proven and backed by companies whose directors are reputable and willing to bear liability to bring it to market.  If no one\'s willing to swear that it\'s safe enough for consumption at the risk of bankruptcy and/or a lifetime in jail, I wouldn\'t bring it into a country.  That\'s a minimum condition- plenty of bad actor companies out there.  Maybe LSD will make it to that point in our lifetimes but probably not, eh?\n', '> Preface: We are not going to change each other\'s minds, but idea exchange is still awesome to me.\n\nThat is true, but I still enjoy the conversation. \n\nYou are right, alcohol isn\'t going away and I am not pleading for that either. Its just usually the perfect case against hardliners, because most of the reasons against drugs perfectly apply to alcohol too, and they usually don\'t even stop to wonder. Its often just a PSA tape being repeated. To illustrate that case, there are some amazing actual ""educational movies""/PSAs on drugs from the last century, that show how crazy some of the misinformation is. E.g. ""[Reefer Madness](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esfKfTBGadg)"" is a glorious example. Its from the 30s but has still been shown to american friends of mine in school in the late 70s. Its about weed, which many people nowadays have a reference frame for. But the ""educational material"" on most other drugs nowadays is no less outrageous. Other than heroin, crack and (partially) meth, most public information is completely made up, today as much as ""yesterday"". \n\nIndoctrination with this topic is a real thing, and I don\'t oppose a tough stance, but I advocate for more well-reflected opinions than those that many people take for granted. Especially in the medical field, where it actually hurts the patient if its not the case. I would love to talk for hours about the political history of the topic, as well as scientific body for certain substances, but I don\'t try to convince anyone to approve of a topic that they do not see a need for. The topic finds itself when necessary and the texts don\'t go away. Text is patient.\n\n>  In practice you don\'t open the floodgates because you have a drip that you can\'t patch (or a stream, or a torrent).\n\nI love that quote. Very pragmatic and certainly true.\n\nThanks for the conversation, Mate.']"

tutlavie,ih22in,[JC] How is your typical weekend study schedule like?,2020-08-27 00:27:55,SGExams,77673,15,14,"Hello! I‚Äôm a J1 here, genuinely here to seek advice on how to plan out weekend studying schedule! :)

I did average for my mid years, but what‚Äôs buzzing in my mind now is that I realise I tend to go all out, studying hard on the weekdays, but end up wasting my weekends away, just by sleeping, eating and watching youtube. So i typically end up wasting my entire weekend, and only being productive during the weekdays.

TBH I find it easier and comfortable studying during the weekdays during curriculum, and also after school, because there is already some kind of structure i have to follow. However, when it comes to the weekends i feel i somehow have too much freedom of time, because i have zero weekend activities, don‚Äôt have tuition those, and minimal family bonding due to certain issues. So, i‚Äôm an independent kiddo here, trying to figure things out :D 

I‚Äôve planned, but since i have no activities, I literally have nothing besides studying, eating, showering and sleeping to fill up with. I don‚Äôt know what else to do with my weekend time. I have singing as my hobby but that is just distracting me too much (I get too addicted!) while studying so i tend to put it away totally for academics sake when exams are nearing. Usually i also video call my friends online, but it‚Äôs for pure studying and we don‚Äôt chit chat for much, so I would consider that under studying also. 
More so now that a new wave of exams are coming, i guess only ideal way to spend my weekends will be just to stay home and study. But this is where i hope to hear some sharings from fellow JC mates out here, about how your weekend schedules are like. 

Some questions regarding weekends:

Q1: On weekends, How much time in total to actually allocate for studying? 

Q2: How much do you sleep? 

Q3: What other activities do you usually spend your weekends on ? 

Q4: If possible, do y‚Äôall mind describing a typical Saturday/Sunday of yours? 

Q5: Do you guys actually follow your planned schedules or sometimes just go with the feels? If go with the feels, how to gauge if your at least doing the minimum? (Setting quota still?) 

Thanks for reading and helping out! :^D
I will really appreciate any sharings!

In most situation, making a wrong choice results in a poor payout, eg I try to steal honey from a bee hive without preparation and I get stung. That's about as natural as it gets, and being stung is also about the bees doing it so they can go about their lives in peace. If you're looking at the word natural in another way, perhaps you could explain. \n\nI would say that you're actually both right and wrong in the last sentence, if by system, you mean the justice system in Singapore.

For example, it is well known that marijuana addiction rates in the US are somewhere in the ballpark of 10%, just google it and you'll get a ton of results about this."", 'Wrong.', ""Natural here refers to the absence of agents influencing the outcome of the cause. So getting stung by bees is natural, nobody is there direct the bees to attack you. But getting punished after breaking a law is not natural. A group of people passed the law, with full intention that if someone breaks it, he/she would face certain consequences, and then employs a centralised institution of power to enforce this consequence.\n\nThe problem here is that the death penalty is an extreme measure aimed at the poor. For a middle class salaryman, a lengthy jail sentence is more than enough to deter him to find other means to get rich. For the lower class society misfits, jail sentences are normalised and don't carry that much weight, an extreme penalty would be necessary. Though I would argue if it works\n\nSo we have a system that intentionally targets the lowest members of society with the death penalty. That to me is a moral issue which we should not advocate for"", ""You're probably right actually. But dont they do that a lot for drugs?"", 'Educate me then, how would you consume in moderation, meth, heroin, ecstasy?', 'You\'re shifting goalposts, the article talks about heroin smuggling and you talk about marijuana.

If you want to twist my words and go ""gotcha!"" With the marijuana stats, at least read and comprehend what the previous comment was written in relation to.\n\nMy opinion on marijuana? Don\'t care, if the government wants to legalise it, fine by me. It\'s not too bad a substance by most standards. \n\nHeroin and meth? You sure about that?', 'Ah, I see. Would it be fair to say that you think all governmental institutions to be unnatural? Perhaps even society as a whole, since it give rise to a need for regulation? \n\nI would not agree to your second paragraph. The death penalty is not targeted at the poor, at least not that I have heard of. Would be really interested if you have a credible source to back up that statement. What they are targeted at is at ppl who believes that the benefits outweigh the risks. And having less to lose makes ppl more willing to take chances, which is perfectly natural, I believe. It is an unfortunate happenstance, but no way targeted on purpose. \n\nAgain, I would say that your third paragraph is outright wrong. The drug laws are targeted at people who partake in the drug trade in any way, be it transport or distribution. The death sentence is but one of the possible outcome. I will agree that the death sentence is a moral issue, but you seem to be saying that the laws are deliberately applying the death sentence to the lowest members of the society, which, unless you can substantiate, would be a very serious allegation.', ""In relation to international cooperation - they do - we have Interpol. But the problem with the solution is that it's dependent on each country's enforcement. So for instance, if police in country A is efficient and Country B is inefficient, and A and B cooperate, B is the limiting factor.\n\nThat's the problem between Mexico/Colombia and the US, and applies everywhere with porous borders."", 'Everytime somebody tries to compare hard drugs with alcohol and cigarette I would ask them to imagine if hard drugs are as readily available as the latter two would this world still function the same way without any significant impact?

There are tons of people who only abuse drugs occasionally and go about their daily lives fine. There are also tons of high functioning drug users with addictions and are negatively affected, but to describe their lives as ruined and families destroyed would be ridiculous.\n\nSame as alcohol and cigarettes. Many social drinkers and smokers, and many addicts with good families and contribute to society.\n\nContrary to what CNB tell primary school kids, you don't get addicted after a single use. Heroin is a dangerous drug with high addiction potential, but it takes habitual use for our brain chemistries to adapt and adjust before addiction happens. Same with meth, but to a smaller extent.\n\nMuch of the harmful stuff in ecstasy is in the meth that's mixed in it. MDMA itself is hardly addictive."", 'You take it once every few months as all sensible users do.', '[deleted]', ""that's not the point."", 'Are you being serious right now?

I\'m not sure what you\'re trying to imply here\n\nI\'m not advocating for drug use, hard or soft. I\'m against the misinformed narrative of ""drugs destroy lives, hence we must destroy the traffickers lives"". Drugs do negatively affect people\'s lives in significant manner, but they\'re not some poison pill that indiscriminately hooks you once you take it. I.e. If you dosed someone against their will just once, it\'s not like they will uncontrollably come back for more.

CloudDevelic,g5tofw,My 2 Cents about the non-essential F&B ban #unpopularopinion,2020-04-22 11:18:45,singapore,378759,33,2,"I thought for a while and hesitated about posting this but after thinking through about this again and again, I've decided to give my potentially unpopular 2 cents.

I do know that it's absolutely necessary for this Circuit Breaker. I do know that Covid-19 is a super tough SOB to fight. I do know that we have no choice because of many other reasons including people repeatedly flaunting the CB rules which partially caused this to extend in the 1st place.

I'm aware of the BBT ""last minute yolo party"" queue last night. While like many of the Singaporeans where I'm tempted to immediately scoff and jump in to criticize them, I thought for a while and decided to take a moment, and think through in regards to their situation, thoughts and feelings at that moment. 

Why do people seem to forgo all logic and common sense for something as trivial as a dumb cup of sugar, tea and boba? Why is it that we can still manage to stay home as much as we can but upon hearing about the non-essential F&B ban, we lose all of our bearings and do ridiculous actions?

A lot of our lives have been disrupted out of the blue, with some of us handling it while others are breaking down entirely. You would see people doing funny stuff like using exercising as an excuse to go out, taking buses and intentionally going to far places, people using buying food as an excuse to go out etc. Does it sound stupid? Yes. But is it sad? Yes. Our lives have just been forcefully disrupted out of the sudden after all.

Also it's the 1st time that us as a nation, we had to observe such protocols in the longest time ever as a modern nation. Is this a #firstworldproblem ? Absolutely yes. 
But is it hard? Yes as well.

I'm pretty sure that many of us definitely have 1-2 snacks/comfort food of our liking/choice lying around at home such as loaves of bread, cakes, chips, crisps, soft drinks etc or whichever other sort of foods that you like during this period of CB. Now imagine having none of these for 1 month, and having to coop up at home + some of us facing personal issues or the aftermath of getting retrenched due to Covid-19. Would you be able to truly be alright, if this has been dealt to you on top of all the other stuff that has been handed to you?

In my humble opinion, food itself holds an important role even if we should be living to eat and not eating to live. Countless times in history have shown that food can make or break a nation/army. Food has been shown to be a mercy, comfort and deliverance for this harsh existence of our lives. Food has been made as our joy and blessing that we can afford to enjoy even in the toughest moments.

Thus, having thought all of these points made me feel sad and wanting to empathise with people instead of wanting to laugh/scoff/mock/scold them. It made me feel helpless about this pandemic as our hands are tied, yet we cannot do anything about it other than abiding by these extreme measures to combat this pandemic. It is all the more in such tough times that we as a nation should work together to support our brothers and sisters to overcome this together (yes, even the less bright ones). This saying is already overused and lame af but ""together we stand, divided we fall"" still holds true.

This is what happens when you divide community numbers from foreign numbers and give people a false sense of security.\n\nSince bbt = essential for some ppl + being relatively safe, not surprised to see people queuing for bbt.\n\nIt is the same as CB right.

(Imagine ntuc say they close down for 6weeks, obviously ppl would queue.)\n\nBut for bubble tea, its a totally different case. Its not a need, its more of a want.\nYes there may be some ppl that are addicted to bubble tea but im sure it is very low in numbers or maybe none at all. I know there would be a queue, but the length of the queue yest is really absurd. \n\nMost of the people who queued yesterday are still living okay, they have time and less struggle in their current lives, hence they can afford to go down and dont mind spending large amounts of time to queue for bubble tea. And neither are they addicted to bubble tea, if not there would be a case study in singapore on ppl addiction to bubble tea before this pandemic even happened \nThis means that actually they can forego this bubble tea urge even if they like it so bad like u said u did, they(not u) need to use their logic. When they see a queue forming up, they should know that crowding is bad at a time like this, and no choice get it after this cb ends. No choice. \n\n\nThose who are legit struggling, wouldnt even want to queue up for the bubble tea when they see the long queue unless bubble tea is damn critical for them. Some of them couldnt even care less, there are more pressing issues in their life.\n\nYea i understand ur pov that we shouldnt judge, maybe a few of them rlly have a valid reason to get the bubble tea. But not the majority of ppl that went to queue, its rlly irresponsible of them. I think u are being too kind to them.', 'While I understand and appreciate your sympathy and the message you\'re trying to convey there\'s a couple of issues which need addressing.\n\nFirstly: the ""so and so is instrumental to so and so\'s mental health"" argument is only going to result in an extremely slippery slope in that everyone will suddenly throw the mental health card as an excuse to ignore the circuit breaker measures which exist for good reason; and ultimately this issue is greater than just one individual.\n\nAn example I like to bring up is the issue of ""emotional support animals"" in the United States. They\'ve been abused to the point of insanity just so people can bring pets to places which are otherwise strictly ""pet free."" Yeah, everyone needs emotional support; but sometimes we need to temporarily find new avenues to cope.\n\nWe are already aware of the very real existence of hidden hot-spots; so let\'s imagine that because of a bunch of simpletons ignoring safe distancing and otherwise leaving their house for no good reason other than to selfishly satisfy a craving we now have a new explosion of cases and the the lock-down is extended, who\'s to blame?\n\nI get that this is a difficult time for everyone, but it only takes a small percentage of the population to ignore the circuit breaker to make it almost impossible to contain the virus; and spending unnecessary time outside queuing for a luxury commodity does not help ***anyone*** if the net result is yet another circuit breaker extension.\n\nPeople need come to terms with the fact that if we don\'t make sacrifices now, then this journey is going to be a lot longer and harder than most of us can tolerate and that will subsequently start a vicious and never-ending cycle of ""I need to go out"" -> virus spreads more -> lock-down extended -> ""now I really need to go out"" -> etc.\n\nAnd to address bubble tea directly: I absolutely refuse to believe that anyone can possibly have such a serious addiction to this crap that there doesn\'t exist any suitable interim substitute. If you\'ve got that bad of a sugar craving most supermarkets are still stocked through the roof with snacks and other sugary delicacies.\n\nSo while yes food is important and I do like a good snack every so often myself, I do realize that sacrifices need to be made and having a sole dependency is just ridiculous.', 'No excuses.

Were they expecting anything different?\n\nThis food hoarding, bbt queuing and hair cut queues are brought on because people think of the upcoming restrictions and some may argue that it is the uncertainty that drove up the ""need"" of it, but PM said very clearly in his speech yesterday that *This circuit breaker will apply for one month, in the first instance.* A month is not too long to form a habit, and not too short to try creating alternatives.\n\nI don\'t think it is comparable to a war, because staples are still provided without the need to compete for them. Food isn\'t being rationed, supply remains the same. Not all bubbleteas will be gone, it is only ""brand names"" that will cease operation during that month. At this time, it just depends on their flexibility and openness to other substitutes.

Gohbraztsovashka,hnzl9e,What do you think of our approach to rehabilitation and substance abuse prevention/education?,2020-07-09 16:39:34,askSingapore,44636,4,4,"
I‚Äôm a recovering addict and I have many tales to tell. I have gone through both private and government treatment in both the US and in Singapore. There‚Äôs obviously pros and cons for each country‚Äôs approach and each system‚Äôs approach but for now I‚Äôd like to open this to the floor. 

I‚Äôll update this post with my own experiences if the responses facilitate an open and respectful discussion. 

What do you think treatment should be?

Who should qualify for treatment?

Should treatment be covered by our insurance? 

What programs did or didn‚Äôt work for you in terms of preventing substance abuse?

Do you think it‚Äôs better to be taught objectively the effects of substances and what to do if someone is potentially in danger? 

Do you think having the fear of god/your parents whipped into you at school is a better form of education?

kuang89,hi0gub,One issue I hope this Election will address,2020-06-29 22:06:39,singapore,378759,38,9,"A bit of background: I‚Äôm an investor in Tesla stocks. 

One of the things I noticed is the decarbonisation of vehicles globally.

For example: 
- California just ruled that by 2024, vans and trucks must be electric.

- Europe‚Äôs car brand vehicle co2 emission has to be below 95g/km or face a hefty fine. This will be reduced to 65g/km in near future. (For reference, a modern Camry co2 emission now is 95g/km.

- China is super accelerated in terms of electric cars adoption, Tesla is best selling vehicle in many segments. 

- Charging stations are aplenty. 

Given that US and China are world‚Äôs largest auto markets, the demand for gasoline (petrol/diesel) will be phasing out by regulation and market forces. 

Meaning, in future more and more cars imported in Singapore (or south east Asia) will be electric as manufacturers stop making internal combustion engine cars. 

I look around us and see that we only have BlueSG which seems backwards and few in numbers. 

Given that by 2030, pretty much a lot of cars will be electric, how will SG govt react to it? 

I glanced through a few manifestos, this isn‚Äôt mentioned at all. Isn‚Äôt anticipating key global issues hallmarks of our country‚Äôs governing style? 

And not long ago, we got into a fiasco where Elon Musk made fun of us for being backwards about electric cars. 

What do you all think?

Edit: apart from the car models, I should also mention about the infrastructure of charging EVs as well. 

EVs now are costly but over time with the acceptance of EVs, hopefully reduced charging costs, it‚Äôll make sense. 

Someone pointed out that our country has reliance on oil refinery, which I agree. I doubt these oil major owned refineries and petrol station will allow that to happen as it‚Äôs their rice bowl. 

We have to reduce our reliance on oil. 

Someone in US said, they are addicted to oil. Which is true considering till now petrol is still the liveblood of cars considering how old it is. 

We have improved our computers from cabinet size to pocket size and yet the major improvements in combustion engines is the race to consume less petrol.",0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hi0gub/one_issue_i_hope_this_election_will_address/,"['Sg gov is pretty against electric cars, prolly becos of the amount of infrastructure needed to support it (imagine all the chargers you must put in hdb carparks) and maybe becos we‚Äôre heavily involved in petrochemical refining so a worldwide decline in demand for petrol will greatly affect that sector.', '> we only have BlueSG \n\nNissan Leaf, Hyundai Ioniq, BMW i3, Renault Zoe.\n\nBut ultimately, the government wants to focus on public transport in terms of being green. Then maybe small, affordable electric cars. Luxury cars like Tesla are always going to be an afterthought. \n\nWhen that fiasco happened quite a few years ago, the Tesla car in question was a used car that did not perform anywhere near the specs that Tesla claimed (for a new car). The pollution that would have been generated to produce the electricity to charge that car made it fall into a tax disincentive bracket. Elon Musk reacted in a childish way.\n\nI understand that technology has improved and at least one model of Tesla cars is eligible for the highest level of VES rebate now.', 'They dont encourage car ownership  at all regardless of engine. Maybe they will adopt electric buses.', 'I think if we are serious about decarbonization, electric cars may be at the lower end of the spectrum.

Yes, EV‚Äôs don‚Äôt require petrol/diesel, but they do require electricity and in Singapore, this is mainly generated by natural gas power plants. (FYI: Natural gas is the most carbon friendly fossil duel, esp compared to coal) A shift to EV‚Äôs will also reduce the fuel tariffs earned, but the government has noted this point in Budget 2020, thus a need to restructure our tax system to make up the short loss.\n\nThe main concern with a mass adoption of EV‚Äôs is its potential to overload our electrical grid. This is actually a concern globally in many cities. This electrical infrastructure will be build over the next few years as stated in Budget 2020.\n\nThe main driver for EV uptake will be the introduction of cheaper EV‚Äôs in Singapore. Until the day main manufacturers such as Toyota start mass producing EV‚Äôs, I believe the uptake will be low since it is cheaper to buy a fuel friendly hybrid instead. But this is coming (Toyota introduced EV‚Äôs in China to meet their emissions demand) and possibly expanding in the 2020s (Toyota has been sourcing batteries to meet mass production demand)\n\nSo in short, we will need the charging infrastructure and affordable vehicles. I think Tesla‚Äôs share price has given them undue attention, but they are a long way away from the industrial might and market dominance of larger car manufacturers such as Toyota and Volkswagen.

Then only Singapore can built upon it."", 'From an SCMP article - ""While road tax for internal combustion cars is pegged to every cubic centimetre of displacement; for an electric car, it‚Äôs based on kW power output.

Is it due to economic reasons?,0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/h98mul/why_are_drugs_illegal/,"[""The big issue with drugs really doesnt come from the harm on the body. I mean, if society really cares about harm on the body, mental health and obesity will be treated with a more serious tone and a gun to your head.\n\nThe main issue with drugs lie with funding to terrorism and secret society. The drug trade is largely controlled by those on the other side, especially produced by rebels and terrorists, to fund their campaigns. (Of course, we can debate if certain governments are involved and taking a cut out of it, but not the purpose of discussion here). \n\nSo, by banning drug trade and effectively curbing demand will deplete fundings to illegal organisation greatly. The margins on drugs are especially high after all. \n\nAnd on the other note yes, drugs is harmful. A society largely dependant on drugs is no joking matter, just look at the opioid epidemic in the US. It will create societal effects that cause people to stop functioning, being a burden to society and what not. \n\nSo why not alcohol and cigarettes. I think its largely to do with also how it can be taxed. Cigarettes by quantity and alcohol by volume amount. Furthermore, while these consumable have effects which are harmful, its not to the extent of drugs. Imagine the effects of heroin vs smoking. While users can highly depend on both, the effect of heroin is definitely more significant than smoking. This is also highly suspected as to why e-cigs are banned because theres no fixed amount to tax for the nicotine. \n\nBy and large, there are certain 'vices' that Singapore do tolerate, as long as it is not too much of a bane to society at large. Take prostitution for example. It is definitely a sin and what not, but it is still tolerated in singapore within a certain district."", ""I think the gov would get rid of cigarettes if they could. As for alcohol, it's okay in moderation, and there are way more things you can do with it than to just be deadbeat drunk.

But think if it‚Äôs make legal. \n\nLet says it got the same amount of percentage as people who smokes cigarettes instead of 0.001% (drug abuser) of population it becomes 14% (percentage of population who smokes;HPB Sg)\n\nYou are risking almost 700k of the populations of the social implication of drugs. Even if it‚Äôs not 14% and is just 5% is still like 100k people and the implication to the workforce will be bigger.\n\nSo why take a risk to legalise drugs and impact your country most precious resource (human). \n\nI don‚Äôt think those who abuse need to be punished though.', 'Drugs and addiction are always trailed by other crimes.\n\nAn addict will do anything to get their dose.\n\nSlippery slope.', 'How about marijuana?', ""While it arguably has much less of a chemical addiction compared to opiates - it's not without its own psychological addiction issues."", 'I would say it‚Äôs same scale as cigarettes and alcohol but just my opinion. It went from illegal to essential service in the states lol', ""Maybe but with one massive overpowering difference.\n\nThe country gets an insane amount of tax from the sales and allowing the distribution of cigarettes and alcohol.\n\nI honestly feel that weed just wouldn't be even closer enough to bring popular here to bear its own weight for the controlling of it.\n\nEven countries like Canada where it's legal now - the government thought they'd make way more money from the taxes than they have shown to.\n\nWith marijuana there's no giant industry (by comparison) driving it like smokes and booze.""]"
elizliza97,jsmdl5,To all Lost Souls in NUS/Things I Wish My Earlier Self Had Known:,2020-11-12 10:33:49,nus,21220,3,0,"Hello everyone, I just wanted to share about my struggles as a Year 2 business student and how I struggled less after exploring new things this zoom university semester. As a business student, unlike everyone else who's set on doing Finance/venturing into Investment Banking, I've been pretty lost about what to major in the future, given that the modules I've taken sparking 0 interest in me.

Some history about me:

* I picked pursuing a Business degree due to it being the most 'general' degree a university could offer. I was lost, unsure of what to pick so I ended up picking this degree. I've always thought that I would figure this out after taking certain core exposure modules like the recent Business Analytics and Marketing module, but damn... I was wrong. I'm still unsure of what I would like to do in the future (career-wise).

Thanks to Zoom University and my ample free time saved on traveling and unnecessary socializing, I have caved in to the FOMO (fear-of-missing-out) and signed up for courses online (since everyone likes to flex their certificates on LinkedIn, I figured I should pick up a course from a credible course provider hahaha....).

Out of the many that I signed up for, the only course that sparked interest in me was the Digital Marketing course I signed up with Smartcademy. *This post sounds like an AD but I swear it's not LOL.* I just wanted to share this sick resource that lost souls like me would appreciate. I wish someone told me about this earlier. I chanced upon the course's advertisement for this course online since every single school social media site was blasting it so I decided to give it a shot since it's free. Apparently, the government gives subsidies to people especially university students, so this course was essentially free for me to take.

This course really sparked my interest in [Digital Marketing](https://smartcademy.sg/intro-to-digital-marketing/) because I've always seen how after clicking on an item on ZALORA, the advertisements instantly pop up on my Instagram story feed. And this course manages to teach me the basics of how digital media works. And given that I am a social media addict, this really helped sparked my interest in digital marketing and I think I might be a little less lost now, I might pursue this in the future(?). This course also helps my incompetent ass (YAY I finally have something to flex!!) come up with a project that I can easily add into my portfolio for my future employers to see.

Just a PSA for all my similarly lost and confused peers, sign up for courses online especially during the holidays to chiong and figure out if you're interested in different possible career paths. I wish someone told me such (free) courses existed. I think [Smartcademy](https://smartcademy.sg/) is having crash course courses on a rolling basis so you can check them out. There are courses not only limited to Digital Marketing I think. Also, don't worry about the cash it's fully claimable if you're a poly/university student.

Jiayous guys, take advantage of all these things that are funded (especially for uni students like us)  and learn as many things as you can especially this winter!! All the best for finals!!! Hope you guys aren't as lost as me tbh hHAAHHA BUT IF YOU ARE MAYBE you could use this advice!!

Amdk: comments from nobodies go viral, featured on mainstream media. ‚ÄúWah see Amdk praise us we must be good!‚Äù

Sinkie: stupid pap internet brigade, brainwashed loser

2. Criticizing Singapore: 

Amdk: this is one area where sinkies except those spgs unite.  Everyone hates on amdks who crticise sg even when the critique is sound. Even nobody amdks get viral when they criticize sg. 

Sinkie: wE cAn d0 bETt3r!!! 

3.  accents

Amdk: wow  inherent regional accent So cool! Even the most hillbilly accent is revered as cultured. 

Sinkie: if singlish accent, loser uneducated swine. If nonsinglish, poser wannabe act atas. 

4. Mispronunciations

Amdk: wow at least they try Chinese or singlish. Nibao! Konnicheewas! Any nonstandard English pronunciation must be their own regional accent so cool!

Sinkie Mispronunciations show you are the uneducated. Cringe. Why can‚Äôt you follow the British or Americans?

5. Hitting on girls

Amdk: proactive, brave, charming, romantic, manly. 

Sinkie: pervert creeps who just wanna fuck. 


6. Staying home

Amdk: family oriented, introspective, resting from a hard weeks work

Sinkie: dota addict, no life, loser. 

7. Interracial marriage

Amdk: so woke, culturally accepting, humble in adapting to foreign customs, exotic mix, beautiful babies, globe trotter. 

Sinkie: loser, cannot find Sinkiebu, mail order bride, dota addict. 

8. Studied overseas in university no one has heard of

Amdk: no problem, we will still hire you. Experience is what matters. 

Sinkie: loser, cannot go to a real university, degree mill, go drive grab. 

9. Kids running wild in public

Amdk: gentle touch, modern parenting, free range play based education, beautiful creative kids with spontaneity and zest for life

Sinkie: report on stomp, useless parents 

10. Living in hdb

Amdk: thrifty, integrate with locals, anthropologist, zoologist

Sinkie: loser, poor, dota addict.

Edit: 11. Humour

Amdk: not laughing at Sinkie jokes = high class, cultures. Got sense of humour if laugh at amdk jokes. 

Sinkie: laughing at Sinkie jokes = low class, loser.

I realised that how people perceive others could be affected by some factors, which determine if we see them as superior/inferior/equal. This in turn could bias how we view their actions. I think its much more complicated than that but we simplify it for the sake of discussion here.\n\nFor whatever reason, somehow, westerners were perceived to be superior compared to a normal sinkie. Consequently, there comes some sort of bias where we subconsciously try to interpret their actions favourably to fit our subconscious narrative of them.\n\nThere is a pattern. Koreans and/or Japanese can be substituted into your double standards. If let‚Äôs say an average Bangladeshi or China person tried some the things you listed, they might end up as badly judged as a sinkie. What is the difference between how we view westerners/koreans/japanese vs bangla/china? Most of us know the answer to that rhetorical question.\n\nEven within sinkies there is a variation in those double standards. A handsome very rich/famous sinkie guy would most likely fall under most, if not all of the amdk side. A handsome sinkie guy would fall under the amdk side for most part (esp. the first 3 examples of yours). An average sinkie might hit or miss some of them. A below average sinkie will definitely fall under the sinkie side. No doubt you can formulate and assign those examples into the spectrum of superiority-inferiority in descending order.\n\nIts more like the other side of the coin of the attractive vs unattractive double standard. Its like an attractive guy can give flowers and stuff to girls, and they are deemed brave, etc. The unattractive dude can do the same thing, and people might think they are creeps, etc. Without much doubt, many do view the attractive as superior and the unattractive as inferior, and thus its no surprise we interpret their actions accordingly to fit our subconscious narrative. Similar things appear to happen in this amdk vs sinkie thing, and it is definitely not confined to just us alone.\n\nIts quite sad really, for us to bias against other people, sometimes so blatantly and arrogantly, for no fault of their own (no one chose to be born that way/in that situation/stuck in that loop in life).', '>Even the most hillbilly accent is revered as cultured.\n\nYou sure?

Yeah, I didn‚Äôt do well for As (68RP). I‚Äôm thinking of retaking As/take a gap year while still working to buy some time of what I really want to do in life, but literally everyone advises against it.

Honestly, I dread going to uni. I applied to NUS and NTU but I doubt if I can enter with my low RP. And then again, I‚Äôm not too sure about the courses that I applied to. What do I really want to do in the future?

Right now, I‚Äôm currently working part-time and I enjoy my job. I look forward to going to work (didn‚Äôt felt this when in JC.) Truthfully, I would rather work than study now.

Realistically, you can survive without a degree but you might not have that many job opportunities, and you'll have a lower starting pay. If you're unsure of what to do now, I'd recommend taking a gap year to try out different jobs, and be open to new experiences.

Going to uni IMMEDIATELY really is a problem especially in this country imo.

And since the rich usually gets away with drug abuse due to bribery, I think its fair to offer the lower rung of society a chance to turn over a new leaf', '> ""This is not to be mistaken for legalising drugs, and I again categorically emphasise that decriminalising does NOT mean that we are legalising drugs,"" he said in a statement on Thursday (June 28)\n\n> Dr Dzulkefly clarified that decriminalisation is the ""removal of criminal penalties for possessing and using a small quantity of drugs for personal use, as opposed to those who are involved in trafficking of drugs"".\n\n> He added that drug trafficking will continue to remain a crime.\n\nDon\'t be mistaken, drugs are still illegal for usage in Malaysia. It\'s just that this change (if it goes through) will mean that you won\'t get screwed for possession.

Who‚Äôs next, Brunei? This is surprisingly progressive', 'All drugs?', 'Let me point out that this is not a novel approach, and you don\'t have to quote Portugal for that. There are two different things:\n\n\\- Decriminalization of drug use means drug users are not punished with criminal sentences for the mere act of using the drugs. They might be arrested but then receive a court mandated rehab order. If people want to get drugs, they still have to find a shady guy for it.\n\n\\- Legalization means the mere act of selling of drugs is not criminalized; however, this does not mean unregulated, as many people tend to say so. Tobacco and alcohol are legal, but heavily taxed and regulated: you can only sell in certain venues within certain period of time, to people above certain age, and you might not be able to stand in the middle of Orchard road chugging a bottle of vodka and getting visibly drunk. Same thing for pharmaceuticals: your products need to adhere to certain standards and only certain qualified people can sell it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSingapore ""decriminalize"" drug use a long time ago. This might come at a surprise for most Singaporeans but the way the Misuse of Drug Acts works is when a person is caught in possession of Schedule I drug, they are sorted into Drug Trafficker and Abuser. How? For each drug, there is a ""intention to traffic"" threshold. This threshold is lower than the death penalty threshold but high enough that it would be prohibitively expensive to purchase that much drugs at street retail price for the average drug user.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nArrested Drug Abusers had to undergo court-mandated drug rehabilitation program. This program is not very successful, judging by the fact that each year, about two thirds of the drug abusers arrested by the CNB are repeated abusers. Singapore, unlike the USA, do not have mandatory life jail sentences for people caught with repeated possession charges (three strikes rule). There is no scientific consensus on what constitute an effective drug rehab program (unlike, for example, how to stop blood lost from a bleeding amputated limb). Alcoholic Anonymous 12 steps program is pretty cultist in nature (appeal to a higher power). You can get repeatedly arrested in Singapore for mere possession and use of drugs without suffering much more than some very boring time with boring therapists.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlaces like China and Vietnam treat drug addicts in rehab programs as quasi-prisoners and forced labour. They are forced to do dangerous work such as manufacturing disposable chopsticks involving dangerous chemicals without much protection or the minimal OSHA guidelines. Such labour in Vietnam can involve peeling cashew nuts fruits, which is actually pretty poisonous (think poison ivy), and can cause serious skin poisoning and reaction.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nSingapore maintain an image of draconian drug laws people who don\'t read too deeply into the CNB. The reality is it actually has some of the softest laws on the planet when it comes to drug misuse.

I think it's dumb to jail addicts. Rehab is what they need, not jail. Fuck the dealers, though. \n\nMy main concern as I stated previously is that I would prefer singapore to remain relatively drug free. I think there are several benefits to this, for example it adds to our image of being a stable country which is more attractive to businesses. Of course this needs to be balanced against the bad rep we get for having harsh drug laws, but idk what the calculus is on that. Again, I would like to emphasize that I am well aware that weed itself is not nearly as nerfarious as the govt claims it to be, but I personally hold the belief that legalising weed will open the door for people to call for other drugs to be legalised. Give an inch and they will take a foot, so to speak. I see communities elsewhere with rampant drug use and I ask myself if it's really worth it to relax drug laws and give vulnerable, addiction prone people another thing they can get addicted to.\n\nMy disdain for drugs in general is informed by personal experience with druggies but I guess I won't get into that here?

You don't know what I feel about alcohol, so maybe don't throw out accusations?

But I\'ll narrow down the points based your posts just so it would be more relatable. \n\n> Can you explain why you want it legalised and not simply decriminalised? \n\nThis is a bad idea IMO in Singapore\'s context. Decriminalization is a grey zone between legal and illegal and will attract black marketeers. \n\nThe idea of decriminalization is that no one will be charged for possession and consumption but selling it will still be illegal. Ok to consume but not ok to trade means the trade part will be managed by gangsters and cartels instead of respectable retailers/distributors who are willing to get a license for it.\n\nFor your second paragraph,\n\nI don\'t think Singapore\'s image will be affected much if we do eventually legalize it. There haven\'t been any gigantic negative image shift on any cities that have legalized Cannabis so I don\'t see any reason it will affect Singapore greatly. \n\n> legalising weed will open the door for people to call for other drugs to be legalised \n\nActually, this so far have been slightly true. Legalization of cannabis have raised calls for legalizing (with regulation) certain other soft drugs as well. Ecstasy (MDMA) was first created as a useful psychiatric medication but the governments of the world made it illegal because people used it as a party drug. So now, MDMA is still big in the party scene despite its illegality but psychiatrist are still not allowed to prescribe it despite its usefulness. So its not only cannabis but people are re-evaluating other drugs that were banned for dubious reason.\n\n> worth it to relax drug laws and give vulnerable, addiction prone people another thing they can get addicted to. \n\nAt this point, my personal stance is that we need to separate the people who can abuse it, people who are benignly using it recreationally and those who can really benefit from it medically.\n\nWe cannot be blinded by people who will be negatively affected by it when there are people who will benefit from it.\n\nI\'m sure you\'ve heard from medical cannabis and I won\'t go into too much detail about it, just that personally, my late father suffered from cancer and I\'ve learnt about medical cannabis that could somehow help him a little but can\'t do it because it is illegal. People like by late father should be allowed access to medical cannabis, even as a last ditch hope of living a peaceful last few months.\n\nAt this point, you may wonder why I don\'t just support for medical cannabis only?\n\nWell, later on I\'ve learnt how much of a trouble this stance have on other cities around the world. The problem with legalizing medical cannabis only is that the government still decides on who gets to get medical cannabis and who don\'t. They create a guideline and they can create bullshit guide lines like ""only Stage 4 cancer patients who literally tried everything is allowed to use medical cannabis on his/her deathbed"", which is essentially useless as a medical cannabis program other than in name.\n\nSo that\'s why I support full legalization. So everyone can get it, especially ones who really need it, without any red tape bullshit.', 'Hypocrisy by the sg (and many other) governments. Not speaking about you specifically.', ""I mentioned in my initial reply that we should consider medical cannabis seperately though? And it seems that that is exactly the stance that gahmen is taking too? Just because other governments failed to properly make guidelines regarding its use doesn't mean that will be the case here either. Let's not sugarcoat, western governments especially US are utter crap at this kind of thing.\n\nAnd I disagree that we should legalise it despite a few bad eggs. Those few bad eggs will make life worse for people around them, not just themselves. Do the societal benefits outweigh the cons? This is a question that's up to the individual I guess. For me the calculus is that it doesn't, for you it does. That's fine."", 'Well the answer is pretty obvious no? Long history and normalisation behind alcohol consumption means its virtually impossible to ban without major local and international backlash.', '\nDo we ban booze because alcoholics exist?', ""That is the answer, you are completely right. It just angers me that we haven't evolved in our thinking (although that is slowly changing around the world).

A couple of years later it was found to cause birth defects and was withdrawn. Sadly, by then around 10,000 babies had already been born with permanent disabilities from deformed or missing limbs.\n\n> If the authorities had properly safety tested this drug before allowing it to be prescribed to pregnant women, this would not have happened.\n\n> This lesson is what we call the precautionary principle: If we don‚Äôt know the potential harms of a drug, we find out before we roll it out to the masses.\n\n> Most countries should have learned this lesson by now but apparently they have not, going by what is happening with e-cigarettes and vaping in the United States.\n\n> In recent weeks 18 people have died, the youngest just 20 years old, and\xa0 more than\xa01,000 have developed mystery lung illnesses thought to be linked to vaping.\n\n> These people are otherwise healthy and young, typically in their teens or 20s. The youngest reported case of illness was just 13 years old. The mystery illnesses resemble a pneumonia which typically starts with nausea, vomiting and shortness of breath and quickly degrades into a more serious condition where they end up hooked to a ventilator.\n\n> In an estimated 80 per cent of cases, they were vaping mixtures of substances, including marijuana oil.\n\n> And it‚Äôs not just in the US. In the United Kingdom, where vaping is common, more than\xa070 cases of vaping-related illnesses, including heart disorders, chest pains and pneumonia, have been reported.\n\n> How did it come to this?\n\n> Let‚Äôs backtrack to eight years ago, when vaping first became popular. Many people were hopeful that e-cigarettes would be a safe alternative for smokers. Others were wary of their unknown health effects. Scientists warned that vaping might cause heart disease or permanent lung injuries.\n\n> Vaping liquids usually contain a lipid base, like vegetable glycerin, to dissolve the nicotine. Most of them also include chemical flavours and additives.\n\n> The lungs are designed to inhale air, not lipids or toxic chemicals.\xa0Something that is safe to eat, like vitamin E, might be dangerous if you inhale it especially if it‚Äôs heated at a high temperature and mixed with other chemicals.\n\n> But at the same time, many people acknowledged that e-cigarettes were probably safer than cigarettes.\n\n> As the e-cigarette debates went on, many countries were slow to regulate. Only a handful of countries banned e-cigarettes from the outset, Singapore being one of them.\n\n> Meanwhile, tobacco and e-cigarette companies were selling e-cigarettes in funky colours and designs, with fruit and candy flavoured e-liquids, and aggressively marketing them to youth on social media.\n\n> A few years later, they had started a vaping epidemic among American high school students. By 2018, over a third of 12th grade students (age 16) reported that they had vaped in the past year.\xa0Many of them were also mixing other substances, like marijuana oils, into their e-cigarettes.\n\n> If the US had regulated e-cigarettes from the outset, these vaping illnesses and deaths could have been avoided.\n\n> The outlook is quite grim for most smokers. One in two will die from a tobacco-related disease.\n\n> Only around 5 per cent of all cold-turkey quit attempts are successful. If they use an approved quitting aid, like nicotine patches, the success rate increases to a modest 25 per cent.\n\n> The rush to liberalise e-cigarettes based on the belief that they\xa0could be safer than cigarettes is therefore understandable, but it is not very sensible.\n\n> When a promising new treatment appears, like the latest anti-cancer drug, it goes through years of safety testing and clinical trials. Its efficacy is compared to standard treatments such as other anti-cancer drugs. Only after the drug passes these tests is it given to patients.\n\n> This is an example of the precautionary principle applied in practice. Yes, it means that patients who need the drug right now will miss out.\n\n> But it also avoids opening a can of worms, should the drug have deadly side effects or other unintended consequences.\n\n> Or, in the case of vaping, if it should give more than\xa01,000 people a deadly lung illness.\n\n> Not a single e-cigarette on the market has met typical safety or efficacy standards that apply for medicines.\xa0Little is known on their long-term safety; even less on the health effects of substance mixes like e-liquid and marijuana oil combinations.\n\n> Worse still, vaping has become extremely popular among young people who would otherwise not be hooked on nicotine.\n\n> E-cigarettes are now banned in more than\xa020 countries. More countries, such as India, are following suit.\xa0As it turns out, Singapore‚Äôs decision to never allow e-cigarette sales in the first place was a wise one.\n\n> This is because, as illustrated by the US‚Äô experience, it is easier to contain a problem before it starts than it is to close a can of worms.\n\n> \xa0\n\n> ABOUT THE AUTHOR:\n\n> Yvette Van Der Eijk is Senior Research Fellow at the Saw Swee Hock School of Public Health, National University of Singapore.\n\n> \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'In before someone says ""I told you so"".', 'Me as a Singaporean living abroad: *takes 4 hits of weed vape* Lol oops', ""Most of the deadly cases involved marijuana oil, as the author admits and glosses over.

babyemmss,j5dlrr,[o level] tips on studying during this season,2020-10-05 13:05:41,SGExams,77673,1,14,"
hey guys here‚Äôs some tips that i personally use while studying, for me i‚Äôm like an adhd kid HAHAHAH i can‚Äôt stand sitting for too long and study gotta move my ass around ü§ìü§ìso no mugging 3-5 h straight for me  that kind as i‚Äôll feel restless in between and it‚Äôs hard to get back on track i got u ! i usually start my day at 9-10am !!
-firstly for me i love to start my day by going for a walk in the park or gardens for 1-2h depending on how long you want ,by doing so i get to breathe fresh air and it makes me feel good to just observe the scenery and at the same time clock my 10k steps a day HAHAHA the thing is exercising helps with bringing up your endorphins and all which helps you to be more productive in whatever your doing 
-also starting your day with a wholesome breakfast helps for me ,i usually walk from my house to shopping mall to sit and chill at some cafe and just read the news/reddit/instagram blabla yep makes me feel like i‚Äôm enjoying life and at the same time i feel damn good lolol it boosts my mood somehow so by the time i actually study would be from 12- maybe 3 or 4? in between i‚Äôll just stretch and walk around the house and if i feel that nothing goes in anymore don‚Äôt force yourself to study trust me you‚Äôre better off doing something else ... so maybe i‚Äôll just use my phone for an hour or so and get back doing
-i‚Äôm a person that pushes quantity over quality so it‚Äôs an internal conflict that i have to deal with that i have to keep on telling myself that it‚Äôs okay to do lesser and really zoom in and spend time on those questions that i really need to learn and really get it instead of just keep spamming.
-for me i usually study till like 5-6pm max then i‚Äôll just relax and do whatever i want and start at 8pm till maybe 10? then it‚Äôs the end of the day for me ,it‚Äôs scary and daunting knowing that your kinda studying so little and being so laid back compared to others but trust me if your not spending your time to go for walk you‚Äôll probably using your phone and you‚Äôll get addicted to it
so for me my logic is i rather go for walk for 1-2h than use my phone and get hooked onto it :D 
hope it helps and feel free to ask your qns away i‚Äôm more than happy to help and answer your struggles.im not a study material and i have short attention span i feel y‚Äôall too~ but by doing all these it helps me by a lot ! i think if i really really study maybe only 4-5hours a day .short but productive instead of stoning or daydreaming there HAHAHAHAü§´ü§´",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j5dlrr/o_level_tips_on_studying_during_this_season/,"[""SGExams has a [whole library](https://exams.sg/library) of study resources and notes for your mugging endeavours!

**This sub was created so that people living in Singapore have a safe space to share their experience/knowledge in mental health.** We know that the stigma is still out there, and getting help may be difficult especially during times like this.

There are other subs created specifically for mental health/illness/conditions, but we hope that the presence of a local one helps you relate to one another better.

1. **Please be mindful and sensitive of your words** when commenting as people on here might already be fragile.

2. **Do provide links/sources** to back your information up (if possible) to ensure they are credible. This also increases the level of trust in the community. Make sure they‚Äôre reliable!

3. **Do add a Trigger Warning** (TW) if your post has certain information that may be triggering for others. A heads up will be greatly appreciated!

4. **Do add flairs** for future reference/for Redditors to scroll through (currently only mods can add flairs).

5. **DO NOT SHARE MEDICAL ADVICE IF YOU ARE NOT A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL**. Please only support with your own experience.

6. **NO DRUG SEEKING IS ALLOWED**. We will not hesitate to ban and report said Redditors - both on here and to the authorities, unless you‚Äôre seeking support on addiction.

All in all, let‚Äôs keep this place a safe one for everybody.

Thank you and have a good day y‚Äôall!

Bryanlegend,ddcmuo,Punishment vs Rehabilitation,2019-10-05 04:01:34,singapore,378759,46,61,"I think there has been a lot of discussions on the recent cases involving university students who are guilty of sexual offences. It seems to me on this sub that most people are of the view that said offenders should have received harsher punishments and not be allowed mitigations based on their academic performances and other related factors.

It also appears that while most people here are supportive of more punitive responses to such crimes, almost none of us are concerned with the rehabilitation of such perpetrators or with the detrimental effects more punitive measures could have on their rehabilitation. It‚Äôs as if we have decided collectively as a society that these people are lepers that should be casted out and left to fend for themselves. It‚Äôs as if we have decided that these people are not worthy of any redemption. Basically, all we are saying is ‚Äúlet‚Äôs lock them up‚Äù without actually caring about ‚Äúwhat do we do about them next‚Äù. 

I can‚Äôt help but feel that the systematic way we treat and outcast people who commit such crimes is the reason why we have a culture where sexual crimes and misconduct are so perpetuated and normalised. In another thread, we see how there are telegram channels with thousand of members dedicated to voyeuristic contents, many of which involve children and teenagers. This is a worrying trend and I personally feel that this is a result of us avoiding the elephant in the room. Discussions about sex are usually considered taboo here in our culture and especially so for certain sexual compulsions. We fear discussing issues like these so much, we have no choice but to compartmentalise it as something completely abhorrent. The only reasonable response to that for us would be to chuck them into a small corner away from our lives(both figuratively and literally), and avoid having to deal with them again. 

However, being outcasted with nowhere to go, people with sexual compulsions and tendencies have to resort to forming their own in-groups as a show of solidarity and to feel ‚Äúnormal‚Äù again. This might be a very warped sense of belonging but it is the only way for them to feel like a functional member of society amidst their dysfunction. 

I may be in a minority here, but I feel that whatever the case ruling, the judge had the best intention. There is always a fine line in balancing punishment and rehabilitation, and it being a zero sum game sometimes, giving more of rehabilitation means giving out less of the other. Too often, we fail to realise that perhaps such crimes are manifestations of underlying behavioural problems and that these people are more in need of help than of punishments.

Just to play the devil‚Äôs advocate, I‚Äôm actually wondering if in the case of sexual misconduct, would more jail time or caning(punitive) be a more effective response against let‚Äôs say, probation/counselling (rehabilitative) for the perpetrators. Because let‚Äôs face it, when we give them more jail time and harsher sentences, the less likely they are able to seek actual outside help on their compulsions. If we do not treat other addictions by just locking them up only and pretending that they no longer exist, why should we do the same for addictions of a sexual nature?

TLDR: We fear what we don‚Äôt understand, and we don‚Äôt understand what we don‚Äôt talk about. We don‚Äôt talk openly enough about sexual crimes and compulsions/addictions, and this is the reason why we are seeing worrying trends today. Faced with such symptoms, would punishment or rehabilitation(or a little of both) be the more appropriate response to such crimes?",0.76,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ddcmuo/punishment_vs_rehabilitation/,"['# Crime and Punishment\n\nTo answer your question, one first needs to consider who the stakeholders are in any legal case. There are 3.\n\n1. The accused; until proven guilty\n2. The complainant; until proven a victim\n3. The public; who vests the judiciary with dispensing justice and through the act of voting for MPs (lawmakers), indirectly determine what laws they want their society to have\n\nThe courts are also given dispensation to determine 2 issues which are\n\n1. Guilt; if present\n2. Punishment; which may follow the establishment of guilt\n\nLet\'s focus on punishment - we assume the accused is unequivocally guilty.\n\nIt is plain that any judge needs to balance the needs of the stakeholders when determining punishment. Justice for the victim, rehabilitation for the guilty and deterrence for the general public are paramount considerations.  That is why the same crime can have different punishments - ranging from probation to fines to imprisonment.\n\nHowever, there are situations which are particularly egregious and hence attract harsher punishment. A shortlist includes:\n\n* Physical or psychological harm, particularly to persons who are unable or unwilling to provide consent, such as minors or incapacitated adults (unconscious person or someone with dementia)\n* Repeated violations of normative behaviour, such as stealing repeatedly\n* Brazen acts such as massive sums when involved in fraud or daylight robbery\n* Lack of remorse\n\nThere are, of course, also mitigating factors that reduce punishment. But this list is rightly limited in scope. In this specific case, the question is whether a potentially bright future enabled by strong academics qualifies as a mitigating factor. Personally, I think not.\n\nA smart person has no intrinsically better claim to being more moral than a stupid person. If we believe that a university student with good grades will rehabilitate better and be less likely to re-offend, it is to a large extent because our judgment is clouded by our meritocratic values. We associate high achievement with fundamentally good character - but that is untrue and unfair.\n\nOur perspective is also confounded by the fact that academic achievement is more than just one person\'s effort. It often takes stable relationships and freedom from worrying about finances to allow one to pursue their studies. There is no reason to believe that a ""dumb"" person isn\'t dumb because of his circumstances; in fact, this is often the case because exigent existential concerns take priority over the future.\n\nThat is why many, like me, believe that good grades are a poor excuse for lighter punishment. If anything, being smart, taken in isolation, should adduce greater culpability because someone that intelligent should know the consequences of his actions.\n\n# Sex Crimes and Mental Illness\n\nI also take issue with brushing off some sexual crimes being a result of an undiagnosed sex addiction. Such claims aim to reduce culpability and hence punishment by stating that the guilty have limited capacity to make decisions.\n\nThe problem with this is the field of psychiatry and psychology - do you know how psychiatrists diagnose mental illnesses?\n\nPsychiatric diagnoses are syndrome complexes defined in a textbook, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. They are literally a collection of signs and symptoms which, if exhibited often enough, qualifies as an illness. **There is no biochemical marker for diagnosis**.\n\nIn other words, the criteria for having a mental illness is determined by a group of psychiatrists in the US who believe that performing *X* action *Y* times means that something is wrong with you.\n\nI do not mean to downplay those psychiatric conditions, but it is therefore obvious that these criteria are **arbitrary** to a significant extent.\n\nWhat this means is that in practice, any serial sex offender can claim to have sexual compulsions and we have no way of determining the truth.\n\n# Society, Rehabilitation and Recidivism\n\nThe issues discussed in the above two paragraphs means that the fate of a convicted sex criminal is ultimately determined by society. Most are released after serving their sentence; and most would have received some form of counselling or psychotherapy if necessary.\n\nWhat prevents them from being contributing members of society after punishment is not the punishment itself but how society views these people.\n\nIf we take Terence and Nicholas for example, even a lack of jail time would not spare them from prejudice for their rest of their lives. It is pointless debating whether courts should lean towards punishment or rehabilitation when recidivism is fundamentally a function of how well the criminal can re-integrate back into society. Failing to provide the necessary support and love that ex-convicts need only dooms them to bad outcomes.\n\nWe (the public) are the ones who drive these people to desperation when we fail to accept them back into the fold, and that is probably the most unequivocal statement I can make in this reply.', 'Having taken the philosophy of law module in university, there is an argument that consequences aren‚Äôt simply to punish the guilty, but also to send a warning message to other people to discourage them from making a similar mistake. A ‚Äúpunish one to warn a hundred‚Äù scenario, if you could call it that. \n\nSo there is no reason why they can‚Äôt be mutually exclusive. In one hand, the culprit may well require our help and compassion, but in the other hand, you want to send a strong message across the board and discourage similar incidents from happening in the future. \n\nPersonally, I take no pleasure from seeing him get slapped with a hefty punishment, but what kind of message are you sending when you let him off with a slap on the wrist, citing his educational background as a mitigating factor?', ""It's more about fairness than wanting more punitive punishments.  For people found guilty of similar offences, sentences shouldn't be lightened for those with better background and grades.  \n\nJustice system is meant to be fair, whether perceived or not.  The Penal Code can be re-looked at to overhaul the punishments but it should be fairly applied."", ""You should read Durkheim on how he described the role of the law in society. Somewhat applicable in how you've described the situation."", ""I'm in support for rehabilitative sentencing, but I feel rehabilitation sentences are too light as of current. I would prefer sentences had longer community work hours, probation, counselling period, and bluntly perhaps a stronger reformative programs to put convicts on the right path.\n\nI feel that there is a wrong focus on convict having good grades/good uni = bright future, thus lighter sentences. But I think it is more of him still being in the mainstream school system, where there are chances of him being better rehabilitated within school in combine with the sentences."", 'I have just a point to add despite the downvotes I‚Äôve getting.\n\nTerence and his defence lawyer had every right to use whatever mitigating factors he came up with in his defence I.e, educational level etc. In fact, if he was denied the opportunity to use it as a factor, it would entail a gross miscarriage of justice as he would be denied the right to a fair trial, considering other offenders before him had such a right.\n\nWhether or not such mitigation should be allowed is an entirely different discussion altogether. If our anger and wrath is at the policies and laws that enabled this to happen, I hope we are objective enough to consider the stakeholders actually responsible for the system that has been perpetuated, and not just blind anger at the people who are caught up in it, even though it is more easy to put out anger and worries on a face rather than on our justice system that enabled it', 'The main concerns of the folk here are that the punishment for this guy was lenient relative to other sexual abusers. I do agree with your points about rehabilitating people\n  and helping them seek professional care for their mental disorders.

It\'s like one of the cases (I think it is Yale-NUS upskirt guy, lol too many cases) where in a thread yesterday it was mentioned that he was a high-achieving person all round who participated in grassroots activities, and then pretty much all comments were like ""well guess he\'s just a piece of a shit in the end"". So for many people here his sexual deviance is enough to classify him as a piece of shit and a failure, regardless of whatever else he has done or the person he is outside of his issue. \n\nI don\'t know the guy but when I read the story I think, ok he messed up and has to be punished, but he also clearly needs help because it isn\'t normal that a person in his circumstances should want to do these things. I want justice and fairness as much as the next guy (the probation case is obviously bullshit) but we have to move past the ""all criminals are just pieces of shit"" extreme.', ""The good (or bad) thing about Singapore is that Singapore is asian and so small that almost everyone is a friend of a friend of somebody.

Rehabilitation is always the last component. You cannot get a free pass to rehabilitation. So these are not binary choices. More often than not, incarceration (prison) provides the environment for rehabilitation for serious offences.', 'In a more mature society, their main concern would be the try and fix aka rehabilitate so that the problem can be solved and the offenders can be reintegrated into society. Less developed societies cant be bothered with this concept and would rather move towards the punishment route, and use it as a deterrent.', 'The legal system is not there to dish out ""justice"". What is legal is not necessarily just. People need to stop conflating their personal morality with the legal system. That is why we abolished the jury system in the first place.

Because, with the way things are right now, I think it does. It also doesn't help that the reason given for said lenient sentence is dubious at best. :/"", 'GP: A', 'What you are describing here is the deterrence factor, which is definitely another aspect of our justice system that should be incorporated, especially for certain crimes.\n\nAgain, just to play the devil‚Äôs advocate, a deterrent argument can only be justified if its effect is evident, i.e, lower crime rates or lower recidivism rates.\n\nHowever, in the case of sexual crimes, I‚Äôm questioning if harsher sentencing do have a deterrent effect on their behaviour. Are people with sexual disorders and compulsions going to be put off the crime just because there is a harsher arbitrary penalty should they get caught, when the more self pressing need for them is to fulfil such a compulsion? If there is indeed a deterrent effect, then why are crimes of this order still so widespread, with the media reporting it so often? People already know the consequences from past sagas(every now and then their names are plastered online and there is a witch-hunt), and I‚Äôm sure no rational people wants to be on the next headline in the news. And yet people are still committing these crimes in very similar circumstances. If deterrence is not working for sexual offenders, is it time we rethink another approach to it?\n\nAlso, on your point on mutual exclusivity, I‚Äôm am interested to know if they are afforded the same amount of care and help as they would be in prison than outside services. Prison is generally a harsh place to be in. The more time you spend locked up in a cell, the less time you have a chance to seek help to overcome your addictions and compulsions. It is for this reason we have drug rehab centres and halfway houses for drug offenders. But as far as I know, no such services exist for sexual offenders, even though it is clear that some of them are suffering from addiction and disorder of some form.\n\nI‚Äôm a strong believer that rehabilitation doesn‚Äôt come after your prison sentence; it has to be taken into consideration before and during your sentencing. If overtly harsh penalties impede your progress to rehabilitation, would it still be wise to impose such penalties?', 'It\'s really the ""perceived fairness"" that matters, because most commentators don\'t have access to the full court proceedings and are unable to come to an informed conclusion of what\'s fair in each case. \n\nIt is too simplistic to say ""same offense, same punishment"" because circumstances may differ.', 'I see this point being trotted out very often. But honestly, if every criminal was given the same sentencing without consideration of their personal circumstances or their ability to re-integrate into society, then the justice system would exist as a form of punitive response (everyone gets punished equally and heavily) than one that is is more rehabilitative in nature (if someone can be proven to be able to rehabilitate, we should help them do so).\n\nWhat a lot of people don‚Äôt get is that sentencing is not separate from rehabilitation. Many people seem to think that sentencing will not affect rehabilitation. So therefore the mentality is that, ‚Äúaiya just throw them into prison first, the rest we talk later‚Äù. But the truth it, when you prescribe a punishment that is overtly punitive(jail time and caning), sexual offenders lose out on the time and resources being able to seek actual help(counselling and support groups) to overcome their compulsions and addictions.\n\nWe do not give someone a lesser sentence by virtue of the fact that they are more educated or have a better background and grades. We do so because these are indicators that a person is more likely to stay out of crime (see recidivism rates and education level), and point to their general rehabilitative potential.\n\nSure, the markers to prove rehabilitative potential are subjective and not everyone agrees with them, but to ascribe everyone the same punishment regardless would be a failure of our rehabilitative systems.\n\nJust a reminder, fairness is not always justice. We can be consistently fair in dishing out the same punishments to offenders. But we would not be doing them a justice if these punishments are consistently harsh to the point that it impedes their personal rehabilitation.', ""Using the test of legality to determine what constitutes acceptable behaviour is always going to be inadequate. So too is using personal or religious morality.\n\nBut a better way already exists, ethics. Which is philosophical in nature, and whose are arguments are sometimes codified into law.\n\nOne of the most fundamental ethical principles (and I claim this as ethics because it is near universal) is the Golden Rule - which generally states that you treat others as you would like to be treated, and not treat others the way you don't want to be treated.\n\nThe world will be a much nicer place if everyone can adhere to that."", '[deleted]', 'I think they do, but I also think anger and disgust (i.e. the ""optics"") are less important to public interest than crime rates.\n\nSociety is **best** served when crimes are not committed in the first place; not when we have appropriate punishments for crimes - because that\'s reactionary.\n\nSo I can (partially) understand the judge\'s decision to grant probation to Terence as opposed to a custodial sentence - the hope that rehabilitation will prevent him from re-offending.\n\nOf course that doesn\'t take into account what potential criminals or as-yet-uncaught criminals will think - they might believe they will get away with light sentences based on precedent and become more daring as a result.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe reality is that no one has an answer to what the ideal punishment is for any crime. Too light and you might see more brazen acts; too harsh and you miss a chance to redeem someone. The important thing here is that we always acknowledge that crime and punishment are dynamic - and constantly evaluate if current practices do indeed lower crime rates (our ultimate goal) and if not, change them.', 'Starting from the whole Monica Baey incident, my impression is that this sort of thing is (still) rampant precisely because on a whole, more people are getting away with it than being caught, and even when prosecuted, the punishment is so light that it may as well not exist.\n\nI believe the problem has always been there. Back when I was studying in NUS, it‚Äôs an open secret that there a ton of hanky panky going on in the hostels, especially over the weekends. I just didn‚Äôt bother with all this as I was too focused on studying and getting my degree, plus I had family issues to deal with. \n\nRather, I believe we are getting more reports now due to growing awareness, and the first case emboldening the victims to step forward to make a police report, compared to the past where they would likely just have opted to stay quiet instead. It does not help that the institutions are apparently trying to sweep these incidents under the carpet, perhaps because they want to protect their reputation, which just perpetuates the whole problem. \n\nI understand that justice needs to be tempered with mercy, but my counterpoint is that while rehabilitation may be beneficial to the culprit after he has been arrested, it does nothing if he is still at large, and it does nothing to deter other people from committing similar crimes in the future, because by definition, if they haven‚Äôt been caught, they aren‚Äôt eligible. \n\nFirst, the law needs to be seen to be fair. What kind of message are you sending when the culprit gets off scot-free with a minor suspension that doesn‚Äôt leave any sort of permanent record? \n\nSecond, I am not sure what sort of closure this is supposed to bring to the victim, who has to leave with the ramifications of that thoughtless action for the rest of her / his life. To me, the law has a duty to first try and protect the innocent from coming to harm (the deterrence factor), else the guilty should receive a punishment commensurate with the harm he has caused, if nothing but to bring some closure to the entire incident. In the very least, that time spent in jail is time they aren‚Äôt outside committing crimes. \n\nLastly, I don‚Äôt see rehabilitation as some magic bullet that will necessarily guarantee that the culprit turns over a new leaf either, contrary to what all the advertisements and tv shows make it out to be. It does entail extra resources on the part of the government (greater need for counselling means more counsellors need to be hired and trained), and that opportunity cost needs to be factored in as well, IMO.', '[deleted]', '>We do so because these are indicators that a person is more likely to stay out of crime (see recidivism rates and education level), and point to their general rehabilitative potential.\n\nFirst, this is a presumption. Second, if true, it is confounded by socio-economic factors.\n\nIt is unacceptable to preclude a poorly educated person from a more rehabilitative (read: lighter) sentence.

In a society where we vilify sexual deviance and are more inclined to make them out to be monsters than other reasons involved,  we are only pushing them away from seeking actual help because we have condemned them to a position that is beyond help. The first assumption for too many people is that people who exhibit sexual deviances are abhorrent beings that should be persecuted and locked away.

So I don\'t understand what you mean by the saying the code ""tends to lean heavier towards punishments"".', 'You guys are misrepresenting my argument and taking my quotes out of context. I have never said that education level should be the sole indicator of recidivism, and neither have I disagreed that there could be other factors involved. \n\nBut judges in court are supposed to make qualitative and quantitative judgements. I am trying to see from their perspective here because while there has been a lot of talk about rehabilitative potential, nobody has come up with a better way to qualitatively and quantitively justify it.

If we do not offer varying sentences based on rehabilitative potential, then our justice system only serves to punish, not to rehabilitate.', 'I dare not say altruism, but I will say perhaps the principle of reciprocity - we avoid harm ourselves by not inflicting it on others.\n\nIs this social contract broken at times? Even often? As wars would clearly evince, yes.\n\nBut by and large, in day to day living, what gives me the confidence to walk on the streets goes beyond police protection, it is the expectation that if I will not be harmed if I do not harm you. And that, I think, is generally true.', 'Assuming it\'s true, the question is why a poorly educated person tends to re-offend.\n\nIs it a fundamental character flaw? Or is it a problem with circumstance?\n\nIf it\'s the latter, then the ""stupid"" person is no less deserving of rehabilitation than the smart one. There\'s no ""meritocracy"" in law - remember that Lady Justice wears a blindfold.', 'I think we need to draw a distinction between thoughts and actions.\n\nWhilst some of us have deviant sexual *thoughts*, not everyone translates them into actions. I don\'t disagree that thoughts can eventually manifest as behaviour, but there\'s a big difference between the two.\n\nBeing so angry with someone that ""I feel like killing him"" doesn\'t make me a murderer.\n\nI also don\'t understand why the hypothetical 15 year old who joins a sexually deviant chat group would eventually normalise his behaviour - isn\'t the fact that he had to join an anonymous group to discuss his impulses evidence that he knows something is wrong with his ideas?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn any case, I don\'t think your issue is really with punishment and rehabilitation, but with the state of mental healthcare in Singapore - which I agree is sorely lacking.\n\nWhat we need is better access to psychiatric help for people who have intruding thoughts and/or unrestricted compulsions **before** they commit a crime. This can already be seen somewhat in the adjustment of punishment for drug related offences.\n\nWe shouldn\'t ostracise those who need help and seek it; and we should make help easily available to those who want it.\n\nSo, *if* Terence indeed has uncontrollable sexual urges then **it is his responsibility** to seek help. And it is society\'s duty to ensure that we do not prejudice those who do.\n\nBut the issue is fundamentally different when harm is visited on a victim because by then, the latter\'s rights must be taken into account as well.', 'Actually, what we\'re saying is that using education level as a significant determinant of rehabilitative potential smacks of prejudice.\n\nUsing a **flawed** marker to decide if someone is more deserving of rehabilitation is fundamentally wrong; the lack of ""better options"" to judge someone **does not justify** using a bad option, rather it warns us against using imperfect standards and giving in to convenience.\n\nThe best way to determine if someone re-offends is to see what happens after release; similarly, the best way to determine if someone can be successfully rehabilitated is to rehabilitate everyone and assess their progress during that programme.\n\nWhat we are practising now, using education level as mitigation, is elitism. I hope everyone sees that.', 'Read the original point on my post where I talk about how people can form ‚Äúin groups‚Äù to feel a sense of solidarity. These telegram groups exists and grow so large because people who join them have no where else to go (being outcasted by the larger society). And often, these ‚Äúin-groups‚Äù become their new normal. If they communicate in their own bubbles, it is more likely they will hold and normalise beliefs that are representative of such groups \n\nYour point about being ostracised is precisely my point. Our attitudes and thoughts and comments against people like them matters as well. If the general public backlash against them is so huge and there is so much stigma concerning them, it is unlikely they will ever seek help, despite it being their responsibility. And who stands to suffer the most? Their eventual victims. We as a society must take collective responsibility if any of this is to be overcome\n\nI feel that the major quip people have is with the law and which allows for concessions like educational level as mitigation. But the anger has been disproportionately transferred to people like Terence and Nicholas such that they become seen as representation of state policies, rather than agents of their own self.', 'In other words, you would not consider rehabilitative potential when handing out punishment and jail term, since you cannot come out with a definite marker to adjudge such potential before they serve their sentence.\n\nThis is antithetical to so many justice systems around the world and not just our own. If criminals are not considered rehabilitatable before they serve their sentences and the law reflects that(by not allowing them to use such potentials as mitigating factors), it would then be hypocritical and false generosity for the state to throw them resources in prison in the hopes that they will reform.\n\nI‚Äôm a utilitarian, so I believe in choosing the lesser of two evils. I can understand your imperative to avoid imperfect standards, but real world obligations sometimes demand we choose, however imperfect the choices are. That is not to say we cannot fine tune and constantly improve what we define as ‚Äúrehabilitative potential‚Äù, rather than doing away with it entirely.', ""I don't disagree that a closed group tends to limit perspective, but they it should be apparent before/when joining said closed group that their attitudes towards sex are not normal.\n\nThat should at least prompt some degree of introspection.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut seeking help is anonymous, committing a crime then being punished isn't. No medical professional will reveal the identity of his patients to the general public. Confidentiality will be breached in certain situations, such as where there is potential for harm to others - for example a paedophile, self-declared, might not be allowed to work in childcare. But these are not strictly punitive measures, rather they aim to prevent adverse incidents from happening."", ""I don't agree about collective responsibility. Why should we take responsibility for the actions of others? There's a reason why society as a collective has chosen to condemn these people and it's because we as a society has deemed these acts morally reprehensible. If an individual has a mental illness that clouds judgment, I would say society is at fault.\n\nBut how can you say that a mentally sound individual that commits such a crime be welcomed easily back into society? Should we all commit crimes whilst fully understanding the consequences of it and expect that? The viewpoint you express is overly idealistic where parties should act in accordance to the optimally perfect and efficient solution for the greater good of society but it doesn't take into account that life and people rarely behave in this manner."", ""On the contrary, I believe **everyone** should undergo rehabilitation of some sort concurrent with their punishment.\n\nIncarceration or otherwise is no barrier to improving yourself if our prisons are robust and supportive enough.\n\nThose who demonstrate the ability to re-integrate back into society are given the support to do so, and released early. Those who don't are kept longer until a time when they are ready.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThis system is of course still flawed, because it demands much more resources and might anger victims who feel aggrieved when their perpetrators are released early.\n\nBut I believe it makes a lot more sense than determining someone's future based on his past qualifications/circumstances during a single point in time (the trial) instead of actively assessing how that criminal is redeeming himself while serving the sentence.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nJust to add. I understand reality as well. Yet a flawed marker is only useful insofar as it is a good approximation for the ideal. Using education level as mitigation, with its blatant pitfalls, is taking a shortcut that penalises certain groups for circumstances that might truly be beyond their control.""]"
whatistruelove24,bqbu8r,I am a gay ex-Christian and I attended a Truelove.is event [xpost],2019-05-19 10:17:21,singapore,378759,113,442,"Hello! I am crossposting this from¬†[r/exchristian](https://www.reddit.com/r/exchristian). Following up on previous discussions on LGBT issues in Singapore like¬†[how WAAPD expresses overt homophobia](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bkjb4c/we_are_against_pink_dot_facebook_group_is_a/), I thought it'd be useful to express my own thoughts on how¬†[Truelove.is](https://truelove.is/), which claims to be more open to LGBT people, actually follows a similar pattern of homophobic sentiment.

&#x200B;

**TLDR:**

Basically, I attended a¬†[Truelove.is](https://truelove.is/)¬†event and found out that:

1. Implicit homophobia is prevalent in the movement
2. The movement adopts an American alt-right strategy of dismissing dissent as ""fake news""/""mainstream liberal media"", so that they can delegitimise and thus ignore criticism.
3. On some level,¬†[Truelove.is](https://truelove.is/)¬†is not just about winning over gay people for Jesus, but about winning an imaginary ideological war against an imaginary liberal LGBT boogeyman

If you're interested, I originally published this on my Medium:¬†[https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97](https://medium.com/@whatistruelove/i-am-a-gay-ex-christian-and-i-attended-a-truelove-is-event-8871aa331f97)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Here is the main text:**

Around this time last year, I was having lunch with some Christian friends when I brought up my concerns about¬†[Truelove.is](http://truelove.is/). As a gay man who spent eight years in Christian society, I was interested in the church‚Äôs latest attempt to reach out to gay people. Even though Truelove.is insists that the church loves people who are not straight, I found that the campaign ultimately teaches tolerance without acceptance;¬†[‚Äúwe disagree with his decisions, but that doesn‚Äôt mean we love him any less‚Äù](http://truelove.is/how-to-talk-to-your-teenager-about-homosexuality/). To me, Truelove.is advocates a worldview in which gay people must either strive to be heterosexually married, celibate, or be judged by society; a sad impasse for anyone to inhabit.

That‚Äôs what I said when my friends asked me for my thoughts on this issue. After hearing what I had to say, one of my friends was consumed by a sudden wave of hatred. After I said that I think Truelove.is essentially promotes euphemised conversion therapy, my friend shouted, ‚ÄúI thought the only thing controversial about conversion therapy is that they electrocute people?‚Äù

Taken aback by his spite, I mentioned that sexual orientation cannot be changed, and that any attempt to repress a natural instinct would be both painful and foolish. To this, my friend spat, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just what the liberals say!‚Äù

Needless to say, that lunch date did not end nicely.

Ever since then, I have been troubled by how hateful my friend became once we discussed homosexuality. Out of curiosity, and out of a desire to understand this traumatic rupture in our friendship, I attended the Truelove.is x Heartbeart Project Symposium held on 30 April 2019 at Church of our Saviour. Re-entering Christian society felt like a return to muscle memory. Re-embracing my dual-citizenship status between Christianity and homosexuality, I attended the Symposium to see if returning to the society that my friend still inhabits‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääa society that I left behind‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwould help me understand him better.

Attending the Symposium provided me with clarity; it also reminded me of why I left Christianity. Previously, I was confused by the difference between my friend‚Äôs usual self and the hatefulness he expressed once it came to gay issues. Attending the Symposium gave me a window into my friend‚Äôs mind by giving me a look into his society. Across the event, speakers ridiculed critics, ignored responses to their campaign, and portrayed themselves as the target of persecution by what they call ‚Äúthe liberal and mainstream media‚Äù. According to this worldview, my friend‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand Truelove.is supporters‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääare not wrong, but misunderstood. It is not on them to explain themselves to gay people, but on gay people to understand them.

All in all, Truelove.is talks¬†*about*¬†gay people, speaks¬†*at*¬†gay people, but does not know how to talk¬†*with*¬†gay people. This is how my friend reacted because this is how they talk about us behind closed doors.

Just to clarify: Truelove.is announced two prohibitions at the beginning of the event. Firstly, unauthorised media was not allowed. Secondly, the Symposium operated under Chatham House rules, which means that the organisers are happy for people to cite things mentioned during the event as long as anonymity is preserved. Out of respect for these regulations, I have blocked the identities of the people I am citing. I am also sorry that I do not have the space or lived experience necessary to discuss The Heartbeat Project.

**Talking** ***About*** **Gay People**

I‚Äôve heard enough homophobia from the pulpit during my time as a Christian. I‚Äôve heard about the Gays‚Äô plan to ruin society, about my supposed desires for incest, paedophilia and bestiality. This pushed me away from the church; I couldn‚Äôt live with people who insisted on believing that I was always a lapse of self-control away from actual immorality.

To Truelove.is‚Äôs credit, I haven‚Äôt heard any explicit homophobia from them. Indeed, Truelove.is has moved away from the overt homophobia and slippery-slope arguments that dominated my time in church. However, several moments during the Symposium suggested that¬†*implicit*¬†homophobia remains a problem.

As Truelove.is writes,¬†[‚Äúwe are enslaved by sin‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpowerless and addicted, so to speak‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand lose our ability to choose good‚Äù](http://truelove.is/how-to-talk-to-your-teenager-about-homosexuality/). This seems to be a guiding principle for the campaign: straight Christians occupy a higher moral ground and must lift gay people up to their level of morality. This might be fine in itself‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääafter all, most Christians think that all who do not accept Jesus will be barred from heaven‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääbut only gay people are treated with a special sort of loathing that emphasises their inability to be anything more than their sin.

Even though Truelove.is insists that people should not be defined by their identity, some of the speakers seem to do so anyway. One speaker told the audience about a counselling session he was conducting for a man with same-sex attraction. During that session, he heard God say ‚Äú\[Redacted‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäA\], give him a hug.‚Äù He then told the audience:

‚ÄúTo be honest, I was really struggling. Because I think I am dark, tall and handsome‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhat happens if he like \[sic\] me?‚Äù

The audience laughed. I retreated into the body of my eighteen-year-old self‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI recalled what it was like to feel like someone was always suspicious of me, afraid that I would burst out of my Christian self-control to reveal the sex monster inside.

Do you really think I am just a swarm of bodily instincts without reason? Would you ever express a fear of hugging a straight opposite-sex person in the same way that you fear hugging me?

To be fair, A did give this man a hug. I am glad that A overcame his homophobia to believe the best in other people. What scared me, however, was the way he wrote this off as a joke, and how the audience interpreted this statement as something funny. When we laugh at a joke, we internalise the ideology that supports the joke; we unite ourselves against an enemy that we can ridicule together. What scared me about the Symposium‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand what turned me away from Christianity‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääis this hidden but pervasive judgment. Even though they keep these thoughts hidden, this is what they think of me in private; these are the jokes they crack about me when they think I can‚Äôt hear them.

**Speaking** ***At*** **Gay People**

Any meaningful conversation has to involve two sides understanding each other, speaking¬†*with*¬†each other. If one speaks to conquer, one ends up speaking¬†*at*¬†people. Perhaps this is a consequence of the Truelove.is dictum that gay people¬†[‚Äúare enslaved by sin‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääpowerless and addicted, so to speak‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand lose our ability to choose good‚Äù](http://truelove.is/how-to-talk-to-your-teenager-about-homosexuality/); since gay people are wrong by definition, Christians stand to gain nothing from understanding their points of view. What saddens me about Truelove.is is that in spite of their earnest belief that they are engaging with gay people, they deny gay people the dignity of being engaged as equals.

Anyone following the social media storm that followed Truelove.is‚Äôs debut will have noticed that criticism of the campaign frequently came down to the notion of conversion therapy. Even though Truelove.is falls short of the traditional definition of conversion therapy in which physically abusive techniques such as electroshock torture are used to (unsuccessfully) recalibrate the brain‚Äôs sexual responses, many critics think that Truelove.is amounts to a psychological version of conversion abuse. According to¬†[Grace Yeoh from Rice Media](https://www.ricemedia.co/current-affairs-features-brilliant-marketing-truelove-homophobia-rebranded-chance-acceptance/), Truelove.is ‚Äúmask\[s\] homophobia as holiness‚Äù and ‚Äúclaim\[s\] to demonstrate unconditional love, yet stop\[s\] short of all-encompassing acceptance and affirmation‚Äù. Similarly,¬†[Gay Star News](https://www.gaystarnews.com/article/this-christian-group-that-loves-lgbti-people-may-have-ulterior-motives/#gs.9chd2m)¬†is troubled by Truelove.is‚Äôs insistence that homosexuality can be repressed.

To many and to me, Truelove.is might as well be conversion therapy: it coerces gay Christians into suppressing their sexual desires in exchange for social affirmation. Any campaign manager worth their salt would have reacted to this recurrent critique, but Truelove.is doesn‚Äôt seem to think this point is worth addressing. While giving the audience an account of Truelove.is‚Äôs progress, Speaker A flashed screenshots of the aforementioned websites on its screen, and said:

‚ÄúWe have been called many, many things‚Ä¶ homophobia‚Ä¶ we have been accused of using conversion therapy‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääwhich, actually, I don‚Äôt even fully know exactly what that means‚Ä¶ I have been accused of things I don‚Äôt understand.‚Äù

Once again, the audience laughed. I felt that old sense of alienness rise up again; this is a society that doesn‚Äôt understand, and doesn‚Äôt¬†*want*¬†to understand, the pain that I go through. It is unimaginable that anyone interested in ‚Äúcuring‚Äù homosexuality doesn‚Äôt know what conversion therapy is. Truelove.is‚Äôs wilful ignorance is a return to an ‚Äúout of sight, out of mind‚Äù strategy that discounts the critic as someone worth engaging; if I don‚Äôt understand you, I can‚Äôt be guilty, and I don‚Äôt have to change for you.

Why, then, are these critics not worth listening to? Truelove.is seems to think they are either liberal or stupid. Later on in the event, we are introduced to a Truelove.is social media response squad‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthey are ‚Äúa group that \[has\] faithfully been responding on social media‚Äù, a group of ‚Äúlawyers and writers who gather together and say, ‚Äòhey, we cannot let¬†lies and fake news¬†triumph.‚Äô‚Äù

Instead of engaging with criticism, Truelove.is discounts criticism by deeming these arguments wrong by definition. To Truelove.is‚Äôs online response team, it‚Äôs not about what you say, but¬†*who*¬†you are. If you lean left, your opinions are fake news; as my friend put it, criticism should be ignored because ‚Äúthat‚Äôs just what the liberals say‚Äù. In their worldview, Truelove.is is criticised because they are Christian and not because they are wrong. This is how they disavow responsibility for self-reflection; all criticism is interpreted as attacks on their identity and not their ideas.

In addition to discounting your thoughts if they don‚Äôt fit their narrative, Truelove.is simply doesn‚Äôt think very highly of people who disagree. As the speaker introduced two members of the Truelove.is online response team, he jokingly mentions‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto the audience‚Äôs laughter‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthat one of them likes to ‚Äúpour oil on anger‚Äù. This laughter went on for quite a while; it seemed like the audience was aware of this person‚Äôs enjoyment for online fighting, and that watching this person¬†*stick it to the liberals*¬†brought them pleasure. In fact, in response to being asked why he joined the team, this online response team member goes on to say:

‚ÄúI think it really comes from a point of having seen the church being beaten down left, right, centre‚Ä¶ and knowing that I can no longer stay silent about it, especially if the Lord has given me a brain.‚Äù

On some level, this made me feel like things weren‚Äôt just about winning people over for Jesus. At play somewhere in this social movement is a desire to simply¬†*win*. It‚Äôs about winning the liberals, about defeating fake news, about proving Christians are smarter.

I left the symposium feeling like I had to take a shower.

**Talking** ***With*** **Gay People**

I attended the Truelove.is x Heartbeat Project Symposium with the intention of finding out how my friend‚Äôs mind worked. I left remembering why I decided to leave Christianity. I felt like I was viewed as a product of my sin, not someone to be understood but an objective to be conquered. My friend‚Äôs behaviour reflected a social trend of dismissing and ridiculing ideas that contest his worldview. It‚Äôs more important to him that he continues believing in his gay horror fantasy instead of looking beyond his fear to realise that I am not that fantasy.

I don‚Äôt doubt that Truelove.is has the best intentions at heart for gay people. What I am saddened by is the way they shut out criticism by deeming it liberal nonsense because they think gay people and their frustrations do not deserve respectful consideration. Truelove.is might insist that they are here for conversations and not conversions, but these are conversations they will have¬†*about*¬†you and not¬†*with*¬†you.

In these closing moments, I turn again to my Christian knowledge and to the verse that gave Truelove.is its name:

‚ÄúLove is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud. It does not dishonor others, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered, it keeps no record of wrongs. Love does not delight in evil but rejoices with the truth. It always protects, always trusts, always hopes, always perseveres.‚Äù (1 Corinthians 13:4‚Äì7).

At the Truelove.is meeting, I realised that even though the campaign strives to embody these values publicly, it ultimately returns‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääeven if unknowingly‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääto a self-affirming, self-serving sense of moral superiority that masks itself as love. As a gay man, and as one who used to be Christian, I was reminded that I left the church because I was unconvinced that it would protect me, trust me, and persevere in understanding me.

I am sorry I don‚Äôt have much advice for the church on how they can reach out to people like me better. If I had any, I wouldn‚Äôt have had to leave.

But I do know Truelove.is will read this. I hope you won‚Äôt dismiss this letter as liberal nonsense, but ask yourself whether your outreach attempts actually come from Christ-like love. As¬†[the Ethos Institute study on LGBT hospitality in Singaporean churches](https://ethosinstitute.sg/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Findings-of-ETHOS-Study-_-Executive-Summary-12June2018.pdf)¬†has shown, while only 13% of church leaders think churches are not at all open to LGBT people, 50% of LGBT respondents felt so. This is the gap in perception that arises when you talk¬†*to*¬†but not¬†*with*, when you force all conversations to occur on your terms.

It‚Äôs not about nice product designs and well-produced short films. We¬†*know*¬†when you don‚Äôt actually want to listen.

You have already lost me; I hope you will help make the church more hospitable for those who still want to stay.

It\'s not your book, it\'s the Jewish people\'s book and you don\'t think about it in the way that the Israelite elders intended it to be. BTW, do you know what ""Israel"" mean? It means  ""he wrestles with God"". The idea in the Jewish community is very simple: laws and rules are the result of debates, discussions, and exploration; they can argue forever without necessarily comes to a conclusive answer; the important thing is the discussion is done, not the answer. Ask a bunch of early Christian priests and bishops to do so and it would have ended up someone getting punched in the mouth (the legend of St. Nicholas, yes that St. Nick), several sides getting called anti-Christ and excommunicated by every other side, and occasionally, war. Same goes with the Muslims, who also incorrectly read the Tanakh.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n[The Oven of Akhnai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oven_of_Akhnai) is a popular Talmud story sums up the Jews\' attitude to God, God\'s Laws, and God\'s Words the best. Basically, Rabbi Eliezer was making some arguments against the majority of other rabbis and he started asking God for signs that he was right. A fig tree uprooted itself and ran away, a river flows backwards, and then the walls of the study chamber started caving in. Rabbi Joshua reprimanded the walls for interfering with scholarly debate. Then the wall stopped. Eventually, a booming voice from Heaven shoted down: ""Why are you differing with Rabbi Eliezer, as the halakha is in accordance with his opinion in every place that he expresses an opinion?"". Hearing the voice of God in this manner, most Christians and Muslims would have bow and scrapped, then totally conceded the point to Rabbbi Eliezer, and later pray everyday to the God to speak to them again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWell, Rabbi Joshua responds, ""[It \\[the Torah\\] is not in heaven](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Not_in_Heaven)"" (Deuteronomy 30:12). He responds in this way because the Torah, which was given by God to mankind at Sinai, specifically instructs those who follow it that they are to look to the received Torah as their source and guide. The Torah says, ""It is not in heaven, that you should say, \'Who will go up to heaven for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?\' Neither is it beyond the sea, that you should say, \'Who will cross to the other side of the sea for us, and get it for us so that we may hear it and observe it?\' No, the word is very near to you; it is in your mouth and in your heart for you to observe"" (Deuteronomy 30:12-14).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nRabbi Joshua\'s response then expresses the view that the work of law is a work of human activity, and that the Torah itself supports this legal theory. The Torah is not a document of mystery which must have its innate meaning revealed by a minority, but it is instead a document from which law must be created through the human activity of debate and consensus. Rabbinic literature was capable of recognizing differing opinions as having a degree of legitimacy (Yer. Ber. 3b), yet the community remains united and the ruling which is ultimately followed comes through proper jurisprudence. As such, Rabbi Eliezer\'s miraculous appeals represent a differing legal theory and were outside of proper jurisprudence which meant that they would not be followed. Instead the Jewish community followed the ruling of the majority in this issue and in others. The Talmud asks how God responded to this incident. We are told that upon hearing Rabbi Joshua\'s response, God smiled and stated, ""My children have triumphed over Me; My children have triumphed over Me.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAnd then God was very happy with his children, left them alone, and never appear before any of them again.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe story also tells the Jews that any man who claims that God spoke to them is probably full of shit and they shouldn\'t listen to him.

SmirkingImperialist,bbuoxm,"Is this analysis of drug enforcement effectiveness data ""potentially misleading""?",2019-04-11 10:17:04,singapore,378759,65,36,"As I grow older, I came to the belief that government anywhere does not really know what they are doing. A government's competence has little to do with how it is structured or what law it is enforcing but rather the general level of development and competency of the population (in other words, it's very hard to be a vanguard).

One thing the Singapore government is very proud of, apparently, is the draconian enforcement of criminalisation of certain substances called ""drugs"". The government from top to bottom keep saying the same thing: our effort is great, we don't have as many drug users as other countries. The Singapore ambassador to the US wrote very proudly that Singapore in the Washington post that Singapore managed to reduce the number of drug user arrested from 6000/year in the 90s to ~3000/year in 2017.
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-is-winning-the-war-on-drugs-says-ambassador-to-us
(Washington Post is behind a paywall)

While what he wrote was technically correct, he conveniently ignored the data in the in the 2002s. No one seems to read the annual report the CNB put out or the data released by CNB, apparently.
https://www.cnb.gov.sg/newsandevents/reports-(overview)
https://data.gov.sg/dataset/demographic-profile-of-drug-abusers

The 2002 report contained data of total number of drug users arrested from 1992 to 2002. The number of drug users arrested did decreased from >6000 in 1992 to ~3300 in 2017. The point of lowest number of drug user arrested was actually in 2005, with 793 arrested that year. The 2005 report was very, very proud of that fact, and it was short. 7 pages long. An equivalent report of the Australian counterparts is 60 pages long.

Then the number started ticking back up. About 2 years later, the number was 2211. The 2007 report is still relatively short, 6 pages long; but it contained only 2006 and 2007 numbers. Then things kinda keep going up; and in 2017, the total arrests of drug users is 3091, the report is 19 pages long, and the draught of data is still the same (just 2016 and 2017 numbers).

The CNB used to release a data set called the street price of major drug of abuse. The price of heroin, according to that data set has crashed straight through the floor. If I ask you to name single legal thing that you can buy in Singapore whose price has decreased in absolute terms in 2017 compared to 2008, you will be very hard pressed. If I expand it into illegal drugs; it's easy. I questioned the CNB over this data and they gave me some very unsatisfactory answers. Then the dataset was taken off data.gov.sg.

In the course of researching this topic, I came across the most useless Master thesis dissertation ever:
https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/23099
The dissertation is supposedly an analysis of the CNB's effectiveness as a case study. It spent 80 pages on basically literature reviews of methodology on assessing the effectiveness, Singapore's laws, and the CNB structure and resources. Then the actual part that is directly related to the title, the analysis of the effectiveness, is 10 pages long. A third of that 10 pages are excuses on why certain analysis can't be done. My PhD committee will fail me if my dissertation has that structure.

All of the data I used in in the public domain; some have since been rescinded since I contacted the CNB over my interpretation of it.

So, what happened? We keep reading in the news about the CNB busting kilos of drugs, but one cursory look at the number of judicial execution see an interesting trend:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore
It went down. From 1994-1996, Singapore executed 50-75 people; no doubt a lot of them drug traffickers. This probably contributed to the drop of drug users in the 90s. From the low point of drug users arrested in 2005 to 2017, the number of executed per year remained well under 9 per year. How?

Before I answer that, here's another interesting trend: the purity of heroin in Singapore went from ~50% (sample seized in 80s) to 5% (more recent samples).
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670869

Think about that for a moment. How can the purity of drugs go down? If your drug is less pure; you need to haul more of it and make yourself easier to be caught. Every other category of drugs, including alcohol during the American Prohibition displayed the trend of increasing purity. Americans went from drinking beers before the Prohibition to 80-proof moonshine. Methamphetamine went from 20-30% pure ""Yaba pills"" in South East Asia to 80-90% pure crystal meth (a lot of which sold by North Korean diplomats). Even cannabis: cannabis growers should receive PhDs for their astounding feats of selective breeding despite very limited equipment. They managed to create strains with ~50% THC (the psychoactive components cannabis), up from the rather low 10-15% of yesteryears.

Here is my interpretation and speculation as why heroin sellers can still sell their stuff and not get executed as oftently recently compared to the 90s. Heroin is still a major drug of abuse in Singapore, btw: about one-third of user arrests are related to heroin. Singapore death penalty are based on the amount of pure substance trafficked. In the case of heroin, it's the amount of pure diamorphine. 15g is the mandatory threshold. What happens for every seizure is the police need to estimate the purity, then calculate from the total amount of heroin no. 3 (low quality) seized to get the pure diamorphine quantity. Basing the penalty on the total pure amount is absolutely vital as far as the law goes since without this, it's hilariously easy to frame someone for a death penalty: throw 2kg of flour mixed with 0.5g of heroin into someone's possession and viola, deadman walking.

When heroin sold and trafficked was 50% pure, getting caught with 30g is a death penalty. More recently, heroin has become less pure; meaning ~300g will be the death penalty. Still heroin is heroin, less pure heroin can't deliver the same high and users won't accept it.  How can the sellers make up the 45% missing ""purity""?

Enter: ultra-potent synthetic opioids. Heroin is ~2x more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is ~100x more potent than morphine and Carfentanil is ~10.000x more potent. Drug mules can traffic 5% heroin and 0.9% fentanyl or 0.009% Carfentanil mixture for the same potency. 15g diamorphine is enough for ~100 average doses (150mg diamorphine/dose). Opioids build tolerance so new users may need ~10-20mg but long-term users may require over 200mg. 30g of heroin no. 3 (the common type of heroin sold) result in death penalty. Now with the new mixture, the death penalty starts at ~300g of 5% pure heroin mixture; and it's enough for 1000 doses instead.

Fentanyl and Carfentanil are Schedule 2 drugs: misuse attracts jail terms but not death penalties. We need them to remain available or a lot of patients will suffer needlessly.

There is an important lesson of war and conflict: when you are fighting other humans, who are intelligent and adapt to your tactics, you will find your tactics fast becoming less and less effective. In a total war, you can go balls-to-the-walls genocidal and ""make a solitude and call it peace"". The civilian society is not a warzone, the population are not partisans and guerrillas (by and large), and the police can not be the Gestapo or NKVD (I hope).

EDIT: the price of major drugs of abuse is no longer indexed on data.gov.sg; but it's still available in through the link provided by the metadata file
https://storage.data.gov.sg/prices-of-major-drugs-of-abuse/resources/prices-of-major-drugs-of-abuse-2018-06-13T02-49-09Z.csv",0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bbuoxm/is_this_analysis_of_drug_enforcement/,"[""Carfentail has been around for ages, but it got more common recently because of illicit manufacturing in China that made use of loopholes in China's laws. But China is cracking down on this to some extent too because it's a very significant (but completely painless) concession it can take up with United States over the trade war. So many people in the US are dying to opioid addictions that it is one of the only 3 countries in the world that has a declining life expectancy (along wtih Afghanistan and Syria).\n\nHence, the carfentail (and the other powerful synthetic opioids) problem is almost exclusively an American problem because of the widespread prescriptions of addictive opioid pain medications like oxycontin and the other -contin drugs which acted as a gateway for opioid addictions.\n\nWe do not have this problem because our physicians never prescribed opioid medications on that scale as American physicians who were so open to bribery-in-all-but-name by pharmaceutical firms. Besides, carfentail's lethality (its dose-lethality is equivalent to Sarin) makes it unviable for commercialization as a illicit street drug because of the high potential for mistakes. One slip up from illicit drug manufacturers will end up killing all their customers. And lots of dead people tends to attract massive attention from authorities, even in the more laissez faire countries, therefore it's a largely unprofitable enterprise. Fentanyl is also potent but less lethal, but its potential for overdose deaths is still so high. The same logic applies to an extent for manufacturers and dealers.\n\nErgo, our drug problem really is that small. 3k arrests a year is nothing. Drug abuse is not a highly distributed issue in Singapore (compared to the US, where it's a problem across thousands of rustbelt towns across the country), but rather tends to be clustered in very small groups. Arrests are almost always for recalcitrant offenders. I mean, how many Singaporeans have actually even seen illicit drug abuse personally? Personally, I've never seen any. Conversely, I went to a certain western European country once and it didn't take me 6 hours from entering the country to stumble across discarded syringes in a secluded area near my hotel."", ""What I'm getting from this, is that we need to reduce the values required to trigger the death penalty.\n\nAlso,\n\n>rug mules\n\nGot a hilarious mental image of a guy trying to smuggle a carpet up his ass through customs."", 'Good and long read. Kudos to you for making so much effort researching about an organisation of a country you do not call home. \n\nAs someone said in another comment, this article is wayyy too long beyond the attention span of Singaporeans.\n\nLet me try to summarize your main points, to make sure we are on the same page and that I am not misunderstanding you.\n\n1. How this thing started: You probably got pissed off when the Singaporean ambassador to the US flaunted our harsh drug laws, and so you made a resolve to digitally investigate CNB, when you came to the conclusion that....\n2. ...SG is overselling the effectiveness of our drug policies (be it our laws or enforcement agency). I assume that you are on pro-legalization camp, and this might be the idea that you are trying to plant in our heads.\n3.  You note that the number of people executed in Singapore has reduced greatly (till the last 2 years though, I must point out), and indeed, most of them are drug-related. This sounds like there are less and less people slammed with the death penalty.\n4. Seized heroin are found to be reduced in purity. You argue that greater crackdown should by right increase purity to evade capture\n5. You propose that our drugs are being tainted with synthetic opoids, and that will explain the fewer death penalties (not enough heroin to be given death penalty) and reduced purity (synthetic opoids substitute the \'kick\' from heroin)\n6. Your point ultimately is that the more the govt cracks down, the more crime lords will evolve to evade resulting in greater effort needed by the govt, as conceptualized in Darwinism \n\nAt this point I must declare that I am no expert in drug crime (nor anything related im afraid), and while I made the effort to open my laptop to type this response out I do not have nearly the same amount of time to research this topic as intensely as you did. Hence some of my responses will be questions which I hope you help enlighten me.\n\n1. Let\'s address the ambassador\'s statement since it made up a third of your post. While you argue that he \'left out\' the part about drug abusers nabbed increasing in recent years, I must argue in defence of his honour that a) his statement did not contain any falsehoods, not was intended to mislead. Number of arrests did decrease in those 2 timeframes he provided, and while it increased recently, it never exceeded 2017 numbers by a great margin (there was no hidden giant peak that he omitted). His point still stands that our anti-drug efforts remain sufficient to curb drug abuse, especially against the background of an opoid epidemic in the US (You and I can agree to disagree on this). b) Number of arrests is an iffy thing. It does not signify that drug abuse went up. It could also be due in part to increasing efforts by CNB to nab drug abusers, and we know that they are taking great lengths to do so what with the frequent islandwide and border operations, and the advancements in technology making it easier for them to nab abusers. An enforcement agency with an increasing efficiency will naturally see its arrest numbers go up. 2018 Drug Report claims 26 drug syndicates dismantled, 1600 operations. We will never know how much each factor (crime level/efficiency) comes into play.\n2. You questioned CNB about the price of drugs, and received \'unsatisfactory\' answers. Please put this out for us to judge, if they did not instruct you to keep it privy.\n3. Executions dropped. A lot. I have no idea why.  [https://singaporelegaladvice.com/death-penalty-singapore/](https://singaporelegaladvice.com/death-penalty-singapore/)  says since 2012 death penalty has been eased a little bit. But it still doesnt account for the drops prior to 2012. Last year had a sharp rise to 13, though. That\'s higher than any year all the way back to at least 2003. I have no data on how many death sentences were meted, so I cannot say whether the number of drug traffickers reduced, or whether less are getting the death penalty, as you use for the basis of your argument I highlighted above in pt 5. Even if death penalty is being meted less, we must consider that, as I linked above, we are not so excited in dishing out death penalties anymore. \n4. Regarding that \'purity went down\' article, yes it did mention that, but from what time point? 1970s? Or 1990s? This is an important piece of missing info. If you have access to the full article, do share what it says. \n5. Anyways, so purity of drugs did go down, and you flagged it to be against theoretical reasoning. Well, I must say this can have multiple reasons. Most likely imo, drug syndicates here operate on much smaller scales, and hence peddle low purity drugs to reduce detection (recall that CNB can dismantle dozens of syndicates EVERY YEAR consistently) Contrary to what you have in mind, I think that there is no one big Escobar-like mafia syndicate running huge drug operations locally bringing in high-purity drugs. If you have any counter information, please enlighten me.\n6. By the way, heroin only accounts to one-fifth of abuse cases, not one-third.\n7.  This is where I need a little bit of personal info from you. Do you have a biochemistry background? I studied a little of this kinda stuff, and I can tell you that based on the analytical instruments that the study used (I went to the wiley website and downloaded their supporting info), GC-MS and HPLC, these are VERY VERY sensitive instruments capable of detecting trace amounts of ANYTHING. I would like to hence argue that if there WAS synthetic opoids in there, they probably would have highlighted it. Your casual sentence in another comment ""However, if CNB labs aren\'t testing for them, they can\'t find it."" hence do not hold so much weight too. They probably are using the same instruments, that can detect these chemicals without looking for them. Yes, no matter how potent they are, if its enough to give you a high, it will show up on the machines. I wonder if you asked CNB about this though, because im interested in their response about this\n8. OK. So to summarize, I criticize your article in the following ways 1) Our ambassador was right 2) Your synthetic opoid hypotheis does not hold water, WITHOUT the following information a) That more drug traffickers are indeed being caught with less than 15g heroin, b) that purity of drugs are indeed decreasing recently but local abusers are still satisfactorily high, and c) there are synthetic opoids in our drugs\n9. Bonus: you talked about budget in another comment. I must argue that 120 million dollars for 1 out of 9 home team agencies which collectively spends more than 5 billion dollars is chump change. And using street values to flaunt seizures are perfectly reasonable: These are money that the syndicate is SUPPOSED to earn, which can be used to expand their operations, but now they cant, aka opportunity cost. When we report thieves stealing things from shops, we report their value in retail price, not cost price right?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, for a little public education talk.\n\nWhy do we need drug laws?\n\nDrug laws work. Drug laws tell the society that abusing drugs is NOT okay and IT IS NOT OKAY to abuse drugs. If we legalized drugs, the number of abusers WILL skyrocket, and we wont even need to be discussing about 6k and 3k abusers anymore, and the sg economy will be in deep shit. With drug laws and an enforcement agency, we keep drug peddlers and abusers on their toes, and importantly we deter global drug syndicates. Syndicates in singapore are likely to be locally run, each made up of less than a dozen people. We do not have big overseas organisations trying to earn money off selling drugs to singaporeans because 1) we have so few abusers, 2) its so much hassle having our government breathe down their neck. And both of these are credited to - TADA - drug laws! \n\n(Continued in comment below)', ""Here is the March 2018 letter from Singapore's US ambassador to WaPo that you mentioned as being paywalled:\n\n> Regarding the March 2 news article ‚ÄúAt opioids summit, Trump suggests executing dealers to help end crisis‚Äù:\n\n> Singapore is one of the few countries that have kept drug abuse under control. We take a clearheaded approach.\n\n> We invest significant efforts to prevent drug abuse. The government works closely with community groups, parents and teachers to educate youths and the general public on the harm and consequences of drug abuse. Drug abusers undergo compulsory rehabilitation programs to help them kick their drug habits. Upon release from rehabilitation centers, ex-abusers receive help to reintegrate into society. Tough laws and effective enforcement are a strong deterrent against drug sales and consumption. Stiff penalties punish those who disregard the law and deter others.\n\n> Singapore‚Äôs anti-drug strategy has worked well. Singapore has one of the lowest rates of drug abuse in the world: 30 opiates abusers per 100,000 people, compared with 600 in the United States. The U.S. opioid crisis has been declared a public-health emergency; 64,000 died from drug overdoses in the United States in 2016. In the 1990s, Singapore arrested more than 6,000 drug abusers annually. By 2016, this number had gone down to about 3,000.\n\n> Any suggestion that Singapore‚Äôs judicial process is ‚Äúshrouded in secrecy and misinformation‚Äù is inaccurate. Cases are tried in open court and are reported. The death penalty is imposed only for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking. Singapore does not take joy in the death penalty. But Singaporeans understand the need for it and strongly support it.\n\n> When expressing sympathy for drug traffickers, let us remember the immense harm drugs cause abusers and their families, especially children.\n\n> Ashok Kumar Mirpuri, Washington"", 'You have some interesting points, but\n\n1) You really shouldn\'t link to someone\'s Masters thesis and slam it like that. The guy\'s name is there for all to see. And it is perfectly correct that a thesis that\'s just good enough to get a Masters should be failed by a PhD committee.\n\n2) It is completely unclear what you want to happen. CNB isn\'t hiding anything, the data is all there. CNB can\'t stop the ambassador from ""selling"" Singapore; it\'s his job to be a ""salesman"" and any salesman would praise the good points of his product and hide the bad points.\n\nThe number of executions has gone down. I don\'t think Singapore wants to execute more drug traffickers. Do you want the laws to be changed so that it\'s easier to execute traffickers if they combine less heroin with fentanyl/carfentanil?\n\nThe number of drug users did indeed go down and then back up. That CNB demographic profile page shows that this is primarily due to the ever-increasing numbers of methamphetamine users, from \\~100 in 2005 to 2000+ in 2018. Meanwhile, heroin users grew from 2005 to 2012 (2000+), then crashed to 700 in 2018.\n\nSo I don\'t know much about the world of drugs, but I posit to you that focusing on heroin is a red herring. Perhaps the price crashed because users shifted over to meth, and the demand dropped. Meanwhile, on the supply side, they decreased the purity of the heroin and thus the production cost. Maybe the level of ""high"" remained the same because they added the synthetics. Maybe they didn\'t (the paper about purity mentioned caffeine and chloroquine as the main adulterants), the ""high"" became unsatisfactory, and users switched to meth. \n\nI don\'t actually know any drug users, but presumably, CNB has people on the ground who have an eye on the situation. Going to CNB and asking them questions with the apparent attempt to get them to admit that they aren\'t doing a great job (?) isn\'t going to spur them on to do better. If you have real suggestions on how to improve the situation, by all means voice them.', '> I questioned the CNB over this data and they gave me some very unsatisfactory answers. Then the dataset was taken off data.gov.sg. ... All of the data I used in in the public domain; some have since been rescinded since I contacted the CNB over my interpretation of it.\n\nIt is generally difficult to trust any research or data supplied by the government or indeed by anyone affiliated with any local university, if it is on a subject that is even remotely political/historical. The subject of drugs is certainly a sensitive area.\n\nDo you still have these data that you say have been taken off? I recommend that you just repost them somewhere anyway (anonymously if need be) and shame them about censoring these data after you raised questions about it.', '>Fentanyl and Carfentanil are Schedule 2 drugs: misuse attracts jail terms but not death penalties. We need them to remain available or a lot of patients will suffer needlessly.\n\nI agree, this is the problem here. Either those should have death penalty for illegal trafficking, or the penalties for heroin should be reduced.', ""> In the course of researching this topic, I came across the most useless Master thesis dissertation ever: [https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/23099](https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/23099)  The dissertation is supposedly an analysis of the CNB's effectiveness  as a case study.

But a crackdown on that route led to a shift towards the western overland/underground routes. A shift which ultimately makes halting their movement much harder. This means that drug abuse levels would then be arguable higher, and a contributing factor towards how the US now treats drug abuse--managing drug abuses over hard halting it--which can be seen in several states having needle bins and such. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn SG's context, I would argue that as a island-state, prevent trafficking is much easier relatively speaking. Which allows us to keep drug abuse levels at much lower levels, thus justifying our strict stance towards drug abuse.

Or any videos discussing War on Drugs. \n\nIts been discussed to death for donkey years but for some reason, majority of the population is still in the dark on this."", '[deleted]', 'I will agree that I found little evidence for the Fentanyl and Carfentanil: I found no publication that showed samples confiscated in Singapore that has them; except for one article of Fentanyl arriving by mail. However, if CNB labs aren\'t testing for them, they can\'t find it. I also don\'t have access to such sample for testing.\nhttps://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/deadly-drug-5000-times-more-potent-heroin-mailed-singapore\n\nStill, Americans died from opioids all the time; most of the time, it is because they switched to street heroin, which there isn\'t exactly an FDA for it; thus the strength and purity are unknown. One day, they may get something so much stronger than what they are used to and so they die. The argument that high potential for mistake OD make certain drugs unviable is moot since such drugs are already sold illicitly. At least one guy in Singapore already has plan to use Fentanyl.\n\nMy argument is more or less against people in other countries who think that adopting a Singaporean strategy will work at all. You can\'t do this in America since the President will be voted out of office at the least, or there is violent rebellion. China and Vietnam do execute drug dealers, but the police and courts are so easily corrupted that it\'s pointless. A less corrupted country also use less drugs (at least that\'s what I think). So even with a relatively less corrupted police force and court system, the enforcement strategy could not stem the tide of drugs; precisely because drug dealers aren\'t stupid.\n\nI do agree that 3k/year is nothing. However, the CNB is an organisation that eats a budget of 120 millions/year. That\'s 40k/arrested addict. Well, I don\'t count the arrested dealer since that number is so hard to find (it\'s not in the Police force data. Prison data include total drug-related incarcerated prisoner in that year; interestingly). CNB also estimated that they seized a bit over 6.5 million dollars worth of drugs. This estimation is hilarious. They are using the retail price to calculate the ""damage"" done to the syndicates.\n\nLet me give you an example: 1kg of coffee beans, the good stuff, may cost around 60 dollars retail. That 1kg can make 71 double shots of espresso, which may go for ~3.5 dollars. This means 1kg of beans may make ~250 dollars worth of coffee sale. If I break into the local Starbucks and set fire to 1kg of their beans, Starbucks accountant will record a 60 dollars loss (probably much much less; since this is retail price, and good beans too), not 250 dollars. If they were to sue me at court, yes, they would claim that I did 250 dollars worth of damage.\n\nUsing the very pessimistic profit margin of coffee sales and apply it to drugs, most likely, the syndicates lost about 1.7 millions.\n\nIn CNB defense and it\'s likely that they will make this claim: they don\'t have enough ""resources"". I will bet any amount of money that any country\'s police force will have more traffic police enforcing parking rules, traffic lights, and speeding than drug police. Apparently, we, as a society, have decided that errant parking is a greater threat than drugs. There is a very simple explanation: traffic fines and such raked in 450 millions per year while the CNB spends 120 millions to catch 3k addicts and uncertain number of criminals, and perhaps do 1.6 millions worth of damage to the syndicates.\n\nAnother thing you learn from history is resources, even for the life-or-death situation of total war is not limitless. The political masters actually cannot give their generals everything possible for final victory. If you increase the CNB budget by 10 times, yes, they may be able to do ""something""; but hey, who wants to pay that bill?', 'If you simply lower the heroin threshold of mandatory death sentence, guess what happen? They will no longer traffic heroin. Many ""heroin"" samples seized in places like Canada no longer have heroin in them. They are Fentanyl or Carfentanil plus adulterants. Trafficking pure Fentanyl and Carfentanil are much easier than heroin. They are available from notoriously poorly regulated chemical manufacturers in pure forms. a tiny vial the size of a thumb can contain several grams of them, enough for hundreds of thousands of doses. This vial can be shoved into any crevices anywhere. Once ashore, can simply be mixed into adulterants to make the end product easier to use. The problem would be how to open the vial and start mixing without spreading it through the air, instantly OD anyone breathing it. A drug dealer dropping a vial of Carfentanil in his flat or in the middle of the airport might as well end up conducting a major chemical terroristic attack.\n\nWhen police start to seize cannabis, they buy synthetic THC in pure liquid forms, smuggle it, and sprayed it on tobacco leaves\n\nThat\'s the kind of non-linear measure-countermeasure games that adversaries play in wars.', ""(continued from above)\n\nThis brings me to your Darwinism point. I perfectly agree with the concept, you crack down harder, they make themselves harder to crack down. HOWEVER, this is very theoretical. I do not think that syndicates are evolving that much. These are not superintelligent villains. If they wanted to earn money, there are much easier ways to earn much more money (this is also where I will bring in about the importance of social mobility and in singapore, our education system is pretty enabling, not the most optimal but doesnt fix the economic status of the financially disadvantaged, either). We dismantle 30 syndicates a year. A few more will pop up in the next year, made up of a few small groups of people looking to make some quick bucks probably using similar modus operandi, but not at that level to outwit CNB for an extended period of time. Sure, some will be stronger, but eventually they will still get caught. If it becomes so powerful that it dominates the market, someone will definitely give them away at some point in time and lead to their downfall. So again, you might be having giant syndicates in mind, but really Singapore is not that attractive a place for them to invest in because we are just so small and anti-drug. We simply do not have the market for them to flourish.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAlso to add on, CNB is not stupid. It is a small organisation, but it is well structured and funded. There's enforcement divisions, public education divisions and importantly research divisions. There are people in there whose jobs are to keep the agency up to date on the latest drug trends around the world, and you bet they know theres an opoid epidemic in the US. You argue so much about heroin, but I didnt see you mentioning in your post that the number of heroin cases just plummeted in recent years, sharply overtaken by meth. And hence you see the logical turn of attention to fight meth abuse these few years. And you yourself say that CNB keep these data up and accessible, so I dont think that CNB is overselling themselves at all. They are doing a good job, and the results show. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nNow, I understand your whole analysis is to point out that we should stop telling other countries to follow us. Perhaps that is true, perhaps our system is only possible because we are so small and easy to govern and enforce these laws. If we bring these laws to a much bigger country, the magnitude of the logistics would be impossible to handle. So if that is your point, I agree to an extent, but please dont come to our subreddit and say 'hey, your cnb is bullshit' without any valid points."", '1) I have considered what I term ""interdiction efficiency"". Assuming there is an X amount of drugs and Y amount of addicts, the x% and y% of interdiction efficiency determined the actual amount of drugs seized and the number of addicts arrested. Those 4 variables are unknown and difficult to estimate. I have pondered this question and here is my answer:\n- If you say that the number of addicts arrested or amount of drugs seized cannot really say anything about the ""actual"" drug situation or interdiction efficiency, then the CNB or the ambassador has no rights to be proud of when the number goes down nor should they be embarrassed when it goes back up; as per your position. However, the CNB was really proud. In 2005, the number of drug users arrested were 739, total, and this is the wording of the 2005 report; note that it contained the 10-years trend.\n\n""The drug situation in Singapore remains well under control with further decline in the number of drug abusers arrested in 2005. Drug abusers arrested registered a fall of 17% as compared to 2004. The situation amongst new drug abusers has also improved with a 25% decrease in new abusers arrested.\n\nLast year, CNB mounted 48 major operations against drug traffickers and abusers, which resulted in the break up of 27 syndicated drug trafficking activities.""\n\n2006 rolls in and that year, the number of drug users arrested started to tick up, there are hints that whoever wrote it have trouble reporting things directly. He/she could no longer simply make a remarks against the previous year and has to go really far back. Then it introduced an arbitrary ""goal"" of ""fewer than 500 new drug users"". 10-years trend data is still there.\n""The drug situation in Singapore remains well under control in 2006. 1,127 drug abusers were arrested in 2006 as compared to 793 in 2005.\n\nOverall, the number of abusers arrested has generally been on the decline since the peak in 1994. Between 1994 and 2006, the number of abusers arrested registered an 82% decline.\n\n464 new abusers were arrested last year. This is the second consecutive year that the number of new drug abusers is below the 500 mark.""\n\nThen 2007 rolls in and this is a ""catastrophic"" year; the number of arrests were 2211. For reference, 2002 was 3393, 2003 was 1809. The fruits of enforcement labour of 4 years were wiped away. I am conducting tea leaves reading and putting thoughts into other people\'s mind here; which are actual criticisms of some of my favourite authors: David Glantz (for injecting thoughts into Stavka and Wehrmacht leaders on his page), and Edward Luttwak (of whom I copied lots of my writing style). The latter have a hilariously sarcastic piece on [the (futile) efforts to stamp out drug trafficking in South America.]\n(https://www.lrb.co.uk/v23/n19/edward-luttwak/napoleon-of-medellin)\n> Unless local police are having fun by suborning student-agents to stage yet another ‚Äòcampus-wide crackdown‚Äô, or more fun still by frequenting discos and nightclubs in zero-risk undercover operations to catch drug use in the act (by spying on strip-teasers‚Äô changing-rooms in one recent case) in a ‚Äòvice-city clean-up‚Äô, possession arrests are mere routine ‚Äì a matter of stopping and searching cars driven too fast, or too slowly, by younger drivers at party time, especially if they are black.\n\n>The sheer monotony of it all should long ago have extinguished media interest even in the DEA‚Äôs more elaborate operations, but its well-staffed press offices ‚Äì they are, after all, the DEA‚Äôs budget-enhancing profit centres ‚Äì still succeed in attracting media coverage by reusing the same standard trick to inflate success claims (seized wholesale drugs are invariably valued at far higher street prices) and by supplying well-produced action photographs and video clips of agents storming in, kicking down doors, and striking assault poses with shotguns and sub-machine guns. The drug cops learn new tricks from the TV cop series they obsessively watch, just as TV cop-series scriptwriters hang out with drug cops to hear their stories.\n\n*Sorry for this kind of tangent; it\'s a stylistic choice I got from Luttwak that admittedly made my writing much longer; much too long for ADHD modern people. Back to CNB reports. In 2007, there were 2211 total arrested, this is what they wrote:\n""There is an overall increase in the number of drug abusers arrested in 2007 as compared to 2006. However, the number of new drug abusers remained low and the local synthetic drug abuse situation is also stable.""\nThey explained the rise in number of arrests as:\n""The increase in drug abusers arrested in 2007 is largely due to the classification of buprenorphine as a controlled drug. This is not an unexpected development given that there was a significant number of a known buprenorphine dependant prior to the classification of the drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act.""\n\nTo explain the next few years of trend, I cannot keep quoting the reports. Basically, in these 3 reports, the CNB is very proud of the fact that a) total number of arrests is down, b) new arrests remains low, and c) explains the rise of users by buprenorphine new classification.\n\nAll of the three points are invalidated by data from 2007-2017. c) buprenorphine very quickly lost relevancy: the number of addicts arrested for it halved every year and in 2011, there were 6 arrested (compared to the peak of 841 in 2007). a and b) The number of new addicts went up. In 2007, there was 520 new addicts, it doubled to 1060 in 2008, then went on to 1327 in 2010. This number went down by around 200 in 2012 but in 2016: 1348, 2017: 1249. The number of new addicts kept going UP.\n\nI can\'t actually find numbers for 2018, because the CNB decided that that its 2018 report are not available in my region, for some reason (this is the error I got):\n\n403 ERROR\nThe request could not be satisfied.\nThe Amazon CloudFront distribution is configured to block access from your country. \nGenerated by cloudfront (CloudFront)\nRequest ID: jH6Iq0BJLRX_EQtig7k97ZKWZyjDIVrxWqU0Kb5p2s0VUOIRX_sVXg==\n\nThus, if the number of arrests does not reflect anything, as you say, there is no reason for this kind of changing of style, or, and this is very arrogant of me, block release of its ""public"" reports to everyone in the country I am living in. Take what you will from CNB actions; I just found it hilarious.\n\nIn the absence of true estimation of interdiction efficiency, I have to rely on the price; guess what, drugs have been getting cheaper. Heroin is about 2.5x cheaper than the peak, meth (despite increasing users), is 3x cheaper. The data is unfortunately taken off data.gov.sg. It will be too arrogant of me to claim that ""it was because of me"" and I doubt CNB will say so.\n\n(to be continued)', '1. It\'s a Masters thesis that is publicly available and shared for the purpose of scientific critique. That\'s the whole point of research. There\'s a reason why it\'s \\*peer-reviewed\\*.  \n\n2. How do you know it\'s ""just good enough"" to get a Masters? The guy enrolled in a Masters.

The guy\'s name is there for all to see.\n\nThat is absurd.\n\nIt would be one thing if this were some JC student\'s project work. This Master\'s thesis is publicly available and open to both criticism and praise.\n\nPerhaps OP could have been ""nicer"" or more polite with his criticism, but the idea that we shouldn\'t generally link to and criticise people\'s Master\'s thesis is crazy.', 'I think his point is that CNB, and by extension the government, oversells Singapore\'s effectiveness in its drug policy. That\'s a perfectly valid point to make, and does not require a ""real suggestion"" on how to improve the situation.', '1) By the same measure, no one should post a bad review of a book, a newspaper article, a film, a screenplay, or any piece of work since the author\'s name ""is there for all to see"". I used my example of my PhD committee but I seriously doubt any research paper, dissertation, or book that used 80% of its length for literature review and 20% for the actual ""research"" will be accepted to any reasonably rigorous journal, school, or committee.\n\n2) The CNB isn\'t ""hiding"", yes; as a matter of fact, I used their data. However, CNB did make deliberate choices to rescind data previously published (Price of major drugs of abuse) and remove the historical, longitudinal trend in the publicly released reports. To me, it\'s a case study of the kind of pressure and different methods of reporting that government agencies have to do to keep their raison d\'√™tre. Believe it or not, I am a lot of sympathetic to these kinds of pressure than I used to be when I was younger. I instead have very low expectation of any and all government programs.\n\nMy focus on heroin was because it was apparently an anomaly in the trend of the response of drug dealers against enforcement attempts. Typically, the response is exactly as I stated: they start moving drugs in purer forms. Purer drugs are less bulky, more easily concealed, and harder to interdict. Cannabis is a very bulky and cheap substance; attempts to interdict it has lead to the shift to crystal meth, Fentanyl and Carfentanil, which are altogether more dangerous. If you look at seizures of methamphetamine class drugs, in Singapore, recently, little low purity Yaba was seized, more crystal meths were caught. This is how most drugs evade interdiction.\n\nYour position that the price of heroin dropped since the share of heroin use dropped has 2 issues. First, the period where the price of heroin start to drop is also the period when the number of arrested heroin users go up. The number of heroin users did go down recently, but the price has already crashed several years before that. BTW, the price of meth has ALSO crashed, and the crash is even steeper than heroin\'s, despite increasing number of arrested users. A more correct interpretation is cheaper drugs lead to more users.\n\nCheaper drugs means either the supply is up or the demand is down. Demand did not go down; not for meth. Supply does go up since the seizure amount went up. If seizure is up (it went up, and purer, too; for meth) but price is down and demand is not down, then it means the amount that got through is greater than the demand, driving down price. \n\nMy theory of the added Fentanyl and Carfentanil is an attempt to explain the heroin anomaly. My great interest from an intellectual POV is the human response to adversarial forces and this is simply so good. I have informed the CNB my interpretation so really, I can\'t be faulted for not being constructive. I simply asked that what is their interpretation and I gave mine.\n\nIf you simply lower the heroin threshold of mandatory death sentence, guess what happen? They will no longer traffic heroin. Many ""heroin"" samples seized in places like Canada no longer have heroin in them. They are Fentanyl and Carfentanil plus adulterants. Trafficking pure Fentanyl and Carfentanil are much easier than heroin. They are available from notoriously poorly regulated chemical manufacturers in pure forms. a tiny vial the size of a thumb can contain several grams of them, enough for hundreds of thousands of doses. This vial can be shoved into any crevices anywhere. Once ashore, can simply be mixed into adulterants to make the end product easier to use. The problem would be how to open the vial and start mixing without spreading it through the air, instantly OD anyone breathing it. A drug dealer dropping a vial of Carfentanil in his flat or in the middle of the airport might as well end up conduct a major chemical terroristic attack.\n\nIn the end, I am hardly the most vocal, strongest, nor most sarcastic voice against the criminalisation of drugs; there are numerous authors writing about other places. People who argued for it typically point to Singapore\'s draconian enforcement as proof of success. I have my own version of that argument when people say that guerrilla and partisan wars are very difficult to win, and I simply point out that if you are willing to go apeshit genocidal, you can (sort of) win, if you are willing to be the organisational equivalent of the SS, Gestapo, or NKVD. Singapore is an example of a reasonably ruled-by-law country with strong drug penalties; question is: is the data supportive of the fact that drug enforcement, even when it\'s as harsh as Singapore while still being (somewhat) civil can indeed reduce drug use? I simply wrote about the Singapore\'s data. The CNB is hardly the NKVD, SS, Gestapo or SMERSH (SMERt\' SHpionam, ""Death to Spies"").\n\nMy view is the level of drug use is more dependant on the population in question rather than the enforcement efforts.\n\nNow if you ask me, what I would do to completely stamp out drug use, if I get into power to do so. Well, I would set up a department call SMERNARKO (SMERt\' NARKOtorgovets, ""Death to Drug Dealers"") and conduct NKVD/Stalinist-style Great Terror/Great Purge on ""enemies of the people"". That is simply the only and next escalation in the War against Drugs.\n\nIf that sounds too harsh, well, ask yourself why. And we have such an example already.', 'Yes, I still have them. The problem is that they are simple csv files with generic licence files attached to it; not really a kind of authenticated data with signatures on it, you know. \n\nI still keep the emails I asked them about the interpretation.

You, or at least anyone with the right authority or security clearance, can walk into its office and ask the HR person, who need to get the appropriate approvals of course. Also a more interesting thing is the personal dynamics of the leaders at different levels (for eg: how Stalin's versus Hitler's style of leadership changed from 1941 to 1945 and how it affected the operational capability of the armies in the field); also how different people interpreted and wrote it down in their memoirs afterwards. \n\nThis dissertation's organisational analysis of the is hardly more than a summary of the org. chart. \n\nIf you want a back-of-the-enevelope analysis of Singapore Police Force and CNB organisation, consider that Singapore Police force probably has more traffic police than drug police.

What does that mean? it means a lot of them don't meet the death penalty threshold. Around one-third to one-fifth of arrested drug users are heroin-related, meaning people are still trafficking it. The question is why?\n\nHere's my guess, if I am correct: the problem with synthetic opioids are they hard to handle safely in pure forms. It's much easier to mix it into a bulkier substance. Heroin is already there, kinda available and are more familiar. Might as well mix it in and traffic the low concentration, less-likely-to-be-killed stuff. \n\nAlso, look at it from the criminal perspective.

My findings, as I stated in my communication: The data was distributed under Singapore Open Data License .\n\nBesides, you can, should, and have the rights to ask that question directly to the CNB, though it will be a little bit hard since they have already removed the price data, which I still have, and according to the Open Data License, I have the rights to redistribute; unless in the meantime, they reclassified it as ""Restricted"" and I may get hit by bullshit legal arguments. You have a Parliament, you have representatives, you are a citizen of a democratic country, exercise your rights.\n\n4) This is the data of judicial execution, broken down by crime:\n\nAs you can see, more people are being executed recently for drug charges; but it\'s still only 10 or so per year. In 2012 and 2013, there was no execution. Given that there is a bit of a lag of several years between arrests, trials, ad executions, the number of executions reflected the enforcement and trafficking activity of several years behind. In any case, around 2012-2013 is also the year that it was the peak total number of drug users arrested.\n\nIf you look at the number of convicted prison inmates admitted, broken down by age group. The number of drug related convicted prisoners stayed rather stable through the years, hovering around 2000. It did not jump as drastically as the number of drug users arrested. Another hint to why arresting drug dealers don\'t really contribute to rise or fall in the number of addicts.\n\nTo their credits, the CNB must have realised this at some point and they do shift or increase the resources into prevention, education, and rehabilitation. Early reports prior to 2007 mostly focused on ""how many we arrested"". The much longer (3x longer) 2017 report spent a lot of that paper not talking about how many we arrested but more ""what are we doing to prevent addiction"". Is it working? 2016 has 1348 new addicts arrested, 2017: 1249. 2018: I can\'t get the report but the data.gov.sg data shows the number 1366.\n\nThe total number of arrests within the last 3 years also did not go down: 2018 number is 3,438; 2017 was 3091.

Anyway, One sample was from a lab in Penang in 1986, the other two are from 2013 and 2016.\n\n5) CNB does not dismantle ""dozens of syndicates"". Note the wording of the report; I love the 2005 reports. It\'s precise, to the point, and full of pride:""break up of 27 syndicated drug trafficking activities."" It broke up ""activities"" not ""syndicates"". The 2017 reports made the impression that 23 ""syndicates"" were crippled. One explanation is that syndicates are simply popping up left, right, and center, which speaks to the futility of trying to whack them down. The other explanation is well, there are fewer syndicates but they are so resilient that dozens of ""syndicated activities"" can be disrupted in a year and in the next, they act with the same vigor. Take your pick, really.\n\n6) I might be wrong when it comes to heroin, but the other popular drug, which started to overtake heroin from 2015 followed the typical trend: 2004, the 16235 tablets of Yaba (low quality and purity methamphetamine was seized). In the same year, 0.37kg of Ice (crystal methamphetamine) was seized. In 2012, only 827 Yaba tablets were seized but 22.18kg of Ice.\n\nThe point still stands: purer drugs to evade interdiction; this is accurate with meth. Note that the mandatory death penalty for meth is right now 250g.\n\n7) I no longer deals with biochemistry or analytical testing. I have greater interests in history and human conflicts. If you read enough of it, certain things stands out. There are things that are close to physical laws in conflicts. What to do when the enemy has a lot more firepower than you and is occupying your country? Guerrilla warfare. Is it new? No. Guerrilla comes from the Spanish word for ""little wars"": of Spanish insurgents against Napoleon I\'s brother\'s rule. Shouldn\'t armies the world over know how to fight them by now? As of 2019, they don\'t. There was only one success: the British in the Malayan Emergency. Somehow, Russia is still very cold, Afghanistan still unconquerable, etc ... The response is very very simple but somehow it keep being effective.\n\nThe principle to evade interdiction of substances by law enforcement is very very simple: purer forms, different drugs, dispersed distribution. People have done it for millennia. It doesn\'t take a super villain to figure this out. And somehow it kept being effective. The immutable law is very simple: a smaller thing is harder to find than a bigger thing and if you distribute your shipment to a very large number of routes, couriers, and packages, it is very hard to be interdicted with limited (and it will always be) limited. With very pure chemical, it is now possible to be mailed. Consider that SingPost is so short staffed that mailmen throw mails away, I seriously doubt Customs and Border checks has anything close to enough to interdict anything through the mail.\n\nAgain, the authors of the paper are still very contactable. You can go and contact them, or the CNB.\n\n9) Wholesale vs retail price. I do suggest you read Edward Luttwak\'s impressively sarcastic piece on the War on Drugs. It was his opinion; not mine. I\'ve already quoted the sections but I do suggest you read it up. Escobar was constantly put down by Americans as ""just a thug"". I\'m not saying Malaysian and Singaporean crime lords are ""Napoleonic"" or ""Escobar"" in capability but in conflicts, you just need to be ""good enough"".\n\nAnd here I quote Luttwak, again:\n\n""It is a general principle of strategy that even effective tactical conduct will turn out to be counter-productive if the ultimate goal is mistaken.""\n\nTo their credits, the CNB probably realised that interdiction is no longer effective (by itself). It was admitted in the 2017 report: It still need to generates headlines of arrests, like Luttwak argued, to drum up support and budget for the agency. The big issue, from my point of view, is that the average Singaporeans still think the old-fashion way: ""hang them"". Continue ignoring the root cause simply means it\'s too late to recognise it.', 'The difference between a Master and a PhD by research is generally expected length and volume, not quality. Quality has to be publishable.

Drug users in Singapore is less heavily punished than in America. There is a threshold of ""intent to traffic""; below that you are a user, above that, a dealer. Decriminalisation of drug use varies in the next response. In Singapore, arrested users need to undergo mandatory drug rehabilitation. In a few places, rehab is welcomed but not mandatory. In any case, there is little consensus of what is an ""effective"" rehabilitation program.\n\nThen there\'s the argument of who\'s gonna pay for the mandatory rehab. Fiscal conservatives and ""taxation is theft"" crowd argues against taking their hard-earned money to help others who, according to them, did it out of their own accord. Tax rate in Singapore is really low, though, so this is not (too) big of a problem.\n\nDecriminalised drug use does not mean decriminalisation of drug sale, manufacture, or trafficking.

Yes, the AUS example is pretty well known, owing to various news outlets having done features on it. However, it should be noted that the type of drugs making it in through mail is also restricted, most notably that weed is extremely difficult to make it through some methods owing to its strong smell. And that weed abuse is one of the top 3 rising cases of drug abuse in SG context, which would imply that trafficking weed into SG via this method is hard, allowing CNB to enforce weed control much easier relatively speaking.\n\nI dont have any knowledge on the street price of drugs and am thus unable to comment on that portion.', '[deleted]', ""Ok, you don't get my point.

Nevertheless, it\'s still the second most popular drug.\n\nIf you look at methamphetamine, the purity is exactly what is expected. In 2004, >16k Yaba pills (low purity meth) but only .37kg of crystal meth was seized. In 2017, hardly any Yaba was caught (<1k) but 22.18kg of crystal meth. 2013 was particularly bad (or good), with 22k Yaba and 44kg of crystal meth. 2018 saw 5k Yaba and 19.3kg of crystal meth.\n\nThere are simply more crystal meth around. And the price is really cheaper, too. And the share and number of new addicts to crystal meth being arrested also went up; despite varying number of seizures.\n\nIf I can make this observation, the enforcement efforts drove low-quality heroin out (if we assume that there is absolutely no synthetic opioids), it was only replaced by crystal meth. The number of meth addicts keep going up. Between crystal meth and heroin, the former is more dangerous to bystanders than the latter. Heroin is a depressant. Users turn into a sack of potato; too much and they die. Meth makes them really violent.\n\nOh and here\'s a really interesting thing about crystal meth: [North Korea manufactures and sells it](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/12/world/asia/north-korea-crystal-meth-methamphetamine-drugs-.html). North Korean diplomats have been arrested for smuggling meth. They can\'t be charged through, diplomatic immunity; the most you can do is to declare persona non grata and show them the airport. Diplomatic cargo aren\'t screened. However, it is believed that [they have stopped doing it](https://www.thedailybeast.com/kim-jong-un-breaking-bad-the-secret-world-of-north-korean-meth) after a few scandals. Still there is a North Korean embassy in Singapore. Supposedly crime rings in China are moving them through the region, and indeed, business is [booming](https://www.asiaone.com/health/un-says-meth-boom-sweeping-asia). Supposedly, the production of meth in North Korea is no longer state-sanctioned, but by small scale productions from people learned the craft in the state-run enterprises. Good luck stamping that out, or the drug lords in China. There are a lot of foreign Chinese flowing in and out of Singapore, right? \n\nThere is one extremely interesting data that I cannot find and that is ""the number of people arrested for drug crimes"" per year. Singapore Police Force [crime cases data ](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/overall-crime-cases-crime-rate?resource_id=efc3dd2a-8779-46be-b8c7-882712d49451) does not have a class for ""Drug crime"". Police Force data for [Islandwide Persons Arrested for Selected Major Offences ](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/islandwide-persons-arrested-for-selected-major-offences) also have no ""Drug"". Finally, only the Singapore Prison Service [Convicted Penal Admission ](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/convicted-penal-admission?resource_id=8782c174-416f-49d0-a20a-0946433e168f), broken down by offence group gave me a glimpse of that. I believe this can show the number of criminals convicted of drug related offences.\n\nGuess what, the number of drug-related convicts each year stayed very stable; much more stable than the addict arrests rate (admittedly, I can\'t find the data for the ""good"" year of 2005 where fewer than 800 addicts were arrested). Since 2006 to 2018, the number hovered around 2000. Pause and think about this for a moment: if 2000 per year are being convicted for drug-related offences and admitted to prison, this stayed stable through the years, and very few people getting executed, what does that mean? Then to ""support"" and make drug dealing profitable for those 2000 criminals (who knows how many more), how many drug addicts need to buy from them? You don\'t make much living selling to just one or two guys (ask any MLM reps). 2000? 6000? more?\n\nI also have the convicted penal population of drug crime. It\'s hovering around 6500 throughout the period. What does that mean? meaning 2k drug criminals are convicted and the same number being released every year. And fewer than a handful get executed in those years, despite (very?) stringent death penalty laws, what does that mean? whatever that they were carrying weren\'t enough to kick in the death penalty.\n\nSo, here\'s my summary of what happened to the drug statistics since 2002: Singapore managed to keep the total number of arrested addicts stable (3393 in 2002, 3,438 in 2018). There are a few more new addicts (911 in 2002, 1366 in 2018). This need to be consider with the fact that Singapore population went from 3.38 millions in 2002 to 3.99 millions in 2018); meaning that on average CNB effort ""may"" be effective to stabilise the situation; but the ""good"" 2005 year caught everyone by surprise.\n\nCNB managed to shift the drug of choice from heroin, which is admittedly quite dangerous for the users, but less so by bystanders, to something incredibly dangerous for both the [person](https://www.rehabs.com/explore/meth-before-and-after-drugs/infographic.php#.XK_oleszZhE) and bystanders.\n\nThe total number of drug users arrested and the drug problem of Singapore remains reasonably lower than most developed countries. However, my analysis is simply to point out that Singapore is not the exception when it comes to the the measure-countermeasure, adaptation, evolution of war between drug dealers and law enforcement. The exact same thing happened. There is a concept in war called the OODA loop: observe‚Äìorient‚Äìdecide‚Äìact; someone is said to have a smaller OODA loop if they change and adapt faster than their opponent. You can say that the CNB is adapting to changing tactics but my view is the criminals have a smaller loop. They found heroin is highly unprofitable (in the sense that the mules get killed); possibly that\'s why 2005 was a ""good"" year. Then they made the switch before the police could shift the attention, which explained the rise; quadruple in just 4 years. The police OODA loop is so big that they could not find a way to stop the rise of meth, either relatively or absolutely, given 10 years. I can give them some leeway if you use addicts per population rate; however, I suspect you will find similar decrease in smoking and alcohol drinking rate, despite we are not hanging alcohol or tobacco sellers (with the possible exception of ultra-conservative Sharia judges). If you argue on a purely interdiction point of view: crystal meths are purer than heroin, making it easier to hide. The death penalty threshold of meth is much higher, 250g. The rise of the Internet, online shipping by a vast number of couriers and carriers means interdiction of mails is harder than ever. If SingPost, the organisation with the job to handle every single piece of mail do not have enough staff to deliver all of them; I doubt any other organisation that is not generate a single cent of profit make a tiny dent.\n\nLet\'s take even another step back and look at history for a moment. The first drug scare was opium smoking. Arguably, opium smoking and eating are more harmful than not using them. The enforcement efforts of yesteryears led to the development of purer and purer morphine, which is more dangerous. Bayer created injectable heroin, originally as a ""replacement of the addictive opium""; it was thought that the act of eating opium or taking morphine by mouth created the cravings. Illicit heroin was probably even more dangerous than morphine. Singapore managed to shift the addition from low quality heroin to crystal meth. What\'s next? Only time will tell; but I doubt it will be a less dangerous drug.\n\nThere is another nuanced point: a lot of the argument for legalisation stressed the great harm being done to people thrown into prison for nothing more than a possession charges. To its credits, Singapore does not charge people for possession charges. I have seen the Prosecutor of New York argued that practically, New York no longer prosecutes people on possession charges (you can light up a blunt in front of a police station and they won\'t arrest you). The harm to individuals with little more crime and just using drugs by the legal system is not too great in Singapore. What I am worried about and why I think the heavy-handed information campaign against drug dealers is misguided is that the population associate drug users with dealers and ostracising the long-term users (the number of repeated arrest addicts are not going down for meth, BTW). They simply don\'t care anymore; and Singapore is actually more lenient towards users than the USA used to be. However, the enforcement efforts does change drug availability to something a lot more dangerous.', 'I\'m aware of the differences. I\'m just critical of /u/duepomegranate\'s logical fallacy in their statement - ""it is perfectly correct that a thesis that\'s just good enough to get a Masters should be failed by a PhD committee"".  \n\n\nI don\'t think your criticism is harsh, in fact I think it is rather deserving. I haven\'t read the thesis proper, but 80% literature review is plain ridiculous.', 'First, alcohol and tobacco are legal, but regulated. There are restrictions on the buying age and time, which can be circumvented, but put a hassle on the user. There are further regulation on where and when you can consume it. Sales tax of them contributed a cool 2 billions to the government coffer. Technically, anyone can smoke or drink as much as they can, but our society hasn\'t collapsed, has it? Well, they die earlier. You know what that mean? They toil their lives away, pay taxes to use what they are addicted to and then die early, saving everyone Medicare and Medicaid money. Isn\'t it grand?\n\nWell, that\'s a very old argument. You may argue that the ""chemical hook"" of opioids are much stronger thus it\'s different than alcohol or tobacco, which is actually disputed, btw. As far as I can see, it\'s pretty hard to kick either alcohol or tobacco, anyway. Opioids. Well, people OD on it now and then even on legal ones. The US gov declared an epidemic because, hey ho, white people are dying. They should have just acted like they did against the blacks and brown people and treat them with disdain. Poor whites were dying anyway, less welfare to pay.\n\nThe addicts will die early. I understand it. They have already forsaken life. I personally think that if we treat them like scum, calling them criminals and low-lives, then being sedated by drugs is less painful. Shouldn\'t we let them pass away peacefully rather than pulling them back into a painful life and ""be a productive member of society"" (wage slave). Either we change our way of thinking and think about ways we can absorb them back with love or there is simply no end to this.\n\nThere is a strategic problem of police vs crime: criminals are punished for mistakes. Mistakes here means slipups that result in them being arrested. Police is not punished for failures to deliver results. Failing of any and all government program can invoke thenfive standard excuses:\nhttps://youtu.be/6Y4PEqvk0Jg\n\nIn short, there is a Darwinism among criminals and no selection pressure among the police. This results in better surviving criminals and weaker police, comparatively.\n\nHow did they end the catastrophe that was the Prohibition? Legalisation.\n\nNevertheless the American government learned a very neat trick: while it\'s hard to find incriminating evidence like drugs or murder, it\'s much easier to charge people for tax evasion. Oh, you have enough money to buy a million dollars yatch? Where\'s the tax return big man? IRS audit incoming and bam! Another crime lord goes to prison for tax evasion. That\'s how Al-Capone was put away.\nSo, every criminal in America learns the lesson: pay your tax. If police really want to do it, they can sniff out the criminals. But finding incriminating evidence is hard, and that budget deficit isn\'t gonna fix itself.\n\nPossibly the only anti-crime campaign that worked successfully solely by enforcement strategy is the Malayan Emergency, which is weird because it was a guerilla war. Still, in that Emergency, the key to win was not to root out and kill the insurgents. It was to drain the support of the populace. Without support and money, many insurgents simply desert, go back to their families ornl just surrender and sell out their comrades for some money. Still that success was a rarity among many many failed counter-insurgency.\n\nLet\'s also not forget that police are also self-preserving and they have limited resources, too. The police ranks-and-files may not fear death for themselves, but they have vulnerable families: husband, wife, children. The heavily armed police can protect themselves while on duty, but there is not enough security resource in the world to protect them or their families 24/7. A few strategically placed killing and raping of officer wives, daughters and sons will have devastating effects on morale. Can you find evidence linking the crimelord to the sacrificial foot soldier who raped and murdered the innocent? At most, you can get one. What else? Reprisal killings of gangs? Police bursting into suspected gang house, shooting everyone because ""I swesr he got a gun"".\n\nThat\'s how in many places, police adopt a ""live and let live"" strategy. Don\'t show your face to the general public. Don\'t kill people in broad daylight. Don\'t be too much of a nuisance. Don\'t be so obvious with your criminal bullshit. We\'ll leave you alone. Perhaps take a small cut. \n\nOnto hacking. Note that the most effective cybersecurity and counter-hacking methods does not from a government agency. No. It comes from the private sector who is also under Darwinism selection pressure should they fail: they go out of business. Letting government do cybersecurity and you will end up with zero security. The most secure browser on Earth, Tor, which allows you to get to the Dark Web is a private venture funded ~80% by the US government. Why? Because CIA spies need secured connections, too. But CIA can\'t do it; so they contracted others. Police is useful since they have guns which can shoot at identified, but resisting hackers.\n\nPoint is: police generally cannot be ahead of criminals. At least not directly; but there are alternative strategies to breakup worst of it. For eg: the majority of drug dealers in Sydney are biker gangs. A long time ago, most of drug in Australia was hippies growing cannabis in the forest. Then the police cracked down on them. Now it\'s violent biker gangs selling meth. Biker gangs are dangerous and violent, so police have a harder time cracking down on them than hippies. Live and let live. But police have the powers to arrest bikers when 3 of them are together. Just 24 hours temporary hold. It beeaks up large concentration of them and drive drug dealing to less visible places.', ""> Decriminalisation means no regulation.\n\nUh no what, that's not what decriminalisation means."", ""Weed is hardly profitable enough for this.

Falling that, there's hash oil, concentrated cannabis oil, which are also very much available for purchase.\n\nAnd as always, meth. It's the no. 1 drug in Singapore right now.

A docile population creates soft criminals who in turn create weaker police. Singapore police, I'm sorry, are no NKVD or MVD. The Vietnamese or Chinese police are much more ruthless to root out enemies, when they need do. However, they are also more corrupted, as do the whole population.

This case is more a failure of the human factor rather than pure cybersecurity (SingHealth hack). Now, I'm not really an authority on NKVD et. al., methodology but I believe what would have happened if they handled the case is that Brochez would ended up dead in a robbery gone wrong.

Maybe they are a business. This is another way to know which parcel to pull and check. However, note that this requires a long history: a lot of parcels will get through before you can establish a pattern.\n\nOther methods can be employed: opening of shell/front import operations. It\'s not strange for such outfit to receive a lot of shipments. Rigorous examination of tax returns and income statement may reveal a few thing.\n\nPerhaps, you can even direct your shipments to an innocent company with a mole in the mailroom, with the instruction to keep packages addressed to certain person. \n\nWhy should a buyer even enter my address? How about entering the address of a neighbour, who is known to not be at home during the delivery time and the ""authority to leave"" was given? The parcel will end up in front of an innocent home doorstep to be picked up at the opportune time. Let\'s say CNB stake out to nab whoever try to pick the parcel up. Well, parcel theft is a lesser crime readily admitted. Btw, do the person picking up the parcel need to be the same as the one ordering it? To create divergent paper trail? Scrub the phones and emails of messages. Contact only face-to-face.\n\nI\'m just outlying simple strategies of measures and counter-measures, that I thought up for fun, that may or may not have been used. There are whole books of similar techniques, used by spies. No need to argue with me whether it\'s feasible or if there is any evidence of their use in actual drug business. \n\nThe fact that drugs has become purer and cheaper speaks to the reality that you can\'t interdict the flow of drugs to any appreciable degree. The resource of police is eternally limited and criminals practically unlimited; so the result is predictable.', ""> There has been no government agency, or very few that has been outright shutdown anywhere for ineffectiveness. \n\nLol? Are you Singaporean? Have you heard of the former Duke-NUS NRP, or how countless schools have been shut down because of the falling birthrate? Government agencies that fail to meet their goals get shuttered, or the staff replaced until they meet the goals.\n\n> It is my long held view that the population, police, and criminals reflect each others. A docile population creates soft criminals who in turn create weaker police. Singapore police, I'm sorry, are no NKVD or MVD. The Vietnamese or Chinese police are much more ruthless to root out enemies, when they need do. However, they are also more corrupted, as do the whole population. In other words, low crime, low corruption have less to do with the police, law, themselves; but more because of the population itself.\n\nOk. So please explain to me how the population itself fundamentally changed without state intervention, within a few decades. From e.g. the 50's when secret societies, opium dens, kidnappings, bribery, riots, etc. were widespread, to the 90's onwards when these things are practically unheard of.\n\n\n> there is only 3 places where I am not afraid that the taxi driver will cheat me: Singapore, Japan, and South Korea. Coincidentally, perhaps, they have lower crime, corruption, and drugs. Yes, all three have decent police and rule of laws; but the population in general is also nicer. Efforts to brutally enforce discipline failed more often than they succeed.\n\nHuh? And you think that the nicer populations have nothing at all to do with these countries having experienced brutal regimes less than a century ago? The Singapore legal system is relatively lenient. Japan and Korea were part of the brutal Japanese Empire (i.e. military dictatorship) for years, and Korea was then under a Korean military dictatorship until 1979.\n\n>This case is more a failure of the human factor rather than pure cybersecurity (SingHealth hack). \n\nWell, the human is generally the weakest link in cybersecurity. The SingHealth hack was also a case of social engineering.\n\n> Kudos to the rule-of-law adherence; though.\n\nYup, application of force without law is tyranny."", "">  And you think that the nicer populations have nothing at all to do with these countries having experienced brutal regimes less than a century ago?\n\nThe brutality and social engineering done by the governments of these countries does not approach the level of the Soviet Union under Stalin, the Chinese Communist under Mao, or the various current Islamic governments. Alcohol is prohibited under Islam; it has been so for over a thousand years. Somehow, in Teheran, whiskey is about as expensive as in New York. Iranians are drinking it and the alcohol is being smuggled by the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). Social engineering, vanguard party just don't work very consistently.\n\nEither Singapore, Japan, and South Korea came up with a secret sauce of government intervention or it's something else entirely. Social engineering failed more often than not (see the entire history of Socialism); thus relying on it as a principle is not reliable. Maybe there's a form of it that is effective, but I am towards the slow development of a population-level morality as a more reliable, if slow method since I can find better evidence for it.\n\nGreater men than us thought that they could do it to their society and failed. I'm not about to say that there could even be a single thing that's different. Perhaps LKY is altogether an even greater or wiser man; but hey, survivorship bias, never forget that. Had he failed, we would never even mention his name. Rwanda supposedly followed the Singapore model to claw its way out of a devastating civil war and genocide. It is being held together through the iron will of its President Paul Kagame, who has been the President for 19 years. He is quite old right now, 61 years old. We may live long enough to see if the whole enterprise unravel but the Soviet Union took a lot of time to unravel and in its day, some thought that it was utopia. Yugoslavia was stable, until the Soviet Union collapsed and suddenly, Balkanisation is a word."", ""Yeah, personally I'm not sure why either."", ""Survivorship bias, never forgets that. Don't read memoirs. Memoirs exists rarely to teach but to excuse failures (Hilary Clinton's memoirs or everything put out by German generals post WWII) or, pardon my expression, mentally jerking him/herself off over victories.. You don't get to read dead people memoirs very often. There's unlucky failure but lucky enough to live; those are the worst memoirs to read.\n\nThe scholarship on the precise topic pointed only to a) individual, private incentives (pro-Capitalism), and b) very slow population development. The institutes that supposedly grant freedom and rule-of-law are very quickly perversed if the population is corrupted. How to make the population less corrupted? There are signs of slow development anywhere you look; but it's slow.\n\nThis is perhaps the best example I could find\n\nhttps://warontherocks.com/2019/02/jaw-jaw-chinas-great-power-disease/\n\n>Two years ago I drove northeast China, since foreigners, only residents can get a drivers license. And I like driving. I did so with a Chinese pal of mine who is a policeman, he spent the entire time complaining how judges can‚Äôt be trusted anymore in China. They used to be party officials, now they are actually lawyers, because they created the legal profession after the death of Mao, where they study law. Studying law they get infected by the rule of law and now he says they won‚Äôt accept confessions, claiming we beat them up, they demand evidence. I arrest somebody Monday, I see him walking the streets Wednesday. I‚Äôm getting more and more angry. Okay? That was his oblique testimony. He said, it‚Äôs only when we catch them with drugs that we can just execute them."", 'Another example of apparent successful crime enforcement was the drop in violent crime in New York in the early 90s. Around the 1980s and early 1990s, New York, as well as much of America was swept with a wave of violent crimes, typically associated with cracked cocaine. The epidemic is help by the CIA with its [Contra affairs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair).\n\nThe violence and crimes dropped suddenly in the early 90s. The mayor of New York was very proud and attributed it to his policy allowing police to randomly stop people and frisk them for drugs and weapons; the ""stop and frisk"" program, which disproportionately targeted black people. Another thing, mentioned in The Tipping Point by Malcom Gladwell is the ""Broken Window"" theory. Supposedly, the police need to keep the city, and the infrastructure looking nice, no graffiti, and no signs of vandalism, etc ... The idea is that the presence of such ugliness, created the illusion that crimes and vandalism is OK and encourage more crimes.\n\nThe problem with the ""Broken Window"" hypothesis or the whole ""enforcement"", ""Stop and Frisk"" supposed effectiveness is that crime decreased over the same time frame across America, regardless of what the police do. So what happened?\n\nThe best and most consistent explanation I got is [legalised abortions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legalized_abortion_and_crime_effect), fewer unwanted children who grow up to commit crimes. In short, the population changed. Mayor Bloomberg, like you, would probably disagree. However, the data when looked closely does not support the theory. He would say ""how can you explain the sudden drop in crime?"". There is an explanation; just that people don\'t like it.', '> The problem with the ""Broken Window"" hypothesis or the whole ""enforcement"", ""Stop and Frisk"" supposed effectiveness is that crime decreased over the same time frame across America, regardless of what the police do. So what happened?\n\nHow do you explain people from high-crime countries moving to low-crime countries such as Singapore and *immediately* modifying their behaviour before anyone gets aborted? Or Singaporeans going to Malaysia and immediately throwing trash out of cars, even if the same person would never do that in Singapore?\n\nNo, I think broken window theory works. Humans are social creatures and we take cues from our environment. See everyone else following the law and you\'re more likely to behave lawfully. See blatant evidence around you that many people don\'t follow the law... And why should you? It\'s just politically incorrect in liberal America because it implies that policing should increase in crime ridden, majority-black areas.', ""There is a simpler explanation: the voluntary emigrates are generally of higher up on the social-economical ladder. After all, you need money to buy at least a ticket. Then there's the pressure to not do anything wrong since it will damage their visa, which they paid so much for. That's a more consistent explanation.\n\nWhen people emigrated involuntarily, like the wave of Muslim, Middle Eastern, and African refugees/migrants that flooded Europe, somehow, they don't behave very well. Much of alarmist rhetorics of the right-wing nationalists are indeed overblown, but there are some kernels of truths to it. European governments has to publish drawings to explain that unwarranted touching of women are not acceptable.\n\nShort-term visitors seemingly have the same issue: the endless stories of unruly PRC Chinese tourists: spitting everywhere, shitting in front of MRT station lift, etc ... American tourists talking loudly everywhere and being obnoxious. There are books worth of kiasu behaviour among Singaporean tourists. I remember one tale: Japanese shops do provide free samples: but if a group of Singaporeans approaches, they hide the samples. Those blows a whole in the Broken Window theory, too.\n\nI do agree that people behave worse when they move to more rowdy areas. The reverse is less true, however."", '> When people emigrated involuntarily, like the wave of Muslim, Middle Eastern, and African refugees/migrants that flooded Europe, somehow, they don\'t behave very well. \n\nAFAIK, they don\'t ""behave as well"" as the natives... But they still exhibit lower crime rates than their countries of origin.\n\n> Those blows a whole in the Broken Window theory, too.\n\nUhhh no, that\'s a ridiculous strawman argument, you have to control for their baseline behaviour.', '> But they still exhibit lower crime rates than their countries of origin.\n\nI\'ll tell you to find statistics to prove that involuntary emigrates/refugee commit crimes at a lower rate than the people of the same age, gender, and socio-economic class in the country of origin. Otherwise, it\'s just rhetorics.  Also, the record keeping of their country origin isn\'t as good and certain ""crimes"" like molesting women who don\'t veil themselves might not be considered, ""crimes"" there.\n\nFirst generation voluntary immigrants commit crimes at a lower rate than the native but second generations commit crimes at the same rate as natives. The ""environment"" factor can\'t make the first gen commit less crime since if that is the case, why would the second gen be worse? If anything, they ""learn"" the bad habits of the native born; and they are native born. The first gens have to ""prove"" themsevles, so they behave better. My explanation of high average socio-economical class and pressure of being first gen make more sense.\n https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258120829_An_Examination_of_First_and_Second_Generation_Immigrant_Offending_Trajectories', 'Good point.']"
aestheticen,dkkkv8,[O Level] EL tips!,2019-10-20 22:50:15,SGExams,77673,10,234,"(i have posted this on different comment threads, but i decided to make a post on it.)

a 2019 O Level candidate here too, so take my advice with a piece of salt. scored B4 for Prelims, one mark away from B3 tho haha

**EXPOSITORY** - i'm more of an expository guy so i'd give tips in this aspect. narrative and descriptive is not my strong suit so i won't give advice on that.

for argumentative, make sure your **stand is clear**. don't make the first paragraph sound so rigid, but don't make your point so ambiguous either. what you might want to do is talk about a certain scenario or situation pertaining to the topic at hand as an intro, and then bring in your point AND REMEMBER to mention your counterargument briefly in the intro too, so it has a more clear overview of what you are writing. you can also add your two points in the intro too, although i didn't do that in my example below (it's not that good tbh, but well) 

(i.e. with the rise of technology, a larger amount of the student population is turning to the internet to access information. technology has also became a medium for many people to indulge in entertainment, resulting in more diverse and accessible options for consumers today. however, the increasing appeal has also caused more rampant phone addiction among youths and adults alike, consequently becoming a forefront in many discussions today about whether technology does more harm than good. well, i believe strongly that although it has its detriments, technology is still more of a blessing than a curse, and that addiction and other problems accompanying the rise of technology can be carefully mitigated.)

be up to date about current affairs as they can prove to be good examples in argumentative writing, and read opinion pieces to give yourself a wider perspective to things and take note of how the columnists write them and search for words you are not familiar with, as some of this can be useful in the essay. 

refrain from using the same verb when presenting your views (""i [strongly] believe that..."", ""it can be perceived that..."", ""i think that..."") , and try to switch passive and active voice whenever you can. always address the issue from a third-person view. **DO NOT USE ""YOU""**, unless it is a speech. find synonyms for words that you think might be useful for expository (e.g. ""rampant"", ""prevalent"", ""pervasive"", ""commonplace"", ""ubiquitous"", ""not a rare sight"" all have the same meaning), and use literary devices such as metaphors (e.g. technology is more of a blessing than a curse) or emphasis (such actions are often deemed reprehensible, sordid and pretentious). lastly, always remember **PEEL** and **FEST** (facts, examples, statistics, testimonies)

**SITUATIONAL**

go and memorise all your formats. use appropriate tone while speaking to the other party, and just think that the other party is the dumbest person on earth so you have to explain EVERYTHING unless it's very very obvious. follow the bullet points and tick each one every time you are done with it. take note of key words in the bullet points and the question, especially for my school's prelims, see if the gender of the other party is exclusively stated. remember **RAFTS+P** (role, audience, format, tone, situation or context, purpose)

engage in small talk for the other party for informal letter writing, but don't drag it out. avoid asking so many questions and don't overuse exclamation marks. **make sure your purpose is CLEAR**. don't make up way too convenient scenarios to recommend your relative something (""I know that you love [...], thus you should check out the [...]""). it's not a big deal lah but this can distinguish yourself from others. if you really want to do it then actually elaborate and capitalise on that person's interest. remember when recommending an activity, price is something you can consider, but don't say that because an activity is free then the activity is good because if it is good there would be a price (according to my teacher). remember do not engage in any sort of condescending remarks. when the bullet point ask why you chose this activity over the other two, COMPARE. don't just bash the other activities, but say it from the activity you chose (""this activity seems more interesting than that"", not ""that activity sounds really boring""). in general, **remember to be specific**. if they ask, let's say, safety precautions - make sure you explain WHY it is important to do this and what exactly they need to do. as i said, treat it like the other party is so stupid they don't know about safety.

**VISUAL TEXT**

remember for ""intended effect"", the answer must involve the reader's feelings, and the outcome you want them to have after reading it. (e.g. ""the effect of the picture is for the readers to sympathise with the poor so that they would donate money to the charity organisation"").

**PAPER 2 COMPRE**

seriously hor, this one i also cannot. just need to read lor, and annotate the fuck out of it. you have a lot of time, so make sure you know what the question is asking and after you answer, play a little game of jeopardy and ask, are you actually answering the question? for the first one, the three examples one, make sure you answer how the evidence actually satisfies what the question is asking for. if the question says ""three pieces of evidence about the weather"", in your explanation explicitly say how it is about the weather. (e.g. ""....."" shows that the place was very cold) other than that idk what else i can give about this.

**SUMMARY**

if you have a lot of time left, please really do summary conscientiously. from the passage, pick out as many points as you can, can be more than 8 (kiasu la, hor). this is what i do lah. after you're done, list them out in words, and then paraphrase. however if you really really REALLY suck at paraphrasing, then don't. at least you get content marks - but paraphrasing increases your language mark. at least try a bit and don't literally copy and paste. don't paraphrase when there really isn't another word for it, and focus on paraphrasing the verbs. if really cannot, just switch passive and active voice or change the word form of the key word. the passage probably will have something about some shit being illegal so just remember words like ""criminalise"". you can also reverse the entire thing to fit into the summary (e.g. ""hunting of ivory is illegal in most countries"" to ""ivory poaching is not legal in most countries"" - that's the same number of words though). but key thing, remember DON'T CHANGE THE MEANING. so if you're really bad at paraphrasing, don't try and lump two or three points in one sentence to fit 80 words as if you change the meaning for one point, you might lose the mark for all 3.

**LC**

MAKE NOTES!!!!! especially the cursed speaker 1 to 6 one. grab the main detail and realise that if they somehow all start to talk about the same shit for all 6 speakers, choose the ones that they are different in. for the last passage, since it doesn't repeat, make sure you still listen while answering the question. multitask. it's hard, but at least remember to not fully zone out when you are writing the point. look out for key words too, and use the 1min 30s to actually check and see the key words again.

Edit:

I misinterpreted the article and CSM's post. The linked lyrics aren't going to be banned. You can watch [Shanmugan's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySWiheMpPRs) for the full picture on ""offensive speech"". He uses the lyrics as an example of ""offensive speech"", then elaborates on how they decide what ""offensive speech"" to ban.

Also, he didn't actually propose any changes to existing laws. His speech was mostly justifying/explaining the approach toward hate speech, explaining the Watain ban in the process.

-----

From the article ""[Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga lyrics listed as 'offensive' in Parliament handout](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ariana-grande-lady-gaga-lyrics-listed-offensive-parliament-handout-135538741.html)"":

> The minister also said that offensive speech can lead to ‚Äú**dehumanisation**‚Äù and create an environment ‚Äú**conducive to discrimination and eventually violence**‚Äù. Offensive speech, which can imply that its targets lack **morality, intelligence or dignity**, is ‚Äúeven more insidious‚Äù than hate speech, he added.

Lawrence Khong, FCBC Pastor, February 19 2014:

> The greatest fallacy of the LGBT argument is: I have no choice. I am born this way. Therefore, I can't help it. I've tried so hard to change. So give me my space. It is my right. Don't oppress me.""
>
> As a pastor of more than 36 years, I've heard this again and again from different people, even well-educated and successful people, on so many different destructive behaviours.
>
> This is exactly what drug addicts have told me. ""I have no choice. I can't help it. I've tried so hard to change. I've gone in and out of DRC. Everytime I come out, I am determined to change. But before I can get home after my release, I'm back on drugs. So I'm born this way. This is my fate, my lot. Give me my space. It is my right. Don't oppress me.""
>
> A husband said to me, ""I can't help it. When I am attracted to a woman, I have to pursue her until I can have her. I love my wife. But I can't help it. I am made this way.""
>
> **I hear the same from wife beaters, gamblers, kleptomaniacs, pedophiles, homosexuals, lesbians and so on**. Now, in putting them on a linear list like this, I risk being misunderstood as comparing the LGBTs, for example, with drug addicts, wife beaters and so forth. Hey, in no way am I saying that. Not at all.
>
> So, as a pastor, I make time to hear them out. I have seen them crying profusely in my office about their struggles. They are so genuine, so honest with their feelings, so sincere, and **yet SO WRONG**.
>
> I counsel them to act against their own passions. I confront them with their wrongs‚Äîbecause even if it is a case of compulsive disorder or pre-disposition as some would claim, they cannot use that as a final criteria for what is right and wrong, and justify themselves. In fact, being pre-disposed in a certain way does not mean that the person has to give in to those predispositions. So, I help them not to make excuses. I teach them to take personal responsibility and not to blame others. And above all, as a pastor, I help them to encounter God and His power.
>
> I've seen many change over the years. But there are also many who harden their hearts. Some get angry at me for calling **what they do as sin**. For example, pornography, drug abuse, molestation, **homosexuality**, adultery, etc. Sadly, just because I don't accept their excuses, they walk away saying that I don't understand. They think I despise them when **I insist that what they‚Äôre doing is wrong**. However, like a physician, the most cruel thing to do is to tell a patient that his cancer is ok. Everything is fine.
>
> This is the deception I see occurring around the world in regard to morality. If the gay who practises anal sex says ""I am born this way, so give me my rights,"" why can't the pedophile and all those who **practise incest, necrophilia and beastiality say the same thing**.
>
> What if one day we discover the existence of a violent gene. Do we then relax or abolish laws against murder? The difference between man and animal is this: as human beings, we don't have to yield to our primal instincts. We cannot just do whatever we feel like doing, however we please. We have the freedom of choice and the capacity to do what is best for humanity, for our nation and for civilisation.

In 2016, a Christian, Bryan Lim, threatened to [""open-fire"" on LGBTs](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/bryan-lim-charged-threatening-open-fire-lgbt-community-singapore):

> I am a Singaporean citizen. I am a NSman. I am a father. And I swore to protect my nation. Give me the permission to open fire. I would like to see these ¬£@‚Ç¨$^*s die for their causes...

Perhaps Minister Shanmugam has a point about ""offensive speech"". It can plausibly ""create an environment conducive to discrimination and eventually violence"".  

I wonder whether our laws will protect all targets or only select groups.

-----

Edit:  

Some would say we've been closer to Religion-inspired violence against LGBTs than we've been to Ariana-Grande-inspired violence against Christians. If ""offensive speech"" like Ariana's lyrics are deemed illegal, some would say it follows that anti-LGBT speech like Lawrence Khong's must also be illegal.

I am not a lawyer. What do you guys think, will there be a *legal* case against anti-LGBT speech like Lawrence Khong's if ""offensive speech"" is banned and performers with histories of ""offensive speech"" are banned?

-----

Edit: 

Update from Shanmugan's FB:

> My Parliamentary colleague Mr Chen Show Mao enclosed a list of songs. I gave the list in Parliament (see below).
> 
> People who did not listen to the speech may misunderstand that the list contains songs which have been banned (!) or are going to be banned (!)
> 
> All of that is untrue.
> 
> I made the point that people may find many things offensive. And gave the list as an illustration.
> 
> Doesn‚Äôt mean that it can all get banned, just because some people find it offensive. That is also a point I made in the speech.

At present, the evidence is somewhat inconclusive if sexuality is really something inborn. And so at best this is a neutral point. If the evidence comes out definitively showing that sexuality is a choice, then this argument is still neutral, since as we agree, the nature of a certain conduct is separate from whether it should be legal (i\'d make a correction to your point about morality here. Legality and morality are separate concepts, and so in the context of LGBT legal rights it\'s best to just keep to the legality). \n\nHOWEVER, if evidence shows that gay people are indeed born this way, I see this as an almost fatal argument that would seriously undermine the validity of 377A. \n\n*I note that you raise the difference in population size between LGBT and pedophiles.

I didn\'t post it myself because I felt I wouldn\'t be eloquent enough to get my thoughts across, but I think it doesn\'t reflect well on CNB when they adopt this us-versus-them rhetoric.\n\nIf antagonising some of the more forward-thinking (?) European countries like Portugal for their policies isn\'t propaganda I don\'t know what is. For some of the Facebook-scrolling boomers who comment under news articles it\'s probably something that will reinforce their already strong belief that our government can do no wrong.\n\nAnd to think of the kids in school who regularly get visited by CNB telling them what\'s right and what\'s wrong. Combined with watching ads like these on YouTube, I feel it will more or less change their worldview of these other countries. I mean, I personally probably won\'t do drugs ever, but at least allow them some space to apply their critical thinking skills and let them from their own opinion.\n\nI really hope they don\'t go so far as to mobilise their future Social Studies curricula, where the only correct opinion in SEQ is ""drugs bad, countries who legalise are backwards"".

Ganaria-Gente,b1pcem,I view Singapore with rose-tinted glasses. Tell me what am I missing?,2019-03-16 14:13:24,singapore,378759,152,192,"As someone living in Canada, I have been reading about Singapore with fascination for a long time, and for many years have admired Sing's authoritarian-democratic, free market/socialist model that you guys are enjoying.  Please tell me where i'm wrong:

- Urban transit: way better than Canada's shitty public transit system. Plus, singapore heavily taxes car ownership. Result? public transit is well funded & popular, while car ownership (which is very expensive & heavily polluting) is very low & only for the rich (who must pay heavy fees & taxes). This also means gas prices don't worry you, whereas we are obsessed about it. 

- Healthcare: again, way better than here. Canadians always compare themselves against the awful BS in American healthcare and think we have it good.  Wrong!

- Housing: This one's huge. As you may have heard, Vancouver & Toronto are in the Top 5 world's most expensive cities for housing. And yet, fools here are overstretching their mortgages irresponsibly.  Meanwhile, homelessness is awful & getting worse. Subsidized Housing has a long wait-list, and is filled with drug addicts, shifty people, or worse. In contrast, Sing has negligible homesslessness, and housing for the masses is well-subsidized.  And it's safe. And there's no ""housing envy"" when one house looks wealthier than your neighbor's. (also, here's a quote from the Economist: ""Singaporeans are granted an extra discount if they choose to buy property located in the same neighbourhood as their parents, nudging them to help with care that could otherwise fall to the state."".....that's genius!! holy shit!)

- Public Safety: street crime rates are rock bottom (something that Sing has in common with Jap and SK and TW). I get the impression you can really trust in the Singapore police.  Not so here, where the police & the public have an uneasy relationship. 

- Drug problems: Sing, again much like JP, SK, and TW, has no real endemic drug problem. In contrast, the foolish War on Drugs has been a massive & expensive failure for Americans, while Canadians are also addicted (albeit with homegrown drugs instead of Latin American stuff).

- Multiculturalism: this is another Big one.  Canada (and esp. our shitty Prime Minister) likes to brag about its multiculturalism & diversity, while ignoring it's failures.  Here's the problem: **self-segregation**. Like most other Western countries, Canadian multiculturalism is basically ethnic enclaves: Indians live & interact with Indians; Chinese with Chinese; white people with whites; Persians with persians. And entire families (except their kids) speak zero English. And you know what, that's because human beings prefer to be that way. Our brains are wired to behave like that.  But in singapore's case, the govt literally forces Indians, Chinese, Malay to live next to each other.  Which means everyone learned English, and you don't hear accusations about racism or Islamophobia or whatever.

- Balance between free speech & social harmony: now, this is a controversial one.  China/Russia/Iran has chosen to ban free speech & censor the internet. USA has free speech (well, mostly) but as a result allows a lot of bullshitters & assholes & shitty MSM. Sing has free internet, somewhat-free speech, and somewhat-free elections. Basically, if you are not a troublemaker, you will be fine 99% of the time. You know all the dumb shit happening in American MSM? I personally hate these professional liars. that's not a problem in Sing. 

- Economy: what can i say that hasn't been said? here, Canada relies on just finance, lumber, oil, tech, entertainment sectors.....and not much else.  Very unstable, unreliable and undependable.  Meanwhile, it doesn't matter how hard Xi Jinping shills the OBOR, cuz Sing will always always be super important.  It doesn't matter if it's oil, cars, cheap plastic toys, piss & poo....if there's ANY product (or parts of a product or factory) that need to be transported in a cost-effective way from Asia-Pacific to Europe/Africa/South Asia (or vice versa), you need to use Sing. That's impressive for a ""country"" that consists of just one metropolis.

- Corruption: Sing appears to be less corrupt than TW and SK and equally with JP. Canada meanwhile is currently embroiled in yet another govt scandal (again, thanks to our retarded PM). 

- Political partisanship: Doesn't really exist in Sing. But absolutely exists (and poisons) most other democracies, including Canada. 

Summary: Sing is the country that China wishes it were (and failing miserably in its efforts)",0.88,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/b1pcem/i_view_singapore_with_rosetinted_glasses_tell_me/,"[""I don't think it's fair to compare Canada and Singapore, the conditions are just too different. Things that you can execute well in a tiny city state may not necessarily work in a huge country.\n\nAll I can say as someone who has lived in Singapore my whole life and spent some time studying in Canada, Singapore ticks all the boxes and scores well in many standard of living metrics, but I can't help but feel a sense of being trapped. Singapore has always been and will continue to be a place where survival is dependent on people working very hard, and very few actually feel fulfilled and happy. Furthermore, the 5C (car, condominium, credit card, etc) mentality is still very deeply entrenched here and people partake in the rat race in droves to chase these things, and success is determined as such. If this is how you feel life should be lived, then welcome to Singapore!\n\nBut for me personally, there is an element of being at awe at vast nature and snowcapped mountains that you can never get in Singapore. "", 'grass is always greener on the other side innit. just like how you view sg as a utopia of sorts, lots of singaporeans want to migrate to canada ignoring all the problems you mentioned cuz it has stuff that sg lacks (less stress, nature, true freedom, etc).\n\nvice versa in your case?\n\n', 'Valid points. As to what you are missing, it‚Äôs probably Singapore being one of the most stressful place to live in. I have been to other countries and I really enjoy the slow pace of life. But efficiency is really slow there \nso there‚Äôs the trade off. Fun fact: we have the world‚Äôs fastest walking speed. I feel that one of the contributing factor to our success, amongst many, is that Singaporeans work really really hard. ', ""Our public transport model works because our country is just one small city which is extremely densely populated. I imagine it's hard to invest in good, cheap public transit systems in bigger sprawling areas where demand is much less."", 'Just to be clear before I begin, I agree with most of your points and I think this is a good place to live. I believe lots of people have covered what makes SG work (that cannot be applied to Canada) so I will cover other issues.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nUrban Transit: I agree that it is a good system, and in a way, we have it easy as a small nation. That said, people still work their ass off for a car as some status symbol and envy people who have cars and think they must have one. I dont get it, but there you have it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHealthcare: I personally don\'t have much issue with this. But I do hear of many cases where having a special needs child or chronic disorders put a huge financial strain on you, because we are far from a welfare state.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHousing:\n\nfunny that you talk about envy. I might be a cynic but I think envy is in the nature of most people. I grew up hearing people talking behinds others\' backs, saying things like ""she isnt a true tai-tai (upper-class housewife), her condo is only in Bishan! (suburban neighbourhood, not CBD)"". Most people live in HDB but envy of private residence is real. It doesnt matter if it\'s only 20% of the population who can afford it, why cant you afford it? Whats wrong with you? /s\n\nAlso, due to the land scarcity, most youths live with their parents until they marry (if they marr y). This is curious to me, bc in many other nations, youths will choose to move out and rent, even if they cant afford to buy. It\'s a cultural thing, and mostly that\'s ok, but there\'s cases of shitty parents manipulating their kids to stay, and tbf, even renting is outside the budget of some young people.\n\nAlso, if you arent straight, you cant get public housing until 35, bc we dont recognize any form of gay marriage. So good luck living with your parents and staying closeted until you are 35, unless you kick up a massive fight with your parents (hard for us nonconfrontational asians), move out, and spend almost half your paycheck on rent. And no guarantees that your parents cant find you, this is an island.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPublic safety, free speech, and social harmony:\n\nI\'ll address these together. Yes, sg is very safe. That said, i think your argument of ""as long as you behave yourself, you wont get in trouble"" is pretty amusing, bc it applies to almost every country. The only difference is what exactly it means to ""behave yourself"". I myself am, in the local context, well behaved. But it is easy to see how people are unsettled by extensive state surveillance, and broadly worded laws where almost anything they say can be illegal if the gov feels like it.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nMulticulturalism:\n\nlmao. we just tolerate each other. It\'s good that we dont have epidemic racial violence, but dont mistake that for harmony. Tons and tons of racist stuff people say all day, especially behind closed doors.\n\nAnd if you think people dont self-segregate here - ooh boy of course we do. You think some gov policy for public housing means we genuinely mix? Most people dont know their neighbours, at most they do superficially. In their peer groups, and even in places like where they eat, they definitely self-segregate.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nEconomy:\n\nYes it is relatively great, I\'ll admit this is one of the most prosperous nations. But wages are stagnating and the economy isnt growing anywhere like it used to. As in many other nations, the youth have a ton of anxiety over an uncertain and often bleak-looking future, which looks like a ton of hard work but nowhere the level of riches they were promised.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI grew up with a mother who had nothing but a highschool education- she went into the workforce for a few years (90s, IT) and in that time, she earned what is 4k a month today. She told me, when I was looking for a summer job after highschool, not to take a job paying less than 12 bucks an hour, bc i did graduate highschool. I now attend a good university here, where it is common for people to graduate with honors- and make less than 12 dollars an hour. Every day, the rich get richer, and the poor get poorer. Look up the GINI coefficient of singapore for an idea of our income inequality.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhat i\'ve said so far is very negative, and may thus give the wrong impression. Don\'t get me wrong, I agree with most of what you said. I even like the weather.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIf I were born a nicely straight cis Singaporean model citizen, thus able to get along great with my family and relatives, saving up money living with my parents as most ppl do, sidestepping any future economic problems by simply taking over the family business, and then marrying a Singapore of the opposite gender (but the same race of course), getting my sweet affordable public housing for straight couples, popping out one kid-- I would be living the dream and I would never even think of leaving this place. And yknow what, that route does work for most people, just not some of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;', 'I‚Äôd say that most of the points you brought up all very valid. However, happiness brings the whole of Singapore down. How many students are stressed about grades? How many young men are sulking while burning away 2 years in army? How many working adults are struggling with CPF etc?\n\nSingapore is a safe place to stay in. But is it a happy one? It might not be. For sure, we are not this utopia of racial harmony nor the barbaric police state other countries view us as. However, the fear of being left behind and swallowed by our neighbours is always a major concern - something Canada doesn‚Äôt have to contend with.

You don't get much space living here. Very few people have a backyard. It is crowded living places. Not as bad as HK though. \nHome ownership is very high here at 90% which is impressive, however you do have a lot of families living with their parents to keep costs down.

A couple weeks every couple years is enough for me.\n\n\n"", '[deleted]', '[deleted]', 'Canada is one of the countries my foreign colleagues head off to after gaining a foothold here in singapore. America is another.', 'All this stuff only exists while we have good/decent leadership. It can go as quickly as it came. There\'s no backup plan for Singapore, many of us are on this train with no way to get off. As the ruling party keeps telling us, ""bad leadership"" will fuck us up. It\'s technically true, but whether the opposition is actually bad is a matter for debate.', '[deleted]', '[Namaste, brother](https://i.redd.it/4hjxflayt2l21.jpg). I\'ll go over each of your points to explain what exactly about Singapore that makes it work.\n\n**Urban transit**: Singapore is a city-state, so we have incredible amount of control over how many cars can enter the city. Other city centers don\'t have the benefit of this. Public transport is very good, but it still isn\'t replace-your-car good. Lowering the already low car ownership is a major goal for the country.\n\n**Healthcare**: Singapore\'s secret is that majority of healthcare spending is *private,* not government. Every Singaporean is forced to save for healthcare (known as Medisave) along with our version of social security (known as CPF). Government uses heavy regulation to keep private spending from spiraling out of control.\n\n**Housing**: the fact that majority lives in public housing gives the government incredible control over the property market, the authorities are able to stamp out speculation almost completely. Singapore also helps people finance public housing purchases. The largest public housing creditor in the world, in fact. Second in place is USA. Houses are for people, not for landlords and ""investors"".\n\n**Public safety**: Singapore did have problems with trust in the police in the past. The thing that fixed it? Community policing. Work with the community, not against it.\n\n**Drug problems**: We have the death penalty. We also have sprawling rehabilitation programs, and for males, mandatory conscription into the army also doubles as rehab for those who are hooked. Anyway, regarding the death penalty, I think death is too extreme and I would recommend other countries to find more humane ways to serve justice. In Singapore, Singaporeans trust our justice system and the sentences are generally considered warranted and fair - even when it\'s death. While the law is very strict, the *standard of proof* is very high. I think there has been only one conviction in history that has been in dispute by people in the legal field for not meeting the standard of proof (""beyond reasonable doubt"") in our penal code.\n\n**Multiculturalism**: Once again, the key is public housing. Social enclaves were simply not allowed to take root. Public housing has an ethnic quota to prevent too much of any one race from concentrating in an area. Make no mistake - it absolutely is forced integration, but it worked out, and this is the kind of pragmatic policy-making that Singapore is now known for.\n\n**Balance between free speech & social harmony**:  Singapore has state surveillance and some internet censorship. Mainstream media is limited to reporting rather than delving into punditry. Journalists are put on the hook if they are deemed to promote divisions in society. Sedition laws are broad and vague on purpose, so the net can be cast wide. This results in many journalists engaging in self-censorship. To put it simply, professional liars won\'t get away with it like they do in other countries. But that also means our press isn\'t ""free"", as defined by the west.\n\n**Economy**: Singapore relies on trade more than perhaps any other country. Trading is perhaps the single most important thing. We are uniquely vulnerable to disruptions in trade. Singapore will cease to exist without trade.\n\n**Corruption**: There is some truth to attracting talent into politics by paying them a lot of money, making such people less susceptible to bribery. Nepotism remains a problem.\n\n**Political partisanship**:  Lee Kuan Yew once said that Singapore is ideology-free. It\'s true. A lot of people look at Singapore as a free-market success despite the heavy government intervention. And a lot of people look at the heavy government intervention success despite the free market. The truth is, Singapore is a mix of both, and the two were never mutually exclusive. Policy is discussed on their merits, rather than if or not they are ""capitalist"" or ""socialist"" or ""authoritarian"" or whatever. Singapore just does what it needs to get by, labels be damned. The only positions people take today are pro-govt and anti-govt, and even opposition parties tend to not disagree with much of what is in place.\n\nCall us socialist, call us capitalist, call Singapore a repressive authoritarian state, no one cares.', 'If you‚Äôre middle class it‚Äôs an extremely comfortable and sheltered place. Folks here are really sheltered like pet animals. It can be a good thing.

But the vast majority of complaints I hear from Singaporeans are the kind of complaints that you'd have if you've never lived outside of SG\n\nTaking the MRT as easy example - locals complain constantly about some one small breakdown here and there that delayed them 15 minutes - all while failing to recognise that they have one of the best public transport systems in the world, easily within the top 5. It's not something you'd recognise if you grew up with it and it was the only thing you ever used, but spend even a week in say most US cities where without a car you're shit out of luck because the closet grocery store is an hour walk away and you'll be waiting for half an hour for a dirty bus after which you'll feel like vomiting.\n\nSame for SingPost, yeah they're not perfect, but at the same time 99.99% of things get delivered reliably while if you're living in the Eastern Bloc you just expect that the people sorting the mail will open up every envelope just to check if there's anything valuable there they can take.\n\nEssentially many Singaporeans don't understand just how incredibly good they have it - where even with all the complaints, it's still hands down one of the best places in the world to live."", ""I generally agree, and the only thing that you might not consider is the cultural issue some Sg redditors speak of. \n\nPersonally, i think this idea of Singapore being materialistic and high-stress, etc, is largely a personal issue, and most of my social circle don't seem to be that kind of people, but its true that the feedback i get is that those from the West are more relaxed about such things. The good thing is that for me, I have none of the cultural materialistic/high-stress problem, with all of the good stuff that you mention!"", ""the lack of segregation in sg public housing doesn't foster inter racial ties, it just prevents any minority group from forming a viable voting bloc\n\n&#x200B;\n\n...and there are plenty examples of ethnic segregation in sg if you want them"", 'I think society is really stratified btw haves and have nots.

There‚Äôs so much I‚Äôm proud of but the point of this reply is to talk about what we lack. Many of the replies have highlighted some common things, but here are some less mentioned points\n\nI went on a 5month exchange in Finland last year and travelled most of the time. I think one thing I truly missed was the solidarity. Like everyone says Singapore is extremely densely populated, it‚Äôs really quite difficult to find a space without anyone, unless you‚Äôre really in a small corner. While nobody really cares, there will always be people walking by. Sometimes when I‚Äôm sad I feel like going out alone and find a vast piece of land/sea like I used to see in Europe, and just sit there quietly enjoying the peace. Can‚Äôt do that in Singapore. Or at least I still don‚Äôt know where to go. \n\nNowadays I tend to feel lonely as well, because everyone is just so busy working hard, no one has time for you. Living in Singapore is usually fine, but if you ever start feeling lonely or trapped or anything, it‚Äôs quite hard to get out. The negative feelings are here to stay. \n\nOne huge thing I‚Äôm really upset about, would be Singapore‚Äôs recycling efforts. It‚Äôs as if we are worse than a third world country. And nothing is being done, I try my best to recycle like I did in Finland, but it‚Äôs quite impossible even if you had the heart to even go out of your way to do it, because the Cleaners either trash your sorted recyclables or horrible people contaminate your stuff. There just isn‚Äôt enough infrastructure to support the recycling culture. ', ""Free Speech - Look I understand where you come from; The problem with free speech is that people who you disagree with, or even malicious people who lie are allowed to speak, and there is an extremely high bar to prevent them from having a platform. Privately of course, Twitter, Facebook, Patreon can ban people from using their platform, but the government can't interfere in this decision.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nBut, the converse is true. Imagine if you're the one the government disagrees with. There are many potential issues that there can be room for discussion but such discussions are not given a proper airing: examples include the crony capitalist tendencies of Singapore and the elites in the room; Banning of activities if it risks offending recognized religious groups; high pay of government officials tagged to private sector pay without the accompanying risk of private sector failure.\n\nSure you can discuss it with friends but it won't be a prevalent discourse - and we are such a small city, where every act impacts each of us.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe most recent case is where a blogger is now being sued by the Prime Minister for retweeting (or sharing a FB post) that was from an article that impugn the integrity of the PM with regards to dealings with Malaysia.

If you try to bring up anything about feminism or equality, you get drowned out by cries of ""WHAT ABOUT NS!!"" and ""SJW!!"" Look. Social justice issues are actually incredibly important, because they bring marginalized people and give them a platform to speak.

Because the company doesn\'t have an office in Singapore, it\'s impossible to get any kind of spousal visa. \n\n**Conservatism/Asian Values bullshit**\nHoly fuck, Singaporeans can\'t even own up to their ""asian values"" bullshit.

Don\'t even get started on trans* or LGBTQA rights. \n\nFuck, we can\'t even get women\'s rights enshrined along with a whole list of stereotypes that come with it --- martial rape has never been successfully abolished, male rape victims never considered, our *NATIONAL PLEDGE* has /race, language or religion/ enshrined but nothing about gender or sexuality rights -- think of every toxic gender stereotype and its taken for granted in Singapore as ""truth"". \n\n**Economy**\nour economy is only doing great if other countries do well. have you seen the pictures of keppel harbour during the US-China trade war? Lots of ships, nothing moving, no containers. Also we have zero accountability with our federal reserves. No one has any idea how much money Singapore actually has, only that it is *a lot*. Who knows if it\'s real money or not? The only time we have any idea is if a scandal breaks out, or if they make a shit investment (like investing Series D with Uber... good fucking luck with that) and so there\'s no accountability at all. \n\n**Summary**: Singapore is a wonderland if you are a straight, cisgender, male, Asian or Causasian descent, neurotypical or high-functioning enough to pass as one; with a middle or upper middle class background that enjoys a competitive and ambitious career and good schools for your kids.

There are pros and cons to this so it's not all rosy like what some people think, but it's not nearly as bad as what most Singaporeans would say. I'd say the benefits do far outweigh the drawbacks of a tightly-controlled nation. Somewhat-free speech is an understatement though, when it comes to politics (and is pretty well-known actually, despite the Singapore government's attempts to dismiss international rankings and other claims as being inaccurate). IIRC human right violations in Singapore was mentioned in an American article posted here just a day or two ago, and while the writer did definitely exaggerate and spew a lot of bullshit, it is a fact that many of the laws here do go against the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Singapore has outright objected to some of its articles.

Plus, singapore heavily taxes car ownership. Result? public transit is well funded & popular, while car ownership (which is very expensive & heavily polluting) is very low & only for the rich (who must pay heavy fees & taxes). This also means gas prices don\'t worry you, whereas we are obsessed about it.\n\nIt\'s not really true that most Singaporeans don\'t own cars. Some [40 percent](https://www.straitstimes.com/lifestyle/motoring/tens-of-thousands-of-households-will-have-to-give-up-car-as-zero-growth-policy) of Singapore households have at least one car in spite of the extremely high cost of owning one. Even a [significant percentage](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/cnainsider/low-income-and-owning-a-car-why-9449930) of households in the bottom 20 percentile has cars. This is because traveling on Singapore\'s public transport system, which is of course better than most countries\', is still significantly slower and less convenient than on a car. Many \'Reddiporeans\' here do not have kids and have not had the hellish experience of traveling with kids on the MRT and the buses because they are usually crowded with no sitting space. Once a family has kids, the case for owning a car becomes a lot more compelling and many parents scrimp and save to afford one. \n\n>Housing: This one\'s huge. As you may have heard, Vancouver & Toronto are in the Top 5 world\'s most expensive cities for housing. And yet, fools here are overstretching their mortgages irresponsibly. Meanwhile, homelessness is awful & getting worse. Subsidized Housing has a long wait-list, and is filled with drug addicts, shifty people, or worse. In contrast, Sing has negligible homesslessness, and housing for the masses is well-subsidized. And it\'s safe. And there\'s no ""housing envy"" when one house looks wealthier than your neighbor\'s. (also, here\'s a quote from the Economist: ""Singaporeans are granted an extra discount if they choose to buy property located in the same neighbourhood as their parents, nudging them to help with care that could otherwise fall to the state."".....that\'s genius!! holy shit!)\n\nSubsidized housing in Singapore also has a long waiting time of 3 to 5 years on average. Most young Singaporeans live with their parents until they get married because there is no affordable rental market here. In fact, many continue to live with their parents even after they get married because of the long wait for a subsidized flat. More insultingly, Singaporeans are also told by the government that they [""don\'t need much space for sex""](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/571cnz/you_dont_need_much_space_to_have_sex_josephine_teo/). \n\n>Multiculturalism: this is another Big one. Canada (and esp. our shitty Prime Minister) likes to brag about its multiculturalism & diversity, while ignoring it\'s failures. Here\'s the problem: **self-segregation**. Like most other Western countries, Canadian multiculturalism is basically ethnic enclaves: Indians live & interact with Indians; Chinese with Chinese; white people with whites; Persians with persians. And entire families (except their kids) speak zero English. And you know what, that\'s because human beings prefer to be that way. Our brains are wired to behave like that. But in singapore\'s case, the govt literally forces Indians, Chinese, Malay to live next to each other. Which means everyone learned English, and you don\'t hear accusations about racism or Islamophobia or whatever.\n\nThis is not multiculturalism. This is forced assimilation. Not every Singaporean is fine with it, especially the minorities. The weird thing is that most Singaporeans when they migrate overseas prefer to live in those so-called ethnic enclaves. This dispersion of the ethnic minorities also dilutes their sense of community, which can help with care and mutual assistance. For instance, if you are a working Malay parent with children to look after, would you prefer another Malay or a Chinese caregiver to look after your parents? When your retired parents are lonely at home and prefer to speak their own ethnic language, would you prefer them to hang around the Chinese retirees yakking away in Chinese?\n\n&#x200B;', 'Shallow thought\n\nWas it easy to develop SG so fast from 3rd world to 1st world considering the country was at zero.\n\nSimilar to how you restart a game instead of trying to salvage it mid-game due to poor planning from the start.', ""I agree, I think most people don't see the quality of life Singaporeans have when they make this type of comparison.

Many other responses in this thread are also very good. /r/Singapore flying the flag high today. Where the shitposters at? \n\nHowever, I can't resist raising a few other points I think people in this thread haven't covered:\n\nUrban transit: Singapore is a city-state, making its car laws reasonable in its context. In a large nation where cars are necessary in rural areas, similarly strict restrictions on cars within city areas, let alone restrictions on car ownership, will be far harder to achieve.\n\nBalance between free speech and social harmony: All well and good until it hits you. Scroll through the subreddit for posts pertaining to the Swedish band Watain over the past week.\n\nEconomy: (I'm sorry I promised not to reiterate what others have already mentioned, but I'm doing it now) Singapore's 'super important-ness' is not an absolute fact, contrary to OP's claims. The economy in Singapore is entirely dependent on the global competitiveness of its people and processes. The country has no natural resources, and its location advantage is easily matched by Malaysian and Indonesian ports (Tanjong Pelapas and Pasir Gudang are literally less than an hour away by car, and Jakarta is not too far either - distance might be negligible in boat terms), as well as the potential Thai plan for a canal across the Isthmus of Kra, bypassing Malaysia and Singapore. If OBOR is successful in efficiently linking India, Pakistan, and China by road or rail, this will also be a big threat to Singapore's location advantage. On the other hand, Canada will always be able to sell oil and has space to develop agriculture further if it becomes necessary. PAP will kill for those options.\n\nCorruption: IIRC the latest Justin Trudeau scandal centres on alleged pressure on the Attorney General not to prosecute a prominent Canadian firm for wrongdoing as it will threaten jobs in Canada. Canadians feel strongly enough about this potential conflict of interest and illicit dealings to publicly pressure the PM and have senior government officials resign. In Singapore, the AG is more removed from the PM because the AG is not a cabinet minister. However, the current AG was the PM's former personal lawyer, a conflict of interest that is potentially greater. Questions have been asked about whether the AG has been making politically motivated moves, but LHL is far from facing the same level of pressure that Trudeau is facing. The difference in treatment of the AG-PM relationship boils down to cultural differences in politics. Which is better? I leave you to draw your own conclusions.\n\nPolitical partisanship: I agree with OP - political debate in SG has remained very mature, and no political party in SG can hope to stand a chance at the polls without appearing as competent, well-reasoned policy-thinkers (see: Singfirst). However, many see the lack of at least a 2-party 'pendulum democracy', and its associated partisan fights, as a problem for Singapore.\n\nSummary: Singapore and China are very similar in governance style. They're both technocracies where quality of thinking is prized. They are also dominated by one party, where the lines between party and government are not always clear. I don't know if China continues to see Singapore as its model for development, and there are still many differences between Singapore and China, size being the biggest (no pun intended) one. I also wouldn't be too quick to say China is failing. China's rise is probably the single biggest factor for the progress made in alleviating poverty worldwide. However, I would hesitate to say that they are succeeding either, since there are many potential problems that if not handled well, could throw them back into the Chinese version of the dark ages.\n\n\nI have pointed out many problems about Singapore, but overall I still rather it as a place to live because I feel comfortable in SG. This may just be me being sick of toughing it out overseas though (and in a country definitely worse than Canada - America).

FurballTheHammy,cnuetg,[A Levels] Am I normal?,2019-08-09 08:11:51,SGExams,77673,46,99,"Okay... honestly. Looking at how my secondary school classmates posted on social media and stuffs. I‚Äôve come to realise that I‚Äôm kind of anti-social. I only have a small circle of 6 friends in a clique. Pretty much anyone else in my class or tutorial class who tries to converse with me easily gets shut down by me unknowingly. Because, I‚Äôm just not really into social interactions, I‚Äôm just happy with my current social state. 

Personally, if I had a choice between games or social media. I would have to pick games. I‚Äôm a person who views improvement and growth, a lot higher up than social interactions. However, social interactions and friendships are still paramount to my development but I don‚Äôt need that much of them. But games always gives me this satisfaction, especially rhythm games, as I play Cytus. Because when one looks back at how they started a month or two ago and compare to themselves currently, the huge progress and road one has travelled really leaves one happy and satisfied in their heart. At least, that‚Äôs for me. 

For example, if I went out with my clique once this week after school to study/eat and they called me out again, during the same week. I would tend to decline and go home from school immediately to finish up my homework and spend the leftover 1-3 hours playing.

I‚Äôm not addicted just to make it clear, because I have my priorities and I do my homework and revise although I do procrastinate occasionally only on the weekends. And if anything my grades aren‚Äôt disappointing when compared to the cohort, hovering at the 60-70 percentile which I think is okay for someone who spends on average 2 hours playing daily. 

Now, I‚Äôm not sure whether I‚Äôm normal and it just feels worrying and weird. Sometimes when I look at my secondary school friend‚Äôs social media posts, I look at myself and think of how shit I am... It undermines my identity as a human, imagine everyone around you liking something but you don‚Äôt like that something, it really starts to bite at my identity as a human.

Edit: Non gamers alike can also give your opinions as well, especially those who are parents, I like to know what is your take on this declaration, and if it changes in anyway you see gaming in general?",0.66,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/btmmjf/singaporean_gamers_i_would_like_an_opinion_on/,"[""My take is then, I used to suffer from such a disease. Whether I'd change at that point in time if I received therapy, maybe. My family and I used to ignore the fact I indeed faced an addiction problem.\n\nOn the gaming industry?

Don't have the statistics to back me up, but using popular MMORPG as a gauge, most people have a real life job/school."", 'Is the WHO gonna do anything about Working Disorder? People who work too much or managers who expect people to work too much?', ""I think it's better to target the games first rather than gamers. Ban the psychologically manipulative business practices of f2p mobile games. For a game that has addictive gameplay purely because it's well designed, it is not the game's fault but the addict's own lack of impulse control. Other than intervention from friends, family, neighbors and school, not much else can be done without being excessively intrusive into private lives."", 'You know what else is a disorder? Overstress from working long hours and little breaks in between\n\nLook at how little companies cares about those doe', 'It wouldn‚Äôt really affect professional gamers who are the ones most probably sacrificing sleep or proper eating habits for gaming sessions because they earn a lot through prize winnings, streaming, brand deals, etc. On the other hand, it may affect individuals who are trying to study (or have parents that force them to) and yet are horribly addicted to games, but that‚Äôs only if they seek help for it and have to declare it to their employers. If they are really that addicted, they wouldn‚Äôt be able to stay employed long-term anyway so the classification of it as a disorder doesn‚Äôt do much harm. There also shouldn‚Äôt be much impact to the gaming industry because majority of the profit comes from people who have work/school and can spare the money to spend in-game.', 'Other than being more conscious about the amount of time spent on gaming, there is really not much changes to what I‚Äôm currently doing. \n\nI think one way of seeing gaming addiction would just to see it as any other addiction. Too much of anything is a bad thing. It is as real as say drugs, smoking and gambling as addictions and considering the world‚Äôs movement into more immersive gaming such as VRs and ARs, this declaration of gaming as an addictive behaviour is one that is much needed. Furthermore, gaming is a normalised behaviour in our times (No one is gonna fault you for gaming, nor mention one‚Äôs behaviour to be out of the ordinary), especially since gaming has so many perceived benefits when engaging in it (Friends, better reflexes, networking, socialising, destressing). As such, I believe it is a good call for WHO to declare this as of now. \n\nAlthough, I think that games themselves have little to no fault in drawing in players. The onus falls upon players themselves to practice controlled gaming. While these may mean certain consequences for gaming companies, these may be negligent to none at all. \n\nHowever, just some food for thought, there is a very difficult line to draw on what is considered gaming addiction and what is not. I think this is one of the special points to consider when we are analysing this particular addiction. What makes it special is in 2 points: \n1) Professional gamers. As someone who spends most of their days gaming and training, their behaviour definitely fits the criteria, but do we consider them addicts? \n2) How are we going to tackle this in therapy? Gaming (Especially online gaming) is an aspect in many people‚Äôs lives that it is almost impossible to practice abstinence (Versus smoking? Drugs?). What is this the aim? Controlled gaming? Abstinence? Steps to achieve that.\n\nIn all, it‚Äôs smth to think about and perhaps as what one other Redditor said, work addiction among Singaporean IS a real problem especially due to the work life balance. And while gaming addiction has its place in our society, there are many other addictions such as work and social media addiction that can be equally as damaging and have been under the radar for too long. Not to underplay it, but the impact on Singapore I believe may be much smaller than that of the other addictions.', ""As a gamer (though not hardcore), I don't see nor care about the declaration as it has no impact on me or the society (I think)."", 'I believe that in the midst of defending gaming, it is important to remember that addiction is indeed a disorder that requires attention, and this is not exclusive to gaming. \n\n\nThe challenge is in identifying this disorder, something many within the older generation struggle to do. It can be difficult to differentiate between ‚Äúgaming is my life‚Äù and ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt live without gaming‚Äù.', ""I wouldn't say I'm a 'gamer', but I do play PUBG and Apex Legends sometimes because school and homework eats too much time and I'm barely left with time for one match.\n\nRegardless, I think that WHO's recent declaration would hurt eSports development, especially in Singapore. Gamers may feel guilty for playing and may reduce their playing session. They may even choose not to join an eSports clan/group even if they have the skills for it.\n\nThey should be targetting the players themselves, not the games."", 'Probably a lot of grey area la.

After all players are the key resource in any pro team and you want to keep your players healthy. This is also why you see a lot of teams playing actual sports etc. \n\nSome games are also purposely designed to be addictive. The best example is probably loot boxes, that is for all purposes, gambling.', 'But do you stop to eat and go toilet?', ""*Stares at TF2 hats, CSGO skins, Overwatch skins, etc...*\n\nLet's not kid ourselves.

You can play PUBG without getting skins. You can play CS with the vanilla AK and still perform the same as with an AK Bloodsport.\n\nMost mobile games require so much grinding, it's almost as if it's work rather than entertainment. Coincidentally, they are free. I'd rather pay up front for the game and have quality gameplay rather than getting a game for free and hit a wall soon.""]"

No consultation is needed, and the plastic bottles do not come with labels.\n\nAnd the ""doctors""? Middle-aged men who you can be certain have no medical training, yet are more than ready to sell bottles of cough syrup to anyone willing to pay.\n\nThe bottles are hidden inside mailboxes and motorcycle top cases just a few metres away, and are retrieved once a sale is made.\n\nThe cough mixture is believed to contain codeine, an opiate abused by addicts for a high.\n\nThis black market, which extends also to Lorongs 9 and 11, has persisted despite raids by the authorities over the years.\n\nDemand drives the supply of codeine cough preparations, according to the Health Sciences Authority, which works with various other agencies to monitor and carry out enforcement operations.\n\nMore than 460 litres of codeine cough mixtures with an estimated street value of $130,000 were seized from 2016 to last year, with 17 people prosecuted for illegal selling.\n\nWhen The Sunday Times visited one of the illegal dispensaries last Wednesday night, some customers - mostly men in their 20s to 40s - were seen approaching a man sitting at the coffee shop.\n\nThe man, who looked to be in his 40s, would glance around warily, walk to the back, grab a few bottles of the brown liquid and exchange them for cash.\n\nThere were at least 10 buyers over the course of an hour or so, with several people purchasing a few bottles at one go. Some later gulped down the contents in quick succession in back alleys before tossing the used containers into drains.\n\nThe transactions - lasting no more than 30 seconds each - usually took place with at least two other people acting as lookouts, strategically positioned inside the coffee shop and along the road.\n\nThe men, dressed casually in T-shirts and bermudas, alert the sellers if there is a whiff of law enforcement in the vicinity.\n\nOne peddler claims his cough mixture is ""homemade"".\n\n""This is good. We also take it,"" he adds, while counting a wad of $10 notes before putting them in his shorts pocket.\n\nDespite their discreet operations, it is easy to find the peddlers - just follow the trail of used bottles. The Sunday Times has seen about 30 empty ones scattered along pavements and drains in the area.\n\nAbusers buy the mixture from the black market when they are not able to get enough from doctors, who cannot prescribe more than 240ml of cough mixture containing codeine to a patient at any one time.\n\nBut these illegal fixes do not come cheap.\n\nEach 90ml bottle costs between $20 and $30 on the black market. A similar bottle at a clinic would cost between $7 and $13.\n\nAbusers have no choice but to turn elsewhere, given the strict laws on clinics dispensing codeine cough mixtures, said one user.\n\nThe bespectacled middle-aged man, who takes three bottles - or about 270ml - of cough syrup every other day, said in Mandarin: ""Most doctors give only one or two bottles, so I have to hop from one clinic to another to get more. There\'s also the long waiting time.\n\n""Here, it is much easier to get a few bottles at one go.""\n\nHe said he would ""feel sick"" if he did not get his fix. The ""high"", he said, lasts for about three hours.\n\nBut addicts buy at their own peril, as black-market cough mixtures are produced with little or no quality control.\n\nAnyone caught illegally importing or selling cough preparations containing codeine can be fined up to $50,000, or jailed for up to two years, or both.', 'And here I am constantly asking for the ‚Äúnon drowsy‚Äù version.

By 20, Clare was an alcoholic and on the way to drinking herself to death.\n\n> ‚ÄúRight from the beginning, I knew I drank differently from other people. It wasn‚Äôt your regular social drinking. I was chasing an effect, but the more I drank, the more that effect eluded me. It was a mental obsession and I could not stop it,‚Äù said the wellness coach, now 35, who requested that her full name not be used.\n\n> At 25, she suffered a major heat stroke related to excessive drinking. A few years later, she hit rock bottom.\n\n> ‚ÄúYour body tells you when it is breaking down,‚Äù said Clare.\n\n> ‚ÄúI knew I was at the bottom ‚Äì the dehydration was severe, the numbness, the shakes and the anxiety that came if I wasn‚Äôt drinking constantly. The way I was going, I was going to end my life anyway so I decided to give Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Singapore a shot.‚Äù\n\n> What Clare had thought was a long shot saved her life. Through AA‚Äôs 12-step recovery programme, as well as support from her husband and AA members, Clare eventually ended her longstanding drinking addiction, and turned her life and her husband‚Äôs sanity around.\n\n> ‚ÄúI told myself to give it a week, then it became a month, a year‚Ä¶ Eventually, I didn‚Äôt want to kill myself anymore. I started showing up for life,‚Äù she said.\n\n> April is Alcohol Awareness Month. By sharing her experience, Clare hopes to raise awareness on alcohol abuse among women, which is a growing problem in Singapore.\n\n> Alcohol abuse is the second-most common mental disorder in Singapore among the other conditions assessed, and it is on the rise, according to the Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2010 and 2016.\n\n> ME TOO: MORE WOMEN DRINKING HEAVILY AND DANGEROUSLY\n\n> Among Singapore women, the lifetime prevalence of alcohol abuse increased from 1.2 per cent of the population in 2010 to 1.7 per cent in 2016, according to the studies.\n\n> The uptrend has also been documented in earlier studies.\n\n> According to a local study on alcohol consumption trends between 1992 and 2004, an increase in frequent drinking was found to be most pronounced among Singapore women aged 18 to 29. The study was published in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism in 2007.\n\n> At the Institute of Mental Health‚Äôs National Addictions Management Service (Nams), the number of new patients with alcohol use disorders has\xa0gone up.\n\n> Women make up 15 per cent of new patients with alcohol use disorders, said Dr Guo Song, a senior consultant at Nams.\n\n> Nams‚Äô youngest female patient was only 13 years old when she sought treatment ‚Äì a sobering reminder that alcohol use disorders can hit underaged drinkers.\n\n> ‚ÄúThe patients we see at Nams for alcohol use disorders, whether men or women, usually have a chronic history of heavy alcohol consumption. Often, they are unable to control their alcohol use despite having encountered negative consequences,‚Äù said Dr Guo.\n\n> \n\n> WOMEN ALCOHOLICS LESS LIKELY TO SEEK HELP\n\n> A representative of AA Singapore, which has women-only sessions, estimated that about 30 per cent of alcoholics seeking help are women. However, he said the figure is likely an underestimate as women are less likely to come forward to seek help for their drinking problems.\n\n> ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think fewer women have the problem than men. In Singapore, there are lots of cultural reasons why people don‚Äôt turn up for (AA) meetings. It can be particularly hard for women ‚Äì they may be judged more harshly by society for their drinking problem,‚Äù said AA Singapore‚Äôs representative.\n\n> Their spouses may be victims of their addiction, but may also be less willing to come forward to seek help.\n\n> ‚ÄúI know several men who have been subjected to abuse by their spouses who have been drinking. You can‚Äôt tell anyone, so what do you do?‚Äù said AA Singapore‚Äôs representative.\n\n> While Ms Eleanor Ong, a psychotherapist at The Relational Counselling Studio, sees more male alcoholics, this could be because women are more likely to seek out support elsewhere ‚Äì through friends or informal support groups, for example ‚Äì rather than go down the healthcare route, she said.\n\n> Many alcohol abusers also tend to be ‚Äúhigh-functioning‚Äù, which makes it easier for them to hide or deny having a drinking problem in the early years. Despite her heavy drinking, Clare said she was somehow able to continue with her job and everyday life.\n\n> ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt lose my husband, my job, my home. It was so easy to just go on drinking,‚Äù she said.\n\n> \n\n> WOMEN ALCOHOLICS GET IT WORSE\n\n> A health crisis awaits when excessive drinking in women remains an under-recognised and under-detected problem.\n\n> While there is no difference in the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders in men and women, women are generally more vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol than men and find it harder to quit, said Dr Guo.\n\n> Adverse effects can be physical or psychosocial, such as liver problems or sexual or physical abuse.\n\n> Women get drunk more easily than men when they drink the same amount of alcohol, due to differences in body structures and hormones.\n\n> ‚ÄúGenerally, women weigh less and have less water in their bodies. As alcohol tends to disperse more in body water, this means that a woman‚Äôs blood alcohol concentration will tend to be higher than a man‚Äôs, putting her at a greater risk of harm,‚Äù Dr Guo explained.\n\n> According to him, some neuroscience studies indicate that the development of addiction in women is faster than in men. Their physical and psychosocial functioning also deteriorate faster.\n\n> Studies suggest that women who are addicted to alcohol have a higher prevalence of concurrent psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety or borderline personality disorder, said Dr Guo.\n\n> ‚ÄúThese comorbid disorders may make women vulnerable to alcohol addiction, where they use alcohol to cope with their emotions. However, this may in fact render them susceptible to developing drinking problems or alcohol addiction,‚Äù he said.\n\n> People may start abusing alcohol for various reasons. Along with income growth and social interactions, there are more chances to consume alcohol, which many view as a recreational beverage, said Dr Guo.\n\n> Other reasons why alcohol dependence may start include poor coping skills, peer influence and easy availability of alcohol.\n\n> Studies show that people with immediate family members with addictive disorders have a higher chance of developing alcohol addiction, he added.\n\n> At its core, however, alcohol addiction is the same as any form of addiction and ‚Äúa bigger problem than just a matter of willpower‚Äù, said Ms Ong.\n\n> ‚ÄúIn addiction, the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that enables rational decisions) somehow goes a bit offline. The logical part of the brain that tells you, ‚ÄòIf I continue drinking, my husband is going to leave me‚Äô no longer really works,‚Äù said Ms Ong.\n\n> ROUTES TO SOBRIETY\n\n> Anyone who develops an addiction would find it hard to quit and professional help is often warranted, said Dr Guo.\n\n> ‚ÄúAlthough we see fewer women seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders than men, treatment is equally effective for men and women,‚Äù he said.\n\n> At Nams, treatment for alcohol use disorders consists of the use of pharmaceutical drugs and psychosocial support by a multidisciplinary team.\n\n> Patients who are chronically dependent on alcohol may need inpatient treatment for detoxification and rehabilitation, said Dr Guo. They will also need post-discharge follow-up to prevent a relapse.\n\n> Treatment is a highly individualised process, and there is no particular correct way to treat an alcohol addiction, said Ms Ong.\n\n> Support groups can help. ‚ÄúSupport groups such as AA have been proven to help many people, which is why it is available in so many countries. However, while some people feel that it works, others don‚Äôt. The goal we have for our clients with alcohol addiction is that they eventually find support beyond therapy,‚Äù said Ms Ong.\n\n> In cases where the alcoholic herself is in denial or not ready to seek help, her loved ones may have to seek professional help on how to do it, said Ms Ong.\n\n> ‚ÄúAs the addict progresses in her addiction, often, the loved ones also progress in their level of rescuing, enabling and protecting from consequences. Until someone breaks the cycle, both are on the trajectory of going downhill,‚Äù she said.\n\n> Today, Clare has broken that vicious cycle. She has not consumed a single drop of alcohol in the last six years, and now has a one-and-a-half year-old daughter who occasionally accompanies her to AA meetings.\n\n> Encouraging other alcoholics to seek help, Clare said: ‚ÄúThere is a solution out there. You are not alone.‚Äù\n\n> \n\n---\n0.5.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', '[deleted]', 'If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.\n\n**US:**\n\nCall 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741-741\n\n**Non-US:**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)\n \n --- \n \n^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.', ""The existence of underage alcohol drinkers right now would suggest that isn't useful.""]"

>  
>But instead of a personal experience, rapper Subhas Nair, who‚Äôs known simply as Subhas, chose to write about migrant workers.  
>  
>All four songs from Roar! are available at¬†[https://wmsg.lnk.to/Roar](https://wmsg.lnk.to/Roar).  
>  
>Subhas decided to address the topic because there are several issues regarding migrant workers in Singapore that the 27-year-old, informed by his degree in Urban Studies from Yale-NUS, feels strongly about.  
>  
>‚ÄúThese people don‚Äôt come here as just numbers. They are human; they have interests and passions,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAnd human rights includes, to me, a minimum wage in a country that you‚Äôve built.‚Äù

>In a way, though, Subhas has also managed to find parallels between their stories and his: Growing up with an abusive father in a home where his parents struggled to pay rent, he‚Äôd always felt like he was one of society‚Äôs marginalised.  
>  
>Even now, ‚ÄúAs an independent rapper, I don‚Äôt get many mainstream platforms,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúAs a brown man in Singapore in this industry, there‚Äôs not a lot that comes by.‚Äù  
>  
>**AVOIDING THE ‚ÄúPOVERTY PORN‚Äù TRAP**  
>  
>When the opportunity to work with CNA arose, Subhas was focused on using his music for social good, and this involved thinking beyond the superficial.  
>  
>‚ÄúI realised there were two real traps in this. The first one was that it could be very exploitative,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThink about it: This Singaporean songwriter goes and meets with migrant workers, spends some time with them, interviews them, takes their stories, writes their song, sells their song. Who makes the money? And is that restorative justice?‚Äù  
>  
>He continued: ‚ÄúFrom the start it was, ‚ÄòIf I‚Äôm doing this, then I‚Äôm doing it to make sure that migrant workers who are in this documentary are remunerated.‚Äù  
>  
>He added: ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want to just speak to random migrant workers and create poverty porn. I want to collaborate. I want to work with a band. And it turns out there‚Äôs this band, Migrants Band Singapore, that we were put in touch with.‚Äù  
>  
>It was important to him that that the migrant workers featured on the show be compensated for their time and efforts, but because it was against policy for the documentary to pay its interviewees, Subhas worked out a solution. Now, ‚ÄúThey are featured artists on my song. So, you pay me for my craft, and I budget accordingly.‚Äù  
>  
>After that came the second potential trap: Tokenism. Even though ‚ÄúI related to them so much because of diaspora and thinking of myself as South Asian‚Äù, Subhas knew the migrant workers‚Äô story would not ring the truest if it were told through his voice. Furthermore, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt understand their instruments; I don‚Äôt play them. I also didn‚Äôt want them to speak in English or say anything that I wrote.‚Äù  
>  
>So, instead of having them perform a song he wrote, he went to one of their performances in Nee Soon and made a recording of them performing a ghazal titled Aar Kichu Chai Na Mone Gaan Chara, which is Bengali for ‚ÄúI have everything I need because of this song‚Äù. That recording is now part of the track.  
>  
>As artists, he said, ‚ÄúWe just capture what‚Äôs there. We are the vehicles. We are not the most important. The most important are the teachers, the firemen, the mothers feeding children and waking up early in the morning, the hawker aunties with the varicose veins on their feet from standing for so long. Those are the people whose stories we must amplify. Our job is to be authentic about those stories; to tell our Singaporean stories.‚Äù  
>  
>**LESS TALK, MORE ACTION**  
>  
>Meeting the individual band members was an evocative experience. ‚ÄúAnd then when they started making music, I felt jealous,‚Äù he quipped. ‚ÄúThey are so talented‚Ä¶ I learned so much just being in that space and talking to them.‚Äù  
>  
>But beyond raising awareness through this project, Subhas believes in change through action ‚Äì by looking at issues such as minimum wage, for instance. And, as another example, ‚ÄúA professor that I know, Anju Paul from Yale-NUS, is working on a migrant care index. How important is that?‚Äù  
>  
>He asserted, ‚ÄúWe can achieve awareness by talking about something ‚Äì or we can achieve awareness along the way as we demand justice.‚Äù  
>  
>In his view, ‚ÄúWe can live in a country where we‚Äôre all prospering ‚Äì we just have to redefine prosperity to encapsulate compassion, empathy and almost a responsibility for the social mobility for these people.  
>  
>‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why I chose to do music. Because I know that I can influence a generation of people. Because I know it‚Äôs more powerful than they understand.‚Äù  
>  
>**THE POWER OF MUSIC**  
>

&#x200B;

Surprised it has yet to be discussed here.

Any thoughts?

&#x200B;

I fundamentally believe that we need to stop our addiction with using property as a means to accumulate wealth, particularly property that is government subsidised.

&#x200B;

One wonders how a policy where the government essentially guarantees the value of your house against inflation (and presumable property downturns) is equitable and feasible in anyway.",0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ah63jp/today_online_freehold_hdb_flats_heres_how_it_may/,"['[deleted]', 'People just want their cake and eat it. Ironically those staying in hdbs are pushing for a policy which would most likely hurt their future generations. Going by the generalizationthat they are average or less well to do given that they stay in subsidized public housing, them pushing for continuity for their houses is only going to make it worse for their future generations since there will be a shortage of supply and a spike in prices.\n\nPretty sure it doesn\'t bite the private estate dwellers that much since most statistics suggest they already own multiple homes and are capable of continuing to shop in the private market instead or afford the raised prices of a resale hdb in a ""freehold hdb"" market.', 'The issue surrounding HDB flats is kind of hazy because until now there are almost no HDB flats are close to having their lease expire. There are heavy market distortions in terms of perceived value of the HDB flat which I believe is due in large part for there being lots of uncertainty in what happens at the tail end of the lease (i.e. with less than 25 years or so left).\n\nThe problem is that in Singapore now, there are almost no flats/apartments facing this issue in the next 10 years or so, so flat prices have remained relatively stable even for old flats that are approaching the 50 year old mark). Hence the market distortions will continue at least in the short term. However eventually people are going to realize that it\'s not worth it for them to buy houses that will only last say 30 years as they won\'t be able to stay in those houses fort the rest of their lives but will eventually have to look for alternate housing. Hence the price of these houses will probably drop very quickly over the course of a decade or so, in 20-30 years time. I\'m curious to see how the govt will handle SERS/VERS flats at that time when the free market value is very low.\n\nI have some ideas about how I think the government can soften some of the impact, which I didn\'t spend more than a few minutes on so I apologize if they aren\'t very well formed.\n\nBasically I think the govt should have an internal valuation of BTO flats that is completely divorced from the market sale price of the flats, similar to the OMV/PARF valuation of cars. So the valuation would be the sum of the 99 year land lease (analogous to COE) and some other part tied to the value of the actual building itself (analogous to OMV). Then they can have a formula to pay out the PARF equivalent to people when the 99 year limit actually hits. This way, people have a bit of cushion to find alternate housing and make plans.\n\nIn this case I think the free resale market should prevail (just like in the used car market). People just need to come to terms with the fact that their HDB flats should be depreciating assets. They are already aware of that with their cars so I don\'t see why it sould be any different with housing. Having permanently appreciating housing assets really benefits the few at the expense of the many.\n\nOn the govt end, I believe education is the way to go. The government should encourage people to buy older flats with their eyes open. They are already doing a good job of restricting the CPF you can use to buy older flats and I believe education is the best policy here.\n\nHowever, trying to spout the old tired line where the govt will maintain the value of people\'s flats is dishonest. Basically the govt needs to be upfront about HDB flats depreciating, people need to be prudent about their flat purchases, and the govt should step forward with explicit subsidies to help out certain people who are caught in the crunch in future. Not use schemes like SERS/VERS to distort the market further unless absolutely necessary.\n\nAlso, I believe this ""freehold HDB"" idea is just silly. If the govt has an option to buy back your ""freehold"" property at market rate any time, is it still considered to be ""freehold"" in anything but name? To take a different perspective, the proposed idea just gives the government the ability to arbitrarily hold off repossessing HDB flats with expired leases, which is yet another opaque scheme to distort the market (which is a terrible idea in my opinion).', 'I already see Bukit Merah and Toa Payoh turning into retirement villages while new families crowd themselves in Punggol and Sengkang. The use of land is looking very skewed and worsened now that nobody wants to buy old flats. Expecting a stop-gap measure soon in loosened TDSR requirements. ', ""I'm just bummed that once your flat goes below 60 years remaining lease its value drops because nobody can buy them anymore unless you're paying for it in cash. In 10 years time you're gonna have tens of thousands of flats with this problem."", 'That\'s what I thought. Dynastic wealth perpetuates inequality.\n\nPeople are willing to treat relatively large expenses as sunk costs, most commonly luxury cars (which we do see in HDB carparks).\n\nCan\'t they apply the same philosophy to a leasehold subsidised flat? To use and enjoy it for a limited time before the inevitable disposal instead of ""handing it down""?', "">Furthermore, in a landlocked Singapore, this means that the supply of flats on the market would decrease even further, because the government will be less likely to reacquire old flats and hence reduce the supply of new flats, driving up the prices on public housing in the long run.\n\nThe math doesn't really work though. Assuming the number of people who want to live in HDB flats are constant and the number of HDB flats in existence are constant, the demand will stay the same and prices should be stable regardless of the point in in time relative to the lease end that people sell their existing flat.\n\nNo matter what, some people  will need a house to stay. So even if they sell a flat after 60 years of its lease (instead of 99) they will be looking for another flat to replace the first one.\n\nThe overall market for HDB flats only changes if in one scenario people are incentivised to move to private housing for some reason freeing up more HDB flats. Or if people sell off their flats earlier and rent say single rooms for the rest of their lives. If people just shuffle around between HDB flats then there's really no change in the overall situation."", 'I agree.\n\nLocals need to treat a home more like a transient good than a heirloom.\n\nCheap, affordable housing is perhaps a good way to mitigate our problems of low fertility, poor entrepreneur-ship and rentier tendencies.\nAll of which result in structural demographic issues down the road.', '""Freehold"" with an option to buyback at the end of the life, is just like being ""owners"" of the flat when at the end of 99 years it goes back to the government. You are a lessor, ownership is a fucking lie.\n\n""asset enhancement policy"" is just the bs being sold by the G to get people to believe in HDBs as an ever appreciating asset for retirement.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nIn a country like Singapore, prices for something as critical as housing should be well planned for a long-run horizon and not subject to forces of the open market in the first place. It\'s a place to live not a source of fucking retirement funds.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nPlus i think its pretty ridiculous to call a policy thats planned to be rolled out 20 years in the future a significant policy at all. Who will be there in twenty years to take ownership of the success/failure/problems generated by this ""significant policy""? surely not the current generation of pap dogs\n\n&#x200B;', 'The issue came to head when HDB allowed lease owners to resell their flats to others. In doing so, HDB effectively ceded flat valuation to the free market.\n\nIf HDB adopts your idea and comes up with an internal valuation for near end-of-life (EOL) flats, then the likelihood is that private valuation will tend to converge with that over time. Mostly because HDB\'s valuation will have set the upper limit of what is ""reasonable"" to pay - and HDB\'s valuation is likely to be lower than private valuation (just like how BTO flats cost less than resale). This does mean that near EOL flat owners might get some money from making a sale; but the flipside is that the near EOL HDB valuation can be extrapolated up to newer resale flats as well - which can dampen the market.\n\nHaving said that, I don\'t disagree with the idea of drastically cooling the housing market, it is just a possible unintended consequence of having separate valuation systems.\n\nI think the ideal situation would be that public housing isn\'t sold, but rented on a long tenancy basis with liberal tenancy rights - including the right to renovate but not the right to transfer (sell) leases.', 'Not exactly true. The cpf limit does kick in but scales with the potential buyers age and flat age as well. \n\nSo for example, 50 year olds may still be able to buy your flat fully with cpf but 35 year olds might only be able to pay half in CPF and have to cough up cash after the CPF limit.\n\nBut yes a lot more flats get affected in the next 10-20 years and I wonder how long it will take to get priced in. Especially those tasty flats in Bishan that are still regularly going for more than 800k\n\nAs a general rule I would stay away from old flats >35 yrs old or dump them ASAP while there are still people willing to bear those market risks. ', '[deleted]', 'The government has a part to play in the idea of public housing being an ""eternal"" asset(anyone arguing that it isn\'t an asset needs to go back to school and reeducate themselves). There\'s no doubt about it being an asset just that there\'s a depreciation curve to be expected of it down the line since it is only good for 99 years. \n\nThe G did market the hdb as something Singaporeans invest in for life and there was a lot of misconception about one getting fair value back at the end of the life span although I do not know when this misconception came about. Too bad our G doesn\'t ever admit to any mistakes but atleast it\'s setting it straight for the nation that they will expire with no value at the end of the 99 year tenure. \n\nOtherwise, public housing is arguably perfect and if any intelligent individual can come up with a better alternative please do so. Otherwise i think average Singaporeans should be happy they aren\'t stuck in shoe box units / horrible run down properties that were built and never maintained. It works and it\'s comfortable for our lifestyle and restraints.\n\n', 'I think it\'s a good idea that they let HDB lessees sell their flats on the open market. There are people willing to pay more and in effect subsidize those who got the government subsidies. Nothing is stopping people from buying a 2 room flat in a less accessible location and staying there for the rest of their life if it\'s all they can afford. Affordability is a separate issue of course but I think the problem is still not so bad in Singapore. \n\nI don\'t really agree with the BTO pricing scheme as a discount from market rate though because I think it\'s just a way that the government props up existing resale prices. But it may be necessary for stability, I don\'t know. \n\nEventually, private valuation has to converge on the government valuation when the 99 year lease is up be it $0 or some PARF value. (Drastic) cooling of the housing market is inevitable at some point. Current housing prices for 40 year old flats are way over what they should be. The thing is that under current policy the value of end of lease flats will be $0 so the free market will have to figure out how to interpolate appropriately between say 700k for a 40 year old flat and $0 when it hits 99 years. And the further the flats get to 99 years before the market distortions correct themselves the more drastic the drop will be.\n\nThere are way too many flats built in the 70s and 80s approaching that age in the next 20+ years that the government can\'t save all of them or pay ""market rate"" (whatever that is), so its really going to come to a head. Realistically, it\'s probably going to take some watershed event in which a sizeable chunk of people get burnt which may trigger a chain reaction overnight. I don\'t know.\n\nSafest thing to do is to buy a house and estimate the remaining value when you retire/die with an appropriate depreciation model and plan finances appropriately. \n\nWhen I bought my house I felt that the fresh out of MOP flats were overpriced for still having the ""new flat smell"" while the 30-40 year old flats in mature estates were overpriced due to their location. The 15-20 year old flats are generally better value overall because they have a good 30 years or so before facing serious lease considerations (eg cpf limits) and you get to see what happens to the older flats about 15 years before any serious issues affect you so you can plan and act accordingly. Hence I never recommend any friends/relatives to buy really old flats as it\'s quite a financial risk. ', 'But who would wanna buy a flat that is guaranteed to depreciate over time? If you buy a flat with 60 yrs remaining lease now, in 20 years it‚Äôd have only 40 yrs lease left making it even more unmarketable. Imagine thousands of flats in the future with this predicament. Really hope the government does something to make older flats easier to transact by allowing the full use of CPF + granting loans to buy them.', "">Not exactly true. The cpf limit does kick in but scales with the potential buyers age and flat age as well.\n\nIt's not just that. Bank loan restrictions also come in for older flats. "", ""You can't end up with two HDB flats in your name. Hdb will force you to sell one. Unless your parents explicitly will the flat to one of their unmarried kids (who I presume were living with them) then it's a different story. \n\nIf you own a private property though you might be able to hold onto the HDB in certain circumstances but they have changed the rules on that. "", ""I'm completely happy that we have a public housing program.\n\nWhat I find interesting is how quite a few locals don't see an investment class housing asset being at diametrically opposed to affordable housing. They are trying to achieve different objectives.\n\nPromoting a policy that says these two goals can be achieved without contradiction was at best ignorance and at worst a lie.\nBut it's tragic that some Singaporeans couldn't think their way through something that definitely sounded too good to be true."", 'To use the car analogy I believe the govt should pay a fair value (equivalent of PARF) to flat owners after the 99 year lease expires. If you think about it ""fair value"" is what another person would pay for it at that point in time (which is $0 after 99 years) so it\'s entirely dependent on government policy. \n\nPeople think they should get back a good amount because LKY and others have been drumming the HDB up as an appreciating asset. They weren\'t wrong because as Singapore grew economically the market value grew much faster than the year-on-year depreciation since the 1980s (assuming a linear rate of decay or so). But it\'s time for fundamental principles to catch up in the next couple of decades. \n\nPeople just need to plan ahead and be wise about what they are buying. I shake my head every time I hear of someone buying a 40-year-old AMK flat for like $700k. They will be unpleasantly surprised in 30-40 years time when they realize the pool of people to sell their flat to is extremely tiny. Assuming they don\'t manage to sell it to another sucker within the next 10 years.', 'That\'s the thing. Every flat is guaranteed to depreciate over time eventually because the value hits 0 at 99 years. Unless the government steps in with artificial market distortions like SERS/VERS to ""save"" people from an essentially valueless flat.\n\nAllowing people to use more CPF grants or loans to buy the flat is just exacerbating the problem. Imagine a 35 year old forking out 600k in CPF/loans to buy a 65 year flat 25 years from now? They are likely to end up homeless at 70 with a repossessed flat after the end of the lease with an empty CPF account. \n\nMy point is, at some point someone will have to eat the shit pie whether it\'s one of the intermediate buyers or the govt. How do you determine what the govt should pay for a flat that someone bought at 700k 50 years into its lease, if it only has 20 years left? 700k? 300k? 100k? The free market value is probably going to be like very very low once the lease drops below 20 years. Who would wanna buy it except for people above 65 who are reasonably confident they won\'t outlive the lease (and who can say with medical advances) \n\nFar better if the government just educates everyone that the flat is eventually going to depreciate and brace themselves for the political fallout. Otherwise, they can just give hefty payouts to make all the flat owners happy at end of lease if the govt in 40 years time has enough surplus by then (highly highly doubt it) ', ""I don't think investment class housing assets are necessarily mutually exclusive from affordable housing.\n\nConsider that not all HDB flats are created equal. Whether it's BTO or resale, many have terrible facing, terrible (future) neighbours, terrible location. Also specifically with resale flats pricing can be all over the place depending on the owner's circumstances, market timing, competing flats in the vicinity etc.\n\nI believe HDB can be a good investment if you take advantage of it (just like buying good stocks when low), in the sense that you can actually get a positive return in the short-medium term (or reduce your payments).\n\nOf course in the long term I agree that it should go to zero (or some small residual value) once the lease expires, but that could be anywhere from 20-80 years down the road. Generally, that's kind of the case for any leasehold property though. Most condos today are terrible investments."", 'The only solution I can think of is to allow private developers the choice to buy over flats that reach the end of their lease. But they must redevelop the flats into public housing style flats (not condos) and be sold under HDB eligibility rules. Homeowners can at least expect to receive some payout at the end of their lease. ', ""I don't meant that the house/flat itself cannot be used for both purposes; I'm contending that the HDB **policy** cannot be formulated with the intent to address both aims simultaneously.\n\nYes. HDB is a lottery. Which by nature means that it is not equitable.\nSurely places an even greater pressure to make sure that HDBs are not profitable investment vehicles because someone really lucky could have hit jackpot - a jackpot that is subsidised by the taxpayer no less."", ""I totally agree with you. I don't think the HDB policy was formulated with that intent. I think it was more a by product of our economic growth from the 1970s-1990s far outstripping depreciation. And then LKY/PAP decided to use it as a selling point politically and the narrative stuck, now it's going to be hard to maintain going forward especially a couple decades from now but they have to unwind it somehow because eventually the shit will hit the fan. "", "">Surely places an even greater pressure to make sure that HDBs are not profitable investment vehicles because someone really lucky could have hit jackpot - a jackpot that is subsidised by the taxpayer no less.\n\nDon't really agree with this. \n\nFor example the Pinnacle at Duxton flats were sold at around 300k and now worth more than a million.\n\nAt 300k, I don't think taxpayers really subsidized very much if any in terms of the flat construction (land pricing and location is govt owned too). The jackpot/windfall is wholly financed by some rich private individual willing to pay those prices. So as much as it's an inequitable lottery, it's still private transfers of wealth.\n\nOne could also say that almost all of our parents generation have seen their flats go at least 5-10x in value from when they purchased them, so they are all lottery winners in some sense, some win more and some win less. It's not that different from the current situation where if you get the best flats in a BTO batch you will likely see a far more handsome profit than the furthest unit from the MRT on the 4th floor above the rubbish chute with West sun\n\n"", 'They really should unwind it now. The can has been kicked down the road for long enough.', 'Well the point is that they are still subsidised by the taxpayer to a certain extent.\nWhich really begs the question of how much money should go back to the taxpayer when the flat is resold.\n\nI agree that everyone with a lottery winner won to some extent; which means that we need to ask\n1. What about those people who can\'t buy HDB? Be it couples earning above the salary cap or non-traditional couples or singles who cannot qualify for HDB flats? How are we fair to these people?\n2. Does the fact that everyone who got a flat won ""something"" make the inherent inequity more acceptable? Or is that a smokescreen for a poorly thought out policy that inherently rewards people based on luck and timing but nothing else?', ""> One could also say that almost all of our parents generation have seen their flats go at least 5-10x in value from when they purchased them, so they are all lottery winners in some sense, some win more and some win less. \n\nThe reason why they went up 5X was because (1) wages in Singapore rose rapidly in the 70's and 80's and (2) there was a liberalisation of the HDB resale market in 1989 as well as the rapid increase in the CPF contribution rate in the 80's. All these factors are one-off and won't work again."", '\n>1. What about those people who can\'t buy HDB? Be it couples earning above the salary cap or non-traditional couples or singles who cannot qualify for HDB flats? How are we fair to these people?\n\nIncome ceiling is quite fair in my opinion. Sure it could probably be tweaked a little, like increasing the amount or maybe having a sliding window instead of a cutoff for resale subsidy. Perhaps taking into account total income of occupiers instead. But generally it\'s a good policy. \n\nBalloting wise, you can likely get a BTO as a first timer in a reasonable span of time if you are not picky and bid for even the unpopular non-mature locations and take whatever is left (and write in to the MP if you still fall within cracks). \n\nAs for people who miss out due to salary cap, I put it down to the govt encouraging people to settle down early. Also at 12k a month you can definitely afford a resale flat in a non mature estate very comfortably even without rebates. Though I think it should probably be raised to like 15k with a sliding window for the CPF rebate. I can\'t see how people are expected to prudently pay for a mature BTO or EC costing 800-900k with less than 12k monthly income. \n\nNon traditional couples and singles are clearly on the losing end of the policy. This isnt because it\'s poorly thought out, it\'s an explicit governmental stance so the government at least views it as being fair. Our individual views nonwithstanding \n\n>2. Does the fact that everyone who got a flat won ""something"" make the inherent inequity more acceptable? Or is that a smokescreen for a poorly thought out policy that inherently rewards people based on luck and timing but nothing else?\n\nI don\'t know anyone in my peer group (regular couples marrying in the 30s or earlier) who wasn\'t picky and couldn\'t get a BTO in reasonable time. Everyone I know who bought a resale including me did it for personal reasons. So I think accessibility seems OK so far. \n\nI mean, I really don\'t know how to make it more equitable besides tweaking the income ceiling. You can\'t change the fact that desirability of individual units will always make things inequitable because people value different things differently (flat facing, sun, unit floor, location) and any valuation would not hold universally true. \n\nUltimately it boils down to the government giving cash to some and not others based on some factors right? I feel like it\'s inequitable to people with kids who should get priority and extra subsidies. Singles obviously want better options. Sandwich class people want income ceiling raised.\n \nYou see the same issued with all govt subsidies. There are people with Chas cards and getting heavy means-tested subsidies who don\'t really deserve it due to some quirk of their life situations, which is inequitable but also kind of inevitable in any system. \n\nFor example people can get 2 years of the highest CHAS subsidy even when they embark on a 10k/month job out of college, as long as they change address/apply during their first month or so, and CHAS doesn\'t get updated for 2 years.

Sometimes it\'s not really a choice on when you meet the right person to settle down with. Why should someone in this scenario be disadvantaged for something beyond his/her control?

When I looked deeper, it seems that Singapore banned it despite less health detriments compared to smoking.

Do you feel your uni related questions being answered sufficiently? Are there enough uni redditors here? What should change? Should this sub branch out to uni so that the O and A level people regain their focus? Share your experiences so the mods know! 


hi, graduating nus biz kid here, i was around to help with some o and a-level stuff but i realize this sub is being used more to help with the uni intake as well and probably will also help with uni resources etc. 
since this sub is new (<1 year old) and you guys are probably the first batch of a-level peeps moving on to uni, i strongly suggest reaching out to more people in uni to join this sub. 

initially this sub (as you can see from the sidebar description), was to prepare for examinations and definitely didnt get the attention of uni peeps. I'm not sure if you guys actually want to start another sub just for uni, cuz its also been diluting (most of the front page is just about uni intake) and taking attention away from the o-level and a-level peeps who use this sub. maybe mods, you guys can chime in on this. there are also subreddits (a bit dead) like r/nus and r/ntu 

Posts such as asking when the camps are, what are the difference between halls and RCs, and how to use your grade free year are important to know. my information is also limited cuz things have changed over time as well, would be better to recruit some current y1 and 2s to join this sub. i strongly suggest asking on r/singapore that you guys are expanding and do need some help from uni peeps. btw some of this info is also google-able, like on NUSSU facebook page or on NUS admissions page as well. 

NUS peeps, maybe you guys can also ask on nuswhispers, which has been quite active in getting queries answered, usually within a day. sorry i cant speak for the NTU and SMU peeps.

Hopefully Uni threads can stay in /r/SGExams :D\n\n# Important websites\n**University Administration**\n\n- [LumiNUS](https://luminus.nus.edu.sg) - The main learning platform where all your modules, content and submissions will be at effective AY2019/20. Modules of previous semesters will be at [IVLE](https://ivle.nus.edu.sg).\n- [MyEduRec](https://myedurec.nus.edu.sg) - The main portal for your academic and financial records, also used for applying for overseas exchange and to register for modules.\n- [myPortal@NUS](https://myportal.nus.edu.sg) - The website that contains important information that may be relevant to you during your time in NUS. Note: Some parts of this portal is outdated, use with care.\n- [NUS WebMail](https://exchange.nus.edu.sg) - Access your email @u.nus.edu.\n- [NUSync](https://nusync.nus.edu.sg) - For all student life-related matters (such as co-curricular activities and interest groups).\n- [NUS Campus Map](http://map.nus.edu.sg) - The map of NUS, more detailed than Google Maps.\n\n**Other websites**\n\n- [NUSMods](https://nusmods.com) - The official timetable builder for NUS and contains information on individual modules.\n- [NUS Libraries](https://libportal.nus.edu.sg) - Website for searching the NUS online and offline libraries, extremely useful for your project research.\n- [NUS Web Lecture](https://nuscast.ap.panopto.com) - A place for you to catch up on your recorded lectures (only available for certain modules and requires manual activation from LumiNUS).\n- [NUS Bulletin](http://www.nus.edu.sg/nusbulletin) - For all information about your degree requirements.\n- [NUSWhispers](https://nuswhispers.com) - An unofficial forum where users can post anonymous confessions.\n- [NUS Business](https://nusbusiness.com) - An unofficial map of all washrooms available on campus.\n\n# Academics\nIn NUS, most of the degrees operate on a modular structure except for Dentistry, Law and Medicine. This means that you are free to choose the combination of modules that you wish to take during a particular semester, subject to certain restrictions such as module pre-requisites and preclusions. Most modules are worth 4 Modular Credits (MCs). The Registrar\'s Office has [more information](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/education-at-nus/modular-system.html) on this structure.\n\n## Module Registration\nNUS handles module registration via a priority-based system. This means that you are more likely to get a certain module it is more urgent for you to take it. Module registration is handled by ModReg@EduRec.\n\nEach of your module selection is given a priority score, which is determined by the type of module you have selected, your seniority and the ranking of your preferences. This priority score is thus used to decide if you get the particular module as compared to another student selecting the same module.\n\nAdvice: Use NUSMods to plan for different possible combinations of your timetable and ensure that there are **no clashes in your timetable**, or your module selection will be voided.\n\n## Types of classes\nThere are many different types of class types, but the more common ones are explained below:\n\n- LEC: Lecture, a session for the tutor to deliver module content to you in a one-way manner, usually held in Lecture Theatres or Auditoriums.\n- SEC: Sectional, a classroom-based session similar to a lecture, but usually at a smaller scale and allows for class participation. Usually held in Seminar Rooms or Tutorial Rooms, but some modules may incorrectly show this type when it is in fact a Lecture.\n- TUT: Tutorial, a classroom-based session where a teaching assistant will be revising the concepts taught during a lecture and applying the concepts to certain questions, usually held in Tutorial Rooms.\n- REC: Recitation, similar to Tutorial but focuses more on revising concepts taught during a lecture.\n- LAB: Laboratory, a classroom-based session where there will be hands-on work to be done in a Laboratory. The focus is on applying concepts taught in lecture in a practical manner.\n\nSome Lectures may be recorded and made available on the NUS Web Lecture platform.\n\n## Degree Requirements\nFor single degree students (which is the majority of the student population), depending on your faculty, you will have the following types of modules that you will need to take during your candidature in NUS:\n\n- University Level Requirements: 5 General Education modules to be taken from 5 different pillars, total 20 MCs. Compulsory for every student unless enrolled in a Residential College programme and **cannot be mapped overseas**.\n- Faculty Requirements: Modules that your Faculty has decided that you will need to take, depends on the Faculty and the course you are enrolled in.\n- Major Requirements: The bulk of your modules will be the ones related to your major and consists of ""core"" (essential) and ""elective"" modules. Depending on your course, if you take a certain group of modules, you can request to make it your specialisation (which will be shown on your **transcript**, NOT your degree scroll).\n- Unrestrictive Electives: Refers to **any** module that you can take, provided that you fulfill the necessary pre-requisites for the module.\n\nFor double degree students, you will not have Unrestricted Electives. Instead, they will be replaced by the Faculty and Major Requirements of your second degree. More information is available on the [DDP Framework and Guidelines](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/education-at-nus/undergraduate-education/special-undergraduate-programmes/double-degree-programmes/double-degree-programme-framework-and-guidelines.html). For concurrent and joint degree students, please check with your academic advisor for more information specific to your degree programme.\n\nNote: There may also be additional graduating requirements that you will need to fulfill before you can graduate. Hence, check your degree requirements to ensure that you have fulfilled the graduating requirements as early as possible!\n\n## Second Major and Minor\nWhen you applied for admissions to NUS, you would have indicated a major that you wish to be enrolled in. This is called your first (or primary) major. The modules that you need to take for the first major are under the major requirements.\n\nAs you are free to take any modules as your Unrestricted Electives, you can choose to take up a minor or a second major. This means that you will need to take certain modules to fulfill the requirements for the minor or a second major, which will then be shown in your **transcript** (NOT your degree scroll).\n\nIn general, a minor consists of 24 MCs worth of modules whereas a second major consists of 48 MCs worth of modules. However, the actual number may be lesser depending on the amount of overlap that your first major has with the minor/second major. If there is some overlap, then some modules can be double-counted (taking the module once to fulfill 2 different requirements), up to a maximum of 16 MCs for the second major and 8 MCs for a minor.\n\nDue to the limited space of your Unrestricted Electives, you will probably only be able to take only one second major, or up to 2 minors. A second major will also require a separate application to the host faculty for approval and is not automatically awarded. If you have applied for a second major/minor during your admissions application, you can choose not to pursue that second major/minor without any repercussions.', 'I feel like Uni threads belong in this sub because for most of us the end goal of these exams is to get to University.\n\nIt would also be helpful for exam threads not to exist in a vacuum away from Poly/Uni threads because logically one would be more motivated to study with an end goal in mind. The current ecosystem of this sub facilitates discovery for students who are still unsure of what they want. The students could click on the Uni threads out of curiosity to find out more even if they are not graduating this year etc.\n\nLastly, we will still be worshipping the bell curve in Uni, how dare you kick us out. (Jk)', '[deleted]', 'I‚Äôm super late to this post but anyway! Just have some thoughts; I feel like we should probably branch out to a SGUNIs subreddit with all the university content. Although like what the comment said above that the end goal is still university, I feel like with the inactiveness of the various uni subreddits(and absence of smu subreddit) and the activeness of this subreddit, this subreddit most likely will be filled with questions about ‚Äúhow change major‚Äù or ‚Äúhow does gpa work for this course‚Äù ‚Äúhow does the bell curve for this course work‚Äù etc. Especially when this batch of dragon babies head into uni! Really hoping this subreddit stops being diluted by posts about university admissions atm as many uni students are not here(as you mentioned) and also it‚Äôs hard to find posts about alevels and poly and olevels amidst the barrage of uni posts. Not sure whether the reception of a all-sg-uni subreddit will be though!', '(part 2/2)\n\n# Overseas Opportunities\n\nThere are different types of overseas opportunities available for you to take part in during your candidature in NUS and some of the more common ones are:\n\n* [NUS Overseas Colleges](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/educate/nus-overseas-colleges): Allows you to gain entrepreneurial experience up to 1 year abroad, fulfills mainly the internship requirements and a limited number of modules.\n* [Student Exchange Programme](http://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/student-exchange.php): Allows you to spend 1 semester at a partner university while taking modules to fulfill degree requirements (usually about 20 MCs).\n* [Summer and Winter Programmes](http://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/summer-winter.php): Allows you to spend the summer break (May - July) or the winter break (December) at a partner university while taking modules to fulfill degree requirements (usually about 12 MCs for summer and 4 MCs for winter).\n* [Study Trips For Engagement & EnRichment](http://www.nus.edu.sg/gro/steer.php): Allows you to spend some time (usually during the summer break) overseas to understand the culture of the destination country. However, this cannot be used to fulfill degree requirements.\n\nAll modules taken overseas can be transferred back to NUS subject to Faculty approval and will only be recorded on a pass/fail basis in the transcript.\n\nNote: These programmes are NOT compulsory (with the exception of NUS Business School). However, it is strongly encouraged that you take part in one to gain a better perspective of the world beyond Singapore.\n\n# Residential Life\n\nThere are 3 types of accomodation available in NUS:\n\n* Residential Colleges: A 2-year programme that allows you to take certain modules within that College and can be used to fulfill your General Education Requirements. The Residential Colleges are Cinnamon College (for the University Scholars Programme), Tembusu College, College of Alice and Peter Tan (CAPT), Residential College 4 (RC4) and Ridge View Residential College (RVRC).\n* Halls of Residence: Also known as Halls, the right to continue your stay in the Hall is determined by the amount of contributions you have made to the Hall, usually through the involvement in student life activities related to the Hall.\n* Student Residence: Suitable for people who are just looking for a place to stay.\n\n## Residential Colleges\n\nUnder the [University Scholars Programme](http://www.usp.nus.edu.sg/about/overview) and the [University Town College Programme](http://utown.nus.edu.sg/programmes/university-town-residential-programme-utrp/), students enrolled in these special programmes are able to take modules in their colleges and be guaranteed a 2-year stay on campus. Residential Colleges are suitable for students that would like to learn beyond their degrees. The 5 different Residential Colleges and their focuses are:\n\n* Cinnamon College: Pushes the intellectual boundaries of students and develop independent, adaptable thinkers\n* Tembusu College: Developing international citizens for the future\n* College of Alice and Peter Tan (CAPT): Community engagement and active citizenship\n* Residential College 4 (RC4): Systems thinking\n* Ridge View Residential College (RVRC): Environmental sustainability\n\n## Halls of Residences\n\nThere are a total of 7 Halls in NUS:\n\n* Eusoff Hall\n* Kent Ridge Hall\n* King Edward VII Hall\n* Raffles Hall\n* Sheares Hall\n* Temasek Hall\n* PGP House\n\nMore information about the halls are [available here](http://www.nus.edu.sg/osa/campus-living/residential-options/halls-of-residence).\n\n## Student Residences\n\nThere are only 2 student residences available:\n\n* PGP Residences\n* UTown Residences\n\nThe majority of students will reside at PGP Residences whereas only a selected number of students are able to stay at UTown Residences (only through invitation).\n\n# Student Life\n\nThe majority of student life is available on the NUSync portal, which hosts all information about the different activities available for students to take part in.\n\n## Freshmen Orientation\n\nHere are some links to the relevant websites to obtain more information about [Orientation 2019](http://orientation.nus.edu.sg):\n\n* [Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences](http://fassclub.org/freshmen/)\n* [NUS Business School](http://www.nusbizadclub.com/fops19/)\n* [School of Computing](https://freshmen.nuscomputing.com/)\n* [School of Design and Environment](https://sdemedia.wixsite.com/sdefop)\n* [Faculty of Engineering](http://enginclub.com/enginfop)\n* [Faculty of Law](https://www.facebook.com/NUSLawOrientation/)\n* [Faculty of Science](http://www.nusscienceclub.com/freshmen/)\n\nI would also recommend attending **NUSSU Student Life Fair** happening on 15 and 16 August 2019 from 11am to 6pm at University Town. It features a lot of the activities that you can take part in as a student, plus there will be lots of freebies for you to take. Freshmen are also entitled to getting a free shirt.\n\n## Computer Clusters\n\nIf your laptop battery has ran out and you need to use a computer on campus, here are some computer clusters that you can use:\n\n* Yusof Ishak House (YIH) Level 2 & 3 (printing and scanning available) - Managed by NUSSU Committee for Information Technology (NUSSU commIT)\n* AS8 Level 2 Computer Room (printing available) - Managed by NUSSU commIT\n* ~~ThinkLab, Level 3, NUS IT (printing available)~~\n* Central Library, Level 4, Central Library Building (printing available)\n* Science CBLC (Level 2, Block S10)\n* Various Programming Labs at School of Computing (Block COM1 and Block i3) - Only available for SoC students\n* PC Cluster (Level 4, Block E1 and Level 3, Block E2) - Only available for Engineering students\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\n* The Internal Shuttle Bus (ISB) provides for connectivity to various parts of the huge campus.

Go to a gym and try climbing using the rental shoes.\n\n\\- if you like climbing enough to want to buy your own pair, decathlon sells dirt cheap climbing shoes. Get that.\n\nAt the beginning level, everyone's technique is generally bad so shoes don't matter that much. Makes a lot more sense to get a trial pair of shoes and get the basics right, and then buying the type of shoe that suits your climbing style."", ""Additional note: Please try on the shoes before you buy if you can!

Too tight a fit, you'll grow to dread putting on your new shoes. \n\nOnline shopping is good only when you know exactly what you want."", ""Honestly for a first shoe, you should just get something under $100, considering how you'll fuck up the toe area with poor footwork.\n\n\nBtw, you can find madrock flashes at campers corner\n\n\nEdit: the climbing shoes from decathlon is also quite decent for a beginner.

johnotcena,aftudz,[O Levels] (Studying While Staying Sane) #1 How I went from Suck to Superb,2019-01-14 16:35:36,SGExams,77673,12,52," 

**‚Äú336th? Out of 385 students in the cohort? Are you kidding me?‚Äù** I questioned myself silently. I was staring at the End-Of-Year report card for my academic performance in Secondary 2 with shock. I just got slapped hard by reality. 

I was a ‚ÄòC‚Äô student (my overall percentage was 57.9%), my L1R5 was definitely way out of my expectations (23), and the subjects that I thought I excelled in did not enable me an A2.  

During the December holidays, I questioned myself, ‚ÄúSeriously, why does school seem so hard?‚Äù I thought I worked hard for the EOY examinations, only to obtain scores worse than the previous tests. In Secondary 2, I was already struggling to stay afloat. Will I be able to handle the much more difficult workload in Upper Secondary? Will I score well enough to even be eligible for any Junior College?

As you can tell, **I hit rock bottom during that stage in my life**.  For most of my Lower Secondary School life, I deluded myself into believing I was still fine. Failed a test? Well, most of my friends seemed to also be performing badly, so I am still alright. 

But once I saw the cohort position (336/385), I panicked. What? You mean my scores were not of the norm? Most people were better? I was in the last 50 in my batch? Something definitely was wrong here. 

During the holidays, I decided to figure out for myself why I was unable to do well in school, and why it is unsafe to continue at this rate. Some argue that performing in school does not guarantee success, and to that, I agree to a certain extent. But for me, I needed to do better. You will realise why in the next chapter. For now, I‚Äôll fast forward to where I had already answered the two aforementioned questions.

At the start of the new year, I had the reasons placed in my head. I was not here to suck in studying. ‚ÄúI am here to make a change,‚Äù boldly claimed the 15-year-0ld me, who was feeling the initial euphoria of the start of a new year a bit too much. 

I worked my way up to clinch a few leadership titles at the beginning of the year. I eventually became the Class Chairperson and Student Conductor of Chinese Orchestra. The stories about my experience can be saved for another time. For now, just know that these positions cost me certain commodities. My time and energy. The sacrifice of them forced me to manage my time well. I had to learn early. Because for Common Test 1, I did poorly.

For this major examination, I had an L1R5 of 30. My best grade was a B4, and I failed two subjects. I had to quickly adapt, or I would repeat history. 

Perhaps my true waking call was after CT1. I told myself that I should start making huge changes, and to genuinely put my effort. I was feeling rather hopeless, but I promised myself that if I still did poorly for Mid-Year Examinations, then I cannot blame myself anymore.

So there began the actions I took instead of blabbering to myself some quotes to pump me up in the short-term. I downloaded a few phone applications, such as Habitica and Ankidroid. I also removed most of my online entertainment which served as a distraction, such as most of the Youtube channels I had previously been watching. My boldest move yet might be living a life free from social media (which I consider being Instagram/Snapchat/Facebook; Whatsapp and Telegram are not social media platforms, they serve mainly as messaging platforms) and video games, which I was addicted to. I created a studying schedule on my own free will a few weeks before MYE. I even used Google Calendar to plan my activities by the hour. I also began focusing hard during lessons and participating in activities, such as group work.

My results? An L1R5 of 23-2 (I passed MSP). An A1 (for Physics), which was commendable considering my past performance. My grades were slowly climbing up.

For CT2, I followed many of the same productive habits, while also tweaking my strategy. For example, I started practising Mathematics on Acelearning (highly underrated website) regularly, which obviously guaranteed me mastering most topics. Hence, I wasn‚Äôt that surprised that I got two A1‚Äôs from my two Mathematics. I was top 3 in the class! For a guy who got 50% for both subjects in CT1, that was superb. Other subjects were improving too, like Combined Humanities. I got a B3, which was a vast jump from a D7 in CT1. My L1R5 this time was 19. Now I can finally enter Junior College (though a low-tier JC)!

For EOY, I dipped a little. It might be because of my slight complacency, or an inability to cope with revising a year‚Äôs workload. However, I still performed better than pre-MYE. An L1R5 of 21 was not too shabby. 

With all the new habits I have taken, and the immense change of mindset, I was now placed 125/391. In just a year, I have gone up by 211 positions. That is about half the size of the cohort! I was absolutely proud of myself for working hard yet smart to achieve this result. My leadership commitments did not pull me down, though I could have blamed my results on them. This shows one can take up several commitments and still excel in academics. So those with leadership positions, don‚Äôt give up!

But of course, doing well in Secondary 3 wasn‚Äôt the goal here. As the legendary rap artist Dr Dre once said, ‚ÄúBut remember, anybody can get it. The hard part is keeping it.‚Äù I wanted to show my vast improvement wasn‚Äôt a one-off thing, and that I can stay consistent.

I definitely stayed consistent in my work. I did not believe slacking off would do me any good nearing ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels. After the March holidays, I was already spending the next few weeks to revise my Secondary 3 topics. Most people would only focus on the Secondary 4 topics being taught in school. I was already ahead of them.

For MYE in Secondary 4, I had an L1R5 of 13-2. There were only two ‚ÄòC‚Äôs, which were from Chinese and MSP. For the rest of my subjects, only B4-A1. The overall percentage was 67.0%. I was a ‚ÄòB‚Äô student, only a few marks short of an ‚ÄòA‚Äô.

For Prelims, my L1R5 was 11-2. Overall percentage, 71.0%. Level position, 77/389. I had 5 distinctions (3 were A1‚Äôs). I definitely worked hard to maintain this level. 

I have received the Good Progress Award thrice (Sec 1,2,4) and the EAGLES Award once (Sec 4) on top of my results too.

For ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels, well, I got an L1R5 of 10 with 4 bonus points, making it 6 for net score.

From Secondary 2 to 4, I have come a long way in bettering myself. While it might seem like I‚Äôve become this study ‚Äúfreak‚Äù, it wasn‚Äôt true. I still had time reserved for other aspects of my life, such as leadership commitments, exercising, reading, even songwriting. My family and friends do not portray me as this degraded into a nerd who doesn‚Äôt care for his social/psychological/spiritual/physical needs. Truth be told, I don‚Äôt like it when people have the intelligence, but no benevolence, such as being too selfish to share their notes, or have no social life. I thrived in other parts of my life. Thus, this book is called ‚ÄúStudying While Staying Sane‚Äù. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äòsell your soul to the devil‚Äô for doing well in school, as most believe. This is what I will explain throughout this book. 

Therefore, I genuinely believe my story needs to be heard. Not to show off my achievements and inflate my ego, but to prove it is possible to do well in school if you put the effort and use effective techniques with your hard work! All the reasons for my huge improvement will be revealed in this book. You will see from my personal story, from suck to superb, how can someone who was 336th in the cohort quickly claw his way to 77th. How I went from a ‚ÄòC‚Äô to ‚ÄòA‚Äô. Of course, while still staying sane.

I_am_a_robot_,eh1kaz,Recommendations for a good dermatologist for tan related issues?,2019-12-29 12:35:18,askSingapore,44636,0,3,"I have from a farmer‚Äôs tan (plus maybe some other issues) on my face for many years as it is very noticeably darker than my arms and legs and have lately been thinking of visiting a dermatologist for help. I mainly want to revert the tan on my face so that it is at the same shade as my arms and legs.

I spent some time googling and found Dr. Justin Boey https://sozoclinic.sg/dr-justin-boey/ but was wondering if anyone has any recommendations. The advice given to many other skin related posts are to visit the National Skin Centre which I believe is not applicable for cosmetic purposes. I plan to visit two different doctors to get their opinions before going in on one with the recommended treatments.

I am aware of the Asian Beauty and Skincare Addiction threads, and that it takes time to fade off a tan (if mine is indeed a tan) but I would just like to visit a doctor to get his advice and see if it is possible to speed up the process.

I've read your comments and decided to have a talk with my parents about the situation.

My parents said that the fact that I played a lot of video games could be the reason why I get such anxiety over a stressing need to get good grades for my studies. My mum especially said that when playing video games, especially online PvP games, the brain can be tricked into thinking that success is easy to achieve when I won a quick round of gaming, and it can be distracting from the pace of real life. When the brain gets used to this sense of wining, it wants more, and I can get grouchy if I don't ""win"" enough, except there is virtually no ""enough"", as my mum hypothesises that I could have fallen into a plausible state of addiction with video games.

As a gamer for as long as I have remembered, this could be the core reason I could be getting so much anxiety over my English scores. My mum has already booked an appointment for me and a psychologist recommended by a friend of her's after the exams, but for now, both she and dad suggests that a stable mental state and sound mind should be a priority as important as exam and studies themselves. Even though my parents have been limiting my screen time since the start of the year, I have trying very hard to find alternatives to curb myself, such as reading novels, magazines, doing sports, go down to 7-Eleven for a treat, and I'm starting to try my hands on sudoku.

I will still try to stir away from the subreddit to avoid adding fuel to the fire, but I never thought that the people here could be so helpful to me and each other. I thank to all of you from the bottom of my heart for allowing me to grasp the situation and get it under control. 

I need to sleep now, this was posted past midnight, but my mood has significantly improved and is resilient enough to go on a slow road to recovery.

johnotcena,akl96x,[O Levels] (Studying While Staying Sane) #3 Studying is too Stressful?,2019-01-28 15:42:34,SGExams,77673,0,8,"This is a huge reason why students do not wish to study hard. They get pressured by the stress which comes from performing well in examinations. To that, I agree. We can break this huge umbrella term further into two categories:

1. Competitive
2. Challenging

**Competition:**

Now, I do believe that competitiveness is needed when it comes to grades. For jobs, they will pick those with better qualifications. However, there are parents who constantly compare their children‚Äôs results and punish them if they are seen to be even worse than others. At the same time, students might also look over at their classmates‚Äô scores to see where they are in the ranking (like me at times). For those who place a heavy emphasis on students (including themselves) to perform better than others, I disagree.

In Professor Jordan B. Peterson‚Äôs book ‚Äú12 Rules For Life: An Antidote To Chaos‚Äù, Rule 4 is ‚Äú**Compare yourself to who you were yesterday, not to who someone else is today**‚Äù.

This is because one might not have the same destination as another person. Person A, who wishes to enter a mid-tier JC, should not feel dejected when he sees that Person B, who wishes to enter Raffles Institution, scores higher. It‚Äôs fine to be worse off other people with more ambitious goals. What you need to focus on is self-improvement. In what ways can you better your past self?

Another reason to compare yourself is sportsmanship which comes in this competitive climate. Gary Vaynerchuk once tweeted out, ‚ÄúStop tearing down everyone else's ""buildings"" THATS LOSER S\*\*\* .. if you are a true winner - just build it.‚Äù **The idea that one should be great by making everyone else lose instead of concentrating on working hard shows the lack of sportsmanship**. All the more why I stated earlier that I hate students who are too selfish to even lend a helping hand or share notes. That‚Äôs not the person I wish to be.

Lastly, you are not in control of how well people study. However, you are fully responsible for how you revise for tests. So which will be more efficient in obtaining grades? Working on only yourself. It's not trying doing whatever it takes to screw someone's grades over.

**PARENTS:**

For parents who keep comparing other students‚Äô scores against their own children, you are not helping them at all. You are only adding unnecessary pressure on them, which is counterproductive to what you wish for your children.

Readers, if you have parents who do this, **confront them immediately**. I‚Äôm dead serious on this, because if you have suffered mentally due to their constant comparison of grades, then it‚Äôs about time you get them to know about it. Don‚Äôt wait anymore. Stop reading this post. ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels is coming faster than you think. You wouldn‚Äôt want your parents (or anyone) to be part of why you crack under pressure. If they still behave that way, you need to tell another trusted adult (teacher, relatives, counsellor, etc.) about this.

If they still place pressure on you, just remember what is said in this post. There‚Äôs no use comparing yourself to others. So, just take a few deep breaths for the next scolding you get from your parents and continue. No point getting stressed over such competition.

**Challenging syllabus:**

Next, ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels is too challenging for some, so they are extremely stressed. I also understand how revising a huge number of chapters and excelling in examinations is considered difficult. I believe many who have taken ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels would agree that at one point during their journey, they felt like the syllabus was hard. However, I disagree that the high difficulty is a reason why one should stop studying hard.

If ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels is not hard, then it defeats the purpose of making students push beyond their boundaries. How can society create people who come out of the education system if they are not challenged to take on hardship?

For a moment, imagine that your Mathematics teacher walks in and announces that there is a surprise test. The class begins groaning and moaning as students separate their tables and take out a piece of foolscap paper. Even worse, the test is an hour long! However, the teacher then says that there is only one question, and it will be written on the whiteboard. Here is the question.

5x-8=27

Now, everyone is confused. ‚ÄúWe have one hour just to solve that question?‚Äù a student questioned. ‚ÄúYes,‚Äù the teacher replied. What is this, an insult of your intelligence? I believe even the worst in Mathematics will take 3 minutes maximum to figure this out (x=7). Now, that wasn‚Äôt very challenging, right?

The issue is if we do not increase the level difficulty from Primary School Leaving Examinations to ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels, students do not have the opportunity to exceed their limits. Do you know how detrimental it will be for future generations? Many have labelled those born after 2000 the ‚ÄúStrawberry Generation‚Äù likely because we had it easy financially since young compared to previous generations. We need to toughen the next few generations to bloom for the country‚Äôs economy. But other than for the nation's sake, you need to face the rigour of ‚ÄòO‚Äô Levels if you wish to compete in life. Studying is meant to be stressful. If not, people will not grow outside of their comfort zone. **Do you know what‚Äôs outside the comfort zone? The growth zone.** Start facing the pressure of studying for subjects, no matter how hard they seem to be initially. That will grow you to become a strong person with resilience. Family members, friends, jobseekers will love being with you.

‚ÄúBut Johnotcena, how do you explain the higher rates of depression and suicide among youths in Singapore? Isn‚Äôt the education system a factor in this conversation?‚Äù Yes, I concur to that point. But, **if you are stressed over results, do you blame the education system or take responsibility to de-stress**? Should parents blame game developers for their child‚Äôs gaming addiction? Is it the casino‚Äôs fault that people are compulsive gamblers? The answer to all of this is no. You decided to get hung up on these things. So quit blaming the government for your mental health. You take responsibility for it.

Find ways to de-stress, such as exercising. I will discuss this another day. The main takeaway from this is that **the education system is not at fault for people being mentally unsound**. It is a hard pill to swallow, but these victims have mental distortions which cause their brain to have such thoughts. They have to be responsible for them.

In conclusion, it‚Äôs more about what type of stress is right and how to cope with it. Hence, to quit studying just because of stress is wrong. Learn to embrace it instead.

Next, we‚Äôll uncover why studying hard to attain good grades is so important for you.

johnotcena,axktqi,[O Levels] (Studying While Staying Sane) #11 How to Stop Getting Distracted by your Devices (and Procrastination),2019-03-05 20:52:31,SGExams,77673,0,9,"It's funny how I was able to write this post only after installing an application to aid me to not have any online distractions. (If you want something to help you in not procrastinating on your essays or a script for a presentation, use Cold Turkey Writer). I was also occupied with games such as Persona 5 and Brawl Stars (urgh). But here you are, still reading this, showing that I did do my work.

&#x200B;

There are so many distractions in our phones and computers. Even if you get rid of Wi-fi Connection, you could still play that jumping game on Chrome (those were the days in Secondary 2) or play Solitaire on a computer (it is pre-installed, so you could easily play it, just as the ex-US president Theodore Roosevelt.) So, **how do we combat these?**

&#x200B;

Remember the one application I recommended to install in the post on physical and digital materials (#7)? Qualitytime. It can schedule breaks and block the applications which distract you.

&#x200B;

But not only that, I believe any blocking application can help. For example, **you can ask someone close to you (e.g. parent) to help you as your Accountability Partner (AP)**. If possible, create 2 different accounts on your desktop if you are addicted to it. One account has work-related stuff, while the other has all the distractions. Ask your AP to type a really long password for the account with all the distractions. Thus, it will require much more work to play. On the other hand, put no password for the work account and place all essential applications on the screen when you first enter. **You are trying to decrease the amount of willpower it takes to work and increase the amount of willpower to play.**

&#x200B;

Another way is to **place a reward-punishment system**. Promise with your AP that if you get distracted, you will do this punishment. It could be to record yourself doing 100 pushups at one go, eat your least favourite food or anything which will really kick you into not getting distracted. On the other side of the coin, promise a reward if you go for a period of time without getting distracted. It could be eating your favourite food, spending time outside with your friends, or your AP has to do a forfeit (this is where relationships are usually broken, but if both of you are cool with that, so be it).

&#x200B;

Example:

&#x200B;

Promise with Tze Kai (my older brother, not his actual name) that I will not play for more than 30 minutes a day when I promised to study during that period of time (if you want to know when you could have breaks, click on this post).

&#x200B;

Punishment: I will squirt mustard (least favourite condiment, just eww) into my mouth for 3 seconds and swallow it all before I could drink any liquid down if I failed three out of 7 days.

&#x200B;

Reward: I can sit on Tze Kai as he does 10 diamond pushups if I didn't fail at all for a week.

&#x200B;

Another way to defeat procrastination is to **remember what you are doing this for.** If you wish to study so that your parents' effort of raising you up does not go to waste, hang a picture of your family in front of where you study. If you hope to enter Raffles Institution, hang the school logo in front of you too. You could also hang 3-page exercise from #2 for motivation.

&#x200B;

It's also helpful to **imagine your leisure time with tons of unfinished activities, spoiling whatever pleasure you would be fully immersed in when you procrastinate.** Imagine that little thought at the back of the mind taking over your body as you are overcome with guilt.

&#x200B;

These are all possible options to not procrastinate. Take one or two to try today. I'm sure you would find some of them useful to avoid distractions. Just so you know, these techniques are all from the book **The Procrastination Equation**, which I recommend for students like us who struggle a lot in procrastination.

&#x200B;

Also, if you've been constantly reading my posts since the first one, that's awesome. **Give yourself a pat on the back.** If you haven't, then it's a good time right now to catch up to speed.

&#x200B;

Next, we'll try to understand how did I study for the subjects I took and why I couldn't score well for a few subjects. Please don't repeat my mistakes and you just might do better than me (L1R5 nett 6). This next post is definitely a huge chunk to take in.
