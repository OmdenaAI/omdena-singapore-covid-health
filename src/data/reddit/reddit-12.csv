titan-trifect,1568519755,d4fl3n,5,3,"Hi there guys! Fresh diploma grad in film that just finished NS, recently attended an interview for a normal office hours mon-fri admin position in an insurance agency.

To be honest because I don't like the jobs in my line of work, because of my negative experience during my school internship (Mostly doing work that didn't make me feel fulfilled or satisfied, crazy long hours / days that started or ended in the middle of the night at like 3/4am) and I know that even if I went to find a full time position in the same field it would be the same even if I'm not a intern, I like music, my passion is music, I have no knowledge in music theory but it's something I want to get into someday, be it producing music, a DJ, all that. Which is why I just want a normal mundane job while still being able to spend time with my family and friends, while earning the savings to go for classes for such things, purchase the gear and all that, but at the same time it feels too late to have found this outburst of ""I want to do this for my entire life!""

Now funny thing is, during the interview, the interviewer was really nice, not much older than me and could relate to some things that I explained to him, my passions, my difficulties towards following that passion and all, and kind of prodded that seems like money will be a thing for me. He recommended me the financial consultant / agent whatever you call it position. Pulled out entire documents on what I could possibly be paid with, sales targets, and all that, and offered to pull his manager in to fill in me on more details, he came in, super charismatic guy, had an interest in music as well, offered me to follow his instagram, he explained to me everything possible about and what is expected of a financial consultant, training, tests, job scope, how much I'll be earning. (He was saying 2.5k with all the bonuses, commissions and incentives adding up to at least 5k)

Now to me, of course I was interested in this, imagining myself earning so much to be able to support my family and to pursue what I love after, who wouldn't? If it weren't for a lot of things:

\-I'm a crazy introvert with social anxiety, even their personality test said so and I'm not surprised, I'm fine with meeting people face to face and putting on a smiley front, but it's really easy for me to read emotions / feel heavy amounts of guilt to be selling this kind of thing to a person if they are obviously not interested.

\-Meeting a sales target? According to their cumulative sales target, seems like i have to close out about 1-4 deals a month on average, small number but it seems insanely difficult nonetheless looking at other posts on this reddit. I don't have any social circle, a lot of my friends are my age or younger, we are all broke people, and I was the very person in my social circle to personally FUCK over any friends who do that ""Hi want to meet up for coffee"" bullshit, so if I were pressured to do the same, I would say a big fat hell NO.

\-They said with my personality I could start with telemarketing, before moving on to the typical mrt side or roadshows, and again I was the very same person that absolutely dead set ignored these people, so again it's really ironic if I ever take this job... And I could also never shake off the guilt of trying to sell one of these things to someone, I know I can be genuine, I definitely want to help if needed too and if I ever actually do sales I want to sell something and feel like I actually connected with the person over the product and genuinely helped the person, not pressurising or selling some sob story to just get the job done. I'm emotionally sensitive and I would probably switch off if I really get rejected too much. I'm also the person that you will never hear ""We're not trying to sell you anything"" out of my mouth, I still don't know why people still pressure people with that line, like what the fuck agents it's 2019, do better.

So all in all, my situation right now is that I'm going to call in to the place on Monday to say no to the agent job but still would like the admin job, coming up with some polite excuse like ""I really don't think I'm ready for this big change and would like to take some time, but if I'm ever interested in the future again I will let you know."" But at the same time, it feels like manager will try to convince and sway me again considering we have the same interests and he was really connecting with me, (which at this point I don't know whether he was being genuine or just using his agent personality front).

Thank you guys for reading, just had to get this out of my chest, and would personally prefer advice on what direction I should really take from here, it really feels like I'm stuck in a spot and I'm getting pestered daily by my parents on ""So when are you starting work?"" already.",askSingapore,4222,Job advice?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/d4fl3n/job_advice/,,"[""I can see you are very conflicted with your personality vs job requirement. \n\nThe main role of that hiring agent is of course to hire you, he will pursue tactics to achieve that goal - do not be swayed by the sweet talk and potential earnings, key word is potential. Sales is a very tough job that requires a lot of networking, competition is cuttthroat too; not everyone can do sales.\n\nNow, my personal belief is that you should grind through the entry-level job of what you are already skilled in. Reason being you can command a higher starting salary, career progression will be smooth and guaranteed and that you will not be working in the same internship company. In the future, 1-2 years, you can hop jobs and slowly start to make your way out of the industry.\n\nThe government and several organisations have some programmes for you such as Earn and Learn by Skillsfuture, TodoTodo by YoungNTUC and various under e2i or WSG. You can also enquire your diploma's course manager to refer you a job, they will help you."", ""I skipped a lot of the stuff about working in insurance, because I just really wanted to ask you this: why would any other job prohibit you from continuing your passion in your free time? It sounds like you're really not keen on a sales oriented position based on your description of being an introvert, so why force yourself? I work in tech and I have a colleague (software developer) who is also really into music, and he spends his free time mixing music and occasionally playing a gig or two somewhere. I don't think being an insurance agent is the only way you're going to get the work/life/money balance that you're looking for... \n\nWhich brings me to my next point - I don't work in the field but I don't think insurance agents make as much as the hiring person seems to claim. I think more typically insurance agents with very little contacts and stand around at roadshows/do cold calling tend to get very little returns, and it's the type who have a large, established contacts list that tend to do better. The alternative is being willing to spend every other waking minute of your time working on bringing in sales and hustle like hell. So you end up with the conundrum of trying to make more money but have less time, or have more time but less money."", 'As much as I like my field of study (Not much to be very frank), I don\'t really like the work atmosphere in those workplaces because even everyone is supposed to work in a team there are still politics and people still pit against each other for some reason and it makes me go ""Huh?"" at it, which is why I was searching for normal office jobs where everyone just has their own set of things to do and I couldnt be caring less about the other agents competing against each other.\n\nI have a very bad balance when it comes to interviewers that throw me the expected salary question out of nowhere, where it seems that I tend calculate every nitty gritty of what affects the numbers, like :\n\n-My work personality\n-My portfolio\n-How big the company is in compared to how much I value my own self worth to be if I work in the company\n-Slight guilt to seem confident to be asking for a higher number \n\nThank you for the recommendations on the programmes, will look into them and see how I can expand myself further definitely.', ""The manager did mention that to me, that I should be prepared to spend my dinner time to be out there meeting potential cilents and people rather than going home to my mum's good homecooked food :'( \n\nI think the reason why I don't see myself pursuing my passion as much in another job is because its also gear dependant in a way, I see myself giving alot of my pay and savings back to my mum, and calculatively using the rest to survive for the rest of the month, and it seems that if I do invest in the gear that all the rest of my savings will be gone and me working hard all this while will have been for naught if the music thing doesn't work out, but that should just push me to work even harder... right?"", 'Gonna start off by saying that I don\'t know what direction you should take, and that it\'s okay even if you don\'t either. You\'re still young, you have the chance to change your line of work. I know it may sound tough, and it does get tougher the older you get, but you\'re a poly grad with many chances yet.  \n\nI\'d just like to suggest that you don\'t jump into insurance sales. The turnover rate is insanely high for a reason; because the job is tough. The constant rejection can break the strongest of spirits. You\'ll have to be passionate about it, and be ready to receive looks of disdain all day long, even if you do have the best of intentions, people will more than likely not believe you. And because of the high turnover rate, the recruiters are always looking for new blood to fill in the spaces, and their prime target: fresh grads, especially those who can\'t find a job, or are lost. I was in a similar situation. \n\nI graduated from uni, but after being unable to find a job for so long, I was getting increasingly desperate. I broadened my choices, and tried for a data analyst position at an insurance company. They gathered a whooooole bunch of us who were looking for non-insurance agent roles, and first thing they did was give a talk about how lucrative sales could be. Look, you could earn $\\_k per month, and since you continue to get payouts down the road once you sign someone up, you earn more and more and it snowballs!! You\'ll earn even MORE if you get some juniors to sign up, part of what they earn will be yours, too! Look, fancy cars, fancy vacations, work at your own pace!! We\'re all one big family here, your seniors will always be there to help you! Alright, now we\'re going to give you this super accurate test that will tell us what kind of person you are and what role you\'re suited for. Trust us, this is the most accurate test in the world, it\'ll tell you everything you know and also don\'t know about yourself yet; this will be an eyeopener like never before! And if the tests show that you\'re better off in admin work, we\'ll put you there! \n\nI\'m not sure if it sounds familiar to you, but it doesn\'t matter what results you get on the quiz. If you answered accurately, it\'ll tell you the truth, that in your case, you\'re an introvert with social anxiety (I had the same result). But it doesn\'t matter, it\'s their job to convince you that you are, in fact, greatly suited for sales. They\'ll say that perhaps you want an admin job... But give this a try! If it doesn\'t work out, they\'ll recommend you for the job you signed up for. They\'ll have stories of those with personalities like you that had great success in sales because they trusted the test. The recruiters sound charming and charismatic, they understand you... Because they\'ve seen the lost fresh grad countless times. They\'ll basically hang onto anything whatsoever that can make you feel welcome, hobbies or life experiences or anything at all, to entice you to join, even if they have to spew the most beautiful tales of success stories and relatability. \n\nNow, I\'m not saying that they don\'t actually understand what you feel. But I just hope you\'ll take their words with a mountain of salt. Being charismatic is their job. It\'s possible to excel in such a role but you\'re going to have to be the top 5% (arbitrary number here). Also, just to let you know, you\'ll need to pass a series of exams to do insurance sales. Don\'t expect them to pay for you. In my case, they paid for me first, then demanded the money later because they already booked the tests, and I passed over my savings in tears, made to study and then take the exams that I didn\'t want for a job I didn\'t ask for. Protip: They are highly unlikely to give you another role. The instant I passed, the seniors were like ""Congratulations!! We knew you could do it, so proud of you. See, you can trust us,"" and when I insisted that I\'d much prefer a non-sales role, they vanished off the face of the planet. Radio silence. Goodbye to my exam money too. \n\nSorry for the long reply. I\'m not sure how useful it\'ll be either, since it\'s just my experience. Personally, after the insurance fiasco I had, I continued looking for a job that suited my needs, and I found one that, while I was unsure of, became the job I\'ve had for the past 3 years, that I... I can\'t say ""love"", but am alright with. I know that if I had forced myself into the insurance sales role, I would not have been happy. So my advice... Is to be firm that you do NOT want sales. If they really give you a chance at the job you initially asked for, great! If they drop you like a hot potato, also great, just leave it behind. Don\'t be pressured into doing what you don\'t want to do. And even if you don\'t know what else to do with your life, you can take it step by step. Further your studies if can, a degree is important (whether useful or not is another thing, but it\'ll get you into a higher position with better pay most of the time). \n\nI wish you the best of luck.']"

Background: A Levels -&gt; NUS Nursing, am a girl. No exp in the military hence seeking help from you guys out there. I am interested in combat medicine and trauma medicine, but I only have a nursing degree. Thinking of pursuing a military career (medical side, saf medical corps?) if I don't fancy being a civilian nurse in the govt sector.

Any recommendations on why/why not to pursue military career, and any drawbacks or setbacks for my degree? 

What would there be any diff if I go into the military sector with a postgrad MD in medicine instead?

roses_are_rosie_,1564750802,cl3slz,13,8,"Hi. I'm an NYP student, y1s1, under the course of IT. I'm starting to lose interest with school because it's a heavily programming course which I have no desires to keep on going. Took a programming course for 4 yrs in ITE, went thru JPAE, and got myself here. 

During JPAE period, I was planning to get into a different course but at that point of time, I was desperate to get into Poly so I just chose any of the IT courses that I felt beneficial for my future. Weeks and months past, obstacles start to kick in and I kept convincing myself I could get thru it.

It has been on going for 3 months and I'm about to lose myself. I stayed up, to do tutorials, practicals, finishing up individual and group projects. 

Now, I've developed anxiety and depression. Anxious of not being able to do well despite the amount of efforts being put inside, anxious of socialising with classmates who have more potentials to do well in class and are lowkey looking down on me, depressed that I'm a slow learner. I'm still trying to adapt to Poly's fast paced up until now. Talked about my problems to an ECG counsellor, PEM, friends and family but all thought that I'm just plainly whining and make a big deal out of it, which no one genuinely understand what I'm going thru is not easy.

Everyone only asked me to focus in class and work hard, but didn't really guide me to gain back my interest for programming. It's like I'm forcing myself to work hard with no definite purpose.

Hi everyone. Forgive my ignorance and lack of research---I've been looking on the internet for the best place to live given our circumstances, but am overwhelmed with the info + figured info from locals would be much better.

Me and my significant other are two 24 year old law students studying at NUS Faculty of Law August-December 2019 (different campus than normal NUS-the law is northern part of Botanic Gardens).

* We're trying to live somewhere that is the most ""young,"" if that makes sense. Just a neighborhood with food, etc around would be great. We're not picky about there being too much noise, etc.
* We're not tied to living next to school, but also want to live in a neighborhood that is accessible to the school
* We're wiling to spend up to 4,000 Singapore dollar a month (3,000 usd) for a studio/one bedroom. (is this doable?)

t_rcs,1551690942,ax55vt,8,1,"I'm at that age where everybody starts to drink, and so I have so many friends who go out and go crazy at parties. They bring alcohol to parties (although majority of the time they're the cheap kind,,...) and proudly display it when taking photos at, for example, birthday photobooths. They're obsessed with playing 'drinking games'. Many friends have tried to brag to me about how much they drink; how much of an 'alcoholic' they are, saying things like 'oh, I was *so* drunk last night, i can't remember *anything*.' I know half (or more of) the time they are just exaggerating. Drinking straight from bottles that are clearly communal (e.g. Bailey's, Absolut Vodka) just to signal to other people how 'tolerant' they are (what I assume they're trying to do by doing so)? Disgusting, unrefined, inconsiderate....

I don't know why, but personally I find it unclassy, distasteful, thoughtless, meaningless. To me it just comes across as reckless and that my friends lack self-control and to some extent, even dignity and self-respect. At this point my friends aren't so reckless such that they drink then do freaky shit like make out with people or have sex or that kind of stuff (THANKFULLY) but still: this is only just the beginning, imagine what it could escalate to. Anyway, just to add on a little bit, I think alcohol is generally a waste of money &amp; burns a pretty huge whole in one's pocket. And it tastes like shit half the time too (tried grape soju the other day, tastes like cough medicine tbh. in that case i should just stock up on cough medicine......of course my friends disagreed but how can they not be lying. who willingly drinks cough medicine unless it's pi pa gao lmao) .

Personally &amp; preferably if I were drinking alcohol I'd do it while enjoying a nice, refined meal. Like red wine with steak. At a nice sit-down restaurant dinner/dinner party with friends rather than.......whatever parties my friends are attending and holding. Well, I guess it's just me &amp; a small handful of friends who share this sentiment. The rest want to drink, or maybe just want to look cool or something, I don't know. I don't get the appeal.

These ex-friends  stay out till 4am everyday drinking and smoking, and because of their lifestyle choice, they ended up screwing up their academics. \n\nThey’ll probably only learn their lesson when they’re older.

Valkeri,1550720686,asyab4,7,7," Hi All,

I was hoping there are some experts around here on this topic. Of course I have done some prior googling, however many threads are old, or do not apply directly to my situation.

I have been offered a place at UCL medicine, and am currently applying to NUS medicine. I'm considering, in advance, what I should do if I get an offer from NUS as well, but I've hit a dead end.

&amp;#x200B;

Some context:

QS UCL = 10th in the world, NUS = 31st in the world

Times Higher Education UCL = 8th in the world, NUS = 26th in the world

Take these rankings with a pinch of salt, as always.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm trying to weigh up the benefits of staying back in Singapore, the one that's most convincing to me being that I've heard it's easier to get into residency in Singapore with an NUS degree than an 'overseas' degree. **(1)** My question is this; the statement is very unspecific, and it could range from ""you have a disadvantage in Singapore coming back from Bob's Medical university in Dimwitshire, UK"", to ""you studied at Oxford? I'm taking this NUS student for specialisation instead"". Of course I understand that there's many other factors that affect whether you can get into a residency or not - such as performance at school, with the department and your peer-reviews et cetera, but I'm wondering if, for example, you had a model student from UCL and a model student from NUS, would the student from UCL - it being a very renowned and famous school - be at an inherent disadvantage? I'm a male who will be finishing his NS, so no disadvantage there. **(2)** I'm keen, at the moment, on neurosurg; the UCL MBBS integrates a BSc, so I'll graduate with an MBBS BSc (Neuroscience), for example. Does this add anything to my CV in terms of getting into residency here in Singapore?

We can, with some difficulty, afford UCL, but of course NUS is better on the cost front. I will be looking at the PEG from the government to cover 150k. **(3)** Does anyone have input in terms of student life in NUS? How would this compare to UCL? Is an NUS med student, on average, going to outperform a UCL med student in terms of knowledge? **(4)** I'm also wondering how difficult it is to build a rapport here in Singapore. I'm submitting a paper which I worked on with a neurosurgeon to the SMJ at some point this year, but how difficult is it to build upon this and continue this in the future? If I'm at UCL, how challenging is it to get a reference from a doctor/professor there to come back to Singapore on the holidays to work on publications and my CV locally? After all, I intend to come back to work for MOH, as I like Singapore and its people - it's the place I want to dedicate my life's work to, I suppose. I very much hope to become a clinician-educator, or scientist, so I can contribute to the academic field here.

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry for the lengthy post. I was just hoping that there's some doctors out there with experience with NUS and UCL students, and what my prospects are coming back here after overseas studies, compared to NUS studies, especially with my, admittedly, rather-too-lofty aspirations. I'm just a bit afraid that I'll be stigmatised coming back, with people saying that ""he couldn't study at NUS, so he went overseas to UCL""... As I said, not even sure if I can get into NUS, but if I do I'd be tearing myself apart over the choice!

uhhhh12345,1546847558,adfijp,26,1,"Hi all

I’ve posted this on r/AmItheAsshole previously but I guess I could get more advice here considering the cultural background here that we as Singaporeans are able to understand better and the stigma of “abandoning” your parents. Not searching for any validation of my actions but more of wanting to find out how to deal with this situation better.

Here goes my story:

I’ve been raised by my real birth mom since young, and my entire memory of her is just being beaten and scolded throughout my childhood. She hasn’t worked a single day ever since I was born, my dad is the sole breadwinner of my family and therefore didn’t spend a lot of time at home. So my mom just spends most of the time at home doing household chores and complaining about the fact that no one cares about her. She is also an alcoholic with depression.

I remember as a child I always woke up in tears as she would verbally and physically abuse me on a daily basis from the time I wake up till I leave the house for school or some other activity. She often called me useless and said things like she wished that I had never been born, etc. Other than being well supported by my father financially, I really don’t think I was raised with love and nurtured well as a child. But that’s fine by me, I told myself that once I am self-sufficient I will be able to move out and lead my own life.

On the other hand, I have a very caring Godmother (my dad’s older sister aka my aunt) who is single and has no children of her own. So she treated me like her own, bringing me on holidays with her, gave me extra money and gifts for special occasions. But the most important part wasn’t just all these, she supported me through my childhood giving me advice in life and whenever I faced problems. She was the one who guided me on the right path as she knew that I wasn’t receiving all of these from my parents. Thanks to her, I prioritised my studies and made it through university.

Fast forward to present day, I am a working adult in my late 20s. I have also gotten married and shifted out from my parent’s home. Naturally I don’t see my mom as much and conflicts have been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, we try to get together as a family on special occasions like birthdays or Mother’s Day, etc. On those days that I do see her, she gives me regular shit as well.

Lately I realised that no matter what I do to make her happy, she doesn’t appreciate nor reciprocate. Do bear in mind that I have tried very hard to make amends and communicate with my mother to improve our relations and while I do admit that she does get better at times, every few months she lashes back out at me and makes me feel like any improvement she has tried to make are all fake and deep inside she still hates me. Every time such an episode happens it affects me on a very deep level and I get emotionally affected for days and weeks.

Now I do not make any more effort to visit her, I intend to only meet up with my dad separately to pass allowances and continue to treat my godmom as my real mother. I introduce my godmom as my mom to outsiders because that’s how I genuinely feel and I am grateful for how she has raised me up to what I am today. Many people who do not know my story has pointed out that I should continue to try harder with my mom as afterall, she is my real mother.

However, I feel that I no longer have any capacity to try harder. Whatever extra time or money I have, I would very much prefer to spend it on my godmother or my father instead. If I were to give it to my mom, I can’t help but feel like I am shortchanging the people who really did care for me in the past and present.

I have chosen this path as I am tired of this toxic relationship and all the negativity and emotional blackmail that ensue just from dealing with my mother.

However, just know that despite all the hate she have shown you she did have you for 9 months and you are here reading this.\n\nThe Chinese saying that in this world only mothers are the best, is not wrong I believe. To villains they are the hero in their own story. She might have loved you in another way but we will never know. We are very similar because I too have an aunt that treated me like her own kid and was the nicest to me. I am lucky to have met some people in my life to enlighten me. \n\nAt one point of my life I too wanted to ""change"" my parents but the very same people that treated me well reminded me that love comes in many different form. I do hope the best for you and your family regardless of your decision to disown your mother or to give her one last chance. ', 'Sadly, my answer for 1 is a no, and for 2 I really can’t give a definite answer now. Walking away is not only for my own mental well being but also might be better for her since she doesn’t have to face her “useless” child anymore. ', 'That’s something I have lived by and I have no second thoughts about removing toxic people from my life. But when it gets a bit more tricky when the subject in question is your own parent. ', 'Thank you for sharing, good luck on your healing journey, which I’m going to embark on myself now. I hope you’re in a much better place from where you left of. ', 'That’s what I intend to do as well. Thank you for your advice. ', 'Hi there, thank you for taking the time to share your experiences and advice.  \n\nThere has always been one thing that I cannot understand which is, despite all the bad memories of childhood, I will never wish the same treatment upon anyone else, much less my own child. Yes my mom has often lamented her difficult childhood but things have gotten a lot better ever since she married my dad who is from a well to do family. Since then she never had to worry about finances and never had to work, I can say she is leading a very comfortable life. \n\nTrust me when I said that I’ve given more than plenty of chances to make it work. No doubt she is the one who brought me into the world, more often than not I wished that she hadn’t if the world I was brought into is full of misery and reproach from her. \n\nI guess you’re a much more resilient and mature person than me in dealing with this situation. I have much to learn from you. Thank you for the advice to a stranger over here. I hope one day I will be able to truly able to accept her and her actions just like you did with your father.\n', 'Even if you would regret it right now, you may not after healing yourself emotionally through through therapy or otherwise. \n\nIn any case, good job cutting toxic people out of your life. However, your inner child will need to mourn and grieve the realization/acceptance that your mum would never be the nurturing and loving person that you have always hoped for ', ""Acceptance is a key step to healing. However it doesn't mean you need to forgive or condone future actions on her part.\n\nFor example, you can accept that she had an abusive childhood which probably influenced her actions and so you don't hate her for that. That doesn't mean you need to forgive her or be ready to start a relationship from a blank slate. \n\nIf she continues to behave that way you should just disconnect and cut her out like you are doing. If I were you I probably wouldn't even send her money unless the police were going to clamp down on me for Maintenance of Parents. "", 'I think at this point I’ve already looked beyond that. I have a mom all along, she just wasn’t the one who gave birth to me.', 'You’re right. For the money part I’m actually giving it to my dad. I see it as my duty, after all he was the one putting food on the table. Whether or not he wants to pass it on to my mom that’s no longer within my control and not my concern. ', 'Stay strong! At least you have family to depend on. I cut off all ties from my entire immediate family 😅', 'I’m sorry to hear that. The negativity from them must have been so overwhelming that pushed you to make such a decision. I truly hope you have found peace and strength.', ""Damn now you got me teary eyed reading this. I was in a similar situation like 4 years ago, left the toxic environment without looking back. Best decision I ever made, but sometimes some wounds go too deep to heal. Family can be a curse or a gift and I'm sorry you are down that road too. How are you the asshole for choosing happiness and positivity? Do you, you don't owe anyone anything. Hit me up if you wanna chat more. Sending positive vibes your way. "", 'If you feel that you have already done what you can to save your relationship with your mother and if she still does not care, then I think that you should walk away. \n\nIt takes 2 hands to clap and your mom might not want to be the second hand. Some parents are just like that. They have a mind that nobody can ever understand. Not sure of why your dad would ever fall for such a difficult person who obviously has anger management issues and has no idea how to be contented and how to care for her son. Not to mention that as a house wife, she is already so ""stressed"" that she has been torments you for a regular basis. Did you tell your dad about this while growing up and did he do anything about it? \n\n If what you say is true, then it is not your fault. As person who is like this for long time is bound to never change. Take this as what your mom wants and not what you want. \n\nCutting ties might also be good as by doing so, her grandchildren and daughter/son in law might not have to go through the same abuse you went through. \n\nOf course if I were you and if she ever somehow has a serious problem , medically of financially and needs your help, I would probably somehow help her as she is still my mother and I cannot possibly her to the extent that I would leave her destitute. ', 'Thank you so much. I’m sorry to hear about your situation as well but I guess we can both take comfort in the fact that a random stranger on the internet is able to fully empathise with this sad situation and that you’re not alone amidst all the negativity.', 'Hello, about my dad, he has developed this amazing coping mechanism throughout the years. I’ve seen him changed from someone who tried so hard and from what I know now he has another family out there, it’s an open secret and clearly no one else is blaming him for it. I fully support his decision and I’m just grateful for him still providing for our side of the family financially. \n\nI forgot to mention I have 2 other siblings. One is clearly the “golden child” who can do no wrong in my mother’s eyes and the other one is not living with us since birth. I am a female just for clearer context and the other 2 are boys. I’ve read up a bit on the narcissist parent and our family fits exactly into the narrative of the Golden Child, Scapegoat Child and the Lost Child. Clearly I am the scapegoat child. \n\nMy dad is aware of my mom’s treatment towards me and I can tell that he has also been trying to make it up to me in many other ways, which she never fails to bring up and make snide remarks about. \n\nI won’t be broadcasting to the whole world that hey this person is no longer my mom but I will start to walk away from this hell of a toxic relationship. Slowly but surely I will be able to be at peace one day. Thanks for your kind advice. ', 'No problem. Issues like this are always one of the most difficult problems we can possibly face as making the wrong decision can become a lifetime of pain and misery. Its good that your dad still supports you all emotionally and financially as well. Hoping that more fathers can be as helpful as your dad and not simply walk out on their own families. \n\nYour mom is certainly the very ""traditional "" type , only favouring the son more than the daughter. No idea why would people in this age still live with such a stupid mentality. Even so, the ""Golden child"" might also end up biting the hand that feeds them. There have been cases of the ""golden child"" taking their parent\'s $$ and abondoning them after that. Whats worse is that the mother especially would see nothing wrong with that and still continue to favour him. ', 'You’re not an ahole, if that’s what you’re asking. I agree that you have to keep yourself sane.\n\nIf there had been no reason for my mom to be treating me like that (childhood experience herself, maybe neglected, etc), and I’ve exhausted all my efforts to make amends, I would also distance myself. But probably not completely cut off my ties. I would still pay a visit once in a while, only on a frequency that is comfortable to me. She’s my mom after all.\n\nSorry to be negative about it but I think I wouldn’t entirely be angry just with my mom. Had my father known that his wife was going through depression, I think he should have done something about it and not just have stayed by the sidelines, providing financially. Raising a child, in this case taking care of a family, is also his reponsibility.', 'You have an answer for yourself. So stick to it... And seek your own happiness', ""If you see your friend beating up their child, throwing punches left and right, you'd call the police and never talk to again.\n\nSo why is it okay for you to talk to your mother who is an abuser your whole life?"", 'Thanks, I’ve decided to do just this and the past month has really been the best time of my life. No regrets.']"
akujerome,1561440448,c53599,11,23,"Hi red-dottors,

I am quite passionate about the arts and social sciences, particularly philosophy and economics. However, being in fast-paced and practical Singapore, I find that many know close to nothing about those studies -- a real pity!!

2. If yes, whats your reason to denounce faith/what's the trigger point if any?

3. Have you come out to your family?

4. How does your family view it/extended family

Would wanna know your answers too', 'I applaud you guys for it. Am non-malay, and non religious too.', 'So was I, I think there\'s a huge majority of non-practicing muslim malays that would still put ""Muslim"" in a survey.', 'Were you born into a religious family?', 'Yes, born a christian, went to various different churches throughout my childhood and teens. \n\nI honestly think society is better off without religion.', 'Alright sure.\n\n1. Yes born into a relatively conservative Muslim family. Not super conservative, I have cousins whose households are far more religious.\n\n2. Started slowly doubting since I was 13 I think? I had this thinking that the best way to believe in something is to find all evidence to disprove it, if you still believe in it then your belief is even stronger. So I started reading up on other religions/atheism. I was still a Muslim until about 16. I had a gf who was very devout Christian. She brought me to church and I started getting into Christianity. It was also the first time I openly became non Muslim, before that I was private. The relationship ended and I still tried to learn more about Christianity. I had a lot of close Christian friends. That combined with how much the faith helped me out of a dark situation almost led me to stick to Christianity. Ever since then I\'ve since stuck to being a freethinker. Definitely not an atheist though I\'m not rejecting faith entirely as of yet. Im still giving Islam an equal shot. I listen to sermons and I read the Quran but as of now I\'m thoroughly unconvinced. \n\n3. Nope. My family is totally liberal on a million things. Theyd be fine with me smoking or going to bars or watching movies about homosexuality or having a non-muslim gf (they knew about the Christian one and were fine with it). But the one thing they\'ve told time and time again is to make sure my faith is strong. So... I plan to tell them when I move out. But then I\'d only be moving out when I\'m getting married and by then it should be clear to them what my stance is so I really have no idea what to do there. Cross that bridge when I get there I guess. My sister might know that I\'m a non believer. We had a conversation about how she thinks I\'ll probably only have a civil marriage and not a religious one. I remember the conversation ending with ""what will mom think"" and neither of us having an answer.\n\n4. I don\'t know really. They know I have liberal views on things like gay rights or acceptable women\'s clothing (basically no hijab or anything showing skin) and I think they\'re kinda suspicious about why I have Christian songs on my playlist. We don\'t talk about it. They wouldnt disown me I\'m sure but I think they\'d lose all trust in me. They\'d probably start forcing me to go to religious classes, never let me have a non-muslim gf things like that. My extended family probably wouldn\'t care too much. I\'m very distant from my aunts and uncles. It\'s a very contained family.\n\n5. Not that I can think of. I don\'t have many Malay friends and the ones that I do have don\'t know I\'m not muslim so I guess no judgement from friends really. The rest of my friends are Chinese in general they don\'t really care. Actually, I did have a Malay secondary school teacher that was mildly upset I wasn\'t going to Friday prayers but it wasnt really her place to say anything so she didn\'t. \n\n6. Firstly coming out to my parents. Not for consequenxes on me but on the emotional impact. My mom will be devastated. In her mind, I\'m going to hell and how can a mother live with that thought on her own child? Ideally I\'d hope to never let them know so they can at least die with a peaceful heart. But that\'s unlikely and id like for them to live long. \nSecondly, finding a partner. Despite being non religious, I still have some Islamic values. I don\'t drink by choice, ever. It\'ll be hard to find a partner with similar values but also isn\'t religious. Especially if they\'re Malay. My track record isn\'t good either I\'ve only have Christian gfs so far.\nThirdly, things like Hari Raya or anything involving extended family. I want my future kids to experience the joys of a big family. I really hope I dont get cut off from my family if I do come out. I\'m sure my kids might get judged during Raya visiting. I don\'t want to burden that with them just cause their dad chose to not be Muslim before they were even born. That\'s not fair to them.\n\n7. I don\'t have a community. I feel foreign during Hari Raya visits and talks about god. I feel foreign going drinking with friends and them not understanding why I don\'t drink. I feel foreign with my conservative friends who share the same tendencies I do but don\'t understand why I don\'t believe in a god (as of now). It\'s really hard to identify fully with anyone. I\'m a subset of a lot of different peoples beliefs.', ""Damn, I hope it wasn't too hard. But I have to disagree. I'm not religious but I think religion is a beautiful thing."", 'yeah i know quite a number of them. most of them are “closeted” ie they hide it from their parents, still pretend to pray, etc because they still live at home so don’t rly have a choice if they don’t want to get kicked out.', ""Wow that's tough... thanks for sharing. Do you think it might be particularly hard for females since they might feel a need to don the hijab even if they aren't religious? (Not Muslim myself but just wondering.) \n\nAlso, not many people who come from religious backgrounds feel the need to examine their faith, and less so other faiths. I applaud you!"", ""Hey thanks man, I think it's the duty of anyone invested in their faith to do a double check. \n\nI guess it depends on the family. An increasing number of families find wearing hijabs out optional. But yeah I guess for females if you become non Muslim you kinda have to come out to everyone or else hide it pretty much. :/"", 'Beautiful in what sense? Sure it has networking/community purposes.\n\nBut religion requires blind faith, believing without evidence. It is a good tool to mind control lazy people who do not bother to think critically.\n\nThe late Mr Lee Kuan Yew was not religious either.', ""Beautiful in that it gives people a lot of hope. I've seen people hanging to life by a thread and only their faith saved them. I don't agree with their beliefs but I'm really glad they believe them. \n\nI think astrology and star signs are really dumb. But if it gives someone a lot of hope and comfort then I think by all means let them believe it.\n\n careful with what you believe in. Your believing so strongly in atheism is also creating an us vs them mentality. You sound just as bigoted against those who are religious.\n\nAlso not so simple to say religion is holding us back. Remember Islam in it's golden age invented many things all mostly motivated in the name of God. \n\nI don't think you're wrong I just think it doesn't matter. Even if you're completely right, the advancement of man doesn't equate to our happiness. If it did then we could measurably see our happiness improve year after year. Just love the people around you and don't be bitter to those who are devoutly religious"", 'False hope you mean? \n\nAtheism/agnosticism isn’t a belief, it’s a lack of belief due to lack of evidence. I can not be absolutely certain there is no god, but by logical reasoning, I am not convinced that god exists, and am 99.9% certain about it.\n\nYou’ll have to support your claims with evidence that the golden age of islam resulted in many inventions. \n\nReligion is 100% holding us back. People go to war over religion. And war results in many inventions so there might be some truth to your claim :p\n\nAdvancement does improve happiness, better technological advancements leading to better quality of life, better treatment/cure of illness. \n\nReligion is a psychological prison for many because they think they’ll go to hell if they do not worship and obey an imaginary man in the sky.', ""I'm not continuing this argument further because I don't think either of us can convince either of anything."", 'The thing is you do not have an argument 😆✌🏻 Peace out.']"

**That extraordinary yet typical girl who loves bbt and steamboat!**

To my lost老朋友 (old friend for which I used to call you), to one of my closest female friends I ever had, and to the one that will never get to read this!



Before I begin, I promise to be interesting and keep it short.

It’s been a long while for me to decide to write about this. 6 months to be exact! Especially when I’m so baffled the time that has lapsed far exceeds the time when we were much closer friends.

It wasn’t exactly that I’d not written them (the feelings and thoughts) before over the past 6 months. 

Just that they were all in point forms, in a complete mess, a colloid of different languages, full of philosophies and analogies that I’ve proudly given birth to. 

**All written and to be deleted, deleted to be retrieved, and then to be re-written all over again and only to be deleted again.** 

I wrote this instinctively but with no intentions of returning to square one. Just that, I’ve shut out my thoughts for way too long. Also, it is important for me to safekeep them now while converting them to many useful lessons in the process.

**I want nothing more than to preserve every memory and every morsel of knowledge and lesson learnt before they all expire and turn into nothing else but ashes.** 

But really everything is alright now and will ever be 😊 All these episodes are now behind. Just exactly like how I’d love things to work out, it takes time! Hence, the delay in my writings. 

 

Long story short, we knew each other before entering the same university.

**One day, you confided your breakup story to me**.

I knew you were not coping well. Honestly, we weren’t exactly the closest friends to begin with.

But the entire incident had brought us so much closer from where we initially were, and only to be buried down to a level, lower than any strangers you’ll ever see on the streets in the end.

 

**As I said, we weren’t exactly very close friends to begin with. But;**

Close enough to be a counsellor to be genuinely concern to hear you out, close enough to be a detective to help you investigate what went wrong with your previous relationship, close enough to be a surgeon wanting to patch things up for you, close enough to be a pillar to support on you, close enough to be a cheerleader to encourage and cheer for you.

Close enough to be like a brother to really want you to be happy and still lead a normal life you absolutely deserved, close enough to be like a guard to stand by your side when you needed validation, close enough to be a magician to be always available whenever summoned, close enough to put my words into actions. 

 

**Also close enough for you to turn me into an absolute joke at the end of the day!**

We never officially dated. To be extremely fair to me, unlike other guys, I daresay I had absolutely zero intentions to hit on you, negative interest in chasing you and no ulterior motives at all.

Everything is just simply friendship and like what I’d told you before, I would do the same to any friends out there, not just exclusively to you!

But the time we spent with each other and meeting ups were solid proves and evidences as they were quantitatively large enough to be considered that our friendship was merely not limited to simply very good friends or in simpler terms; when the idea of excessive meeting ups come into picture.

**To be exact, I believed we’d crossed the boundaries that any close friends’ relationship should have rightfully maintained.** 

**For that, I couldn’t bear to hold you full responsible for anything and I could only hate myself for allowing it to happen.**

To just illustrate the key series of events we shared:

 

*From intentionally registering a sport with the interest of distracting your state of mind, to accompanying you to attend because you were alone. To texting me every single day and night till wee hours with your cries and sorrows for which I deemed you worthy enough to wake up and reply within a split second with zero complaints. To thinking of ways to make your days better during your darkest time. To waking up at ungodly hours just so to accompany you to exercise before your work. To going on food hunts multiple times a week where we shared a long list of food (only to be left unconquered in the end.) To complaining to me how annoying the random guys were who tried to hit on you and how you wish they would vanished and you, the one whom told me I’m different from them. You, the only one whom I allowed to gain access to my IG as it brings joy to you hacking my account and, I’d no privacy to hide. You, the one whom I will always remember all the brands, specifications and additional request of all food and drinks you love. You, the one whom we will share our supplies of bed time stories about cool and interesting stuff every day. You, the one who complains to me about how naggy your mum was. You, the one whom I could discuss how well the lyrics of all the love songs were written. You, the one whom we could discuss how unbelievably attractive and talented Jay Chou is. You, the one whom we could share our respect and love for the quality content created by Butterworks and Thesmartlocal. You, the one who was so generous in spreading your positivity, kindness and sincerity to the people around. You, the one whom we would give each other surprises with our foodpandas and honestbees. You, the one whom requested me to do silly stuff such as singing songs just to cheer you up. You, also the one whom I could open myself up, share indistinguishable conversations with and spoken to more than anyone I’d known combined. You, also the one whom I believe have known me at greater depth than the people that have known me for years.* ***Lastly, You the one whom told me “Don’t be so nice to you. You’re afraid you would unintentionally develop feelings for me for which it is very wrong to do so.”***    

 

***And towards the end of 2018, your “last” words to me were: “Thank you for everything you’d done for me. I really appreciate them a lot!”***

Thereafter, in the beginning of the 2019, everything would begin to turn south towards the end. You would be so busy with your work, cutting me off from everything, replies were so much longer than it used to be, progressively morphing me into a cold distance and slowly turning us into strangers.

 

Back then and even till now, I’d no expectations in anything; expectations in the form of asking for a r/s, expectations in the form of replies, expectations in the form of meeting ups, expectations in the form of many things. 

**NO! Zero of those!**

Perhaps, it could be a little nicer if you were more responsive with your replies just like before. But, I understand how the terms **“uncontactable”** and **“unanswerable”** are unjustifiably fault as sins in our culture. Hence, I never ever wanted to intentionally blame them on you.

**With that being said, it sucks to be deemed unworthy of a response because I never ever deemed you unworthy of a one whenever you needed help, support, validation or anything.** 

I deemed you worthy enough to wake up in the middle of the night and reply you within a split second with zero complaints whenever you texted me with your cries and sorrows.

***Lesson 1: Through that, I’ve seen how fair the world can be, how realistic people are and how I failed miserably.*** 

Despite all those, I still fed myself with white lies; convincing myself that everything would be fine, you would speak more in a while, maybe it would just be temporary. All those positive thoughts and wishes didn’t come true as I’d hope they would. 

 

**Having said that, I am still thankful and glad that you didn’t leave me in the dark.**

I greatly appreciate the time and effort you took to explain to me in great details why you choose to leave and change things. You were right, and the reasons were acceptable but still a tough pill for me to swallow.

Even though I believe there were wrong explanations somewhere as it is proved that humans will intentionally or unintentionally lie when they communicate with others, be it exaggeration or the withholding of certain information.

Also, I respected you for being brave and rightful enough to pull us back down to the reality before we floated too far out into space.

**Looking back, I remembered doing the best I could;** not how the way it was supposed to be right or the way you would like it to be, but did the way what I thought was right in trying to salvage and maintain the friendship we once shared by means of; still checking up on you, still telling you old jokes, baking, still getting your fav stuff.

***Lesson 2: Thank you for showing me that my best will never be good enough!***

 

But I was always deterred and flooded by a myriad of internal emotions, self-induced inferiority complex, self-complicated grief and many external forms of disappointments.

**Everything just seemed to hit the roof back then and it was bad**.

I remembered vividly, 8 weeks into being given a cold shoulder, being a recipient of harsh tones and fits of rage, being badly bruised and broken with negativity and perpetually perfunctory. It dawned on me when it was probably time for me to not talk to you anymore.

**Still, I was fluctuated between “Should I ignore you?” and “Being soft hearted and kind with my replies to you.”**

 

I didn’t finger point at anything or anyone else with the exception of myself.

**But, let’s face it, I believe it was tough on you back then as well**. (I hope not, because I’ve in ways in which I don’t want you to feel bad. I hope, because at least I feel worthy enough.)

Back then, I’d suspected if I was ever dealt as a **rebound** which it took me months to realise that and I was actually that **innocent** **enough** to be unaware of the existence of such term. 

***Lesson 3: It never feel good to be used by someone to fill in a void they themselves cannot fill. Hence, I hope people see the importance of breaking the vicious cycle of hurt people hurting people.***

**Back then, it all felt that I have a thousand of reasons to blame you.**

**I’d love to blame you for every single shit that you’ve cold-bloodedly shoved up my ass.**

\- Blame you for dragging me into a pothole of emotions that took pieces of me for which I don’t deserve.

\- Blame you for your cruelty in dragging an unwitting soul into your emotional baggage.

\- Blame you for confiding in me, entering and leaving my life like you wish in which it indirectly changed my life and perspectives towards many things that I didn’t see coming.

\- Blame you for being inherently evil and leaving me to deal with unsettled emotions

\- Blame you for making me wonder what’ve I done wrong to deserve this.

**All be it intentionally or unintentionally done**!

***Lesson 4: For that, Now I would like you to know that it may seem like your fault, but it was never yours. I was lying to myself and it was way easier to push my responsibilities than to realise that.*** 

Back then, all in my mind was; 

\- Every now and then, I hope you’ll be unfairly treated, so that you will understand the value of justice.

\- Occasionally, I hope you’ll suffer from betrayal and be lonely, so that you’ll value the importance of loyalty and not take friends for granted.

\- Periodically, I wish that you’ll be ignored so it will teach you the importance of respecting and listening to the friends who were once there for you.

***Lesson 5: For that, Now I would like you to know that now I’m immensely contrite. I still feel awfully ashamed and disgusted for my terrible judgement back then!*** 

Back then. It was a truly devastating blow to my gut.

**The sobering realisation that the foolishness living within myself and the selfishness, the weakness, and some sort of emotional dependency living in your soul were the only parts that fit us as close friends together.** 

It took me long enough for me to wise up, turned away but occasionally still looked back to check if you’re coping well.

At times, I discovered how loud silence could be, noting down every single mistakes and lesson learnt, where I would refer them as the fertilisers I require to grow and nurture myself into a vibrant garden in which will provide the runway that I require to take off.

But on the other hand, I’d always prepare myself with a thousand and three reasons to neutralise and tackle all sorts of negativities, anger and resentments I held unfairly against you.

1) Deep down at the bottom of my heart, I’m fully aware that I should bear full accountability for everything for which I’d allow them to take place.

2) I still care and regard you as a friend no matter what.

**3)** **I realised that I’ve created this whole image of you, that wasn’t really you in which was very unfair to you. For that, I’m extremely remorseful and sorry!**

**However, its hard that I’m waiting for something that isn’t going to happen, for that; I’m referring to an apology that I’m ready to accept but I'll never ever get to hear.** 

I’m glad and relieved that I no longer bear any anger and vengeance towards you, and I hope that’s the same for you too.

***Lesson 6: Thank you for all your lessons. It taught me to be strong, rethink my actions, learn to smile and appear okay, learn to tame my darkness within my bare soul and, also not to drag an unwitting soul into anything.***

Time have come to pass. And would I do anything different if I could turn back time?

No! I would do the same in a heartbeat even to the detriment of re-enduring those negative troughs.

It’s the memories, experiences and the friendships that make life unforgettable and meaningful.

It is just like eating warhead candies, awfully sour at the beginning but it will turn out to be sweet, leaving and remembering all the best of the sweetest memories behind.

**I’d entertain with the idea of what would happen if I choose to lead my own personal life, not be a busybody and to ignore your sorrows.** 

Would I be much happier? Well, I don’t know the answer.

But at least I learnt that, that was the least I could do for anyone out there.

\- At least I know that I am capable of making someone day much brighter than before.

\- At least I found out that I’ve become more interesting than I actually am

\- At least I found out that despite the unwelcomed fate, I’d done one of the most beautiful and selfless acts I never see myself doing. 

**Importantly, I’ve fulfilled and honoured my basic responsibilities as a friend!**

To end of, regardless of what, my lost old friend I have to say thank you. Even though we no longer speak as much as we used to do.

Remember I told you last Sept. to live life to the fullest. Make this living life as memorable as the one everyone hoped they had.

Remember I told you to smile more, frown less as it takes less energy to smile than to frown.

I remember telling you that it is okay to feel sad, but just a while.

Remember I told you to give yourself a few months and everything will be alright. 

**I remember telling you so much so that they all ironically and subconsciously served as encouragements and reminders to myself as well. Thank you!**

To my lost old friend; Continue to spread your positiveness and kindness wherever you go. Be happy wherever you are and whatever you do. Continue to be generous with your supplies of sincerity, joy, cheerfulness, warmth and love to the people around you,

Continue to grow that heart of gold you possess. Continue to indulge in all the food and drink you love. Be reminded that weight is just a number and don’t be too concern about it. Continue to work hard and strive for what you believe in.

Be reminded that you are more than enough and don’t let others pull you down. Be reminded that nothing can stop you from pursuing what you believe in and that you can conquer almost anything once you’ve made up your mind to do so.

Regardless, you’re an amazing and excellent friend that brings out the best in the people around you. For that, you have unknowingly made yourself a priceless gift to all of them. 

I will remember you as the version you would wish to be remembered for.

I’m glad that we were at least close friends before. And I hoped that, by the time we meet, your chapters will be beatified, and we will have a good story to share. 

Till next time. 

Regards,

Will and ever be anonymous.

Will and ever remain as a secret as promised.

shaunreddits,1559021457,btw66e,1,8,"One example of Pets I'll use will be dogs. I often see the same pattern of exuberant neighbours welcoming their puppy or adopted dog into their home and take care of it diligently for at least one year. 

However, afterward, when the owners grow tired of it, as well as being preoccupied with other committments like school, work, relationships, the poor animal either gets given up to a shelter, to someone else, or even dumped somewhere,or gets neglected by the owners, seeing it only as a leech of their time, energy, and expenses. 

Some owners are out from early morning until very late in the night almost every day and not bother to atted to the dog's needs properly. Whereas, some can spend the whole day cooped up in their homes and get their helpers to entirely take care of their dogs, growing their fat asses in the process. Furthurmore, some of them can take looong morning and evening walks by themselves and still make their helpers walk and take full care for them(bathing, medication, walking, etc...

Sure helpers can take care of the dog when the owners need to be away. But these negligent owners think that they are aristocrats and abuse their helpers by making them take full care of the dog. They fail to remember that it was the them who got the dog, and not the helper. Furthuremore, it is very likely that the helper will do a shitty job taking care of their dog as it is not listed in their contract after all. 

Why would the helper also know to proper way of taking care of the dog when they are mainly trained to do housework?

One more detailed example I can present is a Shiba-Inu my neighbour got for his daughter. She was always pestering him for a dog and he finally got her the one when she enrolled into University, believeing that shes old and mature enough to take care of it. 

Unfortunately, she eventually grew tired of it and totally disregard it now.

Of course, her parents were very disappppinted as they spent money getting the dog for her, only to realize now that they made a huge mistake doing so. Fortunately, they love the dog very much and still take good care of it.

Its so sad to see these poor dogs spending most of their miserable live sitting by their front gates, waiting for their owners who could not care less about them. There was one dog which was so badly neglected that it had mange all over its body(even its tail) and its owners could not be bothered to treat its condition. I reported the dog to AVA before. However, I may have to file another report soon as its condition has worsened instead.

This is why I strongly think that Animal Welfare should be taken much more seriously by, perhaps, having a much stricter regulation on taking care of animals like dogs. 

By doing so, we can ensure that these animals will much less likely go to these terribly irresponsible people. 

I will also like to take this chance to tell anyone reading this post that, if you are intending to get a pet, please understand firstly that pets like dogs are intelligent creatures and have emotions which makes them able to feel the same things that we feel. Secondly, do very very extensive reasearch, think extremely hard, if you are able to balance time for caring for your pet and your time for other committments. Thirdly Get a pet because you have a genuine interest in the animal and don't get a pet on impulse or for other stupid reasons like an accessory, or just because you want a guard dog. 

Otherwise, you will most very likely regret doing so later on as you will feel like you are officially stuck with the animal for the rest of its remaining life and end up caring for your pet the very same way these negligent owners take care of their own pets.",askSingapore,3298,Should Animal Welfare be taken more Seriously ?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/btw66e/should_animal_welfare_be_taken_more_seriously/,,"[""Yes.. absolutely  yes..

I just graduated last year from university and entered the workforce as a mechanical engineer. The pay is decent, maybe just a little above average. However the work is mundane and I hate my company’s culture so much.

Everyone is worried to make any mistakes and I feel like it’s starting to affect me as well. I’ve stopped doing things independently and started incessantly checking with everybody if doing X is okay before proceeding. 

I don’t feel the job is very fulfilling either. I’m just doing paperwork that piles every week and it stopped being “can I finish my outstanding?” and became a “which tasks should I do first and which should I just ignore”

And I feel so hesitant about changing jobs. I’ve only worked for less than a year so I’m not sure how other companies will look at me. Plus what if the next job is the same? What will I do then? Hop again?

raeeeeeeeeeeeeeee02,1556070325,bgoq3c,14,4,"Hello to all singaporeans who used to live in the US (or are currently living in the US) , can i just check how did u guys split your name(s) into first name(s) and last name ????

I'm talking about people with names like (surname) (chinese name) , (english name).
So im just gna give an example here to makes things easier:

Let's say my name is Koh Qi, Rachel
My first name should be : Qi Rachel
Last name:Koh

That means my name will be : Qi Rachel Koh. The problem with this is that usually middle names are not written in most legal documents (in my school in the US, my name is literally Qi Koh  =_=)

My legal name is listed as Qi Rachel Koh but in the school system for simplicity sake, they just removed rachel for most of the school documents (since it's a ""middle"" name).

I mean since rachel is my middle name, no one really calls me by that name even if it's listed there. I rmb there was once i went to see the school's nurse as i wasn't feeling well. The person literally shouted ""qi"" really loudly but i didn't know that she was calling me because they struggle with ""chinese"" names sometimes (which is understandable)

I'm just wondering if it's possible for me to use rachel as my first name instead in my legal documents :-( i used rachel in school as a preferred name but when it comes to doctor's visits, signing of contracts, basicallt legal documents (i'm under 18 so my parents will have to sign for me but my name will still be there - listed as Qi Koh), im not able to use my name Rachel despite it being a name that i have been given by my parents &amp; also the name that i grew up with all along when i was still living in Singapore :-(

Idk if anyone felt the same but i felt shit :-( like everytime i complain to my parents about it, they will b like ""rachel, your chinese name is qi - they are not wrong in calling you that""

Haninumber1,1555768169,bfcdef,27,0,"I know there are many category as a kpop fans.

1. The one who is rich or have connections with production company

2. The Obsessive fans

- These people are sometimes immatures &amp; usually disregard people opinions on their favourites.

3. The Normal fans aka the fans who support their favourite during their up &amp; down.

- These fans are usually patience &amp; are always understanding towards others as well as their idols.They are the type who support their favourites dating someone.They don't give hate comment.

4. The Poor fans who can't afford a ticket

- These fans sometimes turn to Instagram,Twitter &amp; Carousell for contest,sometimes getting abusive if they don't win a ticket.

SparkyCat12,1554738782,bavgcz,19,0,"Hey guys, I will be moving to Singapore this month and am looking to open up a bank account and get a debit card.

I'm debating between DBS and UOB, just because they seem to have the most ATMs in the country, making it easier for me to withdraw money from it. 

One of DBS's merit is being able to open a bank account by using your in-principle approval (IPA) letter, unlike other banks where they require a physical pass (e.g. E-Pass, S-Pass, Work Permit). I'm not sure if this is much of a merit as I have a USA bank and a VISA debit card associated with that bank. So worst case, I'll end up withdrawing a huge chunk of cash, pay a small transaction fee for the withdrawal and probably carry around some of the cash. 

UOB, wont let you create an account with a pass but according to google, they have a shorter line on ATM machines. I have no clue how much of a merit this is to be honest, since living in America and Korea, finding an ATM wasn't that hard since they were all over the places. Branches were also here and there so if I really needed some cash, I ended up dropping by the bank to make a withdrawal. And it was also super quick since there were multiple ATM machines so at most, I would have 1 or 2 person in front of me.

The purpose of this bank account would most likely be to be used as the bank where my company deposits my paycheck. I'll probably make a second account which has a better interest rate and move my paycheck over to the second account. 

Debit card is also a bit tricky. I've seen a number of debit card types that requires you to use x amount of payment using the card, as well as other requirements. I don't understand why this is a thing to be honest and I am quite lost with how I should approach for choosing a debit card...

Just some background: 
I've been working in a hospital for a number of years as a rehab professional (not specifying what at this point as my field is so small many people know each other), so am familiar with patient care at the ward level and have a valid BCLS+AED cert, but otherwise no other experience with emergency/pre-hospital care. Currently a little burnt out with what I'm doing and have been looking at trying out something a little different on a part-time/volunteer basis, and recently came across a volunteer EMT/paramedic position on CDAU's web page. However I had also noted in their entry requirements that ""relevant experience in an A&amp;E department or private ambulance"" is required.

Does anyone here have any experience working as a volunteer CDAU EMT/paramedic and could share more about what pre-requisites you had with regards to the ""relevant experience"" described above, as well as your experiences?

Also, I'm also thinking of taking up a formal course but on a part-time basis... Are there any part-time EMT/paramedic courses available in SG? Also are there any differences between where the course is taken as well (e.g. In terms of validity of cert, etc.)? Should I choose to take up training with SCDF, is there any bond period?

The other alternative I'm looking at is being a volunteer CDAU firefighter, which as far as I'm aware does not require any prior experience. So if anyone has any experiences do feel free to share as well :)

Hi!

I hope my questions don’t really come off as annoying here but at this point I’m just really desperate for any kind of input. 

I’m currently in my final year of high school and the deadlines for uni applications are fast approaching. I want to pursue a degree in Business (nothing definite but something related to Business is fine with me, I like to keep my options wide). I have made some study choices in European countries however studying in Singapore or Hongkong had always greatly interested me. But recently due to the issues in Hongkong, I have for the time being not looked at any universities there. 

Singapore on the other hand however…. every SINGLE person I’ve mentioned this to ALWAYS SAYS “but it’s so competitive!!”. I am perfectly aware that it is. Being Indian myself and living abroad, I wouldn’t even dream about applying to any good Indian universities because it is SO DAMN COMPETITIVE. I am not completely dismissing my skills either, I am capable of doing well in my studies but perhaps not so much as to the extend of being accepted into nation-wide well reputable universities. 

And once again.. I was so tired of everyone dismissing me (including my career counselor teacher in school) that I decided to not look at Singaporean universities too.

However, recently I have just finished my mocks and my predicted grades are being transcribed. I am currently predicted a 40 out of a total of 45 points for IB (international baccalaureate). This has made me feel slightly better about myself and I now feel as if I have a better chance to apply to a Singaporean uni. 

Here lies a bit of the dilemma, I am unfortunately uneducated about studying as an international student in Singapore. A fact that has always been pointed out to me is that it is quite expensive to live there (my parents can’t afford a lot for my uni and my younger sibling is going to uni right after me so it’s a bit of a tight financial situation). I could try for scholarships but in general how expensive is it to live there as an international student?

Also, would anyone be kind enough to recommend me any Singaporean unis that offer reputable Business degrees in English. I know there are plenty but I just want to know if I am familiar with the uni names so I know that I am applying to a uni that is well-known and good for international students. 

And finally, how is it socially like in Singapore? I’m slightly sacred about going to European unis because I don’t know how they’ll perceive an Indian student and so what is it like in Singapore? Are people open to international students?

**Also, we would like to hear from you and from your personal knowledge**, every little piece of information can help:

* **Public space** \- Are you allowed outside? must you wear masks or gloves if so? Is there still public transportation? Are there public disinfection sites outside? Does the government disinfect public places?
* **Getting checked** \- How are people being checked for the virus? What technology is being used to check? Where do people go to, to get checked? How do you decide who needs to get checked?
* **Using quarantine** \- What steps were taken and when? Who is placed under quarantine? Who still can go to work? How is the quarantine enforced? Are people under surveillance?
* **Learning from the past** \- What did you learn from SARS? How were you better prepared for Covid-19? Do you have special ""National alertness"" stages? what do they mean?
* **Medical personnel** \- How are medical personnel and their families are being kept safe?
* **Contact tracing** \- How is ""contact tracing"" done? How do you trace the paths of people who became sick and might have contaminated others?

That's it for now - If you are able to help us with these questions, if you know some sources or websites where we can find data and information, or know someone who is an expert in the field and is willing to help - we would appreciate it greatly.

Don’t get me wrong, my mum was the one that agreed with the idea of dyeing my hair because I am young and adventurous but my dad well, he didn’t like it very much. He thinks it’s like being a gangster cause of some army past he said when he was serving Ns. He told me ppl with tattoos, earrings and dyed hair is bad. However when I went to London, majority of the citizens dyed many bright colours and everyone was ok with it.

LatelyUnlikely,1579243927,epwv4r,2,1,"Hi guys! I’m a Design Student, and I am working on  a Final Year Project for paediatrics aged 4-10 Year Olds.

My product would basically distract first time patients who requires an IV drip therapy by using vibration to “trick the pain receptors” while the needle is being administered. ( think of it as an arm massager )

As you know, children especially first time patients are afraid of the hospitals and would dread going to one, so with my design, the idea, is to reduce their anxiety and to make visiting hospitals a friendly and inviting one.

So my stakeholders would be 

1) Families with children who would dread going to the hospitals for IV drip therapy, as they would cry and be “stubborn”

2) Children. To reduce their anxiety and distract them by means of tactile and haptic feedback, while making their visits to the hospitals non a dreadful one.

3) Nurses. To ease their job, making the IV insertion process a smooth one.

So, I have designed this product in a way that it will NOT interfere with nurses administrating the needle and does NOT cause the needle to vibrate, as the vibration would be clear from the site of insertion which is at the wrist area. It will also NOT hurt your children whatsoever, as I’ve tested the vibrations on relatives and cousins around this age group, and have been received well by them.

My nurse friend who is currently working in a private hospital, has been advising me on my design and now, I would want to take it a step further by using it on actual patients whom requires an IV drip therapy to justify my designs.

So here I am at a dilemma, I tried emailing the public hospitals, and received no replies, so I was wondering if it is possible for any Redditor’s, who has children around this age group whom requires an IV drip therapy, or any nurses or supervisors to explore and see the potential in my design to be tested on actual patients as to justify to my lecturers that my product actually works for data collection.

There will be no photo taking of children using my product, unless given permission and this would be my last stretch in my course of studies. I’m left with 3 more weeks and I’m touching up on the form of my design.

The testing of my product would not take longer than 10 minutes!

So before I enlisted to army I went to interview for a Uni placement in SIT. I got accepted to SIT, but at that time I tried to apply for NTU but got rejected.

After that year was 2019, I didn’t apply to any Uni. Which was a mistake because I missed out on the chance to try my luck again for the course that I want.  I also had a friend who got in with a GPA similar to mine. 

After being in the army it made me realise that what I’m going for isn’t worth it? I don’t know if I can get a job with a degree from SIT. And also my results are slightly below the 10th percentile for the course I want in NTU, so I’m not guaranteed a course or survivability.

spookitkat,1592319586,ha5mbn,10,19,"Lost a friend to suicide a couple of weeks ago. A lot of things went wrong, and part of it was due to a lack of adequate treatment. The therapy he was getting wasn't right for him. In that severely depressed state, it can be very hard to advocate for yourself. If you have mental health issues, do seek help. If you're already in treatment, and it isn't working, please hold on.

# Where to seek help:

Easiest way is to go to a polyclinic and ask for a referral. If you wish, you can specify which hospital you want. You can also go to [CHAT](https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/get-help/mental-health-check/) if you're a youth, and they'll assess you and refer you to IMH. It's all confidential, unless you're a risk to yourself or others. Please be open about what you're going through, don't minimise your emotions, don't invalidate yourself, don't hold things back. If you do that, they may not be able to assess you correctly and might conclude that there's nothing wrong with you.

If you just want medications and don't want to go a hospital, a few of the polyclinics run [mental health clinics](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/mental-health-cases-treated-at-polyclinics) as well. The consultation fee is cheaper compared to a hospital. The waiting time to be referred is also a lot faster as compared to a hospital. Sometimes you need to wait for months to get an appointment with hospitals, whereas it's usually 1-3 weeks at the mental health clinics. A few of these polyclinics also offer psychotherapy. You can go to a polyclinic, and ask them to refer you. There have been instances where the doctors themselves are not aware that the polyclinics run mental health clinics, so be sure to specify the name of the mental health clinic, be it a ""Health and mind service clinic"", ""Health wellness clinic"" or ""Community wellness clinic"". If you prefer to have psychotherapy as well, tell the doctor to refer you to one that offers that. I think the [community wellness clinics](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/35/community-wellness-clinic) do offer psychotherapy as well.

If you're under 18, IMH runs the child guidance clinic at [HPB](https://www.imh.com.sg/clinical/page.aspx?id=283) as well.

# At the hospital:

Now, if you've been referred to the hospital, they will diagnose you and usually they'll start off with medication. If you believe you need psychotherapy as well, tell your doctor straightaway. But even if you don't, if the doctor realises that you might benefit from therapy, they will probably refer you anyway. You know yourself better than anyone else, so just ask for it if you think it'll help. I truly believe that most people can benefit greatly from therapy.

# If you have financial difficulties:

Google the [outpatient consultation fee](https://www.ttsh.com.sg/Patients-and-Visitors/Your-Clinic-Visit/Pages/Outpatient-Charges.aspx) (TTSH for example) for your hospital. Psychiatric consultations, excluding medication, are usually around $30-$40. If you're starting on medication, your doctor would probably want to see you once every 4-6 weeks for a while to see if your dosage needs to be increased etc. Therapy costs about $50-$60. If you have financial difficulties, speak to your doctor and ask to be referred to a medical social worker (MSW). Some hospitals have a [MSW's office](https://www.nuh.com.sg/our-services/Specialties/Medical-Social-Work/Pages/default.aspx) (NUH for example) that you can go to directly as well, or just give them a call. From what I understand, the MSW will require your CPF statement, your bank statement, your income statement, and your family members' income statement and CPF statement, in order to apply for subsidies.

# Infrequent therapy sessions:

So you've been referred to see a therapist. Sometimes, depending on the institution and the therapist, the psychotherapy appointments may not be frequent enough for you. Sometimes it can be as infrequent as once every 2 months. In that case, do ask for more frequent appointments. Ask them if they can block-book your appointments. You have the right to ask. Ask either your doctor directly or your therapist.

If they can't accommodate you, ask if there's any other therapist at that hospital or clinic who can see you more often. Some patients can make do with infrequent appointments, but in order for therapy to work properly, it should be at least once in 3-4 weeks. It works even better if it's weekly or fortnightly. What if all the therapists in that hospital are overbooked and they don't block-book? Ask to be referred to another hospital. Or try private therapy if you can.

# If therapy doesn't work:

What if you're in therapy and it isn't working for you? Talk to your therapist and try to work it out. Sometimes it takes time. Try not to ghost your therapist or just disappear from treatment. They have a tendency to push for CBT in most places. CBT does work for many, but on its own, it may not work for some patients. Many patients can end up feeling invalidated and misunderstood. There are other forms of therapies that they use in hospitals. There's DBT, solution focused therapy, psychodynamic therapy, schema therapy, EMDR, and art therapy in some places too. Google these therapies, they might work better for you. Lots of therapists use an integrative approach where they combine the different modalities. Psychodynamic therapy in particular can be a good starting point for many patients. Talk to your therapist and see if they're willing to try a different approach.

What if it still doesn't work or you just don't connect with your therapist? Ask to be referred to someone else. Please don't just leave treatment. Sometimes it can take a while to find a therapist and a treatment approach that works for you. Keep trying. You have the right to ask to see another therapist, you can ask your doctor to refer you to someone else.

# If you're young and don't want family involved:

What if you're young and don't want to tell your parents anything? If you're below 18, from what I know, they will have to talk to your parents before prescribing you medication. I'd encourage you to go to CHAT and talk to them there and see what your options are. You might be able to receive counselling/therapy, without taking meds, in which case your family may not need to be involved. You can also call them up or use their web chat function on the website. Tell them your situation, tell them you're adamant that your family not be involved and ask them what your options are. If paying for treatment is an issue, ask them which places offer inexpensive therapy/counselling - usually the Family service centres do. There's also the option of [free online counselling](https://www.ec2.sg).

# My own personal opinions on the various institutions:

This is based on both my own experiences and the experiences of my friends. I only have friends who've been to IMH, NUH, and SGH, so those are the only places I can comment on. But please note, these are just opinions.

* IMH

Let's start off with IMH. IMH has changed quite a bit over the years. Years ago, if you were ever hospitalised there for depression, you would have been warded together with patients with other illnesses as well. It was common for 1 ward to have about 30-40 patients of all ages (18 and above) and most of them would have a psychotic disorder. You would have patients crying, screaming, being tied to their bed. This was something that many patients with mood disorders like depression found triggering. Luckily, this changed once they opened the [mood disorder unit](https://www.healthhub.sg/a-z/medical-and-care-facilities/74/recovery-retreat), a ward for mood disorders. I've heard a lot of good things about the MDU from people who've been hospitalised there, not just about the atmosphere, but about the amazing nurses and doctors too.

What about IMH outpatient subsidised clinic? The environment there is different from other hospitals. You will see all sorts of patients, and the general atmosphere feels a little gloomy. It might be unnerving for some, but you get used to it. Doctors are a hit or miss at IMH. I've heard some say that their doctors are amazing, others say that their doctors are terrible. If you end up with a doctor you don't like, you can always ask them to refer you to someone else. Sometimes it's just a personality mismatch and it's perfectly okay to request to see someone else.

Location: Buangkok, no train station nearby.

* SGH

SGH is quite well known for their [eating disorder](https://www.sgh.com.sg/patient-care/specialties-services/eating-disorders-programme/pages/treating-eating-disorders-the-sgh-experience.aspx) (ED) unit and their sleep disorder unit. Would recommend if you have an ED. Usually for ED, you'll see quite a few people: psychotherapist, psychiatrist, dietician, art therapist, sometimes a family therapist too. They have an inpatient, and an outpatient ED programme, and they have a support group as well.

Their regular psychiatric outpatient clinic is okay too. Haven't heard that many good things or bad things.  Atmosphere is fine.

Location: Outram mrt within walking distance.

* NUH

Most people like NUH, but I had 1 or 2 friends who had bad experiences. Most of the doctors here are good. Therapy is a bit of a problem though. I don't know if this is always the case, but their therapy sessions are overbooked, so they offer patients group therapy first until a slot for individual therapy opens up. That was my friend's experience anyway. Atmosphere is okay. Their clinic has green walls.

Location: directly linked to Kent ridge MRT.

* Counselling centres

I've heard good things about [AWARE](https://www.aware.org.sg/womens-care-centre/counselling/)(for women only and mostly 21 y/o and above) and [Counselling and care centre.](http://www.counsel.org.sg/counselling/fee-chargeable)  Aware counselling fee: 1% of monthly salary, $20 if no income. Counselling and care centre: subsidised rate is $40 to $150, depending on income.

I've also heard that [JCU](https://www.jcu.edu.sg/student-life/student-support-services/psychology-clinic) and [NUS](https://www.fas.nus.edu.sg/psy/chpc.html) psych clinics which are run by psych interns are decent as well. Both clinics are open to the public

I've not heard great things about Family service centres. They're useful if you have relationship issues etc., but if you have any psychological illness, a hospital or a clinic might work better. Having said that, there are many family service centres in SG, so it might also depend on which one you go to. The counselling at FSC is usually inexpensive.

# How can I help a friend or family:

Encourage them to seek help. If you can, accompany them to see a polyclinic doctor to get a referral. If they're already in treatment, there are other ways through which you can support them.

* Check in regularly

Consistency is important here. Give them or a call or send them a message. The content doesn't really matter, even sending a cat picture can be helpful. If you don't get a reply, don't take it personally. Continue to keep in touch anyway.

* Invite them out

Invite them out. Even if they decline, keep inviting them out. Make it easier for them by meeting somewhere close to where they stay. If possible, ask if you can go over to their place to just hang out or watch a movie. Tell them stuff like ""we can just hang out together and each do our own thing"" to take the pressure off them. Exercising together is another good activity.

* Listen

Let them know that you will be there when they need a listening ear. When they do talk, try not to offer advice unless they ask for it. Just listen. Validate if you can. Don't dismiss the person's feelings.

* Give them a hug

It's months into the job, and it's been nothing but a strange journey. In the midst of COVID though, I don't know if it's right for me to quit now, or what are the consequences that will follow me because of the circumstances. Hoping to get some views, and here's the story:

I joined on recommendation from an acquaintance for a marketing role. On the first day, the sales tried to get from me my marketing lists from my previous jobs, saying it is a necessity to hand over the list and that ""all marketers should have their own list"". I refused, stating PDPA even if it's personal contacts. I highlighted this to my boss, who told me to observe and give it another chance. Now over the next few months, when asked about what marketing has been done before and their effectiveness, there was a constant ""ask him, ask her"" which resulted in no answers. The same sales person could not provide any insight too of what he is selling or what people have said they would like to know more of etc. As an expat, he openly laughs at local clients ""for being hard to understand"" and has told HR (which is overseas) ""not to hire Singaporeans"" as he feels ""their English cannot be understood"".

Of course, it is unavoidable there are such people around in various settings. But here's where it gets even more 'interesting'.

He often sends things to be signed by my boss with the need for a immediate response - like ""please reply in 10mins/24hours"". My boss found it odd, and so took time to read through. This is when my boss realized, this person is being paid a commission on a contract that cannot be paid a commission. He had said he had ""influenced the person into choose him"" over other competitors. Upon closer inspection, it was uncovered that the contract had been ""post-processed"", meaning he was now paid a commission for work that had already been done and where the contracts were before his time! This wasn't the only contract and there were others, of which one of the clients had asked ""who is this person? we didn't do any sales with him but we see him cc-ed only!""

As things began to unfurl itself before our eyes, we realized he wasn't getting any leads, but rather having them handed over to him because someone in higher management had been doing so to justify the office here. Fearing that it would be outed soon, he demanded to control the generic inbox, and got another colleague to cover for him. The entire office has access into the mailbox, but none of us except that other colleague can delete emails, but suddenly, the two started accusing the rest of the office for deleting their sales source away one day. They are backed by higher management to say ""we are deleting emails"" - but our access rights is only to read?

They then decided to apply for a ""grant"" here locally of sorts, whereby it has to be done according to the application form and guidelines. They managed to find the creator of the guidelines, who in turn was well acquainted with people. Again, trying what sales tried to do with me on Day 1, they tried to get the person's list of contacts. The person refused, and they began to call the person names (childish yes), but even refute that the person's method of filling up the form in accordance with the guidelines was bullshit. They cut out alot of things, and so the person refused to put any indication of work being done by him/her because he/she knew it would not pass audit and he/she did not want to take the responsibility of it. Fields requiring NRIC was left blank, and the other colleague said ""We will just take it off her contract to work for us since he/she should know it will be used as such,""

There is more shady things that are happening in the background, but at this stage, I'm concerned with where this is going because the place is not doing well at all, and may get even shadier than it already is. My boss had tendered, but here's when they are trying to push all blame onto him/her. They had done that with the person in the role before him/her, by accusing the person of stealing contacts - but even when IT went into the email account, there was nothing to be found at all.

I'll update more when I can think of any more.

linglingmozartybae,1591943053,h7ffnh,4,3,"Hello, I'm a JC student considering to study in Japan after my A levels at the end of the year, and I would like to ask a few questions about studying in Japan. I've been wanting to make this post for quite a while and have only just mustered the courage to do so. This post might be a bit long and i apologise for that, but I would really love to hear from you!!!

I'm hoping to study music composition in either Senzoku Gakuen College of Music or Tokyo University of the Arts(Geidai). I don't take any music related subjects in JC (I take h2 BCMTranslation), but I do have a musical background so I'll be able to prepare for the auditions. I know that Geidai admits students under the MEXT scholarship, but the official website doesn't really explain much about the scholarship itself, and I haven't been able to find the 'Music' subject under the 'Fields of Study' section in their application guidelines (I only found Social sciences/Humanities and Natural Sciences), so I'm kind of confused. I will look into it more after A's.

I'm not thinking of studying music locally after hearing from quite a few different people(including my music teachers) that having a music degree here wouldn't really get me anywhere realistically. I was actually hoping to graduate in japan and work in the music industry there.

Regarding my Japanese speaking level: I did Japanese O levels back in sec school, passed JLPT N3 in sec 3 (98th percentile), and N2 in sec 4 (88th percentile). I've also done a few exchanges with the Japanese Secondary School here in SG. Although I can understand around 85% of what is being said when I watch or read the Japanese news, I haven't exactly spoken the language since Sec 4, so I'm nowhere fluent as of now. I'm also well aware that N1 is an entirely different ball game and that I'll never be able to become truly fluent or as good as a native speaker.

My questions are:

* How realistic it is to take a gap year after A levels to work part time, study the language, take N1, apply for MEXT and familiarise myself with the Japanese musical terminologies? (i'm familiar with a portion of it from following the japan music scene for several years).
* MEXT: What is it like exactly? I haven't been able to understand much from their website. How hard is it to get it? How difficult are the papers?
* Fitting in: How hard is it to fit in with the locals? I've heard about the 'circles' thing in japanese uni's, how exactly does it work? For the people reading this who have studied/ worked in japan: what kind of experiences did you have?
* Part time jobs: Would it be realistic to take on a part time job while studying in uni? How hard is it to find a job as a student? What are the common jobs that students take on? Are the working times flexible? How is the pay?
* I'm aware of the pretty toxic working culture (hierarchy, ot, subtle racism etc) and the generally lower pays in Japan. I'm not 100% sure of what it's like in the music industry, but as long as I'm doing something I really like, I'm prepared to deal with them and I'm willing to make compromises to adapt.

Lastly, I would just clarify that I'm only considering to study in Japan. If all things go south, i would just follow my original plan of applying to NUS life science/ NTU biological science. The thing is that I've been considering studying music composition since secondary school, and not to mention that JC has successfully killed my interest in the all subjects I take. Music is the only thing that doesn't constantly make me want to fling myself off the balcony. But then again, according to the lists of international students on the university websites, apparently there hasn't been any Singaporeans studying in Senzoku, and there is currently only 1 Singaporean studying music in Geidai graduate school, so I don't really know if I should even consider pursuing this route in the first place.

If you've managed to read till this far, thank you so so much!!! I'd really like to hear from you so please do consider leaving your thoughts.

I had to churn this out during my recess so I apologise for any grammatical mistakes.

I am a 2019 graduate from a local U with a social sciences degree, and I have been job hunting for a year. I've recently received an offer for a CS Associate call center contract role with the CPF board with a salary that is in the mid 2k range before CPF deduction.

I'm actually quite happy to have received this offer despite it being supposedly a non-graduate job/ salary because I am so very tired of job hunting, but my main conflict is how I will be able to build a career outside of the organization with just CPF product knowledge as well as experience handling inbound calls.

I am just unsure of where I can go to next after I spend a year with CPF, and was wondering if anyone here can help shed some light on if my experience at the job will be helpful in any other career paths going forward.

It doesn't help that my other offer is a possibly back-breaking insurance sales job that will probably give me the relevant qualifications (m9, etc) and work experience to get into a job in the banking and finance sector, but I honestly cannot imagine myself working in sales.

Yes, I got 2 offers at the same time after a year of job hunting (hooray). I would have taken either one if they came individually because I am already tired and depressed (not clinically) from being jobless for a year, but I guess I have to suffer even when I'm supposed to be celebrating.

Herobrine1104,1590914926,gtvlmd,0,1,"The disturbing death of George Floyd (RIP) in America, has brought greater attention to the glaring racial tensions that exist in and plagues most societies today. Even in racially homogenous societies, race has become an issue with the influx of foreigners and refugees. Most have adopted the policy or tolerance to this issues, but it has definitely been hard for a large population to adapt to the changing demographic and the very identity of their societies. In the case of Singapore, the racial riots of our nation-building years have ended, but some racial tensions do remain, as well as the emergence of a growing gap between citizens and non-citizens. This is understandable for a young population that has lost its ancestral roots namely from China, India and Malaysia, and grips firmly to the local identity that it has formed. Laws are in place to protect the delicate racial and religious fabric in Singapore, most notably the racial quota of residents in public housing as well as censorship of racially controversial media and the restrictions on speech inciting racial and religious controversy. I was once against the laws limiting freedom of information and free speech, I though it was not the place of the government to control what we can or cannot say or think. I thought people should be able to air their laundry no matter how insulting, so as to settle differences and release tensions. But looking at the world today, civilisations that have existed for centuries continue to have racial issues. The natural working of society is similar to the law of the jungle: the strongest rule. This evident with the oppression of most minorities, be it racial, sexual, religious or gender, in many societies.

Singapore is a small country that exists by being bigger than itself, greater than its weaknesses. It has to be exceptional in all areas and most importantly: how it manages its people. We have to be a functioning society, and the Government is our moral compass. Our freedom of speech to engage in racially or religiously provocations is dwarfed by the importance of social harmony, even if it is one micro managed by censorship laws. The goal here is to create a society for our future generations where such policies are no longer needed. Unfortunately, we are not there yet but we must continue to uphold this culture of One People, One Singapore,  Regardless of Race, Language or Religion.

Notwars_star,1590419863,gqcrak,4,1,"  Hi, if this gets posted it will be great.

Well to cut to the chase, I got kicked out of my course for failing a module 2. Hence I appealed to my school and ask the director of my school for an interview so that I try to convince them to let me in. Ofcourse that led to nothing as I got no interview with them and got my appeal rejected. Ask the director for another way and he said to go for my NS and get a Recommendation letter from my officer and come back and appeal as some of my seniors have done and have been accepted without any complications.

Now as usual I was expecting it but it took me awhile to let it Fully sink in. After it did, I started to plan my life again. In order of what I think i should most likely do
 
1) Do as the director say and serve my NS and after that continue the course I'm in. Work for the intern company

2)Change of course? Which is a problem because I heard if u get kicked out u can't go to other polys. Also the reason behind wanting to Change to another course is because I have started to lose my interest in the course and hence my demise from the course. Also if I went back I'm not sure if I will be able to go to the UNI I want(SIT) as my GPA after was 1.3. However this choice also means I need save up a lot of money as my tuition fees and subsidy will not cover if I change course and have to pay the full amount. Another con is I'll be almost 27-28 with no work experience and a diploma which makes me worry more as I feel like companies will not hire me due to my age.

3)Same as number 1 but this time I continue working with the company I intern at and work a minimum of 3-4 years and then take a part time degree or maybe a full time degree. Either way I'll be earning and trying to progress instead of being stuck at something I might not like. Like I'll have a goal still to push forward to. 

4) Private diploma but only problem is im from a not well to do family which means money will be a problem.

5)Sign on with Navy? I'm keen with being in the navy and ok with taking orders but the only problem I have is if I decide to work for the public sector I might not have any certification and work experience which means I probably won't get a job. Also if I do sign on I want to be an officer but ofc we all know with a diploma your pay will be better. 

This are my plans so far. I have come to accept I have messed up my life with my own bad habits and now I'm trying to make up for it before it's too late. I knw it might be too late to follow my passion but even if it's something I might not enjoy the most I knw its a need for me to push on so I can have a better life then what my family has and make sure my future family will live comfortably.

I suppose this is their way of ""child discipline"". Today, I heard him crying again and he'd been crying ""I want mummy"" for about 5 mins.

It is very stressful and not everyone has the patience and capacity to deal with children misbehaving for whatever reasons. It is easy to end up venting the frustrations on the children (because they are powerless to defend themselves). Some parents are also unaware that the way they punish their kids can leave lifelong emotional scars. Parenting is like cultivation of character, children seem to be there to challenge you.\n\nMost of the work of instilling good upbringing is in the daily life, e.g teaching your children good values while watching tv together, personal stories etc... \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**How to punish children the right way?**\n\n1) Understand why they acted that way. Not just what you assume it is, make sure you get the full picture. Are they lonely/upset/scared? Just wanted your attention? bullied at school? feel insecure?\n\n2) Explain why that behavior is wrong and tell them the right way to handle it. Tell them how it affects you emotionally when they do that. (help to train empathy too) The truth is some parents won't know how to handle similar situations when they were kids too.\n\n3) Reward good behavior and when you notice progress. Reserve stern scoldings only for really morally undesirable behavior. When the scolding is harsher than needed, children feel wronged and get hurt, their minds just shut off and don't learn anything.\n\n4) Apologise to your children if you were too harsh on them because you were too angry. (parents are not immuned to making mistakes too) This way you are teaching them to admit mistakes and raising their voice is not the way to solve problems.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n**About your neighbour...**\n\nBased on the above points, what you neighbour did, does seem harsh for a 3-4 year old. Though they seemingly didn't hit their child, sending him out of the house is very humiliating and scary for him because children sees the home as place to feel safe. How bad a thing can he do to be kicked out of the house? If this is a timeout, it is executed poorly. Timeout place should be somewhere safe and familiar, just a quiet corner in the house, perhaps his own room, for him to calm down and reflect.

TLDR. I am suggesting that we should go for herd immunity, with the circuit breaker being lifted today. What we should do going forward is to keep the more relaxed restrictions we have in March. That is, continue social distancing and washing our hand, but allow gathering to continue up to a limit of 10 (or maybe 50). Keep restaurants, schools, salons etc open. Enhance isolation of those people who are in nursing home (the most vulnerable population).

I am just a university student. I am not an expert in the field of infectious disease. Everything that I know, you could also know too from online sources. What I am saying here expresses only my opinion, and no one else. I am writing here to generate a discussion and gather more opinions. I am suggesting that we are likely to had went through our current enhanced lockdown for nothing. Continuing with all the restrictions we had in March was enough.

Globally, we have been misled to believe that the fatality rate is between 1% to 3%. But recent surveys suggested that the number is much closer to 0.2% to 0.6%. 0.5% is from a survey in New York, where the healthcare system was overwhelmed. This article from New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html)) suggested that. To quote the article “If the pattern holds, the results from random testing of 3,000 people raised the tantalizing prospect that many New Yorkers — as many as 2.7 million, the governor \[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\] said — who never knew they had been infected had already encountered the virus, and survived.” As a result, “the death rate in New York from Covid-19 would most likely be far lower than previously believed, possibly 0.5 percent of those infected.”. This article was from 23 April 2020.

Antibody test suggested that New York City already have 20% of people being infected. Stockholm another 20%, Heinsberg (Germany’s covid-19 epicentre) already have 14 percent. These are study done about a week ago, and people who are tested positive in these antibodies tests would have been infected weeks ago. Developing the required antibodies takes time. So, these are the total number of people who have been infected maybe two weeks back, so the number today would be higher. These results are suggesting a much higher infection rate for Covid-19 then we have been made to believe, perhaps being even more infectious than Influenze (H1N1, which is also known as Swine Flu, started in 2009 and infected about 1 billion people by 2010). Given that these areas already have so many people being infected, it is impossible to keep the number of cases down to zero. Right now, the number of cases for them is going down. But when they open up, the number of cases will only go up. They are much closer to herd immunity as compared to bringing the number down to zero. In fact, Sweden’s capital, Stockholm, is expected to achieve herd immunity (\~60% of people infected) by end of May. Chances are that US and EU have no choice but to go into herd immunity. What would Singapore do then?

The virus is going to hit us, whether or not we want it. Unless Singapore is ready to seal its border for the next 18 months. Optimistically, within 18 months, an effective drug/vaccine would have been found and ready for mass production. Historically, no vaccine had been ready for mass usage within a year. Unless we are ready to seal our border, majority of us will be infected before the vaccine arrive. Given that we will get the virus eventually, having a lockdown today is not going to help us, we are simply pushing the pain to the future.

I am suggesting for Singapore to aim for herd immunity through natural infection instead of suppressing the virus. How herd immunity work is that by having around 60 % of the population already infected by Covid-19 then recover, the virus would not be spreading through our country as fast even when we leave the restriction. It would not spread as fast because the number R0 (number of people each infected person infects) would be lower because out of 10 person that we could originally past to, 6 of them are already immune and only 4 of them could be infected. We do so by keeping all the restrictions we had in March, but add it on with compulsory mask in public transport and crowded places so that the number of cases would not increase too fast for our healthcare system. Let the virus spread through the population in a controlled manner such that the number of people infected stays at a sustainable level so that the healthcare would not be overwhelmed. A preliminary ball park figure would be 10,000 new infections everyday, but I need to do my study on this, if anyone have a research paper suggesting the right number, do let me know!

Of course, going back to the more relax measure that we had in March would increase the number of people who requires medical attention, potentially overwhelming Singapore’s medical system. But what we read about Singapore healthcare system being severely overwhelmed are being made by a wrong assumption – they severely overestimated the number of people who needs medical attention and ICU facility. I am suggesting that whoever is advising our government on their approach, have used a very wrong number that far exaggerated the real seriousness of the virus. Today (1st May 2020) we have about 15,000 migrant worker who are already infected, yet three is in ICU. On 17 April 2020, Straits time reported that by the time 20 thousand of our migrant workers get infected, we will need 200 ICU beds to treat them. Quoting from Straits Time “Prof Fisher \[senior infectious diseases expert at the National University Hospital\] said: ""If 20,000 get infected, they will need at least 200 ICU beds, and statistically there may be 40 deaths.” ([https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/surge-in-virus-infections-strains-healthcare-system](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/surge-in-virus-infections-strains-healthcare-system)). The 20,000 infections here refer to the migrant population. I don’t think it is a stretch to assume that Singapore’s government had been using this kind of prediction when suggesting that our healthcare system would be overwhelmed without the additional lockdown measures we had in April. I am comparing the measures between what we are doing now, versus what it was back in March. As a result, we might all be going to lockdown because the severity of this virus is being overestimated, by an order of 100x. Professor Fisher estimation suggest that at least 150 migrant workers would be in ICU because we have about 15,000 infections, but in reality, we are seeing single digit number of migrant worker in ICU right now. 150 vs single digit, that's a very big overestimation. Not to mention, given that we now know that in places like New York, California, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden, the number of people who have been infected is 10 times the number that is being confirmed by covid-19 test. Maybe the number of migrant populations being infected is not 15k. Maybe, it is half of 300k. Three ICU patients among 150 thousand infected migrant population. Let that sink.

We could also look at the number of ICU beds that Sweden needed through thisCovid-19 pandemic. If I understand this website ([https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/](https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/)) correctly, Sweden needed at most 558 ICU for covid-19 at any point of time, yet they are suspected to have infected about 1 million people by the beginning of May. Sweden has a population of 10 million, and Singapore has about 5.6 million people. Also, Singapore is capable of having 600 ICU beds for Covid-19 ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/coronavirus-22-patients-in-icu-hospitals-have-nearly-150-vacant-icu-beds-and-can-add](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/coronavirus-22-patients-in-icu-hospitals-have-nearly-150-vacant-icu-beds-and-can-add) ), which is higher than the 558 needed in Sweden for covid-19.

Another important thing to consider is how many could we save by pushing the virus back until a vaccine is found. Base on figures from Europe, most of the death are among those above 70 years old. In fact, in some countries, the median age of death is actually higher than the life expectancy. What's the proportion of those who died from covid-19 that would had died from other causes if they didn't get covid-19 within 1.5 years (the time it takes for a vaccine to be in mass usage in an optimistic scenario)? In some countries, about half the death from covid-19 are from nursing home, and in these nursing home, e.g. in Sweden, majority of them don't really have much longer than a year to live. In other words, about half the death from covid-19 are among people who would had died by 2022 without covid-19. What it means is that the extra health issue (mental and physical health impact of prolonged lock down) could actually outweigh the negative impact of achieving herd immunity through natural infection against covid-19. There is no actual number for this figure yet, and we could only really know it around 2023 by comparing with the excess mortality.

Another thing to mention is that even if a vaccine is found, it may not be 100% effective. Some of us could, especially the elderly, could still be vulnerable to covid-19 even if there is vaccine. Even the flu vaccine, after decades of research and development, only reduces the odds of getting the flu by 60%. Note that this flu vaccine has already taken into account that there are multiple strains of Influenza. Also, there is still no HIV vaccine, no effective dengue vaccine (there's one for those who had been infected at least once by dengue, but none for those who have yet to be exposed). There are some vaccine that even results in vaccine enhanced diseases, but we can't be sure that a vaccine won't result in that until we get to test the vaccine extensively. Vaccine takes about a decade to develop for good reason, to make sure that the vaccine is safe for everyone, especially the elderly and those with co-morbidity. But accelerating the vaccine development so quickly could also means we are removing some of these safety measure.

One major objection to the herd immunity approach is that immunity is not guaranteed. To such objection, I paraphrase Professor Johan Giesecke, the former State Epidemiologist for Sweden and current advisor to Sweden’s herd immunity strategy “Because it is a coronavirus, and we know about six other coronavirus and why would this be special”. Basically, we develop immunity for all other coronaviruses so far, so we will be developing an immunity for Covid-19. The only question is how long our immunity will last. Everyday of lockdown causes us hardship and even more death. Treatment for less serious illnesses will be pushed back as long as the virus is still within us. When these people do eventually get treated, their condition will get more serious because of delayed treatment. The longer we take to adopt the herd immunity strategy, the longer we had to push back treatments for less severe illnesses (heart issues, kidney issues, etc). Not to mention the devastating economic impacts it has on us. The general health of a population usually suffers during a financial crisis. Not only that, a reduction in tax revenue and increased in fiscal spending could also mean less resources for healthcare in the future, which could have a negative impact on future healthcare standard.

Lockdown is not harmless. Lockdown is playing dice with the devastating health and sociological impact that lockdown creates on us. Lockdown is not the prudent strategy of waiting until we know more about the virus then we go ahead. Maybe it was. But today, we already have enough data to suggest that we can go for herd immunity.

Singapore should lift the lockdown measure, while making sure to calibrate their strategy so that their ICU facility has at least a few % (maybe 1% to 2%, I don’t know the number, do let me know if you have any research on this number) of spare capacity at each point of time. We too should protect the most vulnerable from the infection, basically the nursing homes. Those in nursing home who are unable to care for themselves are far more at risk than the elderlies who can take public transport on their own. Singaporeans are not stupid. Singaporeans know what is good for themselves and for others. The government can trust us on that.

Also current estimations is that about 45% of the transmission is from people with symptoms, about 10% are from environment, and the last 45% are from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. With 45 % of the transmission being from people with symptoms, it may actually be sufficient to reduce the transmission by half just by asking those with even the mildest symptoms to isolate themselves at home.

chickiesdoo,1589988286,gndc36,5,1,"Hey guys so I recently graduated with a Diploma in Business Management with an average GPA. Now, idk what to do..

Since young, I’ve always been interested in Science courses and I always wanted to be something like a medical researcher but my parents thought studying business had a brighter future + its easier. After 3 long years of being in Poly, I realise its kinda boring and not really my cup of tea. 

I went to search on local uni as well as overseas uni on science courses and found that they would require an IB or A level cert. And the only option for a business diploma would be other business related modules. 

I’m from an average family and my parents emphasised that they will not be paying for my degree so I would have to work to save up myself. I’m currently working and my working hours are kinda weird, 11am to 8pm. But I’ve previously talked to my boss on furthering my studies and she said that she would be glad to let me off from work early for my studies. 

So here comes my dilemma: 

1. Continue with business courses since I’m already halfway there 

2. Get a A level / IB cert

Studying business would be more practical but i think i would be able to ask my parents for a little allowance if I manage to get into a good local/overseas uni doing a science degree. My parents think that I should continue pursuing a business degree because starting over would be a waste of time. So could you all please share with me your experience and give me some advice. 

Thanks for reading and stay safe everyone :D

spookitkat,1589983476,gnbx3k,42,1,"My story is simple. I’m 23 y.o. and  haven't worked in about 4 years. This hasn't been due to laziness, but due to issues that I haven't been able to overcome. 

My confidence regarding working and functioning are a result of a father who was overly-critical and perfectionistic. He works at the SAF and brought that same sort of mentality home. He would shout, berate and shame me if things weren't done his way. Everything had to be done perfectly. His words would drip with condescension when he spoke to me. Even something as simple as washing the dishes could get him riled up. 

As a result, I developed a huge fear of failure and a fear of making mistakes. I believe that I'm stupid, unworthy and just not good enough. I have no faith in my abilities, even simple abilities like being able to understand concepts is problematic for me. These seem like basic fears that most people struggle with to some degree, but unfortunately for me, they have become debilitating and have affected every part of my life. 

I survived in school as far as grades were concerned, but only because I could go home and study on my own. I had a difficult time with anything that required me to use my hands, like science experiments, or my brain, like being tested on the spot. I still remember how we had to do practicals every Thursdays in JC. I would lie in bed awake the night before, unable to sleep, and sick with worry. During the experiments, I would be so nervous that my hands would be trembling throughout the lesson. 

This extended to the non-academic side of things as well. I vividly remember an instance where my teacher asked me to count some money, I was so flustered, my heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I did not even trust myself to do something as simple as count money! 

I spent all my schooling years severely depressed. I had grown up in a highly dysfunctional family with a lot of other childhood trauma. It was an unstable environment, which eventually led to my own unstable mental state. 

I continued with school for as long as I could, but about 4 years ago, I dropped out of JC without completing my A levels. I couldn't do it anymore. I was suicidal, depressed, and couldn't focus in the slightest. Since then, I haven't worked either. I'm basically a NEET. I have tried going back to school twice since then but dropped out after a short period each time. 

I had one job once as an insurance telemarketer. I spent hours and hours rehearsing the script before the first day only for them to give me a completely different script , which completely threw me off. I was really bad at it too. After the first day, I never went back. I refused the money that they offered me for the 4 hours I worked on the first day because I had done a horrible job, and I didn't feel like I deserved the money. That’s the other problem I guess. I have always believed that I’m so unworthy and bad that I don’t deserve to be paid. It’s a terrible mentality.  

 I very clearly have issues and am in therapy trying to work through them. 

Every Chinese new year, I get the same questions and same looks  from relatives when they realise I'm not working or studying. I know that people view our worth based on how productive we are. But all that does is fill us with shame and perpetuate that inner narrative that we are useless. As someone who was raised to be ultra productive all the time, when I first dropped out school, I would starve myself because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I felt like I didn't even deserve to live because I was no longer a productive member of society.

Someone in my life made a comment recently that I am depressed because of unemployment and that basically I wouldn’t be depressed if I had a job. It made me feel terribly invalidated.

Sometimes I wish I could explain to people the helplessness I feel when they ask me why I've been unable to work so far. I wish I could explain that I can’t just pull myself up by my bootstraps, and the conventional advice of staying busy, exercising and eating healthy, though useful, doesn’t have a significant effect on depression that’s caused by deep rooted issues. It can help, but not to the extent that one might believe. It’s why I was depressed even while I was in school and busy. It’s why even though I still exercise, try to meet friends when I can muster the strength, eat well, take omega 3 acids, get plenty of sunlight, I still remain depressed. 

Having said that, there was some truth to that person’s comments. In my case, although staying busy has never helped with my depression, it does affect my anxiety levels. The busier I am, the less prone I am to angst. Working may not make me mentally well, but it’s a start. At the very least, it can give me a sense of purpose. Also, I can’t hide forever. I don’t want to hide forever. 

So that leads me to the purpose of my post. I find myself stuck in a rut, wanting to work but somehow paralysed by fear. I realise that exposure therapy of just getting out and doing it might help, yet the fear continues to overwhelm me. Therapy and medication have unfortunately not helped me.

There were a few who read that first post before I deleted it and messaged me with stories of their own. Reading those stories was very encouraging.

I’m posting here again because I really need some help.

People are gonna believe what they want and do things their way but PROTECT YOUR HEART. Not everyone is for you. Listen to the meaning behind their msg. If it\'s smth you can improve on, use it. If it isn\'t a voice, it\'s noise. Cast it. There\'re many things you can\'t control, but you can control how you react and what you choose to do.\n\nThere\'s power in words. Don\'t let words grip you of fear. You\'re not defined by opinions or situations. Don\'t look at yourself as who you are right now but who you\'re gonna be. Your setbacks are limitations. You\'re beyond that. Take charge in what you\'re telling yourself. Don\'t wait for someone to care for you. Care for yourself and love yourself first because you\'re important.\n\nWe\'re always a work in progress. I feared moving into the working world. I fear lots of things in life. I still fear interviews. It\'s okay but don\'t run away because sooner or later you still need to confront it. Take baby steps before moving on to big ones. You need to build your confidence slowly. Productivity can also mean enjoying yourself and resting because mental health is often overlooked but one of the greatest things important and necessary to look at. Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) offer emotional support. \n\nThat said, give yourself a timeline. Even if you tried and it didn\'t go as well as you\'d like, CREDIT yourself and TRY AGAIN.

I’m 25 years old and have been working for a few months now, with several internships previously. My friends all feel that I should have enough experience to be able to tackle work life pressure without issues, but that’s not true at all. The more I work the more demoralised I get because I get very self-critical with every mistake I make. Then when the next workload or job comes to me, the worse and more anxious I feel because of all the mistakes I made previously.\n\nYou’re right that you cannot keep running forever, the only way to tackle an issue is to face it somehow. However, I feel like one thing you should know is you have no time limit to face whatever issues you have, you can take all the baby steps you want. You said that you worked as an insurance telemarketer, but I feel that may be a too big step for you now; you need to be very eloquent and thick skinned enough to face rejection. It’s a difficult job even for normal people without the thick skin. \n\nI feel like you should consider whatever issues you wanna change about yourself, then think about how you can slowly work your way through it. In my case, I’m Super introverted and awkward, but I felt that its an important thing to socialise. So I started work as a simple goods packer, where I had to report to different supervisors. I then moved on to carnival part time sales, then to perfume etc. I could see that I improved over these experiences. I still have many flaws and get stressed out/depressed easily, but this “stepping stone” plan I set for myself is one of the few things I’m actually proud of myself in.\n\nCould you tell me if you have any particular interests or aims that you wanna set for yourself? Perhaps I can give you abit of advice on how you can work your way through it.\n\nI don’t think im able to fully understand your circumstance, as I have good friends and family but I still get anxiety and stressed over minor issues.

I might not be experienced enough but I’m just going to leave my advice here just in case:\n\nStart small. Do small jobs to build up your confidence or you can start volunteering first. Don’t care how old you are now or how low paying the job is, right now you have a personal issue that needs some help as it will affect how you react towards bigger responsibility or workload.

It said something along the lines of, “When you’re feeling down, talk to yourself like how you would to a friend who is upset.” Our words are always kind to others but not to ourselves, maybe you can practice that! \n\nMaybe when you’re doing something, teach yourself like how you would teach others. Use words that you would say or wished someone would say to you, when trying to comfort someone who has made a mistake.\n\nThough we might never cross paths, I really want you to feel better about yourself and be kind to yourself.

You sound like a creative person who writes very well. Your vocabulary is so much more than mine. Please take this compliment! \n\nFirst thing you gotta do is tell yourself what do you want to achieve each day (read for 30 mins, meditate, learn sign language, pick up writing [lowkey think you can pursue this area] etc) and do your utmost best to achieve it. And observe that if you fail to achieve, you learn that this is not the method to proceed, so change and adapt. Manage your expectations, and be gentle with yourself. We are our own best friend, and we are going to spend every second with our thoughts. Of course, you cannot stop negativity from coming, but you can rationalise and recognise that they are not part of you. Think of it as a passing storm.

It sounds to me like what you need is constant positive validation. Good luck!"", 'Hi OP,\n\nYou are young and it is ok not to work for 4 years. Different people have different things they need to do with their lives, and if you need time to take care of yourself, it’s valid and reasonable. A lot of relatives here like to gossip and cast judgments and that’s their right. BUT it’s also your right and your free will to give no fucks about their opinions.\n\nSimilar to you, I grew up in an unstable environment as well and was depressed and miserable for as long as I can remember.\n\nMy advice is that for a start, you can consider working part time. This gives you time to distract yourself (when at work) while also having time to sort out your issues. I did that for a year or so, working part time and taking it slow on my off days to work on my issues, think about life, reset my expectations. \n\nIt can be very scary at first trying something you think is too daunting. But persevere. I forced myself to do exposure therapy by going after things I fear the most. Sure, the first few months gave me endless panic attacks and messed up sleep cycles but after a while, you will improve. \n\nOn days when it’s tough, remind yourself to set your expectations low. Do what you can, but don’t push it. And when it’s the end of the day, don’t forget to cheer yourself on for your small but fantastic achievement. \n\nLike the other poster said, it’s about managing your condition and not about suppressing or curing it.

Yeah a job, staying busy, looking forward to things are important, but they\'re more like salves than anything else.  What you\'re looking for is the ability to face your depression and anxiety in the face on the daily and say ""Alright, let\'s go"" and walk out that door.  (Not literally with CB) :)\n\nAs for your work-issue, here\'s my take.  There\'s no shame in taking small steps.  Maybe instead of a job, it\'s more about grabbing coffee with friends who do have jobs and networking.  Maybe it\'s more about taking a part time gig that you can do online in your spare time (you seem super eloquent and well-spoken, so I\'m sure that can come in handy).  Maybe it\'s about volunteering your time at a Non-Profit or religious group or whatever floats your boat.  Someone below wrote ""baby steps"" and I agree: taking small steps is a great way, exposure therapy aside, to create change.  No one conquerers their issues in a day, it takes time and patience for most of us.\n\nAnd when you get down, reach out like you\'re doing now.  Talk to people who can listen and understand.  There are people out there whether in the form of family, friends, therapists, online strangers, they exist and want to hear from you.

This can be achieved in forms of meditation where you focused on your breathing. Mindfulness is the practise of being aware of your thoughts and the feeling of your body. When you are stressed, your mind wanders away, detaching from your body. Mindfulness helps by bringing it back and makes one become self aware of his thoughts, training calmness from within.

As a result, we have confidence issues and for me in particular lots of anxiety when things ain’t going my way.\n\nWhat help me into thinking I’m worthy and boost my confidence a little is to learn a new skill preferably something you can “see” that is tangible (eg learning to ride a bicycle, in-line skating, cooking).\nWhen you are able  “see” your achievements your confidence will kick in. \n\nMoving out of my house was the best thing that happened to me. Staying away from my narcissistic parent albeit she still calls me. \nGive a thought about your environment. An open and conducive away from bad visual cues (eg. Dad?) will help you to move forward in life. \n\nSomething I have learn during this covid season is the art of being patient. Being patient to yourself,. The world is such a hurried place and it does get to us.

Pretty late to this post but still thought that if you\'re looking for some answers or thoughts, maybe this might offer a little insight into things. \n\nFirst of all, the fear of failure is completely valid and understandable. Many people fear failure and you\'re not wrong for also being afraid of it, especially when the kind of education we go through kind of sees failure as something quite negative. But!! It doesn\'t mean that we can remain paralyzed in fear forever. Not sure if this might work for you but I like to think: what\'s the worst that could happen if I fail? If I work a job, say in an insurance calling job as you did, messing up my words or making a mistake and failing to deliver the Perfect Result to the customer would at the VERY WORST result in having to reach back out to the customer to rectify your faults and maybe, get you fired (though that\'s really very unlikely because firing someone requires more work than just showing you the ropes). \n\nSo let\'s say you do get in trouble at your job. What\'s the worst after that? Do you think less of someone else if they made a mistake at something they are unexperienced with? Be kind to yourself pal. I also have the habit of absolutely beating myself up over small mistakes but think of someone else in your position, and you\'d realize that you\'re more likely to forget about their mistakes and forgive them if they tried to be a better person than before. \n\nTo be fair, you might not resonate with this because every person thinks differently, but I hope it helps! \n\nFour years of not working can cause major inertia wherein you really don\'t feel the motivation to even try anymore. I\'d say to try and apply for at the very least 3 jobs a day and then give yourself a break. These jobs don\'t have to be office work or anything. Grab, foodpanda, Deliveroo are all great starting jobs if you want to work on things that are a little rinse and repeat, because ordering food can only get so different in each shop so chances of messing up gets lower with each run. Plus, it gets you out of the house and if you do say something wrong while ordering, the workers aren\'t going to remember you out of hundreds of customers. \n\nIf you feel really low energy, you can try for admin jobs where you\'ll need to be able to complete simple computer-related tasks. It shouldn\'t take too much out of you and you can build up a little ""office experience"". Every job is a good job, so go for whatever works for you. There may be jobs you don\'t even know exist that are great for you; stocking vending machines? Arranging flowers? Who knows\n\nWhat\'s really important is to give yourself time and space to make mistakes. The first month of a new job or experience always feels daunting, and I myself have ever quit a job in 2 days. But I\'d say, unless it\'s heavily impacting your health, give yourself at least one week to adjust. Making mistakes is how you learn and get better. Please don\'t beat yourself up over failures. \n\nI believe in you pal. Sticking it out and not giving up is so, so tough, but it\'ll be worth it. You got this. \n\nP.S.

stamfordmuffles,1589970729,gn8z8k,0,1,"I can't post on the main sg sub so I hope it's okay for me to post here. 

My story is simple. I’m 23 y.o. and  haven't worked in about 4 years. This hasn't been due to laziness, but due to issues that I haven't been able to overcome. 

My confidence regarding working and functioning are a result of a father who was overly-critical and perfectionistic. He works at the SAF and brought that same sort of mentality home. He would shout, berate and shame me if things weren't done his way. Everything had to be done perfectly. His words would drip with condescension when he spoke to me. Even something as simple as washing the dishes could get him riled up. 

As a result, I developed a huge fear of failure and a fear of making mistakes. I believe that I'm stupid, unworthy and just not good enough. I have no faith in my abilities, even simple abilities like being able to understand concepts is problematic for me. These seem like basic fears that most people struggle with to some degree, but unfortunately for me, they have become debilitating and have affected every part of my life. 

I survived in school as far as grades were concerned, but only because I could go home and study on my own. I had a difficult time with anything that required me to use my hands, like science experiments, or my brain, like being tested on the spot. I still remember how we had to do practicals every Thursdays in JC. I would lie in bed awake the night before, unable to sleep, and sick with worry. During the experiments, I would be so nervous that my hands would be trembling throughout the lesson. 

This extended to the non-academic side of things as well. I vividly remember an instance where my teacher asked me to count some money, I was so flustered, my heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I did not even trust myself to do something as simple as count money! 

I spent all my schooling years severely depressed. I had grown up in a highly dysfunctional family with a lot of other childhood trauma. It was an unstable environment, which eventually led to my own unstable mental state. 

I continued with school for as long as I could, but about 4 years ago, I dropped out of JC without completing my A levels. I couldn't do it anymore. I was suicidal, depressed, and couldn't focus in the slightest. Since then, I haven't worked either. I'm basically a NEET. I have tried going back to school twice since then but dropped out after a short period each time. 

I had one job once as an insurance telemarketer. I spent hours and hours rehearsing the script before the first day only for them to give me a completely different script , which completely threw me off. I was really bad at it too. After the first day, I never went back. I refused the money that they offered me for the 4 hours I worked on the first day because I had done a horrible job, and I didn't feel like I deserved the money. That’s the other problem I guess. I have always believed that I’m so unworthy and bad that I don’t deserve to be paid. It’s a terrible mentality.  

 I very clearly have issues and am in therapy trying to work through them. 

Every Chinese new year, I get the same questions and same looks  from relatives when they realise I'm not working or studying. I know that people view our worth based on how productive we are. But all that does is fill us with shame and perpetuate that inner narrative that we are useless. As someone who was raised to be ultra productive all the time, when I first dropped out school, I would starve myself because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I felt like I didn't even deserve to live because I was no longer a productive member of society.

Someone in my life made a comment recently that I am depressed because of unemployment and that basically I wouldn’t be depressed if I had a job. It made me feel terribly invalidated because it’s a simplistic view, one that unfortunately a lot of people in my life share, of the causes of depression. 

Sometimes I wish I could explain to people the helplessness I feel when they ask me why I've been unable to work so far. I wish I could explain that I can’t just pull myself up by my bootstraps, and the conventional advice of staying busy, exercising and eating healthy, though useful, doesn’t have a significant effect on depression that’s caused by deep rooted issues. It can help, but not to the extent that one might believe. It’s why I was depressed even while I was in school and busy. It’s why even though I still exercise, try to meet friends when I can muster the strength, eat well, take omega 3 acids, get plenty of sunlight, I still remain depressed. 

Having said that, there was some truth to that person’s comments. In my case, although staying busy has never helped with my depression, it does affect my anxiety levels. The busier I am, the less prone I am to angst. Working may not make me mentally well, but it’s a start. At the very least, it can give me a sense of purpose. Also, I can’t hide forever. I don’t want to hide forever. 

So that leads me to the purpose of my post. I find myself stuck in a rut, wanting to work but somehow paralysed by fear. I realise that exposure therapy of just getting out and doing it might help, yet the fear continues to overwhelm me. Therapy and medication has unfortunately not helped me. 

Something that did help, though, was reading your stories. 2 days ago, I submitted this post here but deleted it, together with that acc, within 10 minutes of posting because I was terrified. There were a few who read that first post before I deleted it and messaged me with stories of their own. Reading those stories was very encouraging. This has been a lonely experience, and more than anything, I need to know that there are others who’ve been through it and managed to find their way out of the rut. I’m posting here again because I really need some help. 

If you’ve been through something similar, even if just for a short period, please share. If you have advice for me, even if you’ve never been a neet, please share.

Contrary to one online article that I came across, which states the median salary of a fresh doctor graduate to be 5.2k, which is not true. The salary of a fresh doctor graduate is i think around 3.8-4.2k (can't remember) according to my friend. 
Furthermore, a doctor work hours in a week (according to guidelines) should not exceed 80hrs a week, yet many doctors worked beyond that (there was a straits timr articles on this). To put things into context, if I'm not wrong, my friend has been working day for day since sunday. My friend have clocked 2 'on-call duty' (one on call is 36hrs, a normal shift is 12hrs) this week, no rest days. Yes, doctors can't just leave at the end of the shift as patients might still need them. But isn't it contrary if doctors can't be healthy (work until exhaustion)? Even nus articles https://nusmedicine.nus.edu.sg/newsletter/issue26/insights/the-sum-of-all-fears state that doctors are 3 times more likely to develop depressive disorders.

irusz,1589212022,ghq12m,4,1,"Hi all. Could you all please some opinions on future directions - taking into account the impact of covid - based on the situation below.

I have been in this company going 2 years now and I am paid rather low. I am also not very skilled in office politics (perhaps that's why my low pay).

The manager is being described below. Also, there is the laojiao who is close to the manager. This laojiao I have overheard commenting on the rest of the team negatively after-work.

Laojiao constantly sleeps at work then do paid OT but nobody comments or criticises. Isn't it ridiculous?

The manager I have

\- said it out loud, 'oh, i'm just here waiting for retirement!' (I guess he's only about 59?)

\- is often uncertain which topic we are discussing during meetings (after 1 hour of meeting, he would voice out an opinion that is to the wrong topic, or he will say, 'oh we are discussing about this!')

\- often walked around the office the whole day to look at what other people in other teams are doing and will try to interfere

\- would speak to a laojiao team member for more than 2 hours at the cubicle probably just to kill time - or in his words, 'brainstorming' and 'actively problem-solving' by discussing some of the 'challenges' they are facing. I mean, well, after working in the same company for so many decades, can't he show some form of independent creative problem-solving skills?

His comments during meetings are not very well thought out and he would simply agree to some other managers suggestions. Or, he would ask the laojiao opinion first and then just agree with the laojiao.

Basically, I honestly don't think I can learn anything from this person. I don't really want to waste time at a lowly paid job with such a manager who has nothing to offer and yet, taking such a bigger pay check.

Without further ado, let me give a quick rundown of my situation at the moment. I was retrenched back in late March and I have been having difficulty in finding a job as I’m not a local or PR here (plus lack of quotas, I guess).
Besides the usual platforms like LinkedIn or JobStreet, I have also taken to Facebook groups to look for jobs.

So I saw an ‘okayish, not scammy-looking’ post in one of the group looking for an ‘admin assistant’. Texted the guy and he asked for my full name (I only gave out my first name + surname) and asked if I’m currently in Singapore - still normal for any recruit agencies or potential employers to ask.

I asked if he could further elaborate on the job scope and the company around 6pm and he only replied close to 2a.m, saying we can talk about it in the morning. Weird timing for any HR or recruiter to reply but okay.
Major red flag was, less than 2 hours later, this guy called me at 4:30 in the morning. I became suspicious and can’t shake off the feeling that this is either going to be those MLM shit or a scam.

In the late morning, he called again but I missed the call. After a bit of coaxing from my friend for being stupid since it seems like I’m half-assing my job hunt, I decided to just give it a go. 
So I said I will give him a call whenever he’s free which brings us to today! He asked if we can do the interview now though he’s busy so can’t accept calls atm and asked me to type my number and email. He then proceeded to say he’s going to send a SMS to my number soon, officially weirded out like why the need to when we already have WhatsApp??

Pretty soon, there was a message from him and shortly after, a message from Carousell with the OTP/4 digits code that you need to verify. 
He proceeded to ask me for the code and to check my message, then re-sent another request for the OTP.
I confronted him and asked if he was trying to use my number to register an account on Carousell.
To which he said and I quote,”no trying search some thing on there. what is the number,”. 

Blocked the number and here we are.

Dietsodalol,1588748497,gef3ye,12,1,"Hey guys I want to get some advice in terms of how I can make this happen within a 2 year time frame.


I live in Sydney Australia and want to move to Singapore, at least for a few years but its likely I'd like to get a PR and reside there for long term.



Now I know its not so easy to get sponsored so a little background about me that I think might be relevant.

Pros:

I'm currently working permanent full time in Sydney at a large MNC bank as a mortgage loan credit analyst, and I'm paid 90K per annum AUD before tax

A few years ago I applied and was approved for a working holiday in Singapore but never ended up going on it.

I'm in my mid 20s, recently graduated from a top university in Australia consistently top 50 in the world

I'm natively bilingual in both English and Mandarin, and interned in Hong Kong working in a bilingual environment at a large bank before I graduated. I'm ethnic Chinese if that matters.

Not expecting some kind of expat package or anything fancy, hell I'd be willing to take a pay cut even after tax for better future prospects.

Cons:

I'm only 1 year graduated out of university, COVID aside I'm still pretty ""green""

Now I'm expecting realistically I need to do at least another year to ""pay my dues"" for this to be likely, however I'd like to start being well prepared and working towards this goal. I'd love it if someone can chime in with they have an relatable experience or any insight on this.",askSingapore,10163,Moving to work and reside in Singapore from Australia,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/gef3ye/moving_to_work_and_reside_in_singapore_from/,1.0,"[""What's your motivation for moving here?

Australia is far too suburban for me after having interned in Hong Kong. Salaries are far too low for juniors in HK for living there comfortably to be viable, its better to work in Singapore and travel there I think.\n\n\nAlso a lot of practical factors, tax rate even at my current income is lower and means more disposable income in the long run, I also think in the long run my career will go further in Singapore."", ""Well 90k isn't as much as it sounds in Australia, after taxes etc, its in the range of 65-68K take home, not saying you can't live comfortably on that because for one person its enough to live well. However I'd say there are plenty of people in their 20s making far more than that in Singapore, and I'm sure also people fighting to get by with less just like Australia.\n\n\nI think outside of labour jobs overall the income levels in Singapore and Sydney are very comparable, with Singapore inching ahead above $100K mark for take home income."", 'What is your ethnicity and experience with Singapore?

It’s because companies here have to pay hefty amounts of money for you to work here and you’ll basically have to justify your cost, ie why they should hire you when they could hire a local which would be cheaper as they won’t have to pay a levy every month for a foreigner. They also have a head count limit on non PRs/Citizens.\n\nMy bet is would be you’ll end up about the same pay-wise because of taxes (maybe a little lower), if you were to take a similar job in terms of rank, from the little I know about Aus (tax is high there right?).

My husband is from a different country and he spent the better part of 3 years looking for a job, but his degree was not in a sector with huge demand in Singapore, and he lacked the experience and further qualifications needed to come in as a professional.

Oboeru_Nanaki,1587029076,g2bopd,5,17,"I’ll 1st admit, I’d been rather complacent toward the whole Covid19 situation. 
But now, I’m afraid.
Scared. 
Petrified.

When the whole virus 1st started, me and wifie had just left for our belated honeymoon around mid-Jan.
Our news outlet were quite limited but we did managed to get some info about what’s happening. Wifie did started to preamp the situation and decided we should stock up on some mask just in case, thus at the home stretch of our trip we went to the pharmacy only to find all mask have sold out.

This was back in late Jan/early Feb, our 1st true red flag.
I still brushed it off, thinking it will be over soon like all the other “animal flu” virus which happens almost every other year.

I went back to the job which I had dreaded, only to find all sort of plans rolling out in preparation for the (then) possible pandemic. Still thinking that we are probably overreacting but being part of my job, we went ahead with all preparation.
Still no urgency whatsoever.

By the time the 1st few clusters started to appear and some countries are putting up travel restriction, work have gotten more hectic, especially with the extended duration of medical leaves and some of my guys taking the opportunity to exploit the system. Rather than being anxious, I grew more frustrated over all the seemingly extreme measures that’s making my life difficult (I had to literally work over 12hr a day for 2 weeks straight).

I just wanted the stupid flu to get over soon so I can make some plans to set my career straight.

March came and things didn’t get any better.
Travel ban when on full swing and as grim as the situation looks, I was still looking at all possibilities available. Hotels were giving out crazy deals for local staycation and I was actually looking forward to the deals to cope with the growing stress from work. Although unconsciously I’ve been washing my hands much more than usual (even wifie noticed), I’m still not actively wearing a mask to work.

Until the Circuit Breaker announced…
I’ve never been a political person. I’ve never cared for all the rallies nor any of the speech from the PM or any local Minister (I follow more on Trump for a good laugh).
But that day 2 weeks ago, I found myself with all my colleagues sitting in front of the live stream waiting for the PM announcement. Even my client stopped their work and sat down with us to watch.

No more visit, no more gathering, no more shopping, no more loitering.
Things had gotten a turn for the worse. Even more so since wifie and I are staying apart and we won’t be able to meet for a whole month. She wept. My heart broke. 
I told her we can get through this. I told myself to be strong and put my career plans on hold.

Honestly even up until then I was still optimistic.
I told myself I’m still part of the lucky few who have the privilege to walk outside due to my job being part of the “Suicide Squad”. I can still shop at Donki near my work place after I knock off for dinner. The train have never been so empty before, finally I can nap on the ride home. 
Life still goes on…

Or so I thought…

Then 2 of my contractors from the M&amp;E team got quarantine order last week.
The rest of team and other term contractors are starting to get anxious. A chill went down my spine. 
Shit just got real…
Client demanded for actions from the company while the team manager had gotten more desperate and plead for help. My hands are tied as I have to prioritize on my own team 1st.

Suddenly all the jokes weren’t so funny anymore…
Even my favourite Youtube host shed a tear during his Q&amp;A…
(Gawd dammit, my hands are trembling)

An increasingly nagging feeling got the better of me yesterday and I sounded out my concerns to my client for the worst possible outcome. We discussed the possibilities and solutions.
Before we could end our conversation, the M&amp;E manager came in to deliver the bad new…
The whole team were called back to their dormitory for testing and isolation due to 2 confirmed cases in the dorm. The company have ZERO manpower available to support anymore.
My client’s jaw dropped, the scenario we had just discussed less than 10mins ago came true.

I sought out to my supervisor for advice.
He said his own hands are tied as well…
My own company have ZERO technician for all of our projects now…
He gave me the full command of my site and wished me good luck…

This morning as I walked to work with an extremely heavy heart, I watched as an elderly loitered at the park playing PokeGo. I watched as a few joggers ran by without mask. I watched a fellow passenger sat at the wrong seat on the train.

I’m not mad.
I’m scared.

I’m currently risking my life for these people who doesn’t understand the severity of this pandemic upon us. These people who are willing to risk not just themselves but also others for their own selfishness. These people who still thinks that our government is doing all these reliefs as some sort of propaganda for the coming elections.

I’m afraid…
I miss my wife…

lingacademe,1601362906,j1ua2r,12,1,"To keep it short and simple,

I live in a HDB with my mom, and she is an avid gardener. She has quite a collection of plants (but not to the extent of being a fire hazard or anything) outside our unit, in the common corridor area.

Over the last couple of years, mysterious acts of sabotage have been done to my poor mom's precious, beautiful, fruit-bearing plants that she works so hard caring for.

These have included inexplicable (inasmuch as natural causes/explanations are concerned) sudden shrivelling up/deaths of newly sprouted plants, which raised my mom's suspicion of the neighbour poisoning her them.

Today was the last straw for my non-confrontational, pacifist mom. She was pushed to the point of desperation and frustration when she told me a while ago that she now found her freshly sprouted chillies being artificially cut in halves, looking like the evil deed was probably done with a fingernail. So, my mom finally asked me (I had been pestering her forever to seriously consider, but she was hopeful enough to wait and see the sabotage stop one day) how much would it be to install a CCTV outside our doorstep (it irks me to even write this, realising we have to splurge our money during these trying times on a security device because of an evil neighbour)... And she also sat down to handwrite a note saying she knows they (specifically, the man of the household. More on him later) have been the ones responsible for her plants' misfortune. Sadly, though, we currently have no proof against them.

Now, who is this man, and why are we so confident that it's him? Well, the family in this unit next to ours actually has nice people, except literally this guy. His wife and children and sweet and normal folks, but this fella is rude and exudes an obvious aura of hostility against us since time immemorial for God knows what reason. Furthermore, there are only two units for the whole stretch of the corridor in question---ours, and this family's. It's just bewildering there would be anyone else also bo liao to come all the way to our unit to sabotage our plants.

Oh and I almost forgot, this man has been playing territory games with us since time immemorial too, using garbage objects and plants as his chess pieces to take up as much corridor space as possible. As a result, since my family moved here in the 90s, my mom's plants has been sadly corned into only one little section of the corridor, whereas the selfish man takes 3/4 times that much space (and doesn't even use most of it! He only uses 1/2 sections for a few plants and laundry. Most of his 'marked territory' are just blank spaces which could've been given to my mom to spread out her slightly cramped plants).

So, please, apart from spending more of our own money to engage a lawyer and pay that lawyer to sue this bugger ... Is there any other course of action available to my poor mom that's free and hopefully effective (unlike CASE for unethical retailers)? I'm open to listen to any advice please.

Johnathan_wickerino,1601304642,j1dedp,7,1,"I never passed a single Chinese exam in the entire 5 years I was at secondary school and finally got put into basic Chinese class after writing ""Fuck You"" in a preliminary essay and going to sleep lmao. I was immediately sent to the DM and later the HOD of Chinese and somehow got put into Basic.  And I found that unless you are going to JC and then Ultimately to UNI there really is no point spending time actually revising Chinese at all and doing damage to your other grades granted I wasn't a very good student anyway. I still got into Poly though and one of my peers though got E8 for English but scored overall better than me went to nursing because no other courses would accept her English standard which is fucking sad because honestly she deserved a better course than me considering her other grades although nursing could be a good profession I'll give you that.

So, I've been thinking since most people can communicate with English pretty well nowadays and not really in mother tongues not their own especially the younger generation there really is no point in teaching mother tongues anymore not to the extent we are anyways. I feel like it would increase our overall competency of the English language and pretty much stop the use of broken English. Broken English I feel is a real problem as not only is there no real application for half English half Chinese/insert mother tongue it also diminishes our competency in both languages as we can just replace words we don't know in another language rather than learning it leaving people with half empty vocabulary in possibly both languages.

I know Mother tongue is only a few hours per week but I feel like because Chinese is such a difficult language to master that I know some people who have to revise extra hard to over compensate for a subject that doesn't really help them in Poly which arguably is better than JC as you have knowledge in the sector before actually applying for a job while in JC you don't and have to go to UNI which isn't possible for everyone.

    Person X: Keep your bullshit apologetics to yourself.

Few days ago I came across this thread in a sub reddit. The pretext is as above. My POV was that the muslim was just sharing his religious beliefs and halal meat with a non-Muslim and I thought it was really harsh and offensive to shoot down someone else's religion like that by calling it bullshit. It was extremely uncalled for.  


Now I responded to person X asking what did I miss and why was he/she so offended? I am surprised that the rude comment received 7 upvotes in the subreddit r/germany and the muslim was downvoted.  


I explained to Person X that it is extremely offensive to all Muslims to call halal meat bullshit because he/she does not think it is ""scientifically sound"". Instead Person X seems to be interpret that as someone ""sharing an argument"" and therefore he/she is well within his right to be offended when being shared an illogical and unscientific article. Person X is completely unable to see that the muslim is only sharing about his religion. I even explained to Person X that that is extremely offensive to ALL MUSLIMS and he literally refuses to either believe or understand it. This person X also appears to be a PHD or post-doc in a scientific field because he compared the page with a scientific paper.  


My question is this:

* Would you also think Person X statement is offensive to muslims? (I am not muslim)
* Is there some cultural differences and understanding in other countries where people actually have no regard or knowledge of respect towards other religions and cultures? (This subreddit is in germany and I am seriously shocked germany has this POV especially when they have so many turkish muslims)

&amp;#x200B;

Please share your thoughts??? This Person X seriously thinks he is not being a racist and that he is within his rights to tell a Muslim halal meat is bullshit science. If you're a muslim, how would you interpret this? If you're not muslim, thoughts??

I don't have any preexisting medical conditions or any mental health issues, although I had to see an SAF Psychiatrist (because when I was very young I saw one), but the appointment was quite short seeing that I'm coping well despite the stress coming from the A Levels.

deitambi,1599733536,iq0pzr,11,1,"Writing in in hopes that I can do something for a friend and also would be helpful if someone in similar boat could shed some lights on overcoming this challenge. 

Thought would be good to give a bit of a background as this isn't a common enquiry for self improvement. I have a friend (anon) who has been battling with depression due unhealthy personal relationships with ex partner and family. Insecurity plays a very strong role here as anon would constantly be trying to prove to these people that their negative perceptions towards anon are incorrect. As a result overcorrection tend to happen as anon couldn't stand being judged for things anon did not do.

So anon tend to ""get real"" with anyone who came across as contesting anon on what is right. Over the last few years I known anon, this happened a few times whenever a comment triggers anon. Anon would go into rage mode and furiously question the other person for the comment that may not even be directed to anon as it seem like it ""implied something"". It was difficult to identify what are the actual triggers but I learnt over the years to avoid delving into certain subjects and know how to de-escalate situations (ie. Cut things short and bring anon out before anon enters full rage mode) 

However, there was only so much of avoidance that can be done. Shit finally hit the fan recently when I wasn't around; anon lashed out at our close friends that we had mutually known for years because anon was triggered by a comment implying that someone else wouldn't end up like anon if they learnt about holding their alcohol well when they are younger. They decided to walk out as to them, they couldn't talk things through when anon was berating them. Anon kept telling them to retrace what they say but it was impossible as both sides are mad at different things (anon for feeling judged for that comment while our friends were furious that anon trashed at them over unclear reasons). 

 After understanding the situation, it turns out it was more a joking but deprecating remark that was led from an earlier conversation where our friend expressed that anon shouldn't be preaching others on what to do if anon couldn't practise what anon preached. 

As an insecured person myself, I understand how certain phrases can rub me the wrong way so I can emphatize how anon felt but to go on an explosive rage mode to get real and end relationships doesn't work.

blkplumber,1599620787,ip855o,63,1,"I've been trying to help one of my siblings' kids to prepare for psle. Kid is a middle child and goes to a neighborhood school. Family is lower middle income or higher low income. 

I found out early on that kid has issues beyond academics. Part of it is middle child syndrome I think. Other parts include home environment, upbringing, etc. 

I do this purely voluntary. I had hoped to instil an appreciation of why must study. 

Problem is kid seems to be languishing in despair. Given up. There have been occasions where kid tells me they're not feeling well and asking to postpone session. 

I want to give kid benefit of doubt but gut feeling is kid can't deal emotionally and is trying to avert session. 

Times like this I really don't know what to do. I don't think there's a point to forcing kid to sit through the session. But time is also running out. Psle written papers is a month or so away. Every session missed means kid will be less prepared. 

Kid isn't exactly dumb. But clearly lacks motivation and desire to try. Some written exams, the answers kid gave weren't wrong but they were too simple and didn't give enough of the required info being tested. Math questions yield similar results. Mistakes mostly careless or result of not trying. 

I feel bad not being able to help more. I'm afraid of pushing too hard as I don't want to stress kid more than already is. 

Would appreciate any tips or advice from folks with experience dealing with kids who have given up like this. This isn't about psle. It's about trying to ensure kid doesn't get lost in the spiral of hopelessness through life.

Currently 18 now but i feel a lot more motivated in life and can say I\'ve regained my self confidence, and have been trying to have an optimistic mindset. I cannsay I\'m doing fairly well when compared to others in the aspect of manners, vision in life and discipline.\n\nPrimary and secondary school I really dreaded. The pressure of being in the school, having no one you can trust to talk to, even the teachers made me lose motivation to come to school.\n\nSoon afterwards i realised the importance of having someone in our life that we can look up to, and share our problems as well as have enjoyable conversations with. How i noticed this was that those with good attendance, good grades and had no beef with the teachers always had friends to talk to and hang out with during recess and after school. My attendance lacked because i didn\'t see the purpose of going to school as it was boring and depressing. Same thing everyday. Then when i actually have a nice conversation with someone, my mood somehow cheered up and i felt better the whole day. \n\nThere were also a few loner kids in my class and had bad attendance and guess what? They also had no one to share their day with in conversations.\n\nNo one really enjoys the studies and memorisation in school, but they enjoy the friends there and they each help one another to focus on studies. Everyone is going through the same curriculum, but the loners feel like they\'re the only one going through the pain. Much like in NS, you\'ll basically die if you seclude yourself from platoon mates.\n\nThe teachers tried ""helping"" by calling up psychiatrists and what not. But I refused to open up, because he had a link with school and i hated the school system. Every mistake you made was dealt with punishments and not advice nor encouragement. So i never ever exposed my feelings even to the nicest of teachers.\n\nThis is my 2 cents, and maybe it\'s his issue too. School discipline system really sucks and now that i think of it, the rich principles with BMWs were kind of cocky and if they were to be in charge of some system that you were in, as an adult, you\'d understand that this person is not in the right.

To expect a 12 year old to take an examination that pretty much determines the rest of his/ her education life (or at least the next step) is quite unreasonable. With that in mind some of his behaviour (not being motivated to study) is expected. The first thing you want to do is to determine the attention span of the kid. With this you can come up with schedules that suite his attention span. (Etc. If the child has an attention span of 20mins, maybe try a 30 min session with a 10 min break) what this does is that it trains the kid to extend his attention span while maximising his learning per unit time. (The brain is a muscle and muscles need to be trained) Next would be to seek a for of incentive. When I was younger my motivation would be to watch tv. Perhaps you can motivate him by giving him 3 study sessions (30mins study 10mins rest X3) before an hour of his leisure time. Ensure he sleeps at a reasonable hour (10pm i suggest) so that he has time to rest. In addition, before he sleeps make sure that he has a summary (no more than 15mins) of what he has learnt as research has shown that your remember the information best when viewed before sleeping.

So my mum and dad hasn't been on talking terms for 2 weeks because they fought. Recently, they fought again because my grandma bought a new kettle. The old kettle has some minor issues but still functional. Yes over a bloody kettle....so my mum scolded her. I stand up for my grandma and scolded my mum. My mum jumped to the conclusion where she thinks i side my dad and ask me to move out with him. Seriously though, i stand up for my grandma because she is 82 years old and i find this to be bullying. I fought with my mum everytime whenever i try standing up for my grandma. My mum also gets impatient whenever my grandma ask her like ""Can i cook dinner?"" or ""Do you want to drink some soup?"". My grandma honestly does alot of household chores like laundry, go downstairs to buy food for my brothers &amp; i and many other things. On weekends, my grandma will go out of the house to give my mum space. There are times where i see my grandma alone in the park just staring at empty space. Whenever my mum comes home from work, my grandma will go to her room and sits on her bed quietly till she sleeps. Its really saddening to see an elderly living her life like this. Sometimes she can be seen looking at pictures decades ago which honestly breaks my heart even more. My mum never once give a shit about what my grandma done and start picking on her over the smallest things. Both my brothers never really appreciate my grandma and find her to be annoying sometimes.  I ain't close with them either and my second brother would randomly flare up, calls me good for nothing and hopeless because i am not good in academics. I am ok with my eldest brother but we don't talk alot. My mum is really a good mother by supporting us. I really just can't stand the way she treats my grandma.  As for my dad, he don't contribute anything to the family. I am in a situations where i can't feel like this is a family. My mum and dad has been considering divorce for years but they are staying for the sake of this ""family"". As much i want to side one of them, i don't have an apparent reason to do so. I simply stand up for what seems wrong. If there is a situation where my grandma ill treat my mum. I will definitely stand up for her. There are thoughts where i really wanna move out from the house but i am only 21 and the youngest. I sleep on the couch because i don't have a room myself despite living in a 5 room flat. The only time i felt peace and positivity was during NS where i had a bed and being away from home. I am really mentally drained and might have a breakdown anytime soon.

In need of advice badly.,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/ikbltv/mentally_drained_from_toxic_family_in_need_of/,1.0,"[""Hi there mate, first as a child of divorce myself, it is your parents choice to make not yours. I dont mean that rudely, I'm saying it to remove that responsibility from you. Right now lets get on the house bit. I was fortunate enough to have lived away from my house. I went to boarding school and then university and such. I'd suggest you pick yourself up and get out of there. What are your plans currently ? think about it. Think about what you really want. If it is to be at peace with yourself so you can have a steady job do what you think is the most viable way. If I had a chance at NS which I didnt get because I got pes F i think that is right, I would 100% have signed on. Just cause it was a stable income, looks good on CV have my own life and gives me time to prep for anything in the future in those three years. And you're only 21. you have the time. this is just my thoughts. I would say get a part time job, grab or foodpanda pays decent. Do it in your off time if you cant find a better one. Start a saving acccount. standard charted is good. And move on mate\n\nEdit: You got this. You have a good heart and it isnt fair you are in this situation but pick yourself up and find you safe space everytime you lose it a little. Breathe and re look at your goals. and just keep trudging through the muck"", 'Hey, my dad lost his company more than a decade ago due to the last recession. He has been in low morale ever since, for a businessman to have lost everything he has sacrificed for: time away from kids ,wife , silently suffering the days where theres low profit, anxiety , loneliness. \n\nIt hits a man hard. Hits the family hard. \n\nIm guessing your dad is trying to recover from this trauma. Help him out a little , go out for suppers , drinks. Men don\'t grow up, so they do enjoy what we enjoy too. Then bounce some ideas off him and spark his passion again. Thats what i would do. But when i came to realise it , it was too late , my dads too tired and old to want to do anything now. He just wants to chill . \n\nYour mom probably has it hard at work. Probably stressed everyday. When she comes home she just wants time alone. Quietly. But its never gonna be quiet and items and systems will never be in place because theres a ""stranger"" in the house. She doesnt have the mental capacity to even begin understanding your grandma. Just look at all the ""terrible bosses/ toxic work culture"" posts in the recent times and you get a taste of what it could probably be like. \n\nSo here\'s where it breaks down. \n\nYour grandma just trying to be nice but your mom cannot begin to put herself in gma\'s shoes cos shes so tired. I mean she feels like shes carrying everything. Your gma seems to understand and takes a step back, but she can\'t begin to fix things because she is constantly getting scolding. \n\nYour mom feels so emotionally drained , mentally hanging there , always in anxiety that shes the only one pulling things together. But she cant even enjoy her life. She probably needs a break and emotional support. But your dad probably isnt in the right mindset or position to do it. Im thinking he finds it hard to speak with her. \n\nYour dad seems to be in the pits. Im just guessing this now since not as much has been written about him. \n\nYou and your brothers are probably in the best position. Your mom won\'t pick on you like she does your grandma and dad. So bring her out and separate her. Even if its just a meal. It helps. \n\nYour dad well, men don\'t express as much unless they feel they can. So go drinking , have a beer or two , talk nonsense. Things naturally will open up eventually. \n\nGrandma needs someone to speak to. In old age everything deteriorates fast. Especially in this scenario. Its alot to handle being the victim of the house but at the same time trying to understand your son and daughter in law. Also that gap in age doesn\'t help.\n\nSo thats what i would do. Then see how it works out before thinking about whats next. If you  instead choose escape the situation like moving out or what not. Theres a massive risk that what you see now will breed into something worse in the future.', 'This is probably the right way. Dont paint me as a bad guy but i guess my family was too far gone and we all had to pick extremes. When none of us were mentally healthy it is hard to look past the things that drain us really. Space gave us a way to recover in some sense. anywho I hope you are doing better now!', ""Nah, sometimes we just weren't mature enough to understand things before they happen. For some its too late. OP made the right choice to open up and ask for advice, i hope he can get advice from mature people ard him as well. Then cross check if it makes sense, since we don't know the details.\n\nEdit: just read your advice for op. Sorry if I was insensitive. I guess your situation is very much different. I probably would have reacted the same way."", ""I totally understand where you are coming from. Yup i had thoughts of signing on just because i wanna be away from home but it wouldn't be something i want to do. What you said really brings a thought of working on myself more instead of fully dwelling on what is happening around me. Really appreciate the advice, thank you so much!"", ""Totally 100% agree on getting that part time job. I do food delivery and it helps take my mind off things , keep fit and earn some income. I really enjoy it tho i wont go hungry without it. Theres alot of positivity among riders, kampong spirit is probably the closest description i can get to. Adds to the fun of it all. \n\nAnd/Or! Go get an internship to build your portfolio and align it to your goals. Alot of companies need hands but can't afford a full timer now. So it will be a rush of experience (as you will highly likely be doing a fulltimer's job) for you, but don't mind the minuscule pay for now. Once your resume is good, you will jump faster than your peers. \n\nLike labrat said , you definitely got this. Change up your mindset abit and be positive, surely something good will happen. :)"", ""My dad has already reach the age of being too tired as well. Its a sad fact that he is gonna retired with very little savings. I fully agreed on my mum being too tired from work because she supports the family on her own. I can only hope that one day she actually try to understands my grandma but this seems like wishful thinking for now. You are right, i can't really communicate with my grandma because my chinese is pretty bad haha but i will try my best. I will definitely take what i can do with my mum and dad in consideration. Thanks for such good written advice. Appreciate it!"", 'Thank you for the suggestions (: Yes i definitely need to build my resume haha!', 'My Chinese is not top notch also. Doesnt help that they mix dialect in. Just try little steps to talk to your gma. They always will try to communicate and they always appreciate you trying to talk to them. Especially your gma , she sounds like a nice lady. Not those old sour types. \n\nYour dad can try doing grab car or smth. Its chill, be your own boss kinda thing. My dad enjoys changing cars everytime the lease is up. HAHA. \n\nStart with your mom first i would say. Sounds like shes the one who urgently needs attention. \n\nI always tell myself. My parents will go one day. It could be today , tomorrow , 10/20 years later. Who knows. But when they go , would I have known their story? Would i have known them personally like a friend?', '婆媳之争。。。\n\nTo be honest, even as someone who truly believe in talking things out, my experience with my own family and my friends ’tells me the options are very limited. The relationship between a women and her husband’s in chinese culture seems to be an issue for many family.\n\nI don’t necessarily see divorce as a bad thing (of course, you may disagree, depending on your values). To me, a family is a group of people (often related by blood or marriage) willing **to coexist** together. \n\nBe it grandma at fault or mom at fault, your dad will always be the one in the middle. It is up to your dad and  mom to decide how this family will coexist. If no consensus can be reached, divorce isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If living apart means both parties can live happier, why not? Whether it’s divorce or getting grandma to live elsewhere, same reasoning.\n\nI have no clue what I’m trying to say, just stuff that’s off the top of my head.\n\nAt the ends of the day, their marriage, their decision. Divorce does not necessarily mean a disintegration or a family (again, depending on your values). The responsibility is not yours, you are not obligated to feel sorry or guilty.', 'Hello, I have had similar experiences myself. I was always the middle person preventing fights and standing up for either one of them. I never picked sides but everyone misunderstood and thought I was with the other and started emotionally blackmailing me. Didn’t help that they decided to live together “for the kids” after a fierce divorce either. I’m suffering the after effects of all that simply because I decided to intervene whereas my sister was not affected in the way that I was (she just became apathetic). I don’t see how the situation could be helped and I don’t see how your situation can be solved either. Sorry if it sounds too harsh. If you continue intervening this way, it’ll do nothing and cause you more trauma and pain. \n\n\nThe “other” side is always the villain in the other side’s eyes and they’ll never change unless the circumstances change. The others who commented that you should relieve your grandma’s suffering or your dad/mom’s stress by getting them away from the house though? I think it’s the only thing that may work. You’ll need a lot of emotional capacity for this and I’m so sorry that your brothers are like this. They probably unknowingly tuned out their sympathy/empathy from the stress or simply do not have the maturity to realise this needs to be fixed and it’s not just an annoyance. You could try to have a heart-to-heart talk with them if possible. It may not work. \n\n\nI hope that you’ll monitor your mental health alongside all this and know when to step away. Sometimes, things are just a certain way and there’s nothing we can do but help make someone feel a little better. If you do decide to abandon everything, it’s not your fault either. You never chose this situation.', 'Hey there, coming from a dysfunctional family whose parents once tried to stab each other.\n\nThere are some really useful advice provided, wish I have known this a lot sooner. Adding my 2 cents worth:\n\n- Family: it may be easier to break the ice with more “effort” to be seen in building relationships or contributing to the family. It is not purely about doing things. It is about slowly making the family know that you are doing things (without you telling them).\n\n- Allies: You wont be able to change the world alone. So enlist the help of your family. Delegate tasks to others, propose ideas and let others be responsible. This will help to amplify the impact you are making, and at the same time allowing others to be involved as well. You are just human, and will need help.\n\n- OP: Please remember that you are the most important person to you. You will not be able to do much if you are burned out, frustrated, or all in all not functional. As such, please take care of your own emotional &amp; mental health.  Take time to relax, know that you are doing your best. With that, even though it is uphill, you will have the strength to go through.\n\n\nThat’s what I did to survive. So take care and know that you are a filial son wanting to stand up for your grandma and to make a difference. Reach out if you need help, and Jia you!', 'Hi hi! Hope you are feeling better. Just know that your situation isn’t that unique (and therefore you might not be alone in facing such familial issues) and things will get better as you become older.\n\n1. It’s not for you to ‘figure everything out’. So if you feel tired and don’t want to think too much it’s okay. The people here on reddit can give advice, but you have to steel yourself because you are in important years of forming your identity for the rest of your life.\n\n2. Whatever you do, don’t get bitter. It’s okay to get angry/frustrated/tired, but don’t let it corrupt your spirit. I’m an auntie and I would like to tell this because I know from experience when you become bitter, unfortunately good people might stay away because they might not understand your back story. Get help, but don’t get bitter.\n\n3. I highly suggest you start looking for SAFE accommodations be it with relatives or perhaps if you are able to get into University hostel etc. then visit your gran on weekends where she is the most vulnerable as your mum is not working. I was the opposite of you. My grandma was abusing me on a daily basis. I regret not moving out earlier, thinking I can’t do it. \n\n4. Your dad might feel helpless also as he is not the one earning money. Rope him in for help as he might still feel tender towards your grandma.\n\nRope in your elder brother’s help. I know he doesn’t talk to you much, but sounds like he might be reasonable. Let him know your concerns Eg grandma staring into space during what is supposedly her golden years. He might not be as unreasonable as your second brother.\n\n5. If you feel you cannot take it, try to make new friends. Be it church, or hobby group etc. there are many adults who are willing to help. But just remember to keep safe and keep your wits about you.\n\nDon’t really know how else to advice you but keep us updated.', ""My own father's business wasnt doing great when I was around your age - alcoholism took him in lesser than a decade. I agree with what some others have said about talking to him, and letting him know you're there for him through your actions. \n\nBeyond that, you don't really have control over whether he decides to pick himself up, so don't beat yourself up over that."", ""Its heartwarming to see you thinking of your grandmother and trying to make things better. I feel like perhaps if you have the time, you could bring you grandma out for a simple lunch/dinner, it could be in the nearby coffeeshop or hawker center. It will really make her happy :)\n\nYour siblings is probably frustrated about your family the same way as you are but they might not be able to express themselves well.

Don't be shy to hit ENTER.\n\ndysfunctional family is more common than a lot of people think of. I can't give a sound advice as different families have different skeletons and mess, with a lot of biases and intricacies.  \n\nwhat i would suggest is, being 21 year old and youngest should not be the reasons holding you back from regaining your sanity and mental health. take a leap of faith (and more), move out, sleep at whatever decent room with a door that you can find if you must (yes, i'm talking about bomb shelter/maid room), save every single cent like no other tomorrow, get multiple jobs, build your own financial freedom, find your solitary and peace, take care of yourself. \n\nby the end of the day, you will be very lonely, with a fiercely independent trait (and probably hard to build very close and meaningful human relationships), if you survive the ordeals. But you will have a peace of mind. \n\nTrust me, I know exactly what i'm talking about."", ""take good care... you're a good person and I wish you well."", ""I don't think I can say much that someone else hasn't already said in this thread, but you're being too harsh on yourself. This situation you have with your family isn't your burden alone to carry and you shouldn't feel that it is. Whatever happens between your elders at home should not be your responsibility to fix. They are, after all, individuals just like you and the only individual you are responsible for in this situation of yours is yourself.\n\nSo long as you have done your part within reasonable means to try and help your family situation, you have done enough. Whatever your parents decide to do with their marriage, however your mother treats you grandmother, none of it is your responsibility. You just have to accept whatever is happening and find ways to make the best out of whatever you can.\n\nThe most pragmatic advice I can give you is: focus on yourself. If you can't take care of yourself, there's no way you can even try to take care of the situation you have at home. Do what you can within your means if you wish to improve your family situation, but do not go to the point of exhaustion. Also if you need to, consulting social workers who are trained to deal these sorts of family situations might be another possible course of action.\n\nTo end off on a happier note, congrats on your ORD fam.

My mum never once give a shit about what my grandma done and start picking on her over the smallest things. Both my brothers never really appreciate my grandma and find her to be annoying sometimes.  I ain't close with them either and my second brother would randomly flare up, calls me good for nothing and hopeless because i am not good in academics. I am ok with my eldest brother but we don't talk alot. My mum is really a good mother by supporting us. I really just can't stand the way she treats my grandma.  As for my dad, he don't contribute anything to the family. I am in a situations where i can't feel like this is a family. My mum and dad has been considering divorce for years but they are staying for the sake of this ""family"". As much i want to side one of them, i don't have an apparent reason to do so. I simply stand up for what seems wrong. If there is a situation where my grandma ill treat my mum. I will definitely stand up for her. There are thoughts where i really wanna move out from the house but i am only 21. I sleep on the couch because i don't have a room myself despite living in a 5 room flat. The only time i felt peace and positivity was during NS where i had a bed and being away from home. I am really mentally drained and might have a breakdown anytime soon.

nvzzi99,1598244241,ifijie,55,1,"Currently 6 weeks in NS, PES BP, had a really bad break up with my ex 2 months before it. Still trying to move on. Not really sure of what the future holds anymore, nor do I feel like I could find a partner especially at this age. 

Context -
I do have issues with self esteem, anxiety and depression, its one of the main reasons why my ex left aside from her mother being against my ex converting into my religion. 

Since I'm 21 now, I feel as though my chances of meeting someone else might be little to none since I probably wont be in a ""classroom"" setting, or smth like that. University is on my mind, but entering it is another issue as well.

Is this feeling of hopelessness normal? and if so, does it get better once I'm older?

2000000821,1597399409,i9j8qk,7,1,"Hi, a few of you may have saw my comments on the daily thread ranting about my mother's time in the public hospital. Decided to make a post to share more about it. 

*Could someone help me to crosspost this to* r/singapore*? My account sadly do not meet the requirement. Thank you! :"")*

Firstly, she was super adamant about going to polyclinic because she feared that she would have to stay in the ward and not being able to take care of us.  (before flaming me, the entire family members has been advising her to at least go seek doctor for opinions.). Months later, she finally decided to go to polyclinic for checkup. 

Polyclinic doctor, without touching her breast, told her ""Ma'am, you have cancer."" Obviously, she was shocked by his comment since he did not touch to check for any lumps or get her to do any diagnosis. Next, the doctor said to her ""Ma'am you should definitely go to **xxx hospital,** it is a good hospital."" But **from the referral letter she received, she saw yyy hospital instead.** My mom called her friend for update, her friend told her to go to xxx hospital since the friend went there before. 

Mom went to **xxx hospital** the next day, taking polyclinic doctor advise/recommendation. 

And boyyy, it was a miserable 3 days stay in. I felt so much anger every time she updates my grandfather about the way she was been treated, the situation she was in. 

**Nurse took her to the ward where there may be covid-19 patients lying there**. I do not know how hospital stays in works, but why did the nurse took her there? Wouldn't it be dangerous for my mom? 

 So, a doctor came to find her and asked her why she was sleeping in the ward which was for **isolation**. She was obviously confused and stunned. They thought that she did not understand English and decided to talk in English. They were mentioning how the **trainee doctor forgot to sign her in** so she had to pay the costs. 

Besides that, she also had to get **swabbed**. 

But **thank you to the two other nurses who were really nice to her!** She appreciates the gesture very much. 

On the other hand, the doctor who was tasked to her was a **trainee doctor.** A trainee doctor. Not that there is anything wrong with that, but damn, a potential cancer patient under the hands of a trainee doctor. 

There were multiple doctors commenting on my mom case. One said ""**You have cancer.**"", next doctor said ""**You do not have cancer!**"". Mom decided to ask them if it is possible to have breast surgery since we do have a history of two relatives whom have breast surgery and they are still living well and fine. But a new doctor told her ""**No, it is not possible! You have cancer near the bone.**"" So many opinions, vast differences. 

&amp;#x200B;

They kept on touching her breast to check for lumps (I supposed.) . I mean, okay, it is fine for ya'll to be checking your patient illness. BUT, she kept on bleeding and they did not give her any medicines to clean the wound. It is also painful for her and they did not take into accordance of her feelings. She wanted to get more medicines (I think the good kind nurse ordered more medicines for her..?) but they didn't allow my mom to take the medicines.

They did not want her to be discharge but luckily she was able to come home today safely.

The total pay amounted to around $2k+, but government subsidies really helps. However, this was really a huge disappointment for me.  The lack of attention towards patients and the messiness from the doctors pisses me off.

drshne,1596769310,i562k8,95,1,"**TL;DR: I made the decision not to convert to another religion for love.**

I’m someone who has always believed that a central message in all religions is love. We are somehow taught to love other living beings around us, but it kind of upsets me to think about certain practices and laws within organised religion that limit the ability to love. 

So just to give you guys some context, I was in an inter-religious relationship (*I’m Hindu and he’s Muslim*) for slightly more than a year, and things were going as great as they possibly could (*I mean no relationship is perfect but this by far was the healthiest relationship I’d ever been in lol*). At the one-year mark, we somehow ended up discussing the future, and marriage a couple of years later. Now, here’s where things went downhill. He brought up the need to convert to Islam for his parents (*who are devout Muslims*) because as per their law, marriage without conversion (*basically a civil marriage*) would not be considered legal and thus he’d be living in sin with me despite the fact that we’d be legally married as per Singaporean law. 

There were multiple discussions about this and I naturally sat down to list down what was at stake here, and let’s just say there was more for me to sacrifice here than him. Just to name a few:

1. My literal identity would have to **change**. That means all legal documentation (*passport/IC etc*) would be revised to show my new given name and to change my religion as well.
2. I would no longer be able to participate in any Hindu rituals or rites, which means in the case my sibling gets married I would not be allowed to participate in the event as the elder sibling. This extends to funerals as well, when my parents pass on, I would not be allowed to say goodbye or perform funeral rites for them as a daughter. It works the same if the roles were reversed here.
3. Religion has always been a personal relationship with a higher being, we all just worship them in different forms. Converting to his religion would have ultimately been only because I’d want to live with him. Is that reason truly enough?
4. I would have to attend religious classes and to get examined on whatever I’ve learned, after which I’d have to put them all into practice as well. I’m talking about the 5 pillars of Islam here: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/fivepillars.shtml](https://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/practices/fivepillars.shtml)
5. I wasn’t someone who wanted kids, but with him, I was open to having just one. However, as per their culture, couples should have at least 3 children. I wasn’t ready for that.

Personally, I believe that marriages definitely require compromise and *some* sacrifices, but sacrifice to this extent (*even though I’m not the most religious girl out there*) right at the start of the next stage of commitment seemed too much for me. We had to part ways, unfortunately, because a compromise could not be made where we’d be able to stay in our religions and live together. 

I think it’d be interesting to hear what you guys think! There are no right or wrong answers for sure, so I’d appreciate completely honest answers/replies.",askSingapore,16922,Would you ever convert to another religion for love?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/i562k8/would_you_ever_convert_to_another_religion_for/,1.0,"['For me, I would say yes because i am fairly agnostic and I dont really believe in a personal God so it makes no difference for me to say some magic words and join a religion but deep down I dont believe in it\n\nEdit: also i personally believe that love is in short supply in this world, so if you can find someone you love and love you deeply back in return, try not to let the small stuff in life destroy this relationship.

I’ll feel jaded of having to follow the religious practices, like what you mentioned unable to go to practice one’s own family Hindu rituals. Unless I feel immensely strongly for the other religion and only if I am able to see sense in why I should not do my own family practices. But If I don’t feel strongly but in the “name” I converted, will probably be overwhelmed with guilt not able to go with the rites if my sibling gets married etc, knowing you are alrd not a firm believer but just cannot do it cause “converted” probably gonna lead you to question feel jaded and just put a strain in everything', ""I wouldn't, though I do feel this thing about religion should be something that should be talked about really early in the relationship"", 'No.\n\nI think that subscribing to any religion requires a substantial amount of conviction.

My idea of love does not involve religion in any way.\n\nWere I in your shoes, I would consider the degree of its impact to my life and my lifestyle. What would I be willing to tolerate, and to give up for this.\n\nEqually important would be for me to assess my own mindset. Might I wake up one morning, a few weeks/months/years in the future and decide that I resent this person for making me do this?"", 'I think right from the get-go you’re not a match given that you don’t want kids and he wants multiple. Regardless of religion, you wouldn’t have worked anyway. Children shouldn’t be a negotiable in a relationship.', 'The important question you want to ask yourself is whether the act of conversion will lock you in or not. I have heard/read too many stories of abusive spouses using their belief/religion to isolate their SO from their family and friends, until they have to depend on them and have no way out even if they wanted to. If he/she truly loves you back, he/she will not force you to break away all your existing relationships with friends and family just because of the religion.\n\nThere is nothing wrong with any religion in the world, only people that abuse its teachings to their own personal agenda.', ""I'm in a similar situation like yours, albeit my SO doesn't harp on conversion (yet), telling me that conversion should be of one's volition, and not out of love. It's something that's emphasised in Islam as well. The shahada (declaration of faith), is a personal act, and it's said in Islam, there should be no compulsion in religion, so that's what I understand. \n\nI've spoken to her alot about this multiple times, and most times it doesn't end well, we end up fighting, and in a stalemate. Personally, I wouldn't convert/revert to Islam out of love, and i think that if your SO can't accept that, maybe its better to part ways, since there is already an underlying tension/friction that may be exacerbated even if you do revert/convert begrudgingly. \n\nThough I'll say, attending lessons and reading up about islam is interesting, because if you aren't born into the religion, it's not something you'll go look/learn/try to understand what the faith is about, but to convert/revert to Islam? It's not just about you. It's also about your family, and asking yourself if you're converting out of love or own personal inclination. \n\nBut, I've heard and seen stories of people who converted out of love, and are happy, but that's their life, not everyone is the same, and can make that leap. You shouldn't do it just because others do it. \n\nThere are real changes to joining a new faith, one that's as strict and disciplined as Islam. Praying, fasting, distinguishing between haram and halal. These are attitudes and ways of thinking/doing that takes time to assimilate, and there's also the question of what if the marriage/relationship doesn't work out? Will you still remain in the faith or leave it? If you leave, you might be branded an apostate. It's not illegal to leave/renounce Islam in Singapore, but this decision can have lasting consequences in other countries, in particular, Islamic countries. Joining Islam is often celebrated, but leaving it is frowned upon. \n\nIt's tough really. But if there's one thing we can learn from your experience, it's that love isn't everything. It takes more than love to sustain a relationship. Understanding between partners, and expectations really play a huge part in the longevity of a healthy relationship.\n\nBetter to lay all the cards and expectations on the table so if y'all suddenly realise that your goals and expectations don't align, both persons can walk away early on, and move on with your lives, instead of having it dragged and drawn out longer than necessary."", 'Don’t do it. \n\nMost religions don’t even expect you to convert. \nIslam is welcoming of new people, but tend to dislike others from leaving it. They won’t bat an eyelid if you’re no longer Hindu, but will threaten and gaslight you to force you to stay. At least as a Hindu you have more freedom to decide, and your religious leaders never forced you to stay.', 'I personally wouldn’t, based on your list that you’ve stated, you wouldn’t even be able to go for funerals or weddings. Those are huge family events, I don’t think I could handle not being able to go for them(unless you don’t really have a great relationship with your family and don’t mind not going for them, but still funerals..) \nAs a couple, it sounds like you guys are just not compatible. Maybe you guys should have a  serious discussion but this time maybe firmly put your views across and compromise.

They had a wonderful marriage. So is Shah Rukh Khan. I'm not sure of you both, it's your choice. I truly believe a couple can different faiths and still be together, the rest are societal obligations, just need to carry yourself properly, and things will be fine. Totally my opinion, forgive me for anything offensive."", ""It is extremely tough to move from one religion to another, the amount of unlearning one has to do to adopt this new lifestyle would be overwhelming. I agree with you completely on the value one has in their partner's eyes if religion is placed before him/her. Ah, well."", 'The guilt was definitely something I mulled over a lot because I would want to be involved in large family events like marriage and even funerals. Yes, knowing that I converted only because I wanted to be with someone might cause me to feel jaded, and perhaps even resentful years later.', ""Agreed, the resentment was what I had to consider multiple times together with the degree of impact this change would have to my life and the way I lead my life. The lack of conviction in the reason I'd want to convert in the first place was what led me to my final decision."", ""Oh, we both had the discussion about kids and it's not that he wanted many. We both agreed that one would be good, but I wasn't sure if familial pressures in the future would have led him to want more than just one kid."", ""Exactly! I couldn't wrap my head around the fact that I wouldn't be able to participate in huge family events post-conversion. I am someone who has a good enough relationship with my family, so this would have definitely caused me some unhappiness and ultimately sowed discord between us because of the resentment I would feel about not being able to be *there* for the family. Thank you!"", ""The lack of conviction in converting to a religion I would not fully believe in would have definitely affected both of us in the long run, so you're right."", ""I agree with you completely, this is basically why as hard as it was, I had to come to the decision to end things with him. The inability to compromise and stick to my religion was something I realised I couldn't live with, so thank you for saying this. Means a lot!"", ""I wouldn't. I have no religion and I think it's pretentious to go through the motions and do whatever religious things regularly eg going to church every Sunday, or praying 5 times a day, having to read religious texts etc like changing my entire lifestyle when I do not believe in it deep down. \n\nBut if it's stuff like burn incense for ancestors I can accept la (actually this isn't religion) . Also not every day."", 'I wouldn’t convert for anything except faith. A deep personal conviction is needed, otherwise conversion would’t be authentic. I think one of the dealbreakers for me would be potentially alienating oneself from family (assuming that I can’t participate in certain rituals/cultural practices associated with my own family). I don’t believe that conversion has to come at that cost, especially in Singapore where cultures and religions are a melting pot. If it ever comes down to interfaith relationships, i’d probably insist on a civil marriage rather than one rooted in religion. It all depends on what kind of family your S/O has — are they very religious? Does his family and their opinion play a huge role in his life? Can he compromise and work with you and your requirements in this day and age? One of the reasons why people arent encouraged to marry outside of their faith is that marriage means being tied to someone who can progress/journey with you spiritually. For many, that alone may be a dealbreaker. In all though, I don’t believe in converting for the sake of marriage, and would probably prefer a compromise/agree to disagree. If my S/O is unwilling to work with compromise, that would be my dealbreaker because religions/beliefs/cultural practices are ingrained in who we are (consciously and subconsciously/some more than others) and converting based on ultimatums would prolly build resentment. \n\nAt the end of the day it really depends on individuals, how conservative they are, or if they are willing to compromise. Marrying someone unfortunately at times, do mean that you marry into their culture/family and religion for better or for worse.', ""I totally get where you're coming from! Especially about the part where conversations about religion would ultimately end up in fights and in a stalemate. As much as I heard stories that seemed promising after conversion, there never is a guarantee that life would turn out the same way, just like you'd said. Not one person is the same and their experiences would never be the same. \n\nOne thing I realised with time was that my initial consideration to convert was only because of love and that in itself wasn't enough. Converting to another religion requires conviction and a strong belief that this religion will guide you in the right direction. So that is why I believed that it would impact the relationship in the long run once bitterness/resentment sets in.\n\nYou're right, love truly isn't everything. It takes a lot more. That being said, I wish you all the luck with your relationship, and I hope it truly works out for the best with you and your SO."", ""For me, I'd say no.\n\nMy personal opinion on religion is that it is a commitment to your chosen faith, and it is one that should not, and cannot be easily broken by anyone other than yourself. (I say this even as a guy who isn't very religious) Converting to Islam will allow you to progress your relationship, but you have to proceed very carefully here. You've already listed out the some of the implications of doing so, but I feel the possible implications on your relationship with your immediate family should also be factored into the decision too, alongside your personal well-being.\n\nI understand that Conversion is an extremely sensitive topic for all religions (my family has some history here), but especially so in the context of Islam, and let's just say it's a decision that is **not** easily reversed.   \n\n\nI'm just glad you thought this through carefully at the end, before making a decision you weren't entirely comfortable with making."", ""Yeah, so I think for most of the relationship I believed that this could work out much like Irfan Khan's or Shah Rukh's marriages, but I guess it depends on how one interprets the laws and practices of their religion. For people like you and me, we view it as societal obligations, but for others it might be binding and we cannot fault them for it. Thank you for your honest opinion, I really appreciate it!"", ""I agree with you. It would be extremely pretentious of me to convert and practice the religion with indifference because of the lack of belief I have in it, since I'd have converted not for the faith but for a person. It would not have bode well for the both of us in the long run."", ""I most definitely agree with you, it's faith that ultimately ties us to religion. Converting would have allowed me to be with him, but at what cost? My ties with family and myself as well would have been affected because of the guilt and resentment at having to practice a religion I do not strongly believe in. \n\nThis decision is definitely something that would not have been easily reversed in the unfortunate case that things didn't work out for us post-conversion and marriage. So thank you for your kind words, while it is definitely a decision I really didn't want to make, I had to do it ultimately for the best of both of us."", 'Honestly, it depends on the religion. \n\nThere are religions that don’t really have a big impact on your daily life, like Christianity or Buddhism, and there are religions that require drastic changes. \n\nBut I don’t think that this is the core of the issue. Asking you to give up your deeply held convictions to embrace his - even superficially - should already be a huge red flag. From what you’ve mentioned (I could be wrong), I suspect that he expected from a pretty early stage that you would be converting to his religion. After all, it’s not as if he doesn’t know the norms in his community.\n\nAnd the question you should be asking yourself is - what’s next? Will he expect you to have more kids than you want? Will he expect you to adhere to his conception of what it means to be an ideal wife? \n\nI’m sorry to hear that you had to end the relationship, but if I’m honest, I’d say you dodged a bullet.', ""Exactly, it truly depends on the religion.\n\nConverting to Islam is not going to be easy because of the drastic changes required as one assimilates themselves to that new lifestyle.

We broke it off 2 years ago due to religion. It sucks I know, but along the way there were other issues which I realised were red flags — he was emotionally abusive during arguments and he wanted to be very intimate when I told him I’m not ready. This happened like the last 2 months before the relationship ended. \n\nHe was like my best friend since secondary school and we basically had a great relationship. I was not a religious person back then so we were open to travelling, staycations and drinking. We did talk about the future every now and then, especially when family members ask about our plans and we shrugged them off with ‘just go with the flow’. \n\nNot until when we were both 26 and everyone else is settling down and we were looking into BTOs when it hit us that hey, this is something that we been avoiding for the past 6 years and we had to face it then and there. \n\nFriends around us said we could have call the relationship off much earlier and spare both of us the pain because well, it’s 6 years.

It’s a painful process finding who you truly are in the context of your religion and culture.

goinginsanecat,1596113503,i0lhv2,41,1,"Some of the main key points:

- upstairs has been creating A LOT of LOUD noise, daily. Usually from 10am till 1-2am, since April.
- noises heard are: object dropping, dragging of furniture, slamming of door, running, stomping.
- I stay at a corner unit, for those that are planning to tell me sound travels in all direction. 

When I first informed them of the noise they’re causing, they were nice and pleasant. Even shocked that the noises where that loud. (I have recordings) 
They even asked for my number to send them recording whenever I’m hearing all those noises.

Moving forward, few weeks later since April - nothing change and they got annoyed with me. One day they even message me saying they feel that I am harassing them. Till date, they are still being delusional and unable to accept the fact that whatever they are doing daily are causing a lot of loud noise to my unit. They refused to talk in person or reply my messages. Basically they cut off communication. 

I’ve spoke to town council, they said HDB handles noise pollution. I’ve also spoke to HDB, HDB said they do not handle noise pollution and they are nothing they can do. They can only advise the unit upstairs that they receive complaints and to inform that’s all. (I’ve play all the recordings to the officer that came down, even he agrees that the noise are coming from the unit upstairs). Police are useless too as they can only advise as well.

Trash_Panther,1596111528,i0l1p3,10,1,"Ns is a total waste of time and brings about more cons than pros for us sons of Singapore. Im speaking from experience.

I am currently serving national service about 8 months in and my vocation is transport operator.
As a transport operator, one would think how 'lucky' we are as we are able to get free license, but in my opinion that is merely a tiny benefit which is massively overshadowed by the cons of this vocation.

Why do i think ns is a total waste of time?

Because aside from actual driving, the rest of the time we either sit in the car or in the bunk and do nothing. On days where we do not have drivings to do, we sit in the bunk the whole day, using our phones and wasting our lives and youth while our female peers pursue uni and find jobs, enriching their lives. Speaking from experience, i find it absolutely tiring to not do anything at all the whole day and theres only so much entertainment social media and netflix can give you before u get bored. And then theres the problem of not having enough data. If ns were to be shortened to say 1 year, it wouldnt be this bad as we could take this as a long holiday but 2 years is way too long and it has stretched from a holiday to a borefest and life-waster. I could accomplish so much in these 2 years be it education wise or job wise, but i have to 'serve the nation' by doing nothing and sitting on my bed in bunk. Is this your idea of 'serving the nation'?

My next point would be how ns takes away my social life. In driving vocation we are constantly bombarded with weekend duties and details without any pity from our superiors. My female friends who are attending uni have already minimum amount of time to go out with us and now with these weekend duties and details the chances of being able to ask them out for a gathering is greatly reduced. As they make new friends in uni and go out less with us, we will soon lose contact with them and ultimately become strangers. Is this what you want, to have your friends taken away from you just because u have to 'serve the nation'? And then theres the problem of spending time with family. For stay in units like mine, and with weekend duties, we sometimes spend up to 2 or 3 weeks not being able to see our family and spend quality time with them. My parents are getting old and time is very much cherished for them and because of ns, i have very little time to spend with them. The superiors constantly tell us how we have to spend quality time with our family but isnt it ironic with the amount of weekend duties you give us, we are not able to do so?

And my third point would be the people i meet in ns. I am an easygoing person who can get along really well with anybody but the people i meet here in my unit, they make it hard for me to do so. These people are what you would call 'YPs'. They fight and smoke in bunks not caring about the rest of us and how their actions will disturb us. I cant even complain about them to the superiors because if they were to find out im a snitch, im a goner. So in camp, everyday, i live under a constant stress for my living conditions, making me depressed and moody for most of the days. Is this really what you want your mental state to be?

Now i feel that everyone has their own experience on national service but i believe i am speaking for most of us here who have to serve. I suggest ns to be shortened to at most 1.5 years or at least make sure during weekends and public holidays all ns activities are cancelled so we can go home to spend quality time with our families. I know what im saying is pointless and the system will not change anytime soon but i just want to get some things off my chest and let it all out.

historicalheight,1595903303,hz6b4f,5,1,"TLDR: my dad has been verbally and psychologically abusive, advice needed

dear everyone, 
 
i need help. my dad is verbally and psychologically abusive towards my family, especially my mum and my helper. he constantly verbally abuses them, nitpicks at everything and expects to be treated like a king. from small things like constantly asking my helper what she is doing, to throwing a huge tantrum when the food served isnt to his liking or he thinks it can be cooked better, although he cannot cook. he constantly barges into my room and tries to kiss my sister, who is in secondary school although she doesn't want to be kissed. he constantly shouts over the smallest of things, like when the bathroom floor is wet or he gets peanut butter bread, although he wants peanut butter and cheese. idk how to give more legit examples, but it’s really a lot of yelling over the smallest of things, and constantly nitpicking the work my helper does. 
 
he is constantly shouting and being crazy from morning to night- especially in the morning. idk why it always seems like he wakes up on the wrong side of the bed every day. my dad and my mum have a joint bank account, and now he wants to withdraw everything inside and leave nothing for my mum. he always gets my mum to pay the bills first, and my mum always has great difficulty getting him to pay her back as he would constantly yell and shout / insist he has paid / call her stingy or whatever.
 
when i was younger, i was slapped by my dad many times. because of that, every time he reaches out, i always instinctively think he was going to slap me. the most recent incident where this happened when he was looking for something and i found it, and then he said ""why u put here"" (i did not) and he raised his hand. i thought he was going to beat me, hence i flinched like mad and my whole body shook like crazy. till today, my dad continues to shout at me and will shout even more when i cry. it is absolutely nerve wrecking. i cannot hide from my dad at home as my dad doesnt allow us to close our doors, and he comes in to see what we are doing every ~30 minutes. i think this is why i hate it when people touch me, even though they are people im close to.
 
typing this sounds so dumb and stupid, but i really really need help. i feel so bad living in the same household and not doing anything to stop him. i have fought with him on numerous occasions because he is just so cruel to everyone, but everytime i do that he will treat them even worse, because he thinks im siding with them. one time when we were in the car alone (both of us were going out separately, and he was dropping me off), i told him to be kinder to my mum and my helper. he agreed, but instead he drove back home and shouted at them even more. i wasnt supposed to know of this until my mother told me.
 
there have been times i want to call the police, but my mum said that thats for her and my helper to decide and not me. and my helper doesnt want to do anything, because of the long process, and the rest of my family treats her well and she really loves us and vice versa.  and she doesn’t think filing a report is worth the time and money. moving out is an option, but it is also financially expensive. thankfully i live on campus during schl term, but the rest of my family is still stuck home and i feel so damn guilty for it.... but at the same time, i some how dont have the courage to cut my dad off because he is my dad after all and i dont want him to die and for me to have any regrets. but because of his temper, we never ever talk normally (maybe like once a year lol) or have any meaningful convos together. he once shared w me a song abt a dude whose dad passed away and he regretted not talking to his dad but constantly fighting. idk if he was hinting abt us or what but i cant do anything because he has been so constantly abusive and draining...",askSingapore,16218,"TW: domestic violence, abuse",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/hz6b4f/tw_domestic_violence_abuse/,1.0,"[""OP,\n\nI don't know your Dad but he sounds like an ass.

sanascilla,1594883372,hs534w,63,1,"FYI: I'm 20, and my mum's 58. 

The more time I have to spend working and studying from home, the more I realise I dislike my mother. Don't get me wrong, I love her as well as my dad but I absolutely hate the opinions they hold about the world around them - if they weren't my parents and were my age, I would absolutely abhor them. My dad's more chill about race and religion (albeit at times mildly sexist) but my mum...has been spiraling deeper and deeper into the cesspool of aunty Whatsapp message chains. I once asked both my parents whether they thought marital rape exists and my dad said yes but my mum said no O.O

I hate how narrow-minded she can be, and how every time I try to explain something, she just gets angry and somehow turns it into a preachy lecture on how I'm just not religious enough and that I've been brainwashed by LKY. It's suffocating because I feel like I can't have a normal conversation with her without it somehow devolving into a conversation about religious morals or racial privilege (e.g. when I showed her the newspaper with the Monica Baey headline, it somehow turned into a lecture on the morals of how women dress which is like ???? incident happened in the shower lmao). Some of her opinions are not unfounded of course but constantly being yelled at for disengaging when she doesn't bother listening to what I think, and dismisses everything I say or feel.

I hate how entitled she can be in restaurants, I hate how easily she buys into flattery and vanity, I hate how hypocritical she is in loving to consume and waste yet preaches modesty...I know she's done so much for me, but I find it a constant source of stress to be around her. But it would break her heart if she even knew a fraction of how different my views of religion are. I guess it doesn't help that I'm a Sociology major and think about this stuff 80% of my day haha

What is your preferred mode of communication? I'm directing this question more toward work environment and professional settings. I've had this debate with my friends and have generally come up with 2 groups of opinion.

Opinion 1 : I'll always prefer face-to-face &gt; phone call &gt; text &gt; email. Reason being that it is more casual and to me sounds friendlier to the other party(as you're not cc'ing the whole wide world). Besides, it also gets things done more quickly.

Opinion 2 : Email/text &gt; phone calls &gt; face-face. This is because calling the person up or going over to their desk indicates that you are demanding for their attention now. So they have to drop everything on hand to answer your question (even if it was just a short one). So sending them an email, allows them to read and respond when they're free. I feel like this would only work if the recipient doesn't receive 300 emails a day. I know quite a few people that would ignore emails because, ""if important then they'll call up and ask la"" type of mentality.

I've recently been to some job interviews and after the session is over, I had additional questions directed at the HR personnel (not the interviewer). My friend said to always send an email first even if it was just 1 or 2 questions. Lo and behold, she ghosted me after that. I tried calling her but she never picked up. I found that to be very unprofessional.

Now, I'm in the talks with another company. 1st interview went very well. He gave me very positive feedback at the end of the session. 1 week later, he referred me to one of his teammates (that's nested under him) to speak with me. The 2nd interviewer wasn't so keen as he felt that I didn't have the background required for this role but he was on the fence and said he will give it more thought and get back to me.

1 week has passed. I dropped him a text asking about the status and he said they're still interviewing candidates. I asked when can I check back in again, and no reply from him. So, I was thinking if I can speak directly to the first interviewer (which is the 2nd interviewer's boss anyway) as he seemed to have a very good impression on me. I just want to know if the 2nd guy isnt keen on me being on his team, is the 1st guy still considering me for another role within the organisation.

What do you guys think?

EDIT: mode, not mod.",askSingapore,14987,What's your preferred mod of communication?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/hrk0dj/whats_your_preferred_mod_of_communication/,1.0,"['It depends. I would prefer face to face if it is within the company, and email if I’m dealing with external parties. If I’m not getting a response via email, I would call instead. I always feel that there is no need for a text message because it feels quite intrusive to me, especially if the other party is using his personal mobile.\n\nPerhaps you could drop an email to the first interviewer and cc the second interviewer in your email. Let them know that the interviews you had with them were pleasant and you are keen in this job, even though you do not have the necessary background required for the job, following the second interview with the company. Ask them politely what could you have improved on if you are not selected for the job.']"
misterdonutguy,1594700214,hqupvc,12,1,"My grandma has come down with a pretty serious infection over the past year in her foot which has led to it being gangrenous. She has been going down to the hospital pretty regularly due to this and this is the third time in the last 3 months.

So today the doctor gave us two alternatives: First is to change to even stronger antibiotics which has side effects on her health and she may still need to come back after all of this given the severity of the infection. Second is to amputate her leg above the knee, but given her advanced age (she is almost 90) and her pre-existing conditions (diabetes, past stroke), they do not give her much chance to survive the operation.

Hi everyone. I am a 19-year-old Canadian citizen (born in India, having immigrated to Canada in 2010). For many reasons now, I have been thinking of whether I want to relocate once I finish my undergraduate degree. Singapore stands out to me because of its excellence in multiculturalism, education, and infrastructure. My plan right now is to live in SG for one year on university exchange and then confirm whether I want to move there for good. Over the past weeks, I have been researching about SG's social and political systems and quality of life. I wanted to reach out on here to ask you guys about your experiences on a few topics:

* If you are an immigrant living in Singapore, can you share your experiences about settling down here? How would you compare your quality of life to your previous home?
* Do many Expats mix with locals, or is it fairly divided? What beliefs do locals have about Expats and is it difficult for them to integrate into Singaporean society? What are some ways Expats can connect with Singaporeans and have meaningful friendships (or do they stick to themselves)?
* I am fluent in English and nothing else. I understand that English is one of the predominant languages along with Malay, Mandarin, Tamil, Hokkien, as well as Singaporean slang. How difficult would it be for me to get around town and make friends knowing just English?
* How would you describe your experiences/ views surrounding the Singaporean healthcare system?
* I have read that mental health issues can be quite taboo in Singapore. What are some ways in which this is true/ not true?
* What are some current challenges Singaporean society is battling? What are the current concerns of Singaporean youth, and are they being prioritized by the country? I will make sure to research and broaden my knowledge on any issues that are brought up.

I don\'t speak for everyone, but from what I\'ve seen, parents have told their kids to suck it up because \'everyone gets sad\', which I feel makes Singaporeans either think that having a mental disorder = weak, or that they aren\'t ""sad enough"" to go get help. The words \'depression\' or \'anxiety\' are rarely seen in school assembly programmes (that I\'ve been a part of) and is often passed off as stress in the working scene.\n\nSingapore is a pretty okay country imo. However, I personally don\'t see a reason moving from Canada?

You'll do great here, or anywhere you choose. Learning the Singlish slang will be helpful, and it can be fun. But English will be enough to get by.\n\nI'd say half my friends are locals, half expats. But I make an effort to talk to people that seem like-minded, rather than wait for them to talk to me.\n\nTransit is great. MRT, busses, taxis, Grab(like Uber). Getting around is so easy here. What bothers me is that the side walks in a lot of areas lack efficient planning. Bullards and bus stops, ramps and stairs to over passes, poorly placed as a second thought. Sidewalks that just end. Can get awkward to get places on foot or bike.\n\nCars have the right-of-way here so you'll have to get good at eyeing how drivers drive. Some signal for blocks, some don't at all. Some just float through lines. The beautiful multiculturalism comes with a variety of driving styles. But it seems like they make it work.

There isn’t a hard divide between expats and local and Uni is definitely a great place to meet local friends.

Hey, I’ve lived here all my life and I’m only fluent in English. For daily living, you can definitely get around easily, almost everything in English. Most young people use English, even when talking to people from the same race. Since you are Indian, just be prepared for people to sometimes start talking to you in Tamil (esp from older generations). But in moments like that, I usually politely tell them that I can’t speak Tamil and they switch to English.\n\n4. In my view, healthcare system is very expensive for non-citizens but makes up in good service and it’s world class. In Uni, the healthcare is heavily subsidised and most Unis here make sure their students have health insurance (Idk what type for foreign students tho, sry :’) ) \n\n5. Among younger ppl, mental health isn’t taboo as it used to be; we are more open to discussing it but we still have a long long way to go. There still is a stigma attached to seeking out counselling or a therapist but there is a growing number of us pushing against it. Schools (esp tertiary institutions) do talk about mental health and try to provide help, but it isn’t a main priority. I think the same goes for working adults. It really depends on who you surround yourself with. \n\n6. Young people in Singapore want a more liberal society. Singapore is historically a very conservative nation but younger generations have been (slowly) pushing for change. Major concerns for youths here are racism, sexism, stress and mental issues and LGBTQIA+ rights. Recently there has been a lot of discussions about racism in the public sphere.

Cost of living is almost similar to canada except for rental expect to pay higher rents for downtown areas even a HDB(public housing) in Singapore might cost as much as a downtown toronto condo for rent.\n\nMixing with locals: Your friendships and meaningful relationships with locals totally depends on you singapore is such a place where you can choose to either remain within your shell and stay only with people your nationality/race/colour or you can go out and seek those meaningful friendships. In my stay I've had a good mix of local as well as expats but luck would have it that two of my best friends are Singaporean so much so that these 2 friends have been witnesses for my marriage registration so mixing with locals is totally a self propagated endeavour. Locals have all sorts of beliefs about expats some may hold xenophobic thoughts some may hold racist stereotypes some may be extremely polite and courteous it depends on what way you choose to look at it.

You might have certain initial issues with accent but I bet you would get used to the accent and local slang within a week or 2. My 2 cents for language learn to shorten your sentences long drawn sentences in English tend to confuse a lot of people especially older gen. \n\nHealthcare: Get insurance, get insurance that covers you for atleast 1 million $. If you come in as a student your university registers you for a group insurance for which you pay the cost along with tuition it is mandatory but if you decide to stay and take up a job employers provide various degrees of insurance coverage but always good to purchase extra. Insurance is dirt cheap compared to canada in singapore in all aspects be it home, auto, health. Quality of healthcare is amazing access to specialists is super quick in singapore as there is a presence of private medical practice but the quality of healthcare you might have access to as a foreigner in singapore depends on your insurance.\n\nMental Health: Its not taboo just that you wouldn't find very many insurance providers that cover mental health and if they do its going to be expensive. Universities have a great mental health infrastructure and its free if you are an enrolled student. \n\nCurrent challenges: I think top priority is handling the aftermath of covid 19 and bringing back the economy to shape other than that just like every country singapore has its own issues google them maybe take a look at whats happening in the GE2020 you could see the numerous debates going on between various political parties in singapore on YouTube might give you an idea of what the geopolitical situation is in the city state. \n\nPM me if you need more info."", 'I’m in the same position', '[deleted]', ""We don't have complete racial harmony as of now.

It's heartening that you are doing financial planning so early. As both are you are not working (I read your other comment that your bf just signed on, but I wouldn't really consider that part since he just started), there's no need to put too much pressure on yourself for the savings.\n\nGoing forward, given that you have a clear target to get married in 2027, you can try to work backwards, based on your expectations of the two big ticket items in your life (wedding and house). IMO the priorities should be:\n\n1) Have at least 6 month emergency cash fund. It could be 6 months of expenses or 6 months of income, depending on your comfort level.\n2) Downpayment for your BTO (I assume). Depending on where you are targeting, as well as whether you are planning to take a HDB loan or a bank loan, try to have savings of at least 5% downpayment.\n3) Renovation fund. I feel that one should try not to take renovation loans if possible. Perhaps 30k will be a good start.\n4) Wedding sums. This could run from just a simple ROM to wedding banquets. Plan ahead on this based on you and your bf's preferences so that you don't have to take loans for this. There are many horror stories where a couple starts off on the wrong footing financially because they took a huge wedding loan, that put a huge strain on their relationships.\n\nFrom now till 2027, there's about 6 years for you to save, a very comfortable timeline. Once you work out the likely sums, you can divide the total sums by the amount you need to save monthly from now on. That will be the baseline savings, since you could have other things that you might want to indulge on, such as travel.

Eventually we kinda agreed that housing is our main priority and that we wanted to have our own place before anything.\n\nIm working part time at the moment and both me and my bf save roughly 200-300 each a month.

That alone will help significantly. Do not start at all.

I have gotten much better at handling my financials ever since moving to Singapore, but I can’t start saving properly until February by next year which is when I expect to pay up most of my debts.\n\nHope that helped somehow.', 'Hi I think a lot of points have been covered, so forgive me if I do repeat some points. \n\nAt this age, if there’s no income from your end, focus on not taking on debt. Debt snowballs and interest rates can be very high. If you’re able to do that, that’s more than sufficient for now. \n\nFor your boyfriend, could you clarify if he’s signing on as an officer or specialist? Also, he’s intending to go to Uni, typically they may either may an allowance or his full salary(depending on  his signing terms). As Uni will be for four years this would be quite crucial to your long term financial planning. \n\nIf you’re saving for a wedding, note that wedding costs vary widely depending on how extravagant you want to be. There will be people who tell you that you can “recoup” your costs but that’s honestly a gamble. A simple wedding (ROM, dinner with family) can be as cheap as $1-2k, whereas renting a wedding gown(s) with a make up artist can easily set you back the same figure. So it really depends on what type of wedding you want. And I would caution you not taking on debt for this, as it’s v common that the marriage gets off to a rocky start when parties realise they overestimated themselves and find it difficult to repay the debt. \n\nWhen you get married there are also a lot of attendant costs, eg buying your house, getting a car/bike, home reno, angpow money (if you’re Chinese; I’m not sure for other races if there’s a similar cultural obligation). So do factor those in as well.\n\nLastly, not being a wet blanket but I note that you intend to get married in 7 yrs time. From personal experience I’ve seen many many couples who were together at 19 but married/attached to different people at 26 (your age in 2027). Coincidentally I’m 26 this year, planning to get married next year, so if there’s any further qns you have feel free to ask. The point I’m getting at is that when the rs is good and healthy now, it’s easy to plan ahead to get married in x years and have kids in y years, etc. But until you get married (and some people would advocate that even after you get married), you should be responsible for your own savings and your own share of the wedding costs. Mainly because you may have your own idea of a dream wedding, but if it’s financed substantially by your boyfriend’s savings, and if (touch wood) you guys split, then you may not be able to afford that dream wedding at the same age. Of course, this is just something to keep in mind and hopefully it doesn’t come to pass.

From the “East Coast plan” to saying LHY when they meant LHL.... and in general, some pretty boring speeches if i do say so myself. I understand that they are in a high pressure situation, but shouldn’t the people leading our country be able to convey their thoughts in an interesting, engaging and confident manner?

Prestigious_Natural6,1609064619,kl1gpq,12,1,"Hello!

Some context first and foremost i guess.

I come from a small town in the UK near the coast. After university I secured a graduate job with Google in their sales team and well, accidently met someone from the company with whom I ended up being in a relationship with. For this role, I had to move to Dublin. Which itself has been a great experience and I love the city, the country and the people. But, not the weather!


Anyway, my gf happens to be a Singapore PR and wants to return home next year. 

Naturally I would like to follow her but, there are caveats and areas I would like to understand more about Singapore however niche it may seem they are important to me!


1. Work life balance - How is it? I would look to transfer internally and wanted to know if the cultural cliches of overworking are true and transpire to MNCs working there? Not an issue - but would need to mentally prepare haha 😅 

2. Rent and standard of living- Dublin rents are extortionate. Currently paying close to a 1000 euros a month. Should I expect similar?

3. Exercise - i love sea swimming but not sure if that's something that I can carry over to Singapore?

4. What is life like there in general? I know it's gaining traction as a tech and innovation hub but what does that mean for the people there? Are they happy to be enjoying the success of Singapore?

There's no one size fits all. Some MNCs vary differently even within each country depending on management. But in general I've never had any dirty look at me from colleagues for leaving office on time or even slightly earlier here in UK if I finished it. However in Singapore, some not so favourable cultural are those where management or even coworkers deem amount of time worked as a determinant for how hard you are working. I know of peers who worked really slowly throughout the day to ensure they could stay longer.  This is not true for all companies however so you may have to research the company's culture on your own.\n2. It depends on what you want to rent in SG, but definitely for that amount it'll be a 1-2 bed apartment. I very much enjoy having my own back garden for that same amount of rent over here in UK. If you have no issues living in an apartment surrounded by other families then for roughly same amount you can get to rent a public housing apartment. If you want a bigger space then you definitely have to pay more. Land is limited in Singapore afterall.\n3. There's a few recreational beaches where you can swim (but they usually have floating sea barriers further out so if you like to swim really far out then you may have to adapt accordingly. Otherwise, I'm sure your body will enjoy the warmer waters more.\n4. It is a fast pace city (at least for me) which prompted the move to UK. However if you like living in a bustling city then it is the place for you. You can reach all ends of Singapore easily and safety and security in SG is one that I truly missed. Also, it is a good gateway into Southeast Asia and even beyond the region due to it's good air connectivity.\n\nI guess you just need to list out what your priorities are.

Sure you can find something affordable, but dollar for dollar you're unlikely to find something better than in Dublin. As for swimming in the sea, we're a major shipping center and the oil and filth coming from the ships will discourage you from exposing your skin to it.

First step is to not assume anything, ask what the work hours are, ask how many holiday days you get, don't assume any of this and in many cases you can negotiate, but even if not make sure you know what you are signing up for, I've heard of people assuming they would get normal holiday allowances only to see the contract and it's 12 days or something like that.\n\nAlso ask about the makeup of the team you are working with, if it's a diverse multi-national team then you're much less likely to run into staying-late-for-appearances syndrome. \n\nTo give you some positives about work here, you get to work in a new market and learn to work in an entirely different culture. Everything in tech from the type of markets, tech adoption, languages, ways of doing payments etc is very different in Asia and so it can help to give you new perspectives. Singapore is also very similar to London in its multiculturalism, in tech especially, it's common to work alongside many different nationalities.""]"

VoidRay728,1608039855,kdlyoi,11,1," 

Before I elaborate, if you're wondering why I put quitting and leaving SG in the same sentence, it's because I'm an EP holder.

Now, a brief summary: I've been living in SG for the past 3 years and a bit more, working in the financial industry. And to be blunt, it's not great. My reservations for my current role basically boil down to stress, unforgiving work hours, being undervalued (or not valued at all even), to the point where I'm probably experiencing PTSD outside of work, I don't sleep well, and I need to think really hard if I actually like anything about my current job at the moment (i.e. I don't).

The job hasn't been great to begin with, but with COVID this year everything has just really spun out of control and any notion of work-life balance (if such a thing even exists in SG) just basically went out the window.

So I've been looking for another job within the financial industry, sounds weird, but despite all the hardships, I still try to maintain my interest in the financial industry (since it's basically the only area that I'm familiar with) -- just not my department and team.

This brings me to the leaving SG part. I've realised that most financial institutions don't take foreigners (i.e. anyone who isn't a citizen or PR), and I am one. This is of course no doubt due to the government restricting the criteria more for EP eligibility, especially in the finance industry -- which to be fair, does employ a lot of foreigners parachuted in from other countries (at least from my impression).

So if I quit my job now, it basically means I won't find another job here as a foreigner, which means I'll have to leave SG and relocate during a pandemic -- which *may* still be less of a headache than my work -- but it means starting over again, and will probably be jobless back home for a while.

Alternatively, I can apply for PR, but the timeline for that is another 9 months -- and I don't know if I can continue with the current course of this job for that long before I implode. Or worse.

MineTheCaft,1608036377,kdl3ho,16,1,"I am ready to be downvoted to hell.

I have no idea if any government personnel is going to track my IP and whatnot but I'm just gonna say it. Why do Singaporean males just accept NS and don't refute it or anything? I have heard many reasons but honestly they're all stupid.

If I am a foreign nation and launch a simple ballistic missile onto Singapore, I hardly doubt we have enough technology to survive a simple nuclear warfare. One missile is enough to wipe out the nation.

Furthermore, we have less threats to foreign nations compared to South Korea/Taiwan which has China and North Korea to deal with.

And is 24+ months necessary, including reservice?? Taiwan is just 4 months. This puts Males at an educational and quite frankly social disadvantage. Not to forget becoming stupider in NS disadvantages them in further learning (University). Plus, there is no gender equality. Equality also ensures the well-being of males too, not just females.

Lastly, the pay is quite horrendous. If you calculate per hour earned for an enlisted recruit, it is not even 1 dollar. 

There are many other things such as percentage death rate in NS compared to other nations, etc.

&gt;Dont have Savage also will at least have a Triple Kill.

&gt;SG gov gotta pander to weak parents, bo bian.

&gt;Excellence has always been borne out of stress. Messi gotta leave country, cross Atlantic join Barca academy at 13yrs old, stress or not?

&gt;Everyday go training, no time for games n fun at 13yrs old, no stress?

&gt;If he didnt make it, he'd be some washed up unknown loser dude in Argentina now, so is the expectation on a young 13yr old ginah stressful?

&gt;Stress is good. TTI is contrarian.

&gt;Parents kb gov say stressful, I actually think its not stressful enough. So i ""top up"" more stress for my own kids.

&gt;No stress how does Carbon turn into diamonds

&gt;Gov policy of pandering to strawberry parents n kids is just gg to make it worse for these guys.

&gt;1 big fine day, when they have to compete with the koreans, chinese, indians etc, then theyd realize that the world's top talent has been turning up for the fight since young whereas their kids r blissfully sheltered.

&gt;Cos cannot stress these ginahs.

&gt;Ok lo, then next time, pls go do non stressful jobs, cos cannot take stress.
Make coffee for TTI's kids in future. They r quite chin chye. Sure no stress.

(b) The meme pages, since there’s a lot you can tell about someone from their sense of humour. More importantly, you can get a read on someone’s thoughts and ideological views based on the memes they share - and at the same time, memes serve various purposes - not all it restricted to humour. Sometimes there’s a bit of an ideological slant to it. So for example, Cold Storage Memes for Meritocratic Teens (personally found the vitriol a bit alarming.)

(c) The journalism sites, both the big ones and the small ones. Been seeing a lot of sponsored posts from sites like the Economist. The reporting for this stuff seems very US-centric, but their reach in Singapore (maybe because social media helps bump this stuff up in our news feeds) means that we kind of know very well.

(d) Local content sites (not sure how to classify them)? Stuff like RICE media, Millennials of Singapore. I think their draw is relatability? Especially around the GE period when the activity really picked up.  But you find them a lot on places like Insta too, where they use stuff similar to flash cards to catch your attention or send a message.

(e) Alternative platforms? I noticed that in the US, some commentators are moving towards sites like Parler because they complained that they’re being censored on mainstream platforms. Do we have that here? The most I know is that we have some niche stuff (EDMW, Sammyboy) that caters to very specific audiences.",askSingapore,32540,"Which forums, social media platforms or other content do you like to follow or lurk in - and what are your thoughts?",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/kddbu2/which_forums_social_media_platforms_or_other/,1.0,"['IMO SGAG is quite good, but their memes may be more moderated as compared to other meme pages. \n\nIn terms of other social media, I prefer Reddit over Facebook because I find Reddit\'s atmosphere not as volatile as Facebook\'s, especially in those comments on CNA or ST\'s pages where you see a heck lot of ""blind"" comments (i.e. comments that are sided and sometimes harsh-worded). \n\nI tend to find more useful and reasonable wisdom on Reddit, and life experiences too!

Just_peeking8,1607557824,ka3ra1,87,1,"To anyone reading, I’m hoping that someone can help me with my current situation. It’s long, but it explains everything. 

I nvr wanted to be in army, it’s honestly not for me, but I understand that every male has to do it so I’ve been trying my best to suck it up and do as best I can in the 2 years. But as the weeks go by, I feel myself cracking like glass (looking like I’m fine on the outside, but being a huge train wreck on the inside). Everyday I wake up like I’m in a nightmare and am constantly attacked by negative thoughts during PT and different parts of the day, to the point I start to consider taking my life to end all of it. The only thing that’s kept me alive is my faith and the effects my actions may have on the people around me, but it feels like I have to suffer just so people are spared off those feelings, so it’s like a continuous cycle that gets worse every time. 

But this problem didn’t occur only in NS. I actually experienced depression and suicidal thoughts when I was in poly before enlisting. I admittedly was too playful in my 1st yr and got mediocre grades, so I took that as a wake up call and put in more effort for my 2nd yr. But no matter how hard I tried, I got the same results. Everyone was telling me to stay positive, strive to do better and all that, I tried telling myself that as well, but it was very difficult to stay happy and positive. In the next project following that, I had no energy or mood to do work. I would just stare at my computer screen and think about what a failure I was and thinking about jumping off my school building. But I guess because I was studying something I really want to pursue as a career, it was slightly easier to overcome and get through my last yr following the disaster that was Yr 2. 

Anyways, I went to see a psychiatrist at both IMH and private, because I felt the IMH psychiatrist was quite condescending and dismissive, especially when I mentioned that I don’t want to do NS, despite me explaining multiple times that I am trying my best nonetheless. He also compared himself to me, saying that he was colorblind and couldn’t get a good vocation which he would have killed for. Maybe it’s a tactic they use to identify those trying to keng? I dunno. Both got memos, but idk what the IMH one says because they sealed the letter before I could read it. But the private memo states that I have Major Depressive disorder and that I want to down pes, so that I can at least get through the rest of the 2yrs more smoothly, while also having more time to in a sense fix myself.

When I informed my OC and OO, they both suggested not submitting the memo, in fear that it would ruin my future, which I can understand to an extent. But I also feel that I’m getting worse here and if I stay I might really decide to end my life. It’s not really the fault of anyone around me, it’s mostly mine.

I feel like my problems are affecting those around me, like my bunkmates who have been very helpful to me despite my situation, but I know that they have their own problems and I feel like I’m adding to that. For my superiors, they’ve been nothing but the best to me, showing concern for my wellbeing and helping me by arranging counselling appointments and talking to me about my problems, but the same as my bunkmates, they have to deal with me and all their own problems, which is the last thing I want others to feel, as I’ve been on the receiving end multiple times. For my parents, they have to worry about their son being a mental wreck and having to pay for my treatments and medications, especially my sis who I think feels neglected because all the attention is on me now. 

All this makes me feel really bad and that I’m burdening everyone around me, which is why I feel ending my life once and for all will end all this suffering that is attacking me.

Anyways, sorry for the long long story. If anyone whose been in a similar situation can advise me on how to go about all this and perhaps some words of advice and guidance would be much appreciated.

I'm not a professional or anything, so take my advice with a pinch of salt.  \n\n\nBefore anything though, I'm sorry you have to go through this, but know that you are loved. You are needed, you are appreciated. You are strong, you can get through this. You will emerge better and you can beat this. Sure, I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I believe in you nonetheless.  \n\n\nDo you have any interests? You can start there to see if perhaps there's something there to help you find something to look forward to, or find something to focus your attentions on. Or maybe you have something you've always been interested in, but have yet to actually try. Now may be a good time to explore.  This will help with the mood.   \n\n\nTake things one step at a time. One task at a time. Depression makes it difficult to even do the simplest things. If you got out of bed today and brushed your teeth, mark that as a win. If you managed to take a bath and keep yourself clean and hygienic, that's a win too. Remember, one step at a time, one task at a time. Don't focus too much on the bigger picture right now, because I'm sure it would seem all-too-big and looming. If you feel up for it, and since you're in NS, do some exercise. If you manage to, that's a win as well. Take the small victories.  \n\n\nSurround yourself with people who care, the people who at least have an inkling what you're really going through so they know how to handle it. Depression is a mental health issue that isn't talked about enough and hence sometimes people don't know the right way to deal with someone who is suffering from it. If you can find it in you, find someone you care about and are close to and talk to them to see how they can help you too. Your parents, your siblings,  your best friend, etc. Sometimes the way people talk to you about your depression does wonders, since most people are too easily dismissive of it.\n\n  \nOne last thing, I guess, although that's a thing of my own personal preference and recommendation. There's this web series I used to watch. It's about a whole group of professional voice actors playing Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It's called Critical Role. That's a personal interest of mine, and it may not be for you, but I know for a fact that that show has helped me through some tough times, and it has helped a lot of others as well. Maybe give it a shot. Who knows? \n\n  \nYou got this. I hope you feel better soon."", 'TLDR: Submit that memo. I did and my life isn’t ruined.\n\nLong story: I got the diagnosis before NS and submitted before BMT started. The thing it doesn’t get easier but at least you can get help.\n\nHere’s a tip. Once you are in the system, and nothing has changed since I was NSF (20 years ago...?), you can use your green card for hospital visits. Ditch IMH and go to another hospital. I suggest Khoo Teck Phua at Yishun. It will be more expensive but it is more worth it.\n\nYour superiors are saying not do because they may be genuinely concerned for you — but if so it’s misguided. Depression is NOT just in the mind. NO amount of positive thinking or self motivation works.

Neither did I. And I can safety bet that probably 98% of us didn't want to be in NS too so you are not alone. But alas, we had to make the best hand out of the cards we were dealt with as best as we can and maybe even win the game of life. When you mentioned dropping pes might be one of your thought process, I then assumed it was becos the physical training was too tough hence you should drop pes status? I would avoid dropping pes becos the army will post u to admin and/or mundane duties which will make the 2 years all the more torturous.\n\nSecondly, you seem to be aware of the people's feelings around you and place the burden on urself to not make them feel bad. I'm sure they love you as much as you love them and would want to see you get better. Don't believe everything that you tell yourself. You are already onto the road to recovery just by reaching out to various institutions and communities and maybe even talking to your loved ones.\n\nTo conclude, start with your small daily wins like thanking yourself for making it through yesterday every morning when you wake up. Be grateful for the meals provided for you in NS compared to the people who may not have a single meal in other parts of the world. Don't be too hard on yourself on having to impress anybody. Be yourself and maybe something (or someone) will touch your life when the time is right.

Imagine telling a pro soccer player ""hey don\'t treat your leg injury, then it will be on your record and your career *might* suffer."" If he doesn\'t treat his injury, it\'s gonna get worse and probably end his career anyway. Likewise if you don\'t treat your urgent injury now, you may not even have a future to worry about because it\'ll destroy you.\n2. What future are they talking about anyway? In the army? I don\'t think you care about your career trajectory for your 2 years of NS.\n3. And if the diagnosis (congrats on that by the way, it\'s a good step towards getting your struggles recognised!) is going to prevent you from doing something in your career, that might mean it would damage your mental health and you shouldn\'t be doing it anyway.\n4. People are growing more understanding about the importance of mental health, and the stigma is eroding. MOM recently released an advisory to employers on supporting employees\' mental health, which I thought was a very good step. So even IF this goes on your record, it should be confidential (medical privacy). And even IF your confidentiality is breached, people are less and less likely to judge you for it.\n\nIdk what submitting the memo will do, but please go do what you need to do regardless of what ""future"" nonsense.

There is of course no one-time fix to getting rid of unhealthy emotions and thoughts, but you can take small steps. It seems like you do have strong social support, which is crucial for improvement. \n\nIf you are willing to, I really do encourage you to seek help from a psychologist. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy go hand in hand when it comes to mental health. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine to treat any chemical imbalance in the brain while psychologists guide you to adapt behaviourally and cognitively. A good psychologist would not tell you how to feel or tell you how to act, but guide you to a more functional and healthy way of feeling and acting by equipping you with the skills that you need. You can search for private psychologists online (though sometimes it can be as expensive as SGD100-SGD200 per hour of session) or go through a local polyclinic - what you can do is see a GP first, tell them your symptoms, and they will refer you to a psychologist at the polyclinic. The downside to this may be that due to the covid season, consultations may be more infrequent at the polyclinic. Alternatively, if your psychiatrist is able to refer you to a psychologist, that would be ideal too. (PS. A psychologist is quite different from a councillor, it will be worthwhile to do a quick google search on the different professionals that you can seek help from - this will strongly depend on your goal ie do you want to seek advice? Do you want to change the way you think? Do you want to learn how to accept certain negativity?)', 'Hi, thanks so much for taking time to reply back to my post.

In any case, firstly don't be afraid to submit your memo. This is the most important thing to do, because it provides documentation for the army to provide a more suitable vocation for yourself, if your depression is severe enough you will likely get  PES E1 or E9 status, which means you will do an easier version of BMT - you can even request to stay out from your doctor (or camp MO) ! \n\nOn the issue of suicidal thoughts, I've experienced the same thing. What I'd recommend is telling your psychiatrist. If he doesn't do much to help you and you genuinely are about to attempt then go to polyclinic or hospital A&amp;E (But highly likely you may be forcefully warded in IMH - I managed to not get warded in IMH or anywhere just temp stay few hours).\n\nAnother important thing is when you are posted to ur vocation and you feel very stressed out or wtv - speak to ur co they may transf u to different unit.\n\nThe most important thing is this, after a few months voice out to ur psychiatrist that you're still not coping well and see if he can get you to go for a medical review at SAF PCC (Psychological care center - very important!) then they will again review if you're suitable for military service.\n\nSpeak out to your psychiatrist when you - self harm,no apetite, experience suicidal thoughts, constant negative thoughts, insomnia, suicide attempts. Documentation is very important in helping  you.\n\nRemember, try your best and save yourself. Don't be fearmongered by others - I got PES F'd a few months into the army and now im in university!

sleepypolarbear123,1606971329,k5qq47,5,1,"Hi, I am interested in getting an IUCD/IUD in singapore, like a polyclinic due to price.

After minutes of being put on hold she replied that i have to have parental consent since i am below 21 and my parent(s) would have to be there for the whole thing. The research i did told me that you would at most require a guarantor if youre under the age of 21. I could be wrong tho.

phucth91,1606367599,k18zv3,12,1,"Hi, I'm a foreigner that's been living and working in Singapore for 5 years, this is the first time I've encountered this kind of problem and I need serious help.
So my friend and I found a room at a landed house rented out by the main tenant of the house. We made a deposit and paid one month rent in advance. We've been living for 2 weeks and few things have occurred making living here no longer bearable.
Part of it was my fault but also due to my expectation not met and I got carried away with my attitude. I'll go to details at the end of the post so bear with me.
So basically I've found the ads for the room on facebook market, it turned out it was the main tenant renting out the master bedrooom. (1) He, his wife, his son, his domestic helper, another female tenant are living there, adding me and my friend there are totally 7 people living there. (2) There was no tenancy agreement prepared for us thus we didn't sign anything and I'm also not sure whether the landlord is aware of this.
Now that we have disputes, my friend and I found that we can no longer stay without feeling unpleasant, we want to move out with one month notice. However, the main tenant refuses to return our deposit despite us asking to find a replacement. I actually rented rooms like this before which is without tenancy agreement, but all turned out well, the main tenants always returned the deposit when I moved out. Until this time...
So I want to ask whether there's anything I can do to make the main tenant to return our deposit (as they refuse any further discussion), for example in (1) the maximum occupancy as I read on URA is 6 unrelated persons, was it illegal for him to sublet the room to us? In (2) there was no tenancy agreement and does it count as illegal subleting when this happens? What if the landlord was aware but no tenancy agreement signed?
Ok so to the part of what happened, I moved in expecting to have good relationship with the main tenants and the housemates, and to be able to live comfortably (that's why I chose the place as there was no landlord). However, things quickly turned south. The first thing was that there weren't much space for us in common area, for example: the fridge, the cupboard, the kitchen are full of main tenants' stuff, the drying rack for the washed dishes. The main tenant also didn't let us use the store room and we had to put our extra stuff in the backyard (when it rains the floor is wet and my stuff also get wet). This didn't happen to me before as I usually had plenty of space to use and other housemates/landlords were also generously sharing with me. Secondly, the main tenant texted me in an annoyed manner that I shouldn't have turned off the water heater because it's for both our toilet and the common toilet (which he didn't inform me before and I just wanted to save electricity). The main tenant also showed that he wasn't welcoming us to use his stuff (utensils, pot, pan, that kind of things). We actually have those, we just didn't want to lay out so many things as there was limited space. I did try to discuss about this limited space issue a few times and asked for his understanding. I asked if we can use the shoe rack but he asked me to buy myself (which I don't know where to put considering the limited space). I needed a chair for my study table and his maid showed me one lying in the store not being used. So I borrowed and informed him. He replied that I could use it temporarily but would take back and prefered me to buy my own. This displeased me a lot because as a tenant I avoid to buy furniture as there's is heavy and big and difficult during moving house. I expressed this concern to him to no avail. Moving on, when we moved in he said that the rubbish bag can be removed at the end of the day, later on he said due to us cooking a lot and had rubbish that attracts insects, we had to throw the trash ourselves. At this point I was already greatly unamused by previous experience, I didn't reply to him. Though I still removed the trash as he requested. We also noticed our utensils and cooking equipment got shifted even when they weren't fully dried. 
So the last straw on the camel's back is when we were back from work after a long night shifts and received complaints that we didn't put back our plates/bowls after drying them. We were very tired and just wanted to sleep as we were going to have one more night shift that day. This angered bith of us. So my friend and I took out our own drying rack and put it on top of one of the counter to dry our own dishes and went back to our room. To my defense, we cooked dinner the evening before at 6pm, we rushed out to work at 7pm, not thinking about the dishes at all because they wouldn't dry by the time anyway. 
To their response, they called us to have a chat (yes, we haven't slept any) and started giving complaint as of why we put a rack there and never informed them in a berating manners. At this point I lost my cool and started arguing with them, but I was always mindful not to call names or words. To my surprise they started calling me names, blaming me, calling me ""crazy, cocky, arrogant, not nice, entitled, uncourteous"" and many more. Their reasons are because I said I rented the room from them so they should give me the chair (I didn't say that though), or when I said I didn't have a maid to always go around and just wait for the dishes to dry and put them back on time. Then they started asking us to move all our stuff in the backyard to our room upstairs and said that they were already very nice and kind to let us put our stuff there which we would have to rent somewhere else. The whole time I talked very little (as I knew it was already a lost cause and there was no point arguing) and they started talking about me in third person after calling names which, as if it wasn't disrespectful enough.
So my friend and I just wanted to move out of there to avoid further unpleasantness, but they refuse us the deposit.
I know I've been ranting a lot but I really just need help with the deposit. Sorry for the long post :( I just felt bad that I dragged my friend into this trouble as I was the one choosing the place. Please help :(

**Overwatch:**

- ""Ure a girl play mercy"" 

- ""Ur dps suck go play support like every girl"" 

- I will carry you every game if you give me your instagram/snapchat/(insert social media name)

- I get trashed talk when i pick ANYONE that's not support, even before the game starts im AUTOMATICALLY SHIT BC IM A NON FUCKING MALE

**Apex Legends: (copy pasting from my other post)**

- Duos leaving the game once they hear mic, female voice. mostly it's ""(grunt/sigh sound) we're matched with a girl, let's just go next"" 

- 1st one to be down (dead) out of the team in a fight, got  flamed for not picking someone like lifeline or loba to support them 

- (this is a funny one) When i was newer (few weeks) to the game, i found a golden evo once and mic-ed just to ask why didnt it have a number to upgrade to red evo. i got asked to stfu because he said i'm only attention seeking for simps to carry me (lol) 

- Got trashtalked for not wanting to provide them with my social media 

- Got asked to ""just follow us don't shoot unless i ask you to"" because apparently, and i quote: ""u're a girl and girls are bad when it comes to shooting games generally"" 

- Got a golden havoc once (best gun don't @ me) at a high tier loot area and got shouted to drop it because girls dont deserve it???????  i didn't and he disconnected straightaway haha

**League of Legends:** (Mostly on ingame text chat or with vc over people that added me) 

- ""Which support do you play? Soraka?"" 

- Give me your (insert social media name) 

- I can carry you if you give me your (insert social media name)

I started playing league when I was 11, and I really loved leaguing from the bottom of my heart. I met many people through the game and one of which is my bf. I met him when i was 14, and we started dating when we were 15. It wasn\'t him that got me into the game - when I was 14, he was barely level 20. You know league used to be capped at level 30. Then, he played a lot more than me, and spammed games to the point where he has multiple accounts at plat - diamond. It came to a point where he can wake up, play league the entire day, sleep, rinse and repeat. And obviously as his gf I was obliged to play with him.\n\nThere were many other things I wanted to do - things in real life. But I couldn\'t. I wanted to play with my other friends, but I couldn\'t. It became so toxic because he would guilt trip me and keep being like ""okay lor sua then i play alone"". Otherwise he will persistently ask me non-stop for more than 10 times (with no sarcasm added) to play with him league. If I play with my other friends he would get upset.\n\n\n Furthermore, what irritates me even more is that he would ONLY play ranked. Well, I don\'t mind playing ranked, but I mind playing ranked with HIM. Because when he plays with me it\'s gold, it\'s ""low-elo"" he would troll and feed because ""our team is so bad they dont deserve to win"" or ""hahaha it\'s just for fun, very easy climb back up one"". He would run it down in my games in a ALL LANES WINNING GAME. (We lost btw, our team was like 17 kills to 4 on the other team, i still don\'t understand how i lose games that i was clearly hardwinning.) \n\nThen he doesn\'t main AD (I main AD!) and he forces me into a support role. Then because we have no synergy bc no communication then he just goes like ""lol you can\'t play support as well"". He has basically named every single champ i played before and said i can\'t play it. I might as well never touch league ever again since i can play 0 champs. My provis was 1 W 4L when i played with him. Guess what, when I was playing without him, it became 6W 4L. Funny isn\'t it. I became a 60% winrate. I finally had the time and ability to climb to plat. But he got upset that I was playing without him. Then after playing with him my winrate is once again it\'s below 50% (probably at like 40% lmfao), i gain from like 25 LP per game to 14 LP per game at gold IV it\'s pathetic. I don\'t even want to league anymore because it\'s too hard to climb. He felt bad and offered to play my account - that upset me even more. So in his thoughts he can just fuck my acc\'s elo just because he can play it and boost it whenever he wants? Does he even care for my feelings as a girl? I\'m in uni rn with not much time to play. But hands-off my acc. I don\'t allow him to play it. \n\n\nAlso, when i\'m tired he doesn\'t respect it. I already said I want to rest and he still forces me to continue playing and keep questioning me why I don\'t want to league. Isn\'t it simple? Because I am tired. He doesn\'t accept my answers and still ask 10 million times (with exaggeration).In games,  he goes like ""awh you should have done X Y Z"" after the things already happen and we already lost. He could have told me to do it before he ran in? He always plays very aggressively and expect me to be able to read his thoughts and catch up. Even other guys do get pissed off at how reckless he is and how inconsiderate he is for the team. It\'s not even a girl\'s thing because even the most aggressive guys i know says he is crazy sometimes. That\'s because he is always going in even at the odd chance of 10% of being able to win.

CBSadness,1604914445,jquo7t,17,1,"Hi all, 20 M currently serving NS, will only ORD on 31st May 2020. I'm on mobile so please excuse the bad formatting

I'm currently posted as a Storeman in an active unit. Initially I wanted to use NS as a chance to study because my Poly GPA was pretty terrible, more than 2.5 but less than 3 due to my horrendous first year, but being in an active unit, I hardly have any time to study and I have to follow for outfields as well. And because of that, I've started to worry about my future with regards to uni and every other step afterwards. My semester GPAs improved alot after the first year, always hitting 3.3 and above, not great but it was a huge leap. However this wasn't enough to land me into the course of my choice which was Information Security @ SIT.

Due to the course being really competitive, I wasn't able to get a slot there. I had a Networking which I did well for but was obviously not enough to prove my abilities given my cumulative GPA.

As my passion really lies in Cyber Security, it would be nice if I need not deviate from the course of my choice, but then again I'm open to suggestions on what I should be doing.

I've also opted for day courses for some certification to hopefully show them that I really am interested in the course, and not judge me based on my cGPA, but rather how I improved over the course of my 3 years in poly.

And of course Im not going to lie saying that degree is not important and blah blah. It is important and good to get you a job. Even though right now doesnt mean got degree got job also, but still better than no cert. \n\nIn your current situation, i would think about what routes i can choose to pursue a uni education. I dont know all the options but whay i can think of are : redo poly; private uni. \n\nOf course these options need money. But the first step is to find out what your options are. \n\nSecond, decide if uni is necessary for you right now. I know friends who have diploma in tech working for SI doing pretty decently. So if you have a diploma, you need to consider if putting food on the table is more important first over a degree or u can afford to do a degree right now. \n\nThe most impt question then is: how do you think a degree can help u? Personally i came from JC background so i had no choice but to go uni, since I dont have a working cert (aka skillsets like in Poly or ITE). Else i can only do data entry work because no one needs someone to write 2k word essay for them. But a diploma is ultimately different  - it is a working cert. So you need to decide what exactly is the value of a degree to you. \n\nAnd to add on: besides a degree, there are some certifications online which you can do as well. I am going for AWS cloud practitioner and Associate Solution architect cause thats my field of interest. They are around 100 to 150usd, which is affordable for me. Find if there is something relevant for cybersec. There should be some certifications from other firms. Building your own mini projects on github can also help to boost your skills and experience, while also giving yourself a portfolio to show off to your interviewers. \n\nI want to say this: as long as you keep trying, somehow some door will open. The doors may not look good right now, but keep trying and you will get somewhere i hope. Stay strong mate.

My case might be extreme but during my schooling days especially, indian girls were rated the most unattractive even by indian boys. Tbh I found this weird because even average looking chinese girls would be considered more attractive just because of skin colour and I am not saying that these chinese girls are not attractive but I feel like all these experiences are just not pleasant for indian girls and really dampens our self-confidence. For example, in JC there was this chinese boy that I really liked but I was really embarrassed for liking him. In my head I was thinking that I was embarrassing him by liking him because I am Indian and I felt like I was doing something wrong as though I am not allowed to like someone chinese because it is not my place. I am really sorry for the ramble but my point is that Indian women in Singapore are more unlikely to approach a chinese man they are interested in because of our lack of self-confidence due to experiences we had growing up and the chances of us getting rejected is so high we might as well not try. Even within the Indian community, most Indian guys would rather date fairer skinned Indian girls so I feel that might be the reason why it is more common to see Indian guys dating chinese girls because dark skinned guys can label themselves as dark and handsome but dark skinned girls are just dark skinned girls.

Fee_New,1604334681,jmqqjj,10,1,"Hello, I don't come to reddit often but recently I was reading and found this to be a great place to ask for advice (while remaining anonymous). There was a post dated a few years back by someone also asking for advice on paying for their Uni education and I think I can really use some advice now. I might be long-winded and this post may take time to read, but I will try my best to summarise.

**Background:** I'm 21, Singaporean male who came from JC and just finished NS at the end of last year. For those who take the JC road, most would be in uni already. During yr 1 NS, I applied for and was offered a 3 year course in NTU which I accepted. Things changed after ord when I joined an insurance agency as a part time staff. Within weeks after joining I decided that the job was not for me. While looking for a meaningful job to spend my time (and earn money) before uni starts, I decided to consider giving insurance a try. The barriers to entry are really low and on hindsight, it is a make it or break it career. It was around that time when I had a big argument with my parents and on the week before my 21st, I was told to move out of the house which I agreed is best for me (more on this later). As those events unfolded, it reaffirmed my decision to join insurance and I told myself that joining insurance is not a choice but a necessity now since they remunerate based on by your ability to bring in sales (there is no upper limit to what I can potentially earn).

I was ambitious and motivated by the possibility of actually doing well in the job so I tried extremely hard to make it work. I worked long hours prospecting but it was not easy. I consider myself a determined and tenacious person but facing literally hundreds of rejections over the phone daily really tested my limits. Although I did not give up, I was surrounded by negativity I created for not being able to produce and to meet sales targets. I also started renting a room and had additional pressure to increase my earnings (because I now had additional recurring expenditure). Not long after I started doing insurance, covid came and CB started. For a good few months, I was stuck in my rented apartment facing my computer over 12 hours a day gaming to escape reality. It was a combination of the bad timing, my incompetence, my inexperience, lack of people's skills and discipline that I failed in insurance. Perhaps it was also this downward spiral that I can only see going deeper and deeper as my life becomes more and more messed up, that another day wasted would not have made a difference anyway.

Along the way, I picked up bad habits like ordering Grabfood every single meal and I chanced upon Singapore Pools online lottery (toto), increasing my expenses (at that point I was generating no income at all). It got so bad one month that I lost hundreds on lottery gambling after losing every bet I made. That was a turning point. I filed for Self-Exclusion under NCPG which essentially blocked my account from making an transactions for at least a year. By then, the damage was done and I have lost a few hundred of dollars (which could have been used to pay rent). During this time, my sibling is aware of my situation and she did all they could for me. My sister even begged my parents to give me my childhood savings which she transferred over to me via PayNow. Whenever I needed money for rent, I would ask her for help and she would always come to my rescue. Currently, I owe her about $3k and my ex company about $5k (for payment given earlier and breaking the contract in the near future).

I then decided to give up on insurance as I could not see myself doing well there. The job is just not suitable for my reclusive and solitary nature. I prefer isolation and I tend to avoid social gatherings. On top of that, I am as straightfoward as a person can be. I cannot pretend to be extremely friendly and lively to others. Unlike some people in insurance, I am too honest for my own good. Considering all these factors, I decided to leave insurance.

Recently, through the help of a friend, I manage to find jobs that allowed me to work long hours and be remunerated rather fairly. I am now working odd jobs every single day to save up (to repay my debts) and also to further my studies (the main focus of this post). Excluding CPF, I am taking home about 3-3.5k a month. After deducting a huge portion for my rent, insurance and other expenses (totally around 1.3-1.5k a month) I am left with roughly 1.5-2k a month to repay my debts and to save. However, these are just odd jobs and there is no guarantee that the jobs would still be available after a few months.

**Now:** I am aiming to matriculate next year Jul/Aug (JC intake). I am interested in engineering courses in NTU/NUS and I will likely choose the cheaper of the 2 options (though from my current research the tuition fees are the same per annum). I have been interested to read engineering for quite some time now but I am unable to decide which engineering course I want to choose as my specialisation. (I know this can be an entire post on its own).

As for what I want to do in my future, I want to be an investor/entrepreneur (eventually getting an MBA) once my life starts to improve after getting a degree. I am open to doing a sales job after getting a degree (especially if it gives me opportunities to travel since I love travelling). An ideal pathway I would want is to work for several years (and pay off my loans) before saving up to invest/start my entrepreneurship journey (my ultimate goal in life). But before that, I would need to get my finances right and also secure a degree and I found out the hard way that having just an A level cert in Singapore is as good as not having one.

In particular, I am interested in Electrical/Chemical or Environmental Engineering courses, although I am not sure where the road will lead after getting that degree. Given that I didn't excel in my A's, I might not be offered the course which I want when application window opens next year too. I scored just below 80 points (which is one of the worst in my school as I came from one of the top schools in SG). I find the most important issue to work out now, though, is not the course but the cost if I were to matriculate next year.

**Moving on:** Below is what I have gathered so far from some research. I plan to use these methods to fund for my uni education. If you have answers to my questions or know of anyone with experience dealing with funding for university, please help to clarify my doubts. It would be even better if you can compare both NUS and NTU's way of settling such payments too.

Disbursement of Funds: For general undergraduate programme students who are using a combination of loans &amp;/or subsidies to settle their MOE subsidised tuition fees, the disbursement sequence is as follows:

PSEA funds

CPF funds under the CPF Education Scheme

Tuition Fee Loan (up to 90%)

Study Loan

Higher Education Bursary

GIRO deductions from bank account

1. Does that mean that I have to follow this order and use up my PSEA funds first before I pay the tuition fees using other methods? If that is so, how is it that some people have advised others to let the amount in their PSEA account compound (2.5% IR) till the last semester before using it to pay for tuition fees?
2. One guide (Guide A) I came across mentions that I should consider if I am eligible for the CPF Education Scheme. (Of course I am using my own CPF since I will be working for almost another year before matriculating and I would likely have a significant amount in my CPF OA by then. I have a terrible relationship with my parents since young and I am no longer in contact with my parents to use their CPF, neither would I want to go back home to seek their help)

Another guide (Guide B) mentions that ""after all available CPF OA monies have been deducted, if there is still a shortfall, the student will need to make up the shortfall in cash, take a loan under the MOE Tuition Fee Loan Scheme, or seek out financial aid.""

3) According to the CPF website (link below) it mentioned that if I do not have enough savings in my OA (which I will not) I will need to make alternative arrangement to pay the tuition fees in cash, or consider other financing options such as the Tuition Fee Loan or use of the student's Post-Secondary Education Account (PSEA) savings. Does this mean that I can only use my CPF if it is enough to cover the entire tuition fees? Can I make part of the tuition fee payment using my CPF OA? According to Guide B, it seems like a partial payment can be arranged. How would I go about applying for that and like the disbursement of funds, how will I go about paying partially?

4) If I take a tuition fee loan of 90% (and if my bursary covers more than 10%), how will the deduction go about? Must I calculate so that I take a tuition fee loan equal to the remaining of what I owe after receiving the bursary to maximise the use of the bursary?

5) Now that I am staying alone, how would my bursary amount be determined? Since my address on my NRIC shows the rented room now, will the gross monthly per capita income be just my own income (if any) when I am schooling? Would I also be able to qualify for study grants?

6) How does a combination of the PSEA funds, CPF funds under the CPF education scheme, tuition fee loan, NUS/NTU study loan and bursary work?

7) As for the study loan, does anyone can give a rough estimate which category would I be classified into? (I also do not own my own laptop)

Below are some of the comments I came across while reading online.

""I became resident assistant in the hostel and received free accommodation."" - Malaysian who studied in NUS

8) How does one become a resident assistant in a hostel?

""Do internships every summer. Internships are very helpful, a better paying one will easily cover your daily expense and even allow you pocket or save some extra cash. Internship will also help to boost on your portfolio!'

9) What is the likelihood of an engineering student finding an internship? (assuming my results are not spectacular, mine has always been average. To be realistic, since I have lost touch with most of the things I learnt in High School/JC below average would be more accurate). Would I be better off working odd jobs in the summer or doing internships to earn money?

10) I saw that there is a Work study scheme in NTU, while there is also a prestigious NOC programme in NUS which develops entrepreneurs which I am really interested in (it might be way above my league, but if it isn't I would defenitely apply provided my results and finances permits) Again it is a comparison of both institutions

Taking into account that I will still need to have fixed expenses of roughly 1.3-1.5k per month throughout the entire course of study, I am looking to apply for as many loans as possible to minimise the amount I pay on my own (until I graduate and find a job, when I will aim to clear my debts as quickly as possible).

Alternative-Sort4744,1604049007,jktf3r,49,1,"Ok here’s mine as a starter. 

I recently left a job after working for 10 months, started w 2.2k and a ‘graduating’ pay of 2.8k. Working in a wholesale and trading company, it is a relatively small family-based business. FYI, I was the employee not part of the fam. 

As a fresh poly grad, they didn’t need any experience and provided meals etc. Sounds pretty amazing tbh. I went in under the role of admin assistant with my working hours theoretically 9 hours per day. 

So the rule is, no outside break. Like we can’t leave the office to get food. We used to have someone bringing food in but due to COVID-19, the supply stopped. So most of the time either we starve, or call for delivery (which the boss tend to give us a weird judgey look for that). 

My scope there was not say very near my definition of admin. With zero experience, i was handling the accounts payable, issuing payroll stuffs, supplier invoices check, MOM permit renewal issuance, quarterly GST, cleaning toilets, ordering printing supplies, ordering items from suppliers. And that’s not the end of the list. 

Our company Accounts was on leave for a period, so i have to cover her part as well like chasing for payments, collecting payments, I have to one shop by one shop collect payments as well. Mcm loan shark. 

One random day the boss came and fired all the clerks who are mainly helping w the orders processing, which left me stunned as heck. So in the end me being the solo ranger covered the whole office operations, alone. 

Where were the family members now, if you were asking? 

Usually in the office the son will only open his mouth to order people around, the daughter is usually not around. So most of the time is just me and the boss. While i handle 300 orders on a daily basis solo, don’t forget my admin stuffs ok. So I have to voluntarily OT until 4am at times. I once worked a 24 hours. All of these - unpaid. 

Can I also say due to COVID-19, there were no air-conditioning bc need to promote ventilation lol. And I was sitting right above two cold rooms, imagine the heat. Plus no fan :)

After like 4 months later, the boss hired a “power clerk” who worked in the company before previously for 3 years. I heard plenty of stories about her, how she told supplier to amend the cash bill so she can pocket the discrepancies etc. Yet when I interacted w her, she told me her reason for leaving was something else, instead of being fired? 

Subsequently some newbies joined too. I would say the order system is pretty error-prone so the newbies make quite a bit of mistakes, and usually I will spot those and rectify on the spot already. But this “power clerk” always snapped a picture before letting me do the corrections. 

Guess where those snapshots went to? THE BOSS. 

I was called for a huge scolding (quite wtf right). 

here’s what the boss said “You should always double check what people do. If they don’t check, you have to. You fear people replacing your position?”

Of which all these made me super confused. And the boss said something along the lines of me “being a compulsive liar”. 

Still don’t get it. Until one day i came across a whatsapp conversation. This “power clerk” reports everything to the boss. From big to small, every single one not spared. 

One fine day this power clerk was telling me: (translated) don’t wear such a big hat if you don’t have such a big head. you need to know you’re worth how many cents. The boss spent thousands to expedite my permit so I can work here, meanwhile you’re just someone picked from outside. So what? To compare to my abilities, you also need to know if you have the abilities to or not. 

Wow this cocky ass. I was contemplating resignation already because knowing the boss, if he starts to have negative statements about you, he will start picking on you. And he always used “bonus” to threaten us. 

Like screw it man. I resigned. 

But I think I was pretty lucky to overhear her conversation with one of the suppliers one day AND THERE SHE DID IT, ALTERING THE AMOUNT WEWWEW. 

I reported her to boss. I mean, if she’s a chronic reporter about others except herself, she should get some reports about her too? But yea, the boss was hella pissed and he banned her from buying goods from suppliers in the future. 

But yeah overall, I was quite contended to have joined this company once I graduated from poly. I was saving up for my university school fees, so this pay amount really helped a lot. And I also learned quite a lot of stuffs and dealing with snakes. Guess I didn’t have to work in a zoo for that LOL

Quite the abstract version bc there’s a lot more details to this whole saga.

Just some background here, I'm currently a J2 student about to take my A levels. A few days ago I received my letter to enlist on 20th January 2020. I was medically graded PES BP cause I was undergoing bulking phase that time. (BMI overshot) I regularly gym last time and do consider myself pretty fit. I was able to get 83 points (1 sit-up 1 pushup away from gold sadly) for IPPT. I have gotten significantly fatter and heavier with 21 - 22% body fat now but I am confident that I can lose it all before enlistment. Thus, any seniors with prior experience ?

itsnaufal,1603806698,jj1hle,30,1,"Hey guys, so I’m currently working at resort world sentosa in one of the hotels. It was Monday 26 October 2020, i was working a 12hrs shift from 10am to 10pm and at 8.30pm i was task to go to level 8 to fix a door battery. There was 4 doors in total. So level 8 was totally vacant for a few weeks coming to a month, i went up around 8.45pm to do the allocated task. I exited through the service lift as that’s the only was staff can get access from floor to floor as we can’t use the guest lift for safety reasons. As i exited the service lift and left the service door ajar as i always do so i can exit without tapping my staff pass i made my way to one of the room to begin my repairs, about few minutes in i hear a loud bang as if the service door was being close by someone. As i thought it was another staff (housekeeping or facility management) I didn’t think twice. As i was about to close up the room door as i had already did the necessary, a second loud bang was heard from the service lift door, I didn’t think as maybe someone exited through it.

So on to the 2nd 3rd and last door, the 2nd door was just beside the service lift door as i was about to open the door i heard the same loud bang i heard earlier on. So i knew something was up as I didn’t hear anyone tapping or footsteps. With that being said i quickly finish up the task for the 3rd and 4th door and as i was walking back to the service door, while opening it i saw something out of the corner of my eye like a shadow walking past back and forth. I knew I didn’t get paid enough for this as i was sure no one came up as surely you would hear footsteps or some shit to know people are there. And I swear to god that as i was waiting for the lift, it was the longest time i had to wait for a damn lift. I kept looking back at the small window from the service lift door so i would be prepared for anything. As i entered the lift to my relief there was 2 housekeeping staff there wanting to go down to B1. I ask them did anyone came up to this level and they said nah we’re all going back bro.

So upon reaching the front desk, i came across the usual engineer and ask him did anyone came up the level i was on? They said nope as they were just about to hand over to their night shift on duty and they were all the way at the front desk chatting with my colleague. about a few minutes past, i told my colleague about what had happened and she said “oh we would always go with someone else at night regardless the level”

So today which is Tuesday 27 October 2020, i told my aunt about this and she is well known amongst us as she has those third eye and supernatural communication thingy. She told me that oh someone was there and you disturbed it by entering as there was no one at the particular level for a long time. She said it was a Pontianak that was angry with me. 

I don’t really believe in the supernatural but this shit made me think twice hahaha.

I'm an aspiring cyber security professional, currently pursuing my bachelor's.

I am just gonna come out with it, coz I think I gotta be real to myself - I am lost.   


**\*\*\*\*TLDR\*\*\*\***

I always considered myself to be special and impervious to the status quo; that 'just getting a job' would be a smooth ride for me and then the real world finally hit me this year.  
Being Singaporean, smart, possessing good military track record, good-looking, holistic personality, fast learner etc apparently noone gives a flying f\*ck and doesn't even cut it to get a starter job somewhere.  
But I strongly feel that I'm not communicating myself well out to the world.

And due to this, I feel totally lost. Because in order to truly find my calling in the industry, I need to start with literally *any job.* I know that once I start applying myself in the real world, I will know where I belong.

My main issue right now is my time. Since I'm pursuing full-time studies, I cannot commit myself full-time to a company/organization. And who the f\*ck wants to hire a part-time guy with educational obligations for serious business like cyber security, unless they have something they can bring to the table that others cannot.

I cannot just sit around waiting for shit to happen anymore. I am 25 this year and am facing immense pressure to do something, and it's not societal, it's just me.

Skdhsksh,1602206891,j7pzbh,44,1,"I don’t even know where to start. I feel that I’m just hopeless and I just have to be a burden to people. For some context - due to family issues , child protection services stepped in and sent me to childrens home in 2018. Back then I was in Sec 3 and it was very difficult living there considering the various factors (eg sleep by 8pm, confiscation of mobile devices). Couldn’t adapt to the environment and was placed in X hostel instead after 6 months. Anyways , being in childrens home was what my father always wanted, as he didn’t want to pay for my expenses. Fast forward, this is my third year living in X hostel. For this whole time in X hostel, my family doesn’t visit me and I am heavily dependent on funding for financial support. I am currently in poly year 1 , doing p decently. But the fact that ever since I started working, my parents keep asking me for money is just oompf . They’ll only come to me when they need money. And sometimes the amount they ask can be like $1000+ like hello I’m not your atm machine. Why am I not able to live like what a 17 year old should? Well, I sent them my results for Os they don’t say anything. I sent them my gpa 3.8X to them, they don’t say anything as well. They will be happy for my siblings tho if they pass all their subjects like wtf? HELLO IM DOING AND DID MUCH BETTER THAN THEM IN TERMS OF ACADEMICS despite such circumstances. The only time when they’ll text me is when they need money. This applies to my younger siblings as well. My brother who is 16 currently gets supplies from the hospital and sells them for a profit(?) To add on, he spends money like nobody’s business, like as if he was born with a silver spoon. He was on probation before for scamming. Nope, he doesn’t go to work thinking that money will fall from the sky. My 2 younger sisters? They have a record of stealing. My mum always like to take sides instead of being neutral. I rmb this time where I told her if she keeps on siding my brother, he will abuse you one day when you cannot give him money. My mum lit just hung up the call and blocked me LOL. my relatives? They side my parents so I lit have no one to rely on. X hostel only allows me to live there till I graduate from poly, I don’t know what to do next as I just feel like shit. I want to rent a room, but people tell me it’s an unrealistic option. I take up to 2 part time jobs whenever holiday comes bc I want to get into Uni badly (+ knowing that I have to pay for such fees myself). I feel bad that “outsiders” have to provide this poor ass with funding etc so that I can get by. If I die, wouldn’t everything be better? I find it difficult to trust ppl too bc of my family. They are lit a bunch of assholes that even my sch counsellor in Sec sch told me that my situation is f*ucked up and he doesn’t force me to “reconcile” with them.

Your mindset to creating posts / comments will also change to think what would gain me karma instead of what do I actually want (or need) to comment.



The simple notion of I don't want to be down voted and not be able to post again in the sub greatly reduces healthy discussion and debate because a lot of opinions are just left unsaid, and making a whole new post on another sub reddit is not only hasslesome and sometimes unnecessary but since r/singapore is the most popular singapore  reddit group, I think it is dangerous a lot of thoughts are just left unsaid and not shown. Meaning, one sided opinions that can be not true even if its up voted because of confirmation bias or blind following to not upset the social paradigm. I believe in any form of freedom of speech no matter what. Down voted comments are alr hidden, so it wouldn't be that cluttering, and we can have a choice to click it to see it or not and respond or not.


I read from some comments before my post got deleted is that the minimum karma and age is to prevent spam/bot/ trolls / agencies from propagating false info.


But I still don't get it, a lot of other sub Reddit don't have a min karma point required to post a comment, and they seem fine? I was told some sub Reddit by r/world news has one, but I know many Subreddits like for instance this one and r/Singapore raw that don't. 




New accounts often have a very lengthy time break between each comment to prevent troll / spam accounts. If you have a negative karma, I think automatically the break time between each post and comment is extended greatly. And honestly I've seen a lot of troll comments with a lot of  up votes as well so just because the popular masses likes a comment doesn't mean to be frank it is worthy to be seen, it can just spur a rumour out of control, it should be allowed that a new acc/ a comment downvoted to oblivion/ should be available to be seen as well. 


 even  if it's not a negative karma point on r/Singapore if you are new u can't post, so just because u just joined your opinion / facts doesn't matter?  Doesn't make sense. 


Sorry for my rambling, but to illustrate my point.. 


I saw comments on a post about an old hardworking naive lady that got scammed off by a teenager all her life savings, insurances. To the point where even after all the old lady has lost, the greedy teenager still wanted her fixed assets like housing  if she didn't stop to report to the police. And people were lauding (with a lot of up votes) the teenager for being smart and got future in sales and marketing.


I didn't mind seeing that comment, it can be funny, but to me that was insensitive and I would like to have responded back that the teenager behavior should not be lauded and the old lady did not deserve this at all for working hard all her life and had a lapse in judgment. 


I'm just going to be frank either the lady was in a very vulnerable state of mind, or she has some sort of mental disability to believe the teenager, but taking advantage of someone in such a serious monetary manner should never be taken lightly, such as I'm sure people don't take it lightly when a person with mental disability is sexually exploited. I personally find being monetarily exploited worse cos money makes or break people. You can't live without money.



 mean it goes against the very principle of governance. To do what is right and not what is popular with the people.

The simple notion of I don't want to be down voted and not be able to post again in the sub greatly reduces healthy discussion and debate. Down voted comments are alr hidden, so it wouldn't be that cluttering, and we can have a choice to see it or not.


I read from some comments before my post got deleted is that the common idea it is to prevent spam/bot/ trolls / agencies from propagating false info.


But I still don't get it, a lot of other sub reedits don't have a min karma point required to post a comment, and they seem fine? I was told some sub Reddit by r/world news has one, but I know many Subreddits like for instance this one and r/Singapore raw that don't. 




New accounts often have a very lengthy time break between each comment to prevent troll / spam accounts. If u have a negative karma, I think automatically the break time between each post and comment is extended greatly. And honestly I've seen a lot of troll comments with up votes as well so just cos the popular masses doesn't like it doesn't mean it's automatically not deserving of being seen. 



Furthermore, even if it's not a negative karma point on r/Singapore if your new u can't post, so just because u just joined your opinion doesn't matter?  Doesn't make sense. 


I saw comments on a post about an old hardworking naive lady that got scammed off by a teenager all her life savings, insurances. To the point where even after all the old lady has lost, the greedy teenager still wanted her assets if she didn't stop to report to the police. And people were lauding (with a lot of up votes) the teenager for being smart and got future in sales and marketing.


I didn't mind seeing that comment, it can be funny, but to me that was insensitive and I would like to have responded back that the teenager behavior should not be lauded and the old lady did not deserve this at all for working hard all her life and had a lapse in judgment. 


I'm just going to be frank either the lady was in a very vulnerable state of mind, or she has some sort of mental disability to believe the teenager, but taking advantage of someone in such a serious monetary manner should never be taken lightly, such as I'm. Sure people don't take it lightly when a person with mental disability is sexually exploited. I personally find being monetarily exploited worse cos money makes or break people.

How feasible is it for us to live off of this?

hason124,1601780500,j4ryn3,12,1,"Hi all,

Recently my mate and I have been thinking about coming back to Singapore to start our careers and a new life here. Both of us were born in SG and went through Primary and Secondary school but shortly after left for the UK to complete our A Levels/Undergrad/Postgrad etc.

We have both been out of the system for over 10 years, but we did come back to serve NS and the occasional 1-2 month summer holiday every other year.  

Our approach to life is very akin to people overseas we both have integrated well into the western culture (adopted the mannerisms, little more open-minded, willing to take more risks, think outside of our bubbles) we have also switched degrees, took gap years to take on projects, travel and explore risky ventures to really figure out what we wanted to do with our lives. But within the context of Singapore we should have already graduated with jobs and started settling down with our partners.


We have noticed over the years that there has been a growing sense of displeasure from our relatives/friends/significant others for talking an unconventional path compared to the rest of the local Singaporeans (going overseas, adopting different cultures etc.). We often times try and think outside our bubbles (even if it seems way to difficult, but not impossible). But have been told that we are either being “Extra” or “Thinking too much” and should just do what everyone else does. 

We try and integrate as much as we can but sometimes we cannot take away the habits and mentality we have adopted overseas. We love Singapore and everything it has to offer but we are worried that this negative perception towards our overseas experiences and our ways of life would mate it difficult to integrate back if we decided to come back. 


Both of us are also currently being pushed by our S.O/relatives to end university (with an undergrad degree) early take jobs and settle down. But we both still plan on furthering our university careers (overseas) to better our opportunities. However, it seems that our age (we are just past our mid-20s) is an issue, we have “wasted time” and their patience is running out. 


Is this something we should be concerned about? Is our situation unique? Are most Singapore open to the idea of their peers coming back to Singapore with different ideologies, accents and habits?

For (2), unfortunately we cannot remain closed to the outside world forever. So this is no doubt a risk the government has chosen to take.

I am in a country where its government had to make a u-turn with regard to re-opening and relaxing. Psychologically, a u-turn is worse than continuing to endure masks. With enduring you're already feeling shit, your mood is low. When you u-turn, there is a sharp increase, followed by a sharp decrease back down.

So, I am from the UK and I have been making good progress with a SINGA scholarship for a PhD in Singapore. I got my email for the final interview and it got me thinking a lot more about life and the cost of living in Singapore.

The scholarship offers $2500 SGD (after the first year) per month. Rent would be cheaper from campus accommodation being around $490 - 590 SGD per month. This would leave me with around $2000 SGD for other expenses.

Would be amazing to get some opinions on what quality of life would be like on that amount! I'm pretty outgoing and enjoy nightlife, food I am happy keeping on the cheaper end, I guess I need to be thinking about phone, transport etc as well. The SINGA site suggests 1000-1300 per month without accommodation, is that accurate?

Get away from Singapore. Go on an adventure or a spiritual journey. Due to the global pandemic, I realize this is more difficult than ever but my advice is the same. Have you read Jack Kerouac On the Road? A movie was made in 2012 based on the book.\n\nMan, I feel your existential crises. That feeling will never go away. The only way to “break on through to the other side” is a little suffering. Work is just a means to live the life I want. So many define their existence by their work but I choose not to do that. I am a paper pusher. I make good coin but I frequently wonder what is the value in what I am doing. I get to travel around to world learning new cultures. It changed my world perspective from most Americans who are ethnocentric. I learned humans are the same around the world. We all struggle for meaning, significant, and purpose. What is my significance in the world? For me it’s not work it’s being a Father. Apart from that, my life has mostly been insignificant. For me, love is the only “real” emotion worth living for and the only real love is either unconditional, such as family or children, or sacrificial. Sacrificing oneself for another life. \n\nThis may sound strange but it it were not for running, I would be in a sorry state of depression. Running for me is about pushing through the pain and suffering to achieve my goal. Running helps me cope day to day. Apart from the joy of being a parent, enduring the pain and suffering from running long distance teaches me the inner strength that I need to endure each day. \n\nAs I see it, as a young man, there are three ways you can embark on a spiritual journey or adventure to change your view of work. all three involve nature as the spiritual medium. The idea is get out of the city into nature. The first two need to involve a bit of suffering to reach a spiritual plane. The third will take you there organically. \n\n1. Organized adventure: it could literally be any organized adventure that will not be easy. Take your pick. For example, hike the Kokoda Trail in Papúa New Guinea with a group and a guide. Hiking through the jungle terrain, you will suffer in the sun and rain to the point of exhaustion and fatigue. Along the way, you will experience sympathy for the people that died on that trail in WWII when the Australians were fighting the Japanese. \n\n2. Individual adventure: for me, this is the preferred option for a spiritual journey because anything is possible. It important to take this journey alone. You don’t have to completely rough it living off the land but you do need to get out of hour comfort zone. Hardship and suffering will be good for your soul. For example, you could go on a 2-week hike of the Appalachian trail alone, camping along the way. \n\n3. Consume psilocybin (mushrooms). This option is the easiest and probably the most profound spiritual journey but is obviously not possible in Singapore. For this you will need to travel to another country. A trip will change how you perceive the world around you for many years. However, you would need to visit Amsterdam to purchase mushrooms from a head shop. Or you could find a cow field after a day of rain and hunt for the mushrooms underneath the cow patties. Better still, take the mushrooms with you on a 2-week hike along the Appalachian trail.', 'Wait till you have nothing to do. Then you will start asking yourself you have nothing to do. What is the meaning of all this.', ""Going to lend an opinion as an outsider, please correct me if I'm wrong. \n\nIt seems to me like the culture in Singapore puts a lot of emphasis on work. It's a country that has grown from very little in 50 years and has done so through relentless work. Apart from strong family values it's the thing that stands out the most when you're here as a foreigner. \n\nWith no travel at the moment everyone is totally immersed in this, with little chance for a break. Which I feel has intensified things a little. \n\nDon't forget it's OK to take time off, even if you're looking for internships. Go and do something else that you love and remember that work is to support living, not the other way around.""]"

Yesterday while I was at a relative’s place, I overheard my aunt telling his son (my cousin) on his wife’s behaviour, “Wah... She come in yaya and never greet me at all still nevermind. Still got the audacity to apologise to me. Wrong is wrong already. Explaining it will only make it worse”.

applesaucekittycat,1613045842,lhjj67,9,1,"Im about to graduate with diploma cert. I really want to pursue carpentry and have been doing internships and freelance works within carpentry industry in SG for the past 5 years. I follow my boss(es) around doing home renovation as well, did cabinetry here and there and did a touch of furniture making. However, due to my my gender (F) and physical size, I don’t think the chances of getting employed as a full time female carpenter are high. 


As much as it is definitely my passion, it’s got a negative effect for my long term as it’s usually heavy job and it probably needs at least 1 more person to help me in a project. My small frame doesn’t help at all when it comes to solo projects. That being said, I really love designing and creating from scratch. Im thinking to swerve from carpentry to interior design as it’s a safer option in case i plan to start a family. 


However, i do not have interior design knowledge in terms of singapore building. Im thinking if i know how to build, i can design better.

It sounds to me like your interest is mainly in design (as opposed to actually cutting and assembling wood? I stand to be corrected though). If you have original ideas, you can definitely have workers construct and create your designs for you.\n\nWhile interior design is definitely an option, the ID industry in Singapore is pretty unregulated and are mostly just contractors offering templated outcomes (residential). If you take up an internship, you are more likely to be just supervising subcon works instead of actually getting to design. If you are looking at ID for commercial and other sort of spaces (common areas, concert halls, schools etc) you\'d probably need an architectural based background. \n\nNUS offers an industrial design course which tackles design principles and (quoting directly from their website) "" furniture design, healthcare design, consumer electronics design, transportation design, apps and interaction design, retail design, home appliance design, conceptual design, service design and more.""

What you should do is to PIVOT your passion in carpentry to jobs which still allow you to feed the passion. I would say a lot of people who work in/are successful in interior design didn’t study it in school either; don’t let your “lack of interior design knowledge” stop you from searching for a job in the industry.

I get most of my furniture made in Indonesia, and the manufacturers designer has a bit of princess syndrome, so whenever I point out that I’d like something differently it’s weeks before I get any feedback. But I can’t design to the degree that it works for three woodworkers. If you can do both then there is a huge market.

MongInABush,1611840828,l6wohc,3,1,"Hi reddit,

l’ve never posted on here and rarely use the site, however, it was recommended to me by a friend.

I’d like to ask for your help as I know there are some internet wizards out there.My name is Nikita, I’m a 20 year old guy and have lived in the UK my whole life, I’ve always looked different from my parents, my mother is Russian and dad Ukrainian, I’ve constantly been teased about looking Asian or potentially being adopted.

Two months ago I travelled to Russia and found an old photo in my mums album, it was a picture of her in her youth standing with a tall Asian man who looked just like me! I instantly felt a lump in my throat, “have I been lied to for 20 years?”, yes, the answer was yes but I fully understand why it was kept secret.

I asked her about the photo and she explained everything, the story began with her dance troupe making their way through Asia, upon reaching Singapore she met a nice guy called “Jason”, he was a security guard at a fancy hotel, they started dating and things looked well, a few months later my mother got pregnant, Jason and his family couldn’t believe it, a white Christian woman has accused him of impregnating her before marriage. My mum came back to Russia to think about what she’ll do next, she chose to study Islam to move to Singapore and start a family, however, all was not that easy. Jason was paranoid and in denial, he called my mum demanding that she admit the child wasn’t his. After multiple threatening calls she blocked his number and never heard from him again.Long story short Jason’s mother didn’t approve and my mother accepted a job offer in the United Kingdom, she would raise me as a single parent until the age of two.

Sorry for the long post but this brings me to the main point, I’d like to know if anyone recognises ‘Jason’ and if so I’d like to contact him and perhaps meet my half brothers and sisters.

I have an image but I can’t attach it for some reason.

**All the info I have:**

* **Went by the name ‘Jason’ but real name might be ’Azar’**
* **Worked as a security guard at BRIX club in the Grand Hyatt hotel, Singapore**
* **Probably in his late 40s or early 50s by now**

My concerns are:
- do I need a CS degree to get a job
- do I need a CS degree with honours (considering the extra 5K+ SGD)

I am very confident, at the very least, more than 95% of the ‘Joels’ who are residents of Singapore have been addressed by the second pronunciation throughout our lives. Frankly, it’s nothing new to us. Most of the time, (for the ones who even care deep down at least) would even ‘let it slide’ as usual.

For what it’s worth, here are some other names that have been commonly mispronounced locally or regionally by us as well:

Just May last year, Gold 905 had sparked the controversy when a contestant had ‘mispronounced’ celebrity Tony Hadley’s name. To which, upon request, the actor himself had endorsed.

So then, why not us? From what I’ve been taught since young, getting a person’s name right is the  fundamentals of respect one should give. Yet, most people would just assume that the name ‘Joel’ is pronounced in the latter as aforementioned. So under those circumstances, is it too much for me to correct them?

I was always confident and comfortable in getting vaccines for myself and my loved ones because many generations before us have gone through that and live long happy and healthy life despite being obstinate. However we do not have that evidence in this case.

I am not too sure about the details as I haven't been keeping up with news as closely as I did back in my school days but I did see on the news that there were some bad and serious reactions to vaccine.

Normally, vaccines would be tested for years before being released to the public however with covid, we haven't had time to do that yet. 

I understand that the economy and our well-being as well as mental health has suffered immensely due to covid and having a vaccine would definitely make life a whole lot easier and allow us to go out and carry on her normal activities.

I\'m a graduate student working on RNA, which is the molecule that the new COVID vaccine is made from. I totally understand your reservations about the vaccine, and your concerns are reasonable.\n\nTo understand the vaccine better, I\'d like to explain how this vaccine works compared to a traditional vaccine. In a ""traditional"" vaccine, we basically give your body a small amount of a ""dead"" virus which cannot cause any illness and which cannot spread. When we do this, the body\'s immune system learns to recognise the virus and defeat this dead virus. When our body next encounters the live virus, it will already have the capability to recognise and quickly kill the virus before it is able to cause disease.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges regading the traditional vaccine strategy is making a virus that is ""dead enough"" to not spread/cause illness, but ""live"" enough that your body wants to fight it off. Another concern is that since we are introducing a foreign particle into our body, our body may have an adverse reaction to the particle.\n\nIn the new COVID vaccines, they use a new strategy. In this strategy, they are injecting a small amount of RNA. RNA is the ""blueprint"" a cell uses to make protein. When this RNA enters your cells, your cells start to make a small part of the COVID virus, and our immune system learns to recognise and attack this small part of the virus.\n\nSince we are only making a small part of the virus, we are more certain that the virus is incapable of spreading or causing illness. Also, RNA is a regular molecule that our body makes (for creating our own body\'s proteins), so it\'s less likely for our cells to have an adverse reaction to the RNA vaccine. Finally, RNA does not last very long in the body. Typically, the body gets rid of RNAs within a few minutes to hours! Once it has done its job it\'s gone, so the odds of long term side effects are quite rare.\n\nIt is true that a small number of people had an allergic reaction to the vaccine. However, it was quite rare, the allergic reaction could be treated quickly, and the truth is that a small number of people are allergic to every vaccine (including the ones we take regularly, such as the chickenpox vaccine). There have not been, as far as I know, reports of any severe side effects unique to the COVID vaccine.\n\nAlthough the technology is quite new, the companies making this vaccine have [been testing RNA vaccines for years](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline/therapeutic-areas/mrna-personalized-cancer-vaccines-and-immuno-oncology) against other conditions, so we do have some idea of its relative safety over a longer timecourse as well.\n\nThe reason why we got this vaccine so quickly, aside from the concerted global efforts in fighting this virus, is also because RNAs are easy to make compared to these ""dead"" viruses. So in the span of time it takes to make a ""dead"" virus, the scientists can design, make, and test several RNA vaccines. This is also why we\'re able to quickly make a massive global stock of this vaccine.\n\nI hope this answers some of your questions and puts you more at ease. Your concerns are valid and actually as a researcher I\'m glad that people are willing to make an effort to learn more about the science behind our medical choices. Let me know if you have any more questions and I\'ll try my best to answer them.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to add that the RNA vaccines are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and Moderna vaccines.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca and SinoVac vaccines rely on the ""dead virus"" traditional version of the vaccine, and they\'re still under trial to test their efficacy and side effects. I\'m not as qualified to comment on those, but from my basic understanding they\'ve been safe in clinical trials as well.', 'Such a comprehensive reply, thanks for the info!', 'Thank you this was very helpful and easy to understand and talked me into getting vaccinated lol. So in the future, are they planning to make and sell the ""dead virus"" version of the vaccine? Also, why don\'t we stick to the rna version for every type of disease if it is faster to make and safer?', 'I forgot to clarify this in my initial response. The RNA vaccines are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and Moderna vaccines. There actually are ""dead virus"" versions of the vaccine well underway and being trialled. For example, the Oxford-AstraZeneca and SinoVac vaccines are ""dead virus"" vaccines (the official term for these is inactivated virus vaccine). I don\'t feel as qualified to give an opinion on these vaccines, but my understanding for these vaccines (at least in Oxford-AstraZeneca\'s case) is that they were already working on an inactivated virus vaccine for the SARS outbreak in 2002, but as the SARS outbreak petered out, they paused development of those vaccines. When the Covid-19 outbreak happened, they found that the viruses were similar enough that they could use the vaccine candidates back from 2002 and start clinial trials, which is why they were able to make a vaccine so quickly. \n\nAs for why we don\'t already use RNA treatments, the honest reason is that it is still new technology. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will be the first RNA vaccines approved for clinical use. One of the major breakthroughs in the past few decades is next generation sequencing, which is the ability to quickly and accurately figure out the DNA/RNA sequences that make up an organism. Up until that point we simply didn\'t have the information needed to make RNA vaccines (not just the sequence itself, but also information about how RNA behaves, how the cell uses RNA vs how a virus would use RNA, etc). Moving forward, I think we will start to see a lot more RNA therapeutics. \n\nAlthough there are more elegant ways of designing inactivated virus vaccines nowadays, you can honestly make an inactivated virus vaccine without knowing anything at all about the virus. For example, one of the polio vaccines was just the poliovirus treated with a chemical to kill it lol. So this is how the earliest versions of vaccines were made, when there was less information available about vaccines. Another benefit of inactivated viruses will be that they look a lot more like the real virus. There\'s a possibility that if you just infect a person with a small part of the virus, the immune system won\'t recognise the real virus as the same thing later on. Whereas an inactivated virus often retains a lot more of the same structures as the original virus. \n\nFinally, there\'s the issue of accessibility. RNA vaccines need to be stored at -80 degrees Celsius, which means they are difficult to transport and store, especially in less developed countries (and it\'s expensive!) \n\nI think we\'ll see both types of vaccines being developed side by side in the future, depending on which is more suitable (:', 'Thank you!

pinkgiselle,1609736012,kq1ljd,80,1,"How do i find friends who make at least the same amount of effort as i do?

I made a friend or two during my first job which was toxic. But they didn't bother contacting me much after I left. I tried making an effort to ask them to meet up for a meal, sending them birthday messages, giving them gifts yearly. Well, they just accepted everything with a smile and said thank you. Year after year, I was the only one making an effort. 

Throughout my other jobs, I made a few friends who.. are the same. They all make zero effort which hurts. No one ever remembers my birthday when i remember theirs. 

A friend never remembered my birthdays or sent me texts for 4 years. I was the one doing it until i called her up because i needed to buy an insurance policy from her (things happened and had no choice but to ask her). She started sending me birthday messages, asking to meet up, and sending Christmas gifts after!! It feels so superficial. She also told me that she was too busy to remember my birthday and felt bad about it (before i bought something from her), then proceeded to continue forgetting it the next year. 

One other friend likes leaving me on read for days and weeks because she claims to be forgetful. 

Another friend tried taking me to church and making me a believer which i rejected. And another asked me to recommend her a WFH job because it seemed easy to her when i searched for months for one, and got mad at me when the company paid her late. They both stopped contacting me after those incidents. 

I... didnt have a problem until I met my bf online. I was fine being alone and being used. He's sociable and hangs out a lot. I was attracted to that side of him. He has so many friends and i just cant understand how. His friends even send him birthday messages, new year messages, and ask to meet him up! I'm envious. Despite all the effort I made, no one would do those things for me first.

Tldr; my ""friends"" never make any effort contacting me. I keep in touch by sending them birthday messages and asking to meet up etc. But they don't do the same for me. Others who talk to me want something from me.

Other commenters have made this point beautifully but essentially, everyone needs to be professional and get along with the team so they all act friendly. If they don’t respond when you reach out, that’s a clear sign you are just an ex colleague and not a friend. \n\nMost of my friends are from school or my hobbies, tbh. \n\nWe have to also assess the kind of friends we are trying to make. I realised some people are very much used to others always reaching out to them. So they are happy to accept invitations or gifts or share a conversation if they feel like it but won’t reach out to you - they are just that much in demand. I’ve noticed this happens more for the prettier and more popular among us. \n\nAnd it’s not that they don’t consider you a friend - they still do - but their idea of friendship is accepting your invitation to hang out and participating, not organising a gathering or reaching out to you. \n\nSame with some extreme introverts. They would always make time for you if you reach out to them because they like and care about you but don’t naturally reach out.\n\nI would suggest that you join a few different clubs or groups. Gardening, rock climbing, yoga, dance, or martial arts - or a language class too. Work on being comfortable with some superficial friendships first, since it takes time for friendship to grow. If someone reaches out to you, do reciprocate (if you want to be friends with them - this doesn’t mean you must force yourself to spend time with people who make you uncomfortable). \n\nAlso try and be more comfortable alone. People can sense if you are desperate for friendship and if they’re normal they are likely to distance themselves. I made a lot more friends when I was chill and older than when I was a lonely teen. Being comfortable alone made it a lot easier to be able to interact with someone as much or as little as we both would like.\n\nAlso I’m a horribly flawed person and since I was a teen I always picked something about myself to work at (interrupting less, listening more, learning more about a topic, etc) and eventually you end up a better person. One reason why no one liked me as a teen was because I was so sad and angry about my family situation that it coloured myself every interaction. Even now, I have some people who only reach out to me because they have some really bad stuff going on and need someone to talk to. I wouldn’t want to abandon them. But they aren’t my close friends who I talk nonsense about random stuff with as well as all the real stuff that happens.

I posted a band advert (i’ll copy paste it below) to r/singapore but it was removed for being off topic. any tips for how to start a band? i’m a bit of an introvert and don’t really know anyone here apart from school friends so i wanted to use social media if possible.

the original post: 

A Pleasant Band Advert

Hey there everyone! My name’s Jared. I am an 18 year old South African, whose lived in Singapore for the last five years. A couple years ago, I made a post here discussing the rock and metal community in SG; local bands, where the scene was, and etc. After finally finishing my studies and having free time, i’ve decided to start a rock / metal band. I don’t have a name yet, but i have ideas.

I am a rhythm guitarist. I also play a little bit of piano / keyboards too. I can play bass relatively well and sing a bit if needed, although i would prefer to merely be backing vocalist. I am searching for , if possible, a vocalist (harsh vocals work but i’d prefer someone who can do cleans) , a lead guitarist (i’m not exactly a soloist), a bassist and a drummer. 

Stylistically, my influences vary. My main musician influences are Steven Wilson and Devin Townsend. I am a prog guy, if you can’t tell, but to be honest , i’m glad to try anything, from Grunge to Thrash to Metalcore to Punk. I’d say my guitar playing style is close to Adam Jones’ of Tool, and Stephen Carpenter of Deftones, with a tone similar to classic era Billy Corgan from Smashing Pumpkins. I love heavy metal and i love mixing it with dreamy genres like shoegaze. My all time favorite band is Porcupine Tree.

If any of this sounds up your street, DM me and we can get to talking! I don’t mind if nothing works out, at the very least i wanted to try my hand and maybe talk to some local musicians.

fokineducatinm8,1624423585,o65rth,5,1,"I came from a middle class family where I was on track to study law and becoming a lawyer, the wishes of my mother.  However, I had picked up trading, namely in Forex and alternative assets since my JC days as a way to earn my own pocket money. 

Obviously I failed miserably at first, and only started tasting success during my NS days where I would be reading, learning and trading everyday. Soon after, I started being able to start putting food on the table for my mother, in hopes that she wouldn't need to work as hard anymore.  I started being active on social media, forums and such and I started receiving pms from people wanting to invest in me. I told my mother about this, and was extremely happy but shocked at the same time that I would even be given recognition where 'easy money' was acheived (a term my mother called it). She was an extremely hard worker who climbed her way up the corporate ladder without a university degree, which prevented the case for further promotions. 

I thought it was an extremely good and rare oppurtunity and wanted to defer my universtity education for chasing it. But my mother was adamant and discouraged me from the field altogether. I did take a short break, but found myself switching courses from Law to Finance as it was all I was interested about, reading about and thinking about. I went back into trading, fx and commodities and I was turning over 6 figure volumes weekly. Eventually I had investor calls again and I started managing money for clients, after creating my own strategy. Within the first month I achieved a return of over 50% and I was ready to drop out of university or take an LOA. I was already making more money than most fresh grads thought were possible and thought that it was the key to financial freedom.

Here comes the weird part- After months of frustration, sleeping 3 hours a day and stopping hanging out with friends to trade New York time sessions(highest volatility and liquidity), where I made more than my software engineer sibling per month, I felt soulless. I felt that I had no satisfaction and was going nowhere in life. I thought about my life trajectory where I wanted to study psychology and become a psychologist/counsellor and actually help people instead of taking corners and inches out of the financial market. I started losing in trading, earning less than I had projected based on past performances and eventually, I decided to stop, for the sake of my health.

I had already put myself on a path to finance, especially trading and wasnt sure how to even make a switch to something like counselling and social work as I was already used to drawing a salary above the mean for my age and qualifications. I decided to start a coaching/mentoring programme for beginners and experienced traders. I found satisfaction and contentment in helping total beginners learn the basics of trading, and mentoring them to the point where they were able to make money on their own. The whole idea behind it was to grant people avenues of financial freedom, picking up a skill which could aid them whenever things at their job were rocky or students who were looking to learn about the financial markets as well. I especially enjoyed teaching people about how the foreign exchange market operated and how relevant it was to our international trade as well as the shipping industries.  Though I charged them fees to for the classes and am making a lot less money than I used to, I feel a lot more fulfilled and genuinely enjoy what I do sometimes. Especially when a passionate student is texting me about a question at 12am. I love it when people work hard and enjoy the fruits of their hard work. 

My mother, who worked hard to raise my siblings and I was a lot happier to see me coach and mentor others as well. She felt my health was deteriorating being a full time trader and was often worried. Prior to trading, I had thought I would just meet expectations of becoming a Lawyer and live out the rest of my life with hopes of being able to touch others' lives and have an impact as well. Though it did not pan out that way I am happy and content helping others through coaching them and teaching them about trading.

I guess, the point which I found out later on in life was that my mother wanted me to become a lawyer so I could be put in a position where I was able to directly help and impact people's lives, which was why I was pushed towards medicine as well. She worked extremely hard, purely for the sake of money just so we were financially stable as my father was a bankrupt financial liability we had to pay debts for. Now that she is on the brink of retirement I feel that she looks back on her life regretting just chasing paper instead of doing something meaningful for others, but in my opinion, she did what she had to do to put food on the table. Acts of service and kindness, fulfillment and joy in helping others was something she had always emphasized strongly to me, which I never understood. But now I do.

Ok-Pair-6044,1624259495,o4pg29,17,1,"I have been shortlisted for the second interview of both roles mentioned above and would like to seek some advice in the above roles. For myself, I have been looking out on corporate treasury or risk related roles in banks/finance companies as I have an interest in these area (i.e. treasury products) but there are minimal openings available for entry level positions. In this case, which role would be more beneficial to add on to my work experience or to kickstart my career?   


Both roles are doing settlements and reconciliation related. For the Treasury role at a MNC, it is not a finance company but rather semiconductor/tech company. The job scope should touch on on cash management and working with China counterparts (mainly treasury operations). The treasury department doesn't seem small though as I noticed many treasury analyst working there for many years and is still currently employed on LinkedIn (5-8 years). Also, I was told that I may be exposed to other financial roles in the future within the company as well. However, despite being a big company, I'm afraid that there isn't much advancement in the job as a treasury analyst as well since it is not a bank/finance company and if I were to consider future treasury roles at a bank or finance company, it may not be as relevant as the type of transaction or treasury products involved may not be the same as a treasury role from a bank/finance company. Whereas for the ops role at a bank, it is doing trade settlements for FX and possible advancement includes rotating between roles within the division for transaction related operations role i.e. middle office operations and etc (should be different types of operations roles working with treasury products). However, I'm afraid that there isn't any transferable skills and will be stuck in this role forever doing settlements i.e. have lesser exit opportunities as compared to treasury operations.   


As I have yet to receive any offer, I can't really comment on the salary part but as of what I know, both jobs seem to have pretty long working hours and both requires to work during public holiday (workload for bank ops should be heavier).

LegitimateShape1743,1624242207,o4kvht,32,1,"This is my first Reddit post so I'm not entirely sure if this is the right way to do it, but here goes!

I made a mistake of signing up for a 1 year gym membership with a small gym in Singapore, under a package of $x/month for 12 months. It's honestly an incredible deal and I can't give up any more details but the catch is that I would have to pay the full amount upfront....so I did.

Being stupid and naive, I didn't read the contract myself and just focused on certain points that the admin staff highlighted, e.g. non-refundable, cancellation fee etc. They sent me the virtual contract after and all was good until recently.

This gym decided to increase the membership prices of all existing members because of COVID restrictions. I wouldn't normally mind since times are tough and they do need to survive somehow but this would be more than a $100 increase per month for me, which wasn't what I signed up for since I'm just a student trying to snag good deals. They did state in their contact that the club had the right to modify club rates for current members as well but I feel insanely cheated. And they definitely aren't gonna give me back my money since the membership is non-refundable. 

I'm still waiting for them to get back to me on the next steps, but this feels descipicable and underhanded. In the package that I signed, there was a line in text that said ""Fixed price for the lifetime of your membership"", which instilled a false sense of security in me since I missed out the line in the contract about their ability to amend rates as and when they wish.

Is there anything I can do other than to just pay the increased club rates and wait it out till the end of my membership? I know I made a mistake at the start by blindly signing the contract and paying up front but there's not much I can do about that mistake anymore.

Ok-Resist9011,1623856939,o17e30,31,2,"Hi all, my company wants to terminate me as they are blaming me for not being productive, though I believe it is not completely my fault. I have some questions to ask, mainly can I still resign before this? Or is there anything I can do to make things better for myself and how can I explain this situation to future employers?

Some background, I am part of company A who outsourced me to company B. So I was working at the site of company B but the staff at company B were unfriendly to me and my mentor was ignoring me when I asked questions. I was here for 2 months I did not complain as I did not want my mentor to get into trouble. However since last week she did not reply my message at all even though I was stuck (working from home) so I decided to tell someone from company A about it.

After telling someone from company A, Then the HR from company A called me and scolded me for not saying sooner as company B is not being managed by them and it is up to me to tell them if company B had issues. I know this is not a excuse but I am 23 years old and this is my first job, I did not even understand that when I joined. I had done one internship before this but the internship was nothing like this.

Nevertheless, the HR from company A now told me that it is my fault now and that company A was already telling them that I was unproductive and they do not want me there. But this was the first time I am hearing of this. She told me that they will give me my 2 weeks notice for termination. I feel sad. I feel its not my fault as the mentor was negligent. I am crafting another email to her right now with screenshots and such to tell her the issues with company B I was facing and how I was being ignored which caused a decline in productivity as well as other actions by them which did the same.

The HR told me that they would try to reallocate me to another job but if not possible then my contract will be terminated and my 2 weeks notice will start and my last day will be on the 30th. And she asked me to acknowledge the email. I don't know how to reply to the email. Would this reflect badly on my future employers? I am heartbroken also did not expect it to come down to this or be blamed for everything. Would sending the email with the screenshots even be helpful now?

throwthewholemeaway-,1623763439,o0e9u7,88,147,"***TLDR; I was raped, tried to get medical help for my injuries had a police ‘pink form’ exam done on me unexpectedly and without the said ‘pink form’, and which included STD testing, and was made to pay $600. Is this normal procedure / an expected cost to pay for having been raped?***

I was raped (I’m not even going to say ‘assaulted’ anymore, because it was clearly rape) a little less than 2 weeks ago. I think this is day 12…? Anyway, my police case has been a mess of my IO taking half statements, giving contradictory advice, and closing my case prematurely without telling me, even though he had told me not to tell him certain things during my statement, as I would be able to tell them to the CID officer that would handle my case. 

My case was never referred, because somehow, me trying to push this guy that I’d just met (so it’s not like I was in a relationship with this dude for him to test the boundaries of my indent) away, crying, telling him he was hurting me, and him acknowledging that he was, his deliberate infliction of additional hurt unto me after him acknowledging it (with the intention to make me cry even harder — so he clearly did not stop when he realised I was crying, because he wanted me to), and the use of force to make me do things that I physically was in too much pain or too disoriented (from being choked) to do, didn’t raise any sexual assault alarm bells with the IO who took my statement. The police had closed my case on the day that I made my statement, even when I was advised to wait for a follow-up, because no offences were found from all of *that*. 

It’s been impossible to seek any medical help. The GP didn’t want to see me for my injuries. I went there first because I didn’t want to have to make a report. But because they were injuries from a sexual assault, the GP told me to go to KKH’s UOGC instead. That meant needing to make a report in order to be seen at the hospital for sexual assault. I asked the IO about what I should do for medical treatment at the UOGC, and he said to just give them my report number. I ended up being denied medical assistance completely at UOGC (couldn’t even be registered) because I didn’t have a pink police form — I wasn’t aware that I needed the form. The IO had to call UOGC and discuss something, because I’d been inconsolable over the phone over the fact that no medical staff was willing to see me for my injuries from the assault. I wasn’t even asking for an exam or anything, just someone to talk through and explain the pains I felt and the pain that I was still feeling even 8 days after. 

I don’t know what was discussed between the IO and UOGC. Honestly I was so distressed at the time that I remember my consult with the doctors just as faintly as I remember the rape. But they didn’t really end up consulting for what I wanted, and spent most of the time doing this “police pink form” exam on me, except without the form itself, checking for abrasions, tears and lacerations, putting different swabs in me. I had to get my blood drawn as well. And I ended up being hit with a $500+ worth of checking and testing fees because they did the exam without the form. 

Is this normal? To be given the “pink form” exam I wasn’t expecting, but without the form, and then be made to pay $500+ for a post-rape STI screening? Would it have been covered if the police had given me the form? Or would I still have had to pay this large amount? Does anyone know?

Unfortunately, the police aren’t giving me any answers about this. I’m not sure who I could raise my concerns about the bill with as well. I’m sure if I go to KKH, they’d say it was because I didn’t have the form, because the IO didn’t think I had experienced an assault. I’d try to claim it under my company’s medical insurance, but the diagnosis on my documents from the exam don’t state “sexual assault”, only “sti screen”, and routine screenings for STIs / STDs are exclusions, so I can’t do that either.

I work part-time, school part-time. I’m paying for my own medication and therapy for severe clinical depression and PTSD and ED, which chalks up to nearly $1k per month, nearly 80% of my take-home income. My family don’t know about the rape yet and I don’t think I’ll be telling them anytime soon, so I’m incurring these costs on my own. 

So I’m just wondering if there’ll be any way to recoup some of the $500+ lost to being a victim of rape. If anyone knows, or has any suggestions, hope you can help me out.

They closed my case within the same day, so i don’t think they even did. I also only knew the guy’s online contacts like his tele ID / online site username, so they wouldn’t have been able to contact his mobile because I didn’t have one to give. Plus I think the rapist would have sent me threatening messages over the online site, if they had contacted him about me reporting him for assault. I haven’t received one yet, so probably they didn’t. \n\nThank you for validating that it’s rape. I’ve really been needing to hear it. So far I’ve just been saying it to myself, for myself, because the police and medical staff so far haven’t believed that that’s what happened. I’ve even been reading the penal code, online SG lawyer resources, anything that I can get my hands on to see what constitutes rape and assault in singapore, and why my case wasn’t either of those. I thought that maybe there was something in Singapore law that was different from the general consensus of what’s considered rape in other parts of the world, that would explain why they said it wasn’t a rape or assault at all. I’ve honestly been questioning my reality and feeling like everyone else knows why it isn’t rape or assault, except me (perhaps because i’m stupid).\n\nI hope tomorrow goes well too. I don’t think I can emotionally take one more person of authority minimising my assault to just “rough sex”. \n\n(On a side note, the IO was aware that the person who assaulted me was into BDSM. Although I did also tell him that I did not know the guy would turn up with BDSM stuff, because we didn’t discuss it, but I also still kind of went with it anyway, so maybe my IO thought I was into that kind of thing too and perceived my statement as just a BDSM thing that got too rough. He also kept referring to it as “the 50 shades of grey kind of stuff”. And also brought up how his neighbour did partner swaps where the neighbour and his wife would swap partners with another couple, with their son in the living room. It was a bit weird tbh, he never once referred to what happened as “assault”, just “50 shades of grey”.)', ""My dms are open if you need a listening ear, sis.

I cannot fathom why he does not even dare to use the term “rape”, as you had perceived the incident to be, or more neutral terms such as “alleged” or “assault” whatever. Calling it “50 shades of grey kind of stuff” is just unprofessional on top of trivialising the issue (given that in 50 shades it was not rape). \n\nIt pains me further that the IO had to bring in his own personal experiences, which were not only irrelevant to the case (what was he trying to even say?) but unprofessional (so what if others were doing it? It should not discount the fact of what you had experienced). Furthermore, it would seem that he was trying to normalise the matter (i.e. don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill, my neighbours had even freakier sex y’know). \n\nI truly hope things go better from here on with your meeting with his female colleague and supervisor.

st0nks72,1623589331,nyvuqe,0,1,"Long read ahead! Thank you for taking the time and I'd love to hear others' thoughts. 

I believe that humans are, on aggregate, self-interested. I make it a point to say “on aggregate” because I too believe that there is indeed a minority of individuals in society who are more altruistic than they are self-interested. But any policy aimed at reducing inequality which assumes the contrary – that on average, a given individual can be relied upon to be more altruistic than self-interested, is bound to fail. Many people do not hesitate to express approval for reducing material inequality (as an ideal), but few are willing to give up what it takes to achieve that. What then, explains why so many people are so quick to express in-theory support of fighting inequality? Is it political correctness that drives this or perhaps just a form of virtue signalling? I might be naïve on this but while there is surely some truth to the pressures of being politically correct, especially given the socio-political climate of our today (think wokeness and cancel-culture), I choose to believe that these aren’t the most important reasons for why the average person lends their support to combatting inequality. I believe that the average human is genuinely averse to inequality beyond a certain threshold – the average human does not revel in seeing a fellow member of society lagging too far behind. It is important to note too (for reasons which further complicates policymaking) that how far too far is differs from individual to individual. Whether this aversion to inequality stems from innate altruism or some calculated form of self-interest is a different matter altogether.

In the context of income and wealth disparity, aversion to excess inequality and self-interest are more often than not competing forces. For example, while business owners might sympathise with the plight of low wage workers, many are unlikely to put their company’s competitiveness on the line to alleviate the conditions of these workers. Self-interest has proven to be a more powerful force than our aversion to excess inequality, which explains the ineffectiveness of trickle-down economics and the widening disparity between the rich and the poor seen around the world.

The minimum wage is by no means a simple policy. Economist have debated for decades about the economic impacts brought about by a minimum wage with no clear conclusion. At this juncture I believe that for most Singaporeans, the debate over a minimum wage transcends the economic realm. Beyond the economics surrounding the viability of such a policy, the debate stems from a more fundamental questioning of our national priorities – do we value a larger pie more than we value a more evenly distributed pie? Answering theses questions at face value is easy. Keeping true to our answers and acting on them is where things get more difficult. A minimum wage is a cost which has to be borne by economic actors and achieving consensus on how this cost is to be distributed among different economic actors is perhaps one of the greatest impediments to implementing the minimum wage. I don’t believe there to be a single funding framework which can be easily replicated globally.

Every country has their own unique history, culture and of course socio-economic circumstances and norms which dictates what will and won’t work. Figuring out what works for a given country is a constant work in progress and is shaped by generations of decisions both at the individual and state level. I remember an excerpt from LKY’s book: Hard Truths, where he states that SG could not simply replicate the Nordic countries’ welfare policies because their communities were simply different, with a unique set of traits shaped by experiences unique to them which facilitated a strong sense of community-mindedness. I have no doubt that the historical circumstances as well as the national policy decisions made and reinforced throughout the lifetime of successive generations of people from these regions have indeed resulted in a set of socio-economic norms significantly more facilitative of welfare policies than in Singapore. The question for us Singaporeans then is whether we are resigned to being constrained by these communal norms, or the lack thereof, which have seemingly come to define us as a people.

In Singapore, we devote much more time to scrutinising the state’s policies than to reflecting deeply and honestly on our own attitudes and mindsets. This could well be the result of decades of paternalistic governance, resulting in a society which lacks the ability to be self-critical and which has become accustomed to looking to the government for recourse on all matters. When we ask ourselves how we are going to fund the minimum wage what we’re truly asking is: How are we going to sustain the continued commitment and will of the people to sacrifice for the less economically secured members of our community? And unfortunately, I believe that it is precisely because we as a society are not fully confident about being ready to give up what’s at stake when it comes down to it that makes answering this question so hard.

So given these unfavourable conditions and coupled by the grim reality that humans are fundamentally more self-interested than they are altruistic, is there any hope for a more equitable future? I choose to believe so. I believe that mindsets and behaviours are largely shaped by the environment. A simple day to day example of this is how by the end of my 6-month stint in the US, the idea of tipping service staff became second nature to me even as foreign and surplus as it felt initially. More significantly perhaps is how I began tipping service staff not just because everyone was doing it (as a norm), but also because I felt it was the *right* thing to do. It is a classic case of how norms can shape mindsets. How then do we go about establishing the kind of community-centric norms which form the bedrock of our efforts to combat inequality? The *calls* for a minimum wage could be one such way in which we look to the government to take a bold step, almost a leap of faith of sorts, to nudge the country in just that direction. The SG government however, calculated and meticulous in every undertaking, would argue that they have plenty of reason to be circumspect about how people will actually take to the pinch of having to make the necessary trade-offs involved in a redistributive policy such as the minimum wage.

It is here where we need to be brutally honest with ourselves – do our *calls* for a minimum wage reflect a genuine desire and readiness to provide for the ones who have not achieved the same level of material comfort as us or are we perhaps conveniently outsourcing this task to the government in a subconscious attempt to absolve ourselves of responsibility? There is no skirting the responsibilities each and every one of us has in steering our society towards a more egalitarian one. If we are serious about change, we have to own the solution and be prepared for what it takes.

I am no less self-interested than the average human being and my thoughts on inequality and the minimum wage are still very raw. I wrote this piece not as an answer or solution but more an attempt to reflect more critically on the underlying questions underpinning the debate on the minimum wage.",askSingapore,42304,Minimum Wage Musings,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/nyvuqe/minimum_wage_musings/,1.0,[]

I only stayed there for 3 months and I dont understand why I have to pay for the lightbulb? She say it's $100 for bulb and manpower and if I do it myself would also cost me around there as its a round fan bulb and I have to call someone to do it, if I get the bulb and do myself Ig it would be $30+ but anyway point is, bulb will wear out right? So why am I being charged? 

She put me in a gc with the new tennant and the new tennant also requested for bathroom and balcony curtains to be replaced with waterproof one as he complain the bathroom curtain have water stain and balcony curtain have a little tear and she said I will replace.

The microwave they provided is rusty and they said they wont give me a new one when I move in as it is ""usable"" well its not, I mean if you want to eat rusty food thats ur choice but pls give ur tennants decent things pls. 

Despite their strict rules, they entered my house without 24 hr notice as stated in contract and called me when they were outside said they r coming for aircon servicing and if I dont let them in now i will have to pay for transport fees for next time so I said come in but I was pissed. They said they had forgotten to message me then threaten to charge me for extra transport fees, if it is their mistake they should correct it right?

pamalu,1622914687,nt1097,98,1," Dear r/askSingapore,

This will be a long post and I hope that moderators will allow me to. I am genuinely seeking advice from both locals and foreigners alike.

I am an European coming from a modest background of a small town in a developed country with comparable quality of life levels to Singapore. 

I arrived here in 2009. It was a combination of me wanting to see the world and my company looking to set up a regional hub. It was supposed to be a 1 year assignment that grew into a long term stay. 

As a general manager for the region, I'm here to grow business and create jobs (and not to take them). We have grown from 3 people to 100+. Majority (90%) are locals, with the other 10 being foreigners that we hired for specific skills and only after looking into the local market for 6 months plus even before such a requirement ('jobsbank') kicked in.

Singapore is my home and my beloved community. True I have parents back home, but that's about it. I have no extended family.

Over the years I have applied for PR. They've been rejected. I am single (and not by choice) and that likely doesn't help. And I'm fine with that. It means just to aim higher, bring more value to the country and the community, and apply again (later).

But then the Covid came. I truly believe that Singapore has done an amazing job to manage the situation. In fact, I'm proud to always highlight to my overseas friends how well it's handled, and how we are lucky to be able to meet our friends and enjoy our way of life (while my birth country enjoyed a curfew). 

BUT Covid came with some additional caveats -

* The online narrative of ""Go back to your country"". Understandable sentiment, seen in many countries, yet it hurts. And it is not only the keyboard warriors on FB comments, but also felt on the ""street"" more than ever. 
* Work pass holders were told to get an entry permit before coming back to Singapore. Lucky for me I'm here, not so lucky for many people outside. Not cool for many people stranded overseas, but understandable to pace out returnee influx and manage the risk . 
* Then in May EP holders were told that their entry permits were cancelled, effectively a ban for entry. This is where it got difficult for me to comprehend. Sure it's Singaporeans first vs a third class residents. But I would argue that most pass holders have established their life here. They don't have another home. Even worse, some have ended up with families split. Sure one would say that you should know the risks, but is that so? These long term residents are contributing to the economy and society in very much the same way like anyone else (barring few exceptions, sure). And we are not even touching the limitations of way of life for (construction) work permit holders here... 

With this long intro (thank you for your patience), I would like to ask few questions:

1. Is it in Singaporean view that Singapore is better off without all the foreigners?
2. What are your thoughts about the ban work pass holder entries into Singapore (yes we know Australia even bans their own citizens, but many Western countries honor work visa holders)?
3. Does ""I don't take jobs, I create jobs"" actually resonate with the local / citizen population? 
4. Should I continue my PR application efforts or just call it a day and uproot? Question here is not about approval chances, but back to question #1.

Thank you for your consideration.

I don't think this behavior is unique to Singapore, in fact because we have strict law against this, I would actually say a foreigner is safer in terms of being attacked physically compared to other countries. I have personally encountered bad racist behavior overseas myself (Of course i am not defending the behavior of keyboard warriors here)\n\nThe thing that Singaporeans don't understand is, we should hate the game not the players.\nPersonally I would feel that Singapore is one of the country that doesn't have good policy to safeguard Singaporean interest. I have been to a few countries, and they were all very Strigent in their application and about their wages paid to foreigners. \nWe also don't have policy where wages should be equal ( eg:  that's why the recent news of us relying on low wages workers from neighboring country poses an issue to us, because it's considered alot of money for them in their country, they could work here for ten years and retire in their homeland and Singaporean Couldn't survive on those low wages) \n\nI don't have a problem with foreigners personally, I think we need them. But I believe we should relook at those policy and bridge those problems. \n\nAbout the entry permit, I think it's how hard your company is fighting for you. My company had have foreigners joining us even in the midst of last year. So... Yeah. Talk to them and see what they can help you with. \n\nAs for your issue of not feeling a belonging here, it happens to people who uproot their live. I feel those feeling now and again when I live in a foreign country. Neither here or there. It's important to find friends from the community here or from your expats community to feel a sense of belonging. It's people that make up your experience afterall. \n\nI am sorry you feel this way. You could pm me if you wish to chat further."", 'Call it a day and uproot!!! This country isn’t going to give you more opportunities.', ""Am truly feeling sorry for what you're experiencing. Am gonna answer 2 qns. \n\n1. This question can become political as there are ppl who still aren't pleased w the policies and will always accuse govt for not protecting them = general hate for expats\n\n4. Any redditors feel free to correct me. But you mentioned you're an European - As a non-Asian, I think its kinda har to get a PR unless u've a local family... I've never rly encounter any :')"", ""Take the replies you see with a pinch of salt as some are going to come from people who are not even in the workforce yet and are basing their opinions off what they read and hear from others. \n\nI'll give my take as someone who's worked close to a decade in the private sector and literally been in teams where as a Singaporean I am the minority. \n\nI don't think we will be better off without foreigners but more needs to be done within the Singapore system so that we can rely less on foreigners. I've enjoyed working with my foreigner colleagues for the most part and I think I even learned from them. There are certain skill gaps that I see in myself as a local next to a foreigner which I hope that future improvements in the system would bridge that gap. \n\nI don't know enough to decide if the work pass ban is good or not but as a country I think we typically over-index on pragmatism and collectivism. So I'm honestly not too surprised that the authorities took such a hard approach on it. \n\nJob creation angle can be a slippery slope because contrarians will question what type of jobs are created. I suggest just ignoring and moving on honestly. As long as you're providing a good quality of life to your 90+ local staff, that's the most important. \n\nOn whether to uproot, I think negative people will be around no matter where you go. Sounds corny but I'd suggest to go with your heart. If you genuinely like this place beyond transactional reasons, can see yourself settling down here and starting a family, why not?"", ""You made a mistake coming from the west and thinking that you'd be fully accepted here :/ Singapore is very nice for a few years and everything works pretty well, but attempting to make a whole life here on those conditions is a mistake"", 'Couple of more things. Normally the rumor is that the first PR is always rejected, so might be worth a second attempt. \nSingapore is very tricky because being a small super competitive country they\'ll always need ""lowly"" skilled foreign workforce to have cheap labor on certain sectors and very skilled foreign workforce. Is not that there are not Singaporeans who cannot do it, of course they can and they do. Is just that with ~3.5M local population is very difficult to have ""the best of the best"" skilled workforce. This happens in other countries too, wise Americans understand that in part their country has achieved a lot of stuff from mining skilled workforce from all over the world. I think very few countries do not have this type of dependency of skilled foreign workforce, China, because 1/4 of humankind is Chinese. \nNow, the issue here is incremented because Singapore has a pretty strong nationalist narrative that again is understandable being a small rich country in South East Asia; the issue with that narrative is that motivates people having stronger opinions about foreigners, specially if you\'re not Asian.', ""to answer to your queries: \n\n1. not just singapore. it happens almost everywhere as per my knowledge. with jobs/opportunities shrinking, coupling with additional stress on living, health and future, resulting in bubbles world creation or self protectionism. it doesn't help when those that anti non locals walked around and saw non locals look alike wine, dine and shop like during pre-covid. \n2. refer to my point no 1 above. \n3. doesn't really matter when you save the whole world and deliver free kelly/perpetuel for each and every human beings, when stigmas are still around. it's again quite related to no 1 above stated. \n4. depend on you. this pandemic that encourage anti social behaviourals will last for quite sometime and clampdown human movements, rendering passport to be a useless item. some people will grow old alone etc. there is no freaking way to meet strangers and establish connections from thereon. even during pre-covid era,get a bargain on some exquisite stuff is easier than meeting people. \n\nif there is any consolation, after reading my (rather blunt) replies to you, is your accomplishment in building a co. from SME to medium size, from HC perspective."", 'Imo, Singapore is definitely better off with foreigners, be it low wage workers (retail, f&amp;b, domestic helpers, construction workers, etc) or PME\'s with specific skillset. Foreigners have contributed to the talent pool gap and have helped contribute to the growth of our economy.  \n\nAs someone who has worked in HR and recruitment for many years before, I can tell you MOM\'s regulations are actually quite stringent already (contrary to some who only know how to complain how MOM isn\'t doing their job well and allowing foreigners to steal jobs from locals). In order to apply for an EP or S Pass for an employee, employers need to submit a lot of paperwork (in addition to the jobs bank ad) to prove that they had put in the required effort to search for a local but there\'s just no such person that has the required skills to fit the job. The most frustrating part is, after months and months of putting in effort searching for the right person, finally we settled on a foreigner (because there was absolutely no Singaporean to be found), and MOM rejects our application. Sometimes it can be tough on the employer too. Cannot find local, yet government doesn\'t approve EP for foreigner. I can feel for MOM, they\'re in a really difficult position. On one hand, they have to ""appease"" the public by making it stringent to hire a foreigner (and even then, many citizens don\'t appreciate the effort and continue to complain), but also not so stringent to the point that it affect the employers too much. I really wish more people could see the effort that MOM has put in, and also try to put themselves in the shoes of employers who are just trying to ensure their business run smoothly. \n\nI am very disappointed to hear that some fellow Singaporeans have become so xenophobic because of covid-19. I want to assure you not everyone is like this (and I hope those that are, are the minority). I truly believe foreign talents can bring more prosperity to Singapore\'s economy, and in turn boost our (local citizen\'s) quality of life. I don\'t see why that is a bad thing.', ""I know the difficulties that foreigners have here, and I empathise when they genuinely like the place and want to stay.\n\nSadly, it seems that the criteria for joining Singapore as a PR are now extremely stringent. It's very tough except for people of specific ethnicities from specific countries. It's really regreattable - we shouldn't be placing so much emphasis on origin instead of level of integration, yet it's a specific policy that we citizens can't directly vote on without voting on everything else as well. We can only speak up in public forums and feedback sites.\n\n(And then once you have the right credentials and financial status, there's the further matter of having children here, which is another key factor.)\n\nSingaporeans have divided views on migration depending on what they're exposed to, and you'll naturally tend to hear the bad stuff more than the good stuff. It comes out more when negative rhetoric has been going around and when fewer people have good jobs. I think this will be an enduring state of affairs for the foreseeable future. It's unfortunate, because there's a segment of people like me who definitely welcome foreigners like you who contribute (not just pay tax) and integrate. (I'm reminded of a foreigner I met about 8 years ago who said in an arrogant, dismissive tone that Singapore needed skilled people like him and that his hedge fund wouldn't be able to find a Singaporean who could do his work. That sort of foreigner is the sort who pisses me off.)\n\nFor hiring so many locals, your company is one of the good ones. Getting your ex-employees to write letters of recommendation for you might be one way to improve your PR chances (yes, I know you're not asking about that). I'm thankful for foreigners like you who deliberately give locals more of a chance, even though I know it's hard.\n\n(If I might soapbox a bit: Foreign companies really ought to think more about picking locals with somewhat relevant but imperfect experience rather than finding the perfect foreign candidate, and giving them that experience. It ought to be the cost of doing business in Singapore.)\n\nI think the issues you raised concerning EP re-entry in May have been muddied by Covid. If it will prevent outbreaks here, a lot of people online simply don't care about EP holders being hurt by restrictions. And to be fair, people should probably not be travelling out of Singapore unless it's a dire emergency or funeral. That's what most Singaporeans probably expect. I don't know the details of the entry permit cancellations you mentioned, but I trust that those are temporary."", 'Sucks that this is happening to you. But don’t let the minority of the voices get in your head. Covid has pretty much messed up everyone’s lives and the angry few are just desperately looking for someone or something to blame. This isn’t unique to Singapore, unfortunately. Things will get better, at the rate that everyone is getting vaccinated and covid being endemic globally. \n\nI’ve had a friend who went to his MP for help to get a PR. Not sure if that still works. Worth a shot, I guess.', 'I was also in similar boat. I got frustrated with lack of certainty of getting PR, stability of EP policies and restrictions of re-entry and had to move out. I think the policies of singapore government are good for locals but I just couldn’t take the level of uncertainty as foreigner. Hopefully the government will make the rules more certain even tough they keep the locals interests in mind.', 'It pains me to read this, it resonates a lot with me (I\'m not trying to hijack this).\n\nAnother European here. I .. came here for 2 weeks for work, fell in love (yes, quick and stupid) and moved to SG. Every morning I\'m feeling blessed to be here, found awesome new friends and I\'d love to make this my home. Unfortunately it really isn\'t your home while you\'re on a work pass - that makes you just a long-term tourist that can be sent home any minute. PR seems unattainable (I tried once only, will likely try again, but the stories are .. disheartening and you just added another anecdote). The PRs I know, ironically, are the ""Yeah, it\'s better for the schools/kids and gives some benefits, but ultimately we\'ll head back to $insertMotherland when the kids graduate"". People like me who genuinely want to settle for good instead .. cannot.\n\nFor Singaporeans who never saw this, the application for PR is very basic (fill some forms, pay 100 bucks, wait 3-6 months on average for a rejection) and the process is totally opaque. The rejection letter is a single page with the whole content being (typing from the letter I pinned on top of my working desk..)\n\n*Thank you for your interest in Singapore Permanent Residence (SPR). All SPR applications are assessed holistically under the prevailing criteria, including economic contribution, education qualifications and integration with Singapore society among other things.*\n\n*We have considered your application, including supporting documents. We regret to inform you that your application is not successful.*\n\n*Nevertheless, you can continue to work and reside here on your valid Work Pass.*\n\nThis.. hurts like a truck. ""Economic contribution""? Alright. Guess I don\'t earn or spend enough then. Least annoying part of the sentence. ""Education qualifications""? Tough. I\'m old. I got a good job here and the qualifications were deemed acceptable for that. At my age there won\'t be any big changes to my qualifications, so if THIS is the reason for the rejection that\'s likely to be it. This is .. a bit terrifying. BUT! The icing on the cake is the last part. ""Integration with Singapore society"". WTF does that even mean? And .. how does ICA check that, I wonder? Because the forms I filled certainly didn\'t ask how many foreigners I have as friends (zero), if I like mala, durian, laksa and nasi lemak (yes, yes, no, yes) or how well I understand Singlish.\n\nIf you feel invested and want nothing more than to make this your home, if you have a (local) social network here that is bigger than the one you had before you threw your old life away.. then this part of the letter is a proper kick to the balls. It\'s not only kinda sorta dismissing the life you built here, it\'s also something that seems absolutely and entirely subjective and .. impossible to prove. Economic contribution? Fine, check my taxes and look at my payslips. Qualifications? You saw them before I entered the country, go and judge me by those. Integration into society? ... How? What does that mean? How would they know??\n\nOP: I\'m just a tiny corporate drone who is happy that he made it over. Hearing that you aren\'t able fix these problems either (although longer in SG, in a management role/creating jobs, much higher economic contribution, likely higher qualifications) is depressing.

But that\'s not to say those behavior are acceptable. As for government, it might come from a place of protecting citizens or it might be easier to have a blanket ban than to go base by case. I\'m not very familiar with the policies but again it\'s out of the norm and driven by necessity. \n\nThe point about creating job is a refreshing take. And I agree. If for that one job you may take from a Singaporean, you\'re creating 10 more, isn\'t that a good thing?  But I can also see how people disagree with it cos maybe they prefer a more local management so they don\'t have to deal with the cultural differences or just not to feel jealous that management job is ""taken away"" by foreigners. \n\nI\'m sorry you have to experience being unwelcome and have your PR rejected.\n\nKeep applying if you want to, there\'s nothing stopping you.

As with everything, these are my opinions based on my experience.\n\n1. This depends on the communities you engage with. Do bear in mind that the comments section of most social media platforms don't represent the entirety of the population. In general, Singaporeans accept the reality that we need foreign talent in the country, whether it's cheap labour or hard to recruit skillsets. A lot of the anger is really directed at the government's policies, but it's always easier to scapegoat the low hanging fruit because people like to blame others for their own shortcomings. While the online mob is a very vocal group, if you actually get to sit down and chat with most of these people, you'll find that most of them are not that bad.\n\n2. I think it's the right big picture move due to the escalation of cases around the world.. However, the execution leaves much to be desired, because we've had a year to realize that this current situation had a high chance of occurring and that there should have attention paid to handling individual cases, as opposed to sweeping policy changes. I mean, just look at how the rediscover vouchers were handled and you'll get an idea of how well our civil service deals with unforeseen problems.\n\n3. Unfortunately, this statement doesn't resonate much with us. There's a whole confluence if factors that contribute to this - mainly that when a company like yours, one that does everything right and actually makes an effort to enrich the local employment market, it doesn't get much press. But when a foreign company does the opposite, it's everywhere.\n\n4. As someone else has mentioned - you should really follow your heart. This is not a decision that us locals can really hope to sway as whatever we feel is gonna be inherently biased. But I can say that if the deciding factor is based on your sentiment from question 1, then I'd say - don't use online chatter as your reference point. Jio some of us here out for coffee, have a convo with your close local friends, go out after the heightened measures are over and mingle with us a little.\n\nI think you'll find it's not that bad :)"", 'To answer your question:\n1. No I don’t think so. Not within my circle of friends anyway. We recognize the need to have qualified foreign talents on our shores to develop and maintain the competitiveness of the country. At the same time however, there might be Singaporeans out there whose jobs could have personally been affected by foreign competition, based on comments we’ve read on forums and even Reddit.\n2. I believe there has been a lot of scrutiny on the government’s handling of the job situation due to COVID-19, and people have been eyeing like hawks at the unemployment data. Also, with many industries in SG in a stand-still such as F&amp;B, tourism, etc, I’m sure many people have reached out to their grassroots leaders for help, and these grassroots leaders have provided feedback to their MP. So, at the end of the day, the government needed to do something.\n3. I’m not sure. Having said, I tend to see a new trend when it comes to locals losing jobs. I was retrenched a few months ago, so was a friend of mine. We didn’t lose our jobs to foreigners living and working here. Our respective companies just decided that HQ will take on a regional function and thus, local roles like mine (and my friend’s) were made redundant. Thankfully we’ve both found jobs already. Ironically, in my new role, the regional HQ is in SG and I am the regional head, and my boss actually made redundant the local roles of the other south East Asian countries (Malaysia, Indo, Phil, VN) so the regional HQ team is doing the work.\n4.

No, certainly not a commonly held nor popular view. Despite a perceived rise in anti-foreign sentiment in the past year, I think the majority of the local population have accepted that foreigners have been an integral part of what makes Singapore what it is today. What we don\'t accept are foregieners who refuse to integrate into our societal and cultural norms, mocking our laws and regulations, and generally being self-entitled assholes. (helpfully my point is illustrated by one of the comments below.)\n\n\n2. This move is largely due to the pandemic situation as opposed to being a direct anti-foreigner action.

(Yes, I know citizenship and PR are different.) He had to face many trials as well, and because he is not white, he doesn’t get the opportunity to even become a general manager. It is likely he will only remain as a minion in the UK with all the racism going on now, no matter how much he loves the UK and how much he has contributed to growing economy (the consulting company he works for serves the government as well). But he is ok with it, as he has managed his expectations. \n\nThere may be racism or “discrimination” when you’re a minority and that is something you have to accept. You just have to try your best to play the game within the rules set, or try to lobby to get the rules changed. As a minority, it depends on what you bring to the table. You’re a general manager, you should know politics. \n\nI know many Europeans who have come to Singapore and they are single and have not married any Singaporean despite having numerous girlfriends (I know, maybe bad luck). What I hear is, they love the region so Thailand would be their second choice. There are many hot girls there too and lifestyle is comparable if you don’t like your home country o Europe. Good luck OP!', ""So I work in a sme construction sector with 90% foreigners. Malaysian, indian, ect. From my observation, its not about qualifications or earning power etc but rather how high are the stakes (chances?) for you to stay in Singapore vs you returning back to homeland. It also depends on what singapore need from foreign talents at the time of application. \n\nA msian man working in singapore for few years as general construction supervisor works in a company with an admin department who steadly applied for his Spass / Epass before going for PR and getting it in 2016. His 2 msian teenage children has also applied and received 5-6 years after (2021)... \n\nWhat do you think of this scenerio?

Theres alot more we can speculate about but the fact is the criteria always changes depending on current local situations and the person handling your application. \n\nOf cos there are those who are offered citizenship/ PR etc because they own businesses here etc. The 'value club'. Thats a whole different ballgame I dont think we should touch on.."", 'As a young adult the only point i can actually answer is question 1.

People like that can always find opportunities in a place where they feel welcome. Singapore will only be left with the grifters and conmen.', ""It doesn't help to paint these people as ignorant. Some of the anger stems from real issues like economic insecurity, depressed wages, increased competition. And in the face of a government telling them that bringing in foreign labour is good but they don't reap any benefits but just the costs, of course they will be frustrated. And in sg it's not like you can direct your anger at the government so they turn to an easier target the foreigners themselves."", 'Usually the “just go back to your country” narrative only happens when the foreigner disrespect the locals and use force on the locals. So as long as you are respectful, it will not happen to you. Just a few days ago, I was in a lift and when I saw a man coming over with a bike who wanted to enter the lift, I quickly press the door open button for him to enter. To my horror, instead of being grateful and saying thank you. He started berating me as being selfish and that I should have pressed the button earlier. I thought that was ridiculous and he was also not wearing a mask properly. The probability of a fellow local being so rude and aggressive is close to zero. The foreigner has serious anger management issues and was threatening to hit me - just over how slow I was in pressing door open. \n\nIt is through this kind of interactions with foreigners, especially the self entitled ones who grates on the locals.

Some foreigners such as your self who can build from the ground up bring alot. But those who come from a trade agreement signed with another country have the easy route to the top which Singaporeans feel is theirs. You must understand Singaporeans for years have felt disenfranchised with certain parts of our lives. We all want to be rich and feel anyone who gets it faster is underserving. Especially when a foreigner comes in, never serves in the military, doesnt make any sacrifices apart from leaving his home and waltzes in. Lets be honest Singapore is a pretty good place to live compared to alot of places in the world. That wasn\'t built by foreign ideas. it may have been built by foreign hands but the ideas were all local with locals in mind. Something changed.', 'First thing, you\'re on reddit, so the demographic would generally be the bunch that\'s younger, and more liberal. The answers you will get are ""they are wrong, and we don\'t do that, they\'re misogynistic"". Which is true to quite a large extent.\n\nYour workplace colleagues most likely won\'t say anything as well, due to the fact that it is politically incorrect (It\'s a psyche thing to be politically correct, and you can observe that in a lot of the folks around here as well) to do so.\n\nPersonal perspective, if you really do intend to make Singapore your home, I don\'t see why I would dislike you for any reason. It shows that you\'re willing to be as invested in being a Singaporean as much as us, be it by choice, or not. I am part of the demographic that dislikes foreigners, but I do dislike the way things are done as well. I dislike the way they do and handle things a lot more, though.\n\n1. **Is it in Singaporean view that Singapore is better off without all the foreigners?**\n\nTough to say, but from the larger perspective, it does not matter to those who dislike foreigners. If you dislike a foreigner, it is really easy to hate on someone. I only need a reason to hate you, I don\'t need to care about the larger picture, when I am so distant away from it to have an effective say over it.\n\nMost of us.... Don\'t actually bother, actually, if that answers your question. Majority of Singaporeans are too tied up with their own stuff to spare energy to care. Which is why you\'d see, that despite having a population of a few millions, it\'s always that same small group making all the noise, while the rest don\'t say anything.\n\nFactual view, no. We lack a lot of things (skills in particular), and are heavily dependent upon foreign businesses. We are extremely far from being economically self-dependent.\n\n2. **What are your thoughts about the ban work pass holder entries into Singapore (yes we know Australia even bans their own citizens, but many Western countries honor work visa holders)?**\n\nPersonal view? It helps to simplify things a lot. Pertaining to the control of the virus, well, as well as the politics. The anti-foreigner sentiment did not just start today. It became popular since the early 2000s.\n\nSingaporeans are the ones voting to keep the political parties in place, and if the government does not reserve the vaccines for the locals, it will be more difficult for the political party to retain power. Singaporeans are the citizens of this country as well, no matter how you\'d want  to spin that ""global citizen"" thing. I\'m talking about a lot of people who aren\'t that well to do, or are just swimming by, who can\'t afford to travel a lot. This is the demographic that you\'d observe being swayed by anti-foreigner, or pro-china sentiments. They form a significant part of the population that votes. If you do not put Singaporeans first, it\'s basic common sense to say that you\'re not even prioritizing your own citizens first, but instead putting foreigners first as well. I can\'t trust that if anything happens, you won\'t sell me out to foreigners. That\'s what taking the action will do.\n\nIt makes for easier virus control as well, as well as the vaccination process.\n\nIf the EP ssytem is not controlled, you will get vaccine tourism, something that will fuel anti-foreigner sentiment. People do, unfortunately, exploit the system quite a lot. You get an EP to come in, and if your country doesn\'t have the vaccine, you can just get it here? That will create an effect of a larger-scale form of vaccine tourism, which makes the anti-foreigner hate grow even more. ""Why would we be depleting our limited supplies of vaccines, vaccinating foreigners, when even our  citizens aren\'t even fully vaccinated yet?"" would be the general sentiment.\n\nAs for the virus, it restricts the flow of people, and hence carriers. Really simple as that. Screw it up, and you will have what is going on now, which is the rise of local cases, and people would be looking at the political party for the screwup. The recent speech from the PM, there\'s a reason why he\'s there to make the statement, and not just the ministers alone.\n\n3. **Does ""I don\'t take jobs, I create jobs"" actually resonate with the local / citizen population?**\n\nAmongst competition for management jobs, yes. DBS has a major case of it, and if you\'d look at the MNCs, higher management tends to be foreigners. You\'d only contribute to the GDP, but ultimately, if you\'re a manager, it is not difficult to see that a foreign company is putting a foreign manager in charge. It is not difficult to hold resentment over that as well. There isn\'t much room for promotions, to perform, when your career paths have already been obviously blocked. Do this on a large scale, it resonates A LOT, and practically, your economy is managed by Foreigners at the top.\n\n4. **Should I continue my PR application efforts or just call it a day and uproot? Question here is not about approval chances, but back to question #1.**\n\nThis is a personal opinion to a personal question, but try. Keep trying. If you have a mind to be a Singaporean, I don\'t see why I would hate you for it.\n\nWhen the situation settles down, things will become better. I\'d want Singaporeans as a population to grow, and if you want to be one of us, I would certainly welcome you.\n\nThe situation now, is quite bad for foreigners. Tbh, I am very surprised why there isn\'t an outreach program to help integrate people like you, with us, and the other way around.', '[removed]', 'Not to disagree, most of what you say is credible.\n\nI do want to knock the “work in Singapore for a few years / 10-20 years and retire on their home country” argument.\n\nThe true cost of living in all countries around us that supply labour, from Indonesian maids to Indian construction workers (I’m purposefully leaving out EP’s / PR’s here), is pretty much going up much faster than in Singapore and the cost arbitrage isn’t what it used to be. This mindset is just outdated, and needs major revision.\n\nThe metric I’ve used for many years is “cost of milk” to determine PPP is my own sense (as it seems to take in a blended value accounting for cost of land, labour, storage &amp; supply chains, retail). Currently milk costs around 2$ a litre in Singapore, while in India it costs 1$ a litre (gross simplification).\n\nAnd please understand that this price is what people in India have to pay, where a big chunk live below/at/barely above poverty line of 2/3$ per person per day. A “salary” of 700$ in Singapore, even if fully remitted back home means an equivalent lifestyle of someone earning 1400$ per month here in Singapore and supporting a family of four. Not exactly the fresh prince of bel air, I’d think. What’s worse is that this expectation of untold riches plagues these “foreign returned” persons with relatives and general society thinking as well that they are “Loaded with cash” to touch for loans and gifts being expected.\n\nWhat’s funny is that I’ve experienced this myself, where a whole bunch of relatives were none too impressed with my paltry 20/30$ souvenirs, and instead were expecting something like an Oprah Winfrey show of, “you get a Blu-ray player, you get a TV, you get an iPhone”. My own parents only get hand me down iPhones :)). The rental my parents pay today is around 700$, which isn’t exactly cheap even by singaporean standards for retired individuals.\n\nSorry, coming back to the point, I think we (as Singaporean’s) should consider ourselves lucky for the still thin labour arbitrage and people who come here, live alone and away from their family for long stints to save up a little more than in their home country.\n\nAs for “highly paid” EP / PRs, this can be a contentious topic, so I’ll stay away.', ""This is an important issue. We probably have to fine tune our policy making and entrance criteria. But at the end of the day how does a bureaucrat sitting in an office and looking at applications really know someone's true intentions."", 'I don’t speak for all Singaporeans but just my own personal views.\n\n1. Singapore are built by foreigners &amp; the skill sets we have may be limited. There are some roles that would need foreigners to fill. But there are also companies that abuse the rules and only seek to hire foreigners. So when Singaporeans lost jobs to another foreigners, that’s when the resentment starts. I used to work in an US MNC that ran recruitment campaign in another Asian country and hired 80% foreigners. I was 1 of the 5 Singaporeans left on the team. \n\n2. It’s common and perhaps necessary as a temporary measure to prevent travel to contain the pandemic. US also did the same for certain countries. And they stop visa renewals too so people who left are not able to return for the longest time. I don’t think it’s a uniquely Singapore’s measure. But several countries are doing it. \n\n3. It possibly does or doesn’t. What skill set you’ve that another Singaporean could not do your role? \n\n4. Singaporeans view is not going to impact your PR application. You may stand a higher chance if you’re married. I have single friends who applied for 13 years and still got rejected and had to leave the country eventually.\n\nI think Singapore is foreigner-friendly in terms of culture, convenience, safety, and ease of getting work visa, etc. A lot of the negativity are further amplified by social media. It may not truly represent the views of many Singaporeans.', '1. Is it in Singaporean view that Singapore is better off without all the foreigners?\n\nNo. To put it simply, many are frustrated and it is a blanket statement. Frustrated over the lack of progression, jobs, overly competitive. (Which btw is the exact fking narrative the government has been selling us since I was a sperm, so I dont know why Sgreans are shooting foreigners)\n\nI believe that deep down, everyone knows but refuse to admit we need foreign talents and workers, for all sorts of jobs. And many believe they are \'good enough\' for these jobs (we aint, just look at SPH. Sgreans cant run jack).\n\n(2. Idk what that is.)\n\n3. Does ""I don\'t take jobs, I create jobs"" actually resonate with the local / citizen population?\xa0\n\nPersonally yes and no. I intern with an MNC for a while and honestly, foreigners (like Europeans) are way better at being mentors usually. And as a fresh grad, they actually are quite supportive of talents (local or otherwise.)\n\nThe no comes from the jobs I see which are perceived as more \'senior\' and not entry roles. This is what sgreans complain about. Why bring in a foreign mgr when this sgrean is here for so long? But the thing is (for mnc at least), many is internal transfer that people dont see. People just see job open -&gt; foreigner come in -&gt; foreigner bad. But it doesnt always work like that. Its more nuanced than that sometimes. Like in your case, you hire 90% local. Maybe some exp positions and some entry level. But Sgreans see \'what the hell why is the 10% not filled by Sgrean\'.\n\nThese are also the same people who dont complain when we go overseas to take others\' \'jobs\'. \n\n\n4. Should I continue my PR application efforts or just call it a day and\xa0uproot? Question here is not about approval chances, but back to question #1.\n\nAs a European (aka not an Asian), I think people will always see you as a European. One day when/if you have kids, they will probably be perceived the same, seeing them as Eurasian or Ang Moh and less so Sgrean (I am assuming you are aesthetically very European). \n\nBut does it matter to you? If you believe this is a great place to be, then why care what so many people think. People in big cities will always be jealous of \'foreigners\'. Being \'deprived\' of that role they are aiming for and what not. Especially SG who literally relies on foreign economy and MNCs. How can we hate the very hand which feeds us. People are just angry/frustrated. And honestly had been for years. \n\nPersonally, i will say go for it. Someone like you (as you have commented), seem to be beneficial for SG more than anything. We need more people who care about the country and less for themselves. Too many in SG care about themselves. It is sickening. Even in the political scene. But i digress. \n\nAnd for haters, fk them. There will always be haters. Here, Msia, Indo, wherever as long as you aint from there. \n\nJust some thoughts as a Sgrean', ""Let accept this fact: Singapore was never be and will never be your country (except you get PR or citizenship). They will do whatever fuck they want to foreigners for their own best interest. Your parents did not build this country so you have no rights to request for anything. You come here, you work for the salary you negotiated and agreed. Singapore is a stop in your life, not your home.

We are saying that SOME should go, especially those that do not contribute much to society, or are merely here to do work and enjoy the glitz &amp; glam that doesn\'t involve knowledge or skill transfer. We are against the labour/manpower policies for not protecting local workers enough, and not the people who come here to make ends meet, especially if you\'re a low wage worker doing laborious work. For non-local white collar workers, I think it\'s fair enough that most Singaporeans expect an appropriate level of contribution/adaptation in terms of knowledge transfer, exposure to &amp; acceptance of local cultures/norms, etc. Some Singaporeans don\'t feel/see it at their workplaces (and even outside of work), and they do not feel that the effects of policies are visible enough for them to confidently say that ""Singapore is a good place to work &amp; live in, no matter if you\'re local or foreign"".\n2.

No, I don’t believe that. As mentioned earlier, I strongly believe that people who vent about foreigners are unhappy people, stuck in a dead end job/marriage, low self esteem, etc etc. If you need evidence, just look at how they will ignore stories like yours or statistics that show foreigners contributing to Singapore, but continue on and on about a few negative news about foreigners.\n\n2.

twsearcher,1622732549,nrfl7i,8,1," Hi guys

Longtime lurker here. Sorry my first post has to be an unpleasant (and long) one but I would really like to hear some of your thoughts and experiences, especially if you have been through a similar situation before.

So my parents and I live in a HDB, and recently we have discovered that the pipes in our toilet and ceiling area surrounding those pipes are leaking. Right now it is still bearable (not like we are flooded everyday) but we should fix it, right? So we contacted the Town Council and HDB who came to assess and they concluded that the pipes need to be repaired/replaced. This would involve both our unit and the unit upstairs. The good thing is that the cost would be borne by the Town Council/HDB (I can't remember which now) so I guess costs would only be for reinstatement for stuff they have to hack to replace/fix the pipes.

Now we went to the unit upstairs - and we have never had any interaction with them before so I can't say we know them well or at all - and they were adamant at not rectifying the problem. The owners' elderly parents live with them so they said that the old folks wouldn't be able to take the renovation/rectification works. They did not elaborate but I assume they meant the hassle, stress and physical/mental strain of having to shift things around and repack and having work done in their home. We told them it would only be for a few days and it would really save us years of inconvenience and we would really appreciate their cooperation but they flat out refused.

To be honest, I know it is rather *sian* when you as the upstairs neighbour get told that you have to drill/hack your toilet floor because the pipes are leaky, especially when it is no fault of your own. The feeling of *sian-ness* is there, even I putting myself in their shoes can feel it. But if my downstairs neighbour were to tell me the same thing, I would *lan lan* do it because I know it must be done and not doing so would cause more inconvenience to other people than it would for me to tolerate those few days of renovation. For them, they seem contented to just let things remain the status quo. I tried telling them that eventually the pipe issue would affect them as well what with the leaks in their own flooring and all, but they were just *meh* about it. And the reason they gave was kind of hard to address (I mean if they said it was because it would be too expensive, at least we know money can fix it, but when you give reasons like old folks, it's really hard to address because it's less tangible a problem, especially being someone who has a heart for the elderly).

We tried checking with contractors whether we can do it only on our end but they all said no, because it may solve the problem for a short while, but the leaks will come back. The root cause is in the pipe upstairs - that has to be fixed, otherwise all other solutions are mere stop-gap measures.

Does anyone have any ideas what we can do? The Town Council seems to not want to take drastic action because it's a ""sensitive"" issue between neighbours so I think they don't want to be the bad guy and try to resolve things amicably. HDB also seems to have quite a bit of red tape so the matter is moving quite slowly there too. I think even if we involve the authorities, the issue will be a long-drawn one because they will want to mediate first given it's a community dispute, and then parties will play delaying tactics, etc, and finally it may escalate into a full-blown legal battle. I am hoping to avoid that as well but can't help it if it comes to that. Right now however, we are kind of stuck playing the long game on this one as we are the only ones pushing this issue forward (naturally since we are directly affected by it). My old parents are also feeling a lot of stress over this and I am concerned about their health and well-being, so I feel quite helpless that I can't support them or make this problem better for them.

Honestly, I don't mind forking money from my pocket to pay for whatever reinstatement costs the upstairs neighbour might suffer, or even give them some cash to entice them to give in. But I don't know how to make the offer and it might even offend them if I were to do so given that they never mentioned money as the reason for refusing. Since they mentioned the old folks, I don't mind going to their place and help out with the packing and shifting and settling the reno works there but I am pretty sure they won't like strangers in their place, especially in the current pandemic. I am seriously open to anything just so they would agree and we could fix the pipes and everyone could live in peace thereafter, but no one seems to be driving this and we as the downstairs unit are powerless at effecting any positive step forward.

Any experienced peeps who can suggest ways to move things along? And no I don't want to harass or threaten or knock the ceiling with the laundry pole etc to ""pressure"" them to give in. :)",askSingapore,41627,Advice/Suggestions for HDB toilet leak,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/nrfl7i/advicesuggestions_for_hdb_toilet_leak/,1.0,"['I was the upstairs neighbor. My repairs were done in 5 days, and I was lucky enough to have another shower to shower in during the time. Although initially the water was fucking shut off and I had to boil water and put it in a bucket beforehand. Plus the drilling was so insane like I had to exit my unit and attend my meeting (wfh) at my common staircase.. \n\nHonestly when our downstairs neighbor approached us, we went to their unit to see the leak. Their ceiling was bulbous, like a water bubble formed beneath the paint layer and is hanging down like a damn ballsack lol. \n\nHDB and TC paid the bulk of the cost and the rest was split equal among us and the neighbor downstairs. It was like $250+ sia. \n\nAnd the HDB appointed contractor was vvvv terrible and sent us a worker with attitude problem. If you ask me again I would’ve rejected the request but we felt bad for our neighbor downstairs living with the ceiling like that. \n\nI’m not sure why TC and HDB don’t wanna be the bad guy, because we rescheduled this repair work once and immediately the TC called my mom and said that please move forward with the repair ASAP. They should be the one to intervene actually we didn’t really interact with the downstairs neighbor much also. \n\nIt shouldn’t go to a full blown legal battle in my opinion cos this is a very small matter. HDB should settle it la, seriously. We don’t even own our units sigh', 'Thanks for the reply! And sorry the repairs didn’t go so well for you. \n\nYeah I totally understand it’s inconvenient for upstairs too. I wish it wouldn’t have happened. I just think we all have to be practical and move on with it.

She didn’t even offered to show us how bad or where the leak was, just bang on our door and demanded to come in. \n\nI was so tempted to delay the renovation due to her shitty attitude. Should had not been surprised at her attitude when she knocks on her roof for small things like flushing the toilet at night or if a glass bottle drops onto the floor. \n\nAnyways, it was reported to the town council, town council sent a guy to check by point long a normal flash light around the toilet floor in 5 seconds and left, town council sent letter to both units, the date was set and agreed upon among the two owners and the renovation was done in 4-5 days. I can’t remember which organization, if it’s HDB or town council, but they paid 50% out of goodwill. So the other 50% was split evenly among the two house owners. \n\nWhat needs to be fixed had to be fixed. Can’t expect your downstairs neighbor to wait for the leak to be so bad that they have a flooded toilet. And.. the water leaking down is probably dirty water too.. most of the upstairs neighbors probably do not want to do renovation as it does not affect them, but we are all neighbors..\n\nWhat I would do if I’m you is to keep pestering the authorities to get things done, better not try to keep having contact with them, never know if they one day decided to say that you are harassing them. \n\nAny leak when left for too long will most probably gradually become bigger, better to just fix it at the start when things are smaller.', 'Thanks for sharing.

Seems like the Town Council can drive things forward (send letter, fix date, etc). Hope ours can be as proactive as yours. \n\nAgree that we should keep our interactions to a minimum too.

ThrowRAabbie01,1622512970,npj46q,43,1,"We started seeing each other at the start of the year. We are both in our mid 20s and this is the first relationship for both of us. He did caution me at the start, that he falls in love and out of love easily. That being said, I felt myself falling for him already so we just went ahead and wants to see how it goes. He has been on dates with other girls the whole of last year but he said it didn’t last past the second dates due to the lack of interest on either parties.

However on our second date, he told me that he sees himself settling down with me. We have been texting for a month by then and I felt I really hit it off with him and we could talk about deeper level stuff, which he agrees too, which was why I thought this could work. We went on our third, fourth, fifth dates and so on...

Fast forward to now we are currently going into our sixth month. It is obvious I’m the one that likes him more than he likes me. I think at the start it was infatuation for him and it is slowly wearing off as we got to know each other better. The day before he raised up a point that he finds frustrating about me. He finds that sometimes when he is sharing his problems with me, I would try to be assertive and provide him a solution whereas all he wanted was just a listening ear. I told him he could just say that all he needs was a listening ear and I will just be there, but to him, this kind of things should come intuitively. It appears to him that we are pretty different people but to me I do find that we are similar deep down but he just does not know that side of me yet. Also, opposites do attract right? I asked him why is he still holding on to me, and he said that he still likes my qualities and it would be a pity.

We have other minor conflicts as well but if I could say one great thing about him is that he really makes time for me and we meet at least twice a week.

I also agree that what he has done seems like a power play - putting distance between you guys by cautioning you that he falls out of love quickly (how does he even know when this is his first relationship?!) so that he can always have a quick exit (i.e. i told you so, don\'t say i didn\'t warn you, you\'re the willing party), then lovebombing you next by saying how you are better than all the other dates he have had - but again, not too much better for him since well, it\'s just a pity if you\'re not with him. Maybe he didn\'t mean it but it would certainly rub people the wrong way. \n\nI would think a relationship is more of a 1+1=2, if you will, rather than a 0.5+0.5=1. From the get go, what makes you think that you\'re not a whole number on your own, and why do you need someone else to make you whole? Start seeing yourself as an individual, complete body, and a relationship as a value-add to your life as well as to your partner\'s life. Take away the relationship and you\'re still not any less you. I think this is a more positive outlook on relationships and hopefully it\'ll help you to reflect on yours and whether this is the right one for you. \n\nOn the conflict that you describe - I\'m of the view that there\'s no such thing as ""intuitive"" in relationships, for the simple reason that you can\'t read your partner\'s mind, and he can\'t read yours. If you put it plainly, he wants you to do what he wants without telling you what he wants - isn\'t that silly? I also went through heartaches wallowing over why my partner didn\'t understand my needs until I realized how silly I was being. There are many other hurdles in life that will come your way as a couple. If one/both of you can\'t communicate with each other - learning how to listen, learning how to talk in a way your partner can accept, learning how to resolve arguments and arrive at a common solution - it\'s going to be tough.

justkiddingjer,1622219899,nn1u2s,23,1,"So a little rant cause idk I kinda feel bad about my cat but then again maybe he decided to find new owners cause we weren't providing him enough? 

Context:
My cat used to be a stray cat from another area until my mum decided to bring him home and adopt him. With him being an ex stray cat and him being used to be able to roam around he had a hard time coping with being at home 24/7 so that was when my dad decided to let him out. It started with him being scared and all but now he LOVES going down to just watch people or be petted. He's a super friendly cat though feisty sometimes and I can see how one can fall into his charms. He is able to climb down the stairs but he can't climb back up so usually we would fetch him up for him to sleep at home or when he goes for his walks we would bring him home as well. This has been going on for a few years and most people from my estate have come to known that he belongs to our family but acts as a community cat. He probably has a girlfriend too, which is the actual community cat who wonders around often. 

Main story:
So a few days ago, we recently found out that a couple has been sending him home right to our doorstep(this is important)cause as stated he can't go home and sometimes would find people to take the lift with.  Today I found out that they have placed a collar on my cat when my dad brought him home from their night walks and he had assumed it was me that bought it for him. But we sort of linked it to the couple that has been bringing him home. The reason why we don't put a collar on his is that we've tried to, twice. Every single time he takes it off or destroys it in a week so we decided to stop. And I came home to see him collared up. Maybe I'm just feeling jealous but my MAIN ISSUE here is THEY KNOW HE HAS AN OWNER but yet still placed a collar on him without asking us first. Like if I knew the cat has an owner I would never dare place a collar on the cat as it is a sign that the animal belongs to someone. By placing the collar on him, to me it seems as it they are marking it as theirs and idk maybe I'm just being sensitive or jealous but idk what to do about it. And what was worse was this happened on my birthday, big clown moment. Idk I feel kinda cheated on by my cat, watching him look for new owners but then again the argument could easily be reversed and it could be me letting him out roam around so often. Can someone tell me what to do😭😭😭 and locking him at home is probably not an option due to my dad insistence of letting him out to roam around. People have suggested to remove the collar but I feel bad if they do. My mum is the only one that has seen the couple and I don't know how they look ljke so I can't really approach them to talk about this issue. If u know u are the couple in the rant, do drop me a dm HAHAH. Anyways I wanna hear your views regarding this issue and this has been unnecessarily long :/",askSingapore,41006,"Neighbours ""adopting"" my cat",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/nn1u2s/neighbours_adopting_my_cat/,1.0,"[""Don't blame your cat, he is innocent!

If there was, we would have immediately made him adapt to being an indoor cat.

fleshmarket,1621945400,nkoggb,1,1,"Hi guys, recently I renovated my new house.

Overall the ID I engaged was doing pretty shit job and then there's a lot of touch ups to be done.

But I guess something else that bothers my fam and I is the vinyl floor. There's a spot that the vinyl feels empty. We knocked on it and it sounds hollow even thou below it's the HDB cement tiles.
At first the ID came down for some measurements taking on other stuff and I highlighted to him on this spot. He said it's because of the foam below vinyl was sticking well. And I have zero experiences on renovation so I didn't ask much or pursue it. He promised me that within one year if it bulges up, he will come and redo. 

My bro in law came down at night and said that it can't be accepted because this is something that can be repaste to ensure it sticks.

So I texted my ID and said that I will not settle for that spot if this is something that can be done again. ID forwarded the carpentry guys recording and he said that we need to step a few more times and it takes time for the foam to stick because that tile is slightly dented in.

But this issue of the tile being slanted it was never highlighted to us during the handover. From my point of view, if its being highlighted before the handover, we will definitely accept it but also see what we can do. And not telling us only when we found out and enquired about it and they just give me an impression that they don't want to settle this and are pushing the responsibility around.

I would like to ask for advice if such a case for overlay vinyl can be done by the carpentry guys?

sssskkk211,1621578856,nhlwoz,135,1,"Hi everyone I’m just seeking some advice, I’m 30F and I’ve decided to move out of my family home. It can be quite a toxic environment with verbal abuse and sometimes even physical (but not towards me). The financial situation at home also isn’t good with father under heavy loans (borrowing from one to pay another). Previously I’ve also taken 2 loans to help tide him over because at the time he told me he had money coming in and would pay me back in 1 month but now 2 years later I’m still paying the loans. Because I am living at home for the first year that I was working I would use my salary to help him offset any bills he had and this sometimes left me with barely any money to be able to top up my ez link card. Eventually when I took the loans for him I stopped contributing to his bills because he knew I was paying the loans instead. His financial situation has worsened since (in all fairness he has property he can sell to fix his life but chooses not to). 


I just shared my news of moving out with both parents and they took it well (very unemotional and quite meh okay lor) but subsequently my father had a calm conversation with me to say if I move out now I’m making a big mistake and I will never get successful in life, he also added that because it’s just a hard time for him financially and if I have money to pay for rent I should have just contributed the money to him and the house instead (but how many years can I bleed myself dry without being able to make a life for myself?)

As a side note, the past few years at home have been quite bad, he is very controlling and as a result I barely have any friends and definitely no romantic prospects because he doesn’t accept having a boyfriend then getting married, thinking instead that good girls are just supposed to get married without having a boyfriend (but he also doesn’t believe in matchmaking so I don’t even know what to do). I’m lonely, depressed and extremely terrified. 

Since I decided to move out and found a place I’ve had 3 big emotional meltdowns where I cry until I cannot breathe but I also can’t stop.

Be as firm as you can be and go ahead with your plan.\n\n- set boundaries, with toxic family, with flatmates, with friends. I’m still learning this myself .\n\n- Money wise, budget everything and always make sure you have at least 6 months of emergency funds in case anything\n\n- renting/landlord - take photos of EVERYTHING before you move in, no matter how nice a landlord is, you never know until the time you move out and they’ll try to pin every single fault on you\n\n- self-care is very important - moving out will provide you the freedom to explore your interests and chart your own path. Being your most authentic self is incredibly healing\n\nI wish you the best OP!', ""I'll say go for it if you have the means. Seems like you've already made up your mind but your father's comments are making you second guess yourself. \n\nFrom my perspective (take it with a grain of salt since I do not know the whole situation), your home situation is not improving despite your efforts to help so you have to ask yourself if you're okay with letting it continue to weigh you down and jeopardizing your future. \n\nStay strong and I wish you the best in whatever decision you choose to make."", ""Kudos to you for making such a big decision and doing it for YOUR mental health ! You are also soo brave for making this  decision for your future as well and don't let anyone else tell you otherwise ! \n\nSometimes our parents aren't our bigger supporters, but are the very things holding us back. If they(or dad) brings up again how moving out is a big mistake and how you wouldn't be successful, calmly tell them your reasons why for moving out. Keep it short and stand your ground. Could be as simple as you wanting to move out be an independent women ! \n\nI know family can sometimes be difficult, and I say normalise moving out of toxic environments.

You hurting is his fault, not yours. Don\'t hate the pain. Don\'t deny it. Acknowledge it, and it will pass. It might pass like a kidney stone (ie bloody painfully) but it will pass. And your heart will live on until you find someone who cherishes it as much as life itself. \n\nRadical thought: consider forgiving your father. \n\nNot because he deserves it. More because you don\'t deserve the pain that comes from begrudging him. Hate is poisonous. If you hate him, it\'ll be like drinking poison but hoping he dies from it. Oh, and forgiving him ties in with your goal of not burning bridges. More on that in a bit. \n\nHe likely did what he did because he had years of bad parenting himself, or allowed friends or whoever to undo any good parenting he received. Not defending him, just saying he, like all of us, were powerless against the indelible imprints made by his parents. Not all of those imprints are positive ones, of course. \n\nShould you succeed in forgiving him, keep in mind that you don\'t have to let him know you forgave him. If he changes, great, but should the leopard not change its spots, then remember that it\'d be silly at best (and life-threatening at worst) to expect hugs and cuddles from the same leopard that enjoyed biting you. \n\nLastly, you mentioned that a good relationship with family is of some importance to you. On that note, I\'d suggest \n- redefine ""good relationship"". Consider settling for peace and cordiality rather than actual happiness. It\'ll already be better than what a lot of families wrecked by debt can hope to have. \n- treat your mum better than your dad. But not too well. Sure, she didn\'t emotionally blackmail you for money, but I sense she didn\'t protect you as much as she could have? \n- just be cordial.

MinisterforFun,1621387400,nfs3w1,17,1,"So my boss offered me a one year contract with her doing the same thing as I am now, except with higher pay and CPF (I’m doing traineeship now).

I’ve applied in the company’s job portal and she’s been following up with HR about my confirmation. However, I’m due to start on 1 June but until now, HR has not sent any offer or any T&amp;C for me to review.

My boss has already apologised for taking so long because she also needs me so win-win. Apparently HR has been questioning why am I being offered an external contract and not being an internal hire.

But anyway, I noticed there’s another opening in her department so I was wondering if I should apply for that?

So how her department is structured is she’s at the top and it’s separated into two teams. The one year contract is for one team (the one I’m already in) and this new opening I just saw, is for the other team.

Would it be unprofessional of me to apply for this other role? Ultimately, my resume and notification will go to her as well.

I feel if I do it, she might question me since I already accepted the first role (the one year contract):

If I don’t do it, I feel I have FOMO. Which leads me to my next question: today is 19 May. So 8 working days left to when I’m supposed to start the new contract (doing the same thing).

galactoes-,1621182607,nds0ge,50,1,"I shared a room with my maternal cousin from my first year of secondary school all the way till my year 2 in polytechnic. 

Here’s some background before I begin my story: My family and I are not well to do at all, we live in a small HDB flat with 2 rooms and 1 toilet. My parents are minimum wage workers. My mother is a PR, her side of the family are in Malaysia. 

In 2014, my maternal cousin wanted to start a career in Singapore due to the high salary, so we took her in. It was my  first year having my own room actually, I shared one with both my parents up till my paternal grandmother passed. She pays my mother $200 a month, and this includes her 3 meals as well. Everything was fine at the start, till she got comfortable and started disrespecting my mother, often screaming at her. She then started leaving her plates unwashed everywhere, in the room, on the dining table, on the sofa etc. We reminded her everytime but she claimed that she forgot. Her showering time was around 45 minutes to 1 hour, which hugely inconveniences my family especially when I had to go to school and my parents had to go to work. We do kinda have a schedule but she just shows up randomly and hogs the bathroom. She sometimes came home after clubbing all drunk at 3am and wakes the whole family up. During exam period for me when I stayed up to mug, she refuses to let me leave the light on because she wanted to sleep. She told me I should have just studied in the morning. A lot more things happened but it has been quite a while so I don’t really remember.

Anyway, my dad and her fought and she even videoed him to send to the family groupchat. She packed her things and left the next morning. She asked me to pay back all the money she spent on me, for souvenirs she got me and some occasional treats. I paid her back with my allowance.

Throughout, my mother goes back to Malaysia once a week to visit my elderly grandfather, who is taken care of by my cousin’s mother, my aunt. My mother pays my aunt every month. After the incident, my aunt refused to take care of my grandfather. She said since we did not take care of her daughter, she shouldn’t have to take care of my grandfather. My mother quit her full time job to go back 4 days a week. Just like that, my mother lost the ability to support her schooling child. My aunt has 2 fully grown adult daughters with university degrees.

Due to the pandemic, my mother had to stay in Singapore. She transfers $1000SGD every 3 months to my aunt. So she would take care of her own father. $1000 is bulk of my mother’s monthly salary.

All this while I felt so bad for my mother. She had to put up with the disrespect, and due to an argument she did not start, she had to sacrifice so much. To me, I think my cousin and her family are being unreasonable. We simply could not stay together because our living habits did not match. Now they just ignore my existence.

qwertythrowawayss,1620995737,nc7km5,31,1,"im 25 M turning 26 soon, i live with my family with two sisters but not on talking terms due to my younger sister being a pathological liar and blame everything on me, one example is my younger sister threw my older sister's turtle away but told my family that i did it. on the outside i seem normal and cheerful but i have been depressed since around sec 4. No one knows i am depressed and i have never shown this side of me to the outside world. i have a normal engineer job (~3k) but its killing me inside everyday. at work, im the type that will resolve everything and not make any noise, but i recently found out that because i dont make any fuss at all and ppl thinks that i dont do any work. i am in a cross functional role and my boss knows im doing work but the constant gossip has gotten to me. i am above average looking, and have tried my best to find a partner but just cant find anyone. i even tried those match making service and there are just psychotic ppl there, i have told them to cancel and termite my profile but they refuse to and kept pestering me. three months ago my final friend said ""dont you think living like you everyday is meaningless?"", and i have not been in the best of mind since. before this year, i work out at least five times a week, does skin care, eat healthy, made sure my room is clean etc but have stop completely. i dont have any social life or hobbies due to me working from a relatively young age because my parent told me to not study and go work instead. my childhood was just staying at home reading encyclopedia from like 1998, during pri and sec schools i cannot go out, not even to the library to read because my parent just dint allow. when i was waiting for poly admission, they said they dont have money to sent me to school and i will need to quit if i cant pay the school fees myself. i have then paid for my own expense since poly, but afew years ago i found out my parents lied to me and just dint want to spent the money to even sent me to poly. during ns when i first held a gun, i had the urge to shoot myself and i requested to be excuse from firing. i dint say any special reason and just said i dont feel well. my vocation as a admin allowed me to not do any duties with guns but the psychological attacks from the insane dxo ma'am also did a toll on me. recently my parents have started asking me to give them allowance but i have nothing in saving after paying my uni sch fees. as of now i dont have any friends, dont have anything to live for, dont have anything to look forward to, everything would be the same without me. i tried going out for fresh air but its useless, i stay in my room all the time except when i need to go to work and act normal. i have always find someway to better my situation but i dont know what to do any more. my deadline to myself is my next birthday if my situation and mental state remains the same.

i have though about quitting my job and start streaming, but 95% of singapore streamer dont really earn enough to even cover rent, and my family would also start complaining if i make any noise in my current room. is there any job that is suitable for high functioning depression ppl like me, and is it possible to find a cheap place that i can live alone. i dont mind if its hunted or anything.

My parents had always held high expectations of me and they wouldn\'t accept, god forbid, for anything to be wrong with their daughter. At first I understood it as their ignorance alone, but I quickly realized that many employers would likely share that same ignorance that stems from the same older generation, so my parents\' reluctance was warranted to an extent. I forced myself to be logical and understanding of their perspective, despite how heartbreaking it was to reach out to my parents and be put under fire for it.\n\nI did eventually start treatment but only from private establishments - my parents did not want anything to be on public record. This led to almost constant guilt tripping about the stupidly high cost it incurred to my family and it made me feel worse, honestly. Although I am proud of my parents for acknowledging my need for help, I could see that they still carried a heavy stigma around mental health &amp; treatment as they would deny official diagnoses and deny me the use of medication (because they didn\'t, and still dont, believe in it but that\'s another conversation) etc. \n\nIts taken long, painful years of hard conversations with my parents to try and shift their mindset and it\'s an ongoing journey to this day. I can say that compared to 5 years ago, they are now more understanding and accepting of the importance of mental health while there are still lessons to be learnt. \n\nSo yes, Singapore/ the older Asian generation has a rigid mindset regarding mental health but steps can be made, no matter how little. Conversations can be made even if they seem like worthless attempts. I, for one, will not shut up about it if it means a better, safer future for the people around me.

I say this from first hand experience, as someone who's lived in Singapore and Overseas, and has struggled with mental health issues. \n\nThe stigma is worse than in some Western countries, where mental health awareness (and acceptance of those with struggles) is far greater. As others have pointed out, there may be some (especially the older generation) who might react negatively towards you should you disclose that you are seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist/counsellor.\n\nSadly we live in a world where a lot of people attack or ostracize others who are struggling, rather than be patient, understanding or helpful. Ideally, it would be best to have support from those closest around but unfortunately that's not always the case. Nonetheless, your health and happiness is the highest priority and you should absolutely get the help you need. Others may not love you, but no matter what happens you can love yourself! If you don't feel comfortable sharing about it then perhaps it's best to keep it to yourself for the time being. (Therapists usually have a patient confidentiality agreement and won't disclose it unless your life or others' lives are at risk.)\n\nTherapy was the best thing I ever did for my health, and indirectly, for those around me too. Your health and happiness has a strong influence on your productivity and relationships too. There's no shame in getting help. People fall ill and visit doctors. Likewise, sometimes our mind falls ill or goes through too much and we need some help too.\n\nIf you do decide to get therapy, it's important to ensure that you are fully comfortable and confident in your therapist. It's absolutely fine and common for people to switch therapists if they find that things aren't working out. (For example, you wouldn't buy the first car that you see in a dealership. It's important to test drive first and then pick the right car.)\n\nAll the best and I hope you feel better eventually :)"", 'That makes sense , thank you.

OverlyLoquacious,1620198914,n59zek,8,1,"Using an old account for a bit of anonymity. Since my teenage years I've suspected I have ADHD or some similar condition. 

Why? Lack of ability to concentrate for long periods of time. Very careless but no matter how much I focussed I don't ever see the careless mistakes (like spelling or something). 

Easily distracted but also have moments of hyper focus. Disorganised thoughts. Lots of restless behaviours such as tapping foot incessantly and needing to have something to fidget with (usually I use my pen or a thick rubberband). Inability to regulate emotions well and lack of coping mechanisms leading to addictive personality. 

Socially very resistant and reluctant to mix or meet with ppl and it physically hurts me (body aches and weird cramping feelings in my lower back and stomach with gastric problems also) when I have to socialise for long periods of time - even with those I consider very good friends (of which I have only 2 currently). 

Unable to genuinely empathise with others or feel what they're feeling and tending to react to my partner's negative reactions or emotions (like sadness or frustration) with outbursts of anger. And I'm prone to bouts of depression. 

Why I haven't seen a doc? Actually I have. In university and later when I started working. In uni I went because I was depressed and was on meds for a while. Asked to check on whether I have any conditions but was told it's just likely depression. Then later when to polyclinic and IMH a couple of times but was always brushed aside or given lines like ""maybe it's stress or lack of sleep"" and then given brochures on how to lead a mentally healthy life (exercise and eat right blah blah). 

So I'm avoiding govt docs now. I don't think they're equipped or willing to consider things properly. But I'm wary of costly private docs as well who might have certain ingrained theories or biasness when it comes to mental health. 

So hoping someone might be able to recommend something or someone who can help. Just really want to know why I'm the way I am like this. If it turns out I'm normal that's great - but it'll help to know how to deal with some of the things I'm going through. And if I do have a condition, I'd like to know what it is and again how to deal. 

I'm just tired of being condescended to and left wondering why I'm so weird or deficient when compared with others who got their lives together, handle setbacks and situations well, have healthy relationships and don't physically retch from feelings of doom and gloom and guilt sometimes for small things.

Emergency_Daikon_631,1620022271,n3pc29,11,1,"Hi all, basically I dont know how normal or common this is but Im afraid I could not learn and progress in my career or worse, fired if this continues. Basically some background, I im a self taught developer and after completing my internship, I joined this company 2 weeks ago, now this is my 3rd week but they haven't given me any development tasks yet. Instead they have assigned me testing jobs (because my laptop wasnt ready yet this started but I am still doing development tasks) and gave me the workload of the PM today (where im supposed to do 2 hourly internet tests and reports). My mentor (the developer I'm supposed to be attached to) doesn't care about me at all, she asked me to sit on the opposite side of the room far away from her on the first day and gave me 5 documents and told me to set up my development environment on my own (with things I have never used such as VM) and disappeared. I chased her to ask her questions but I can tell she doesn't want to teach me. After I was done, I asked her if there are any bugs I can fix or anything I can help her with and she asked me to do read the documents again first. 

Among the 5 documents she gave me, one was a tutorial so I asked her for the answers after that and she said she doesn't have it and will check and get back to me but hasn't. I asked again on friday and she said she is still finding. During team weekly meetings, I got assigned to do UAT testing task the first week with the testing team as my laptop wasn't ready. Now that it's ready, I thought this week they would give me developer tasks but we just had another meeting and they asked me to do testing jobs again and asked me to do the PM's job (send 2hourly reports on the speed of the website loading). Its not even my job and I wasn't hired to do this plus I really want to learn and do development :( I feel sad and taken advantage of. I'm not sure if im self taught thats why my mentor doesnt want to teach me or give me bugs or tasks to fix as she doesnt have faith in me or what, but if given a chance, I can try and do my best. Today I asked the PM after doing her work in front of her when I could get development tasks and she told me to check with my mentor. However she has given me anything as well.

Initially I was worried about not learning and being taken advantage of but just now I heard from lunch with some colleagues that the company has run out of money and using maintanence money right now. Now I am worried that they would fire me. During the team meeting, they didnt even ask me if my laptop is ready (which it is) and instead just assigned me the PM's role, which is a bad sign. 

I am not part of this company but a 2nd party company sent me here to help them out. Should I email my HR there and tell her this? This is my first job (after completing my internship), Im not sure if this is a good idea, would HR help or would I be seen as bad for not being able to solve this on my own or being fussy? How normal is this? Would they allocate me somewhere else? I do want to learn though but at the same time I dont want to become unemployed again as I was unemployed for a long time. I want to make this work if possible, its a good and meaningul project that I would love to be a part of if possible.

If I were to email hr, not saying I should, maybe I should let a few more days pass, but this is what I would say, does any part need to be edited? Do I sound like an entitled gen z? ;_;

The start of every job has to go through intense reading and understanding of codebase before even being assigned a feature to work on. The fact that you are given a testing role at the start is already a feat. Take this opportunity to read and understand the code base better. It would be good for you to understand how the system works, and give suggestions if you can. The company might just be helping you transition into the role by giving you simpler tasks first.

Luckily they were helping out with those areas because there's no way in hell the project was going to be completed within those constraints for 1 developer. \n\nIMO you should just do the tasks assigned to you as you'd be having to do them too as a developer (I assume that you're in a small company) regardless.

Also, doesn't maintenance stuff have money on your side?"", ""Welcome to the corporate world\n\nYour workscope is at your boss's discretion"", ""I'm a software engineer.

Working with things that you are new to on your own is an everyday experience for the industry, you just have to roll with it and learn how to debug problems. I would expect experienced developers to set up their environment with documentation on their own with minimal guidance, and to solve simple problems themselves. I might give a pass for very new developers like you though.\n\n&gt; Among the 5 documents she gave me, one was a tutorial so I asked her for the answers after that and she said she doesn't have it and will check and get back to me but hasn't\n\nHave you attempted to find the answers yourself online?\n\n&gt; Its not even my job and I wasn't hired to do this\n\nI would suggest removing those words from your vocabulary. It's not like they're making you clean the floor, the things you described are still relevant to your career. Thinking that way is going to set you back in your career or getting promoted, nobody likes to work with people who don't take ownership or who aren't proactive.

I'm not super enthusiastic about it either (though I wouldn't be nearly as impolite as her). Mentorship reduces the productivity of developers a lot, however management may not recognize this and still give them the same workload, so of course they wouldn't like it. Or she could just dislike mentoring. This is why I don't think mentorship responsibilities should be just dumped onto people, it doesn't work out well for either party.\n\n&gt; I feel sad and taken advantage of. \n\nNobody is trying to take advantage of you, new developers are a liability to a company for about 6 months until they become productive, if anything the company is probably losing money on you at the moment. What is more likely is that is there was no plan put in place to manage you properly, and no one wants to take on the responsibility. It sucks to be there, but it's not malicious. I would suggest not defaulting to thinking that people are out to get you, most people just want less work for themselves. \n\n&gt; Today I asked the PM after doing her work in front of her when I could get development tasks and she told me to check with my mentor. \n\nHow does your company track development tasks? Do they use JIRA, Trello etc? Have you attempted to look at the tracker yourself and see if you can take on some tasks? You don't necessarily have to wait for someone to assign you tasks.\n\n&gt; they asked me to do testing jobs again and asked me to do the PM's job (send 2hourly reports on the speed of the website loading)\n\nHere's a development task for you, you can automate that. You can write a script to check the website speed in intervals and send emails/Slack messages/whatever medium you're using. Don't know how to do that?

Usage is as such:
Architectural rendering (lumion)
Modelling and BIM (rhino/Revit)
Finite element modelling and analysis (staadpro, plaxis, SLIDE)
PSD
PREMIER pro (vid editing)

Chains_2000,1619626305,n0ibvw,7,1,"    Hi people. I am feeling very frustrated right now, in fact for my my entire life. I live in a toxic family (assumed by me) where my father (70+ yrs old) is always screaming and yelling at my mother. Whenever she does something that he don't like or is unhappy about, my dad would shame/diminish her, say that she is dumb, stupid, basically bad in all sorts way, and loud enough that you could hear him at least 3 house away along the corridor (HDB house). I tried to talk to him, told him that there is no need to yell, but he say he does it because he has bad hearing (which is true), resulting in the tone. But a week ago, when I just got back to my house, I saw my dad occupying my room watching his show (he has a TV with a CD player in my room) and because its my room, and I hate the sight if him, I just want to go into my room and shut the door. My mom then tells him to off the TV and give me the room, but eventually he got frustrated and threw one of his many tantrums by yelling (yes again) and this time raised his hands up holding his CD as though he is going to smash it down, trying to intimidate her. My mom is short while my dad is &gt;175cm (taller than me), so yelling + size + the act of smashing the CD (which he eventually did) is just overboard. This kinds of events has been occurring since my childhood and when I was young, my neighbors did call the police due to the noise, but I think they eventually gave up. I was scared back when I was a kid, so I didn't do anything then. But now I just want to get out. Thought about renting a place, but I just graduated from poly, going to NS soon and planning to enter Uni after, so got financial difficulties. My problem with my dad now is his screaming, bad hygiene (how bad? Well, we have ants, lizards, cockroach, and recently bedbugs, silverfish, you name it. Also way too much dust and furniture that there isn't enough space to walk, he shits in the bathroom, he doesn't flush, etc.), and him being a hoarder (like most old people are), I just don't see how I can move forward with uni. I barely made out of poly, how am I going to handle Uni?? Limited study space (35% of my room is his stuff and half of that he never even use in decades), his yelling...idk. I feel helpless. Its definitely affecting my mental health, and Uni will fuck my mental health even more. I already had a small taste of it in poly.

yeaurossoe,1619180757,mwu3ak,105,1,"(Some random rants as something has been bothering me these few days) 

Late 20s/M here, living a very solitary and loner lifestyle. 

Basically, I don't have many friends due to my quirky and weird personality/character. I also have unusual interests (i.e. transportation stuff) which do not align with those of my friends. This made it hard for me to bond and socialise well with people. 

Being left out of convos? Quite common  
Being left out of any activities? Been there, done that  
An invisible existence? Very likely 

This also means that I have zero luck with romantic relationships, because yes, I am too good at switching girls/ladies off and getting myself friendzoned (oh well). Tried plenty of dating apps, no luck either. I'm not good with pick-up lines, write-ups, etc., so whatever I wrote in my profile are 100% honest stuff about me (i.e. overweight, likes this, like that). Zero match. Nothing. 

So I basically gave up on that and just focussed on my interests and my job (which coincidentally, happened to be something of my interest too), and that pushed me even further deeper into darkness and made me ever more unattractive as a friend or partner. 

How loner is my lifestyle? 

I eat alone. Not just hawker centre, food court, fast food etc., I eat at family-themed restaurants and fancy restaurants alone too, attracting many judging eyes in the same time. I also do cooking, and for some of the dishes that are usually made in multiple servings i.e. roasted chicken, soup, that'll be a week's worth of lunch or dinner instead, since there's nobody to share with. 

I leisure alone -- I ride the cable car alone, I ride the Sentosa Luge alone, I visit USS alone, I visit SEA Aquarium alone, and I went picnic with myself (bring a picnic mat and a few packets of food, and then just sit there and chill alone), I hike alone, I go almost everywhere alone. 

I travel alone -- I went overseas alone, I went for road trips alone, I went for cruises alone.  

I staycation alone. Yes, I booked a fancy hotel and went there for staycation alone. 

How am I doing? Well, I kinda got accustomed to that, and fell into the trap of a feedback loop, i.e. the more I live a loner life, the more accustomed I am to that lifestyle, and the harder it is for me to socialise. 

Sometimes, I do get judged by others, like ""One person only??? Oh okay...""; sometimes its not financially worth it, since I'm paying the price of two for just myself, i.e. hotels, cruises. And sometimes, seeing others having fun as a group, it can be quite sad and desolate. 

Not sure has anybody also lived a similar lifestyle? How are you guys doing? Do you intend to get out of this lifestyle?

An FC from finexis here, here's what I think...\n\nAs a student I think you should just start out with a hospitalisation plan and a personal accident plan, because both aren't that expensive and can save you a lot of money if you get injured/hospitalised.\n\nAs for a the multiplier plan (which is a whole life plan) I think you can postpone until you start working. As of right now it might be cheaper because you are younger but I don't think it's a good idea to buy for the sake of buying, like what's the point? Is the coverage meaningful?\n\nI don't think 3 plans is a lot because there are many different product types out there.\n\n\\---\n\nThat being said as a whole, I think you should at least shop around before you commit to any plan, is the plan the cheapest  in the market? Is your friend really offering you quality advice?\n\nPersonally I think a term plan might be better, even though you will need to service the premiums throughout the entire term, you'd be able to free up capital for investing, because the plan is easily 1/3 the price of a whole life plan. Even though a whole life plan has cash value, if you look at the break even point it's like when you're 70 years old and above lei...\n\nAnd as for the coverage, usually I would cover the amount my client wants to accumulate with investments (I.E Client wants to accumulate 800k, so maybe I'll do a term plan of 800k to 1mil with Critical Illness until 65, in a nutshell)\n\nDo look into other companies like finexis, PIAS, or IPP, which are advisors who can recommend products from different insurers to give you a more personalised financial plan.\n\nEDIT: As for buying before you grad, you can make that decision yourself. If you can afford it, why not? If you prefer to wait till you start working next year, I highly doubt it'll make a big difference (Talking in terms of the Whole life plan)\n\nEDIT EDIT: Oh yes, Whole Life Plans give a FAT commission, and contributes highly to an agents KPIs, so they might be more incline to push it. \n\nIn the market, NTUC would be the cheapest hospitalisation plan (all hospitalisation plans cover about the same things), and Manulife would give the cheapest PA plan, but NTUC/MSIG PA plan (Which you can buy online yourself) is a lot easier to claim."", ""I'm putting money on OP receiving at least 2 PMs from financial advisors"", 'Ask him how much commission he makes and you can get a rough idea of why some plans are being sold to you.', ""All the comments here can be quite overwhelming. 300 a month seems steep for someone who hasn't graduated yet.\n\nI would suggest consulting a few different agents before making a decision.

I dont want to worry about premium payment when im older(like retirement-old).\n\nHospital plan - This is the most important one as the risk of you staying in hospital is far higher than dying(at this age). \n\nPA - If you ride bicycle/motorbike then this is more important.

Total for me at is about 200/mth, my life coverage amount is way less than what would\'ve been recommended by him and other FAs. So I have the life, hosp and PA.\n\nAt your age, go with hosp and PA first. The life plan is a ""really nice to have, if you can afford to ""burn"" 200-300/mth"". For hosp, I recommend you try get one that also provides coverage if you go private hosp. You\'ll pay more in premium, but I think it\'s worth the price. PA is self-explanatory.

dogtifs,1617649483,mks73v,25,1,"My partner and I are looking for a place and have been mainly contacting agents off p. guru but it's been a nightmare. We do not have an agent representing us as we know what we want, do not need any suggestions and are quite well-versed in terms of rental property hunting so we do not find any benefit in engaging an agent (and also paying for the com).

Have contacted multiple agents requesting for viewings, and most of them have left us on read, or just gave us a ""take it or leave it"" viewing timeslot for weekdays which we are unfortunately unable to attend due to work commitments. When asked about weekend availability we'd just get ghosted and left on read.

Also arranged for a viewing one Saturday, only to have the landlord's agent text 2 hours prior to cancel the viewing as ""tenant is sick"". Zero follow up or mention of rescheduling, so we left it as that. Figured that the agent will be the point of contact if we went through with the lease and it will be unpleasant as she already seems so unresponsive and inefficient.

Any idea why these agents are ignoring viewing requests for sincere tenants? We are an EP/local couple so thought it would be ok in terms of the infamous preferences amongst landlords. We're really puzzled as we thought it's a renter's market right now with COVID, stricter new EP renewal measures as well as many foreigners being retrenched. Feels like we have to beg them to rent out their unit to us. Never experienced such difficulty with our previous rentals, what more with many expats leaving we thought'd it be more of a breeze.

uhhhh12345,1546847558,adfijp,26,1,"Hi all

I’ve posted this on r/AmItheAsshole previously but I guess I could get more advice here considering the cultural background here that we as Singaporeans are able to understand better and the stigma of “abandoning” your parents. Not searching for any validation of my actions but more of wanting to find out how to deal with this situation better.

Here goes my story:

I’ve been raised by my real birth mom since young, and my entire memory of her is just being beaten and scolded throughout my childhood. She hasn’t worked a single day ever since I was born, my dad is the sole breadwinner of my family and therefore didn’t spend a lot of time at home. So my mom just spends most of the time at home doing household chores and complaining about the fact that no one cares about her. She is also an alcoholic with depression.

I remember as a child I always woke up in tears as she would verbally and physically abuse me on a daily basis from the time I wake up till I leave the house for school or some other activity. She often called me useless and said things like she wished that I had never been born, etc. Other than being well supported by my father financially, I really don’t think I was raised with love and nurtured well as a child. But that’s fine by me, I told myself that once I am self-sufficient I will be able to move out and lead my own life.

On the other hand, I have a very caring Godmother (my dad’s older sister aka my aunt) who is single and has no children of her own. So she treated me like her own, bringing me on holidays with her, gave me extra money and gifts for special occasions. But the most important part wasn’t just all these, she supported me through my childhood giving me advice in life and whenever I faced problems. She was the one who guided me on the right path as she knew that I wasn’t receiving all of these from my parents. Thanks to her, I prioritised my studies and made it through university.

Fast forward to present day, I am a working adult in my late 20s. I have also gotten married and shifted out from my parent’s home. Naturally I don’t see my mom as much and conflicts have been significantly reduced. Nonetheless, we try to get together as a family on special occasions like birthdays or Mother’s Day, etc. On those days that I do see her, she gives me regular shit as well.

Lately I realised that no matter what I do to make her happy, she doesn’t appreciate nor reciprocate. Do bear in mind that I have tried very hard to make amends and communicate with my mother to improve our relations and while I do admit that she does get better at times, every few months she lashes back out at me and makes me feel like any improvement she has tried to make are all fake and deep inside she still hates me. Every time such an episode happens it affects me on a very deep level and I get emotionally affected for days and weeks.

Now I do not make any more effort to visit her, I intend to only meet up with my dad separately to pass allowances and continue to treat my godmom as my real mother. I introduce my godmom as my mom to outsiders because that’s how I genuinely feel and I am grateful for how she has raised me up to what I am today. Many people who do not know my story has pointed out that I should continue to try harder with my mom as afterall, she is my real mother.

However, I feel that I no longer have any capacity to try harder. Whatever extra time or money I have, I would very much prefer to spend it on my godmother or my father instead. If I were to give it to my mom, I can’t help but feel like I am shortchanging the people who really did care for me in the past and present.

I have chosen this path as I am tired of this toxic relationship and all the negativity and emotional blackmail that ensue just from dealing with my mother.

There have been cases of the ""golden child"" taking their parent\'s $$ and abondoning them after that. Whats worse is that the mother especially would see nothing wrong with that and still continue to favour him. ', 'You’re not an ahole, if that’s what you’re asking.

Hi guys,

Wonder anyone able to clarify my doubts on this. 

I’m currently a contractor (6months) in a company. I’ve got this through an agency (feel free to guess, yellow logo).

My question is, will the agency seek me for compensation of 2 weeks salary if I just so decided to resign immediately after receiving my pay? Apart from legal action, what else will they be able to do? Will they bother to go through the hassle to seek legal action? 

My contract states and I quote” Either party may terminate this contract of employment, without assigning any reason, by giving the other party a two (2) weeks’ written notice, or by paying a sum equivalent to two (2) weeks’ salary in lieu of notice, except where the contract of employment is expiring before the requisite notice can be fully served, the applicable notice period or payment in lieu thereof will be calculated up to the contract expiry date only.” 

Reason why I’m planning to leave this is that my team is toxic &amp; team leader biased. Stirring issues with higher management, trying to cause problems for me. Thus me seeking to leave immediately without notice to get out of this unhealthy environment. Colleague left too, like immediately during lunch 2 weeks ago. 

Sorry for long wall of text.

Will agency seek compensation?",askSingapore,5000,Clarification needed,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/epumv0/clarification_needed/,,"['You can wait for pay but cannot wait to give notice?

This is how they dont lose money also."", ""Yeah it's better to hang on for that two weeks and I wouldn't want to pay my money to that agency.

They threatened to call the police if he doesn't return the money. My friend just ignored and got away with it. Your problem includes two weeks of pay so I think they are likely to take action."", 'Yes, you would need to pay the 2 weeks salary in lieu.

linglingmozartybae,1591943053,h7ffnh,4,3,"Hello, I'm a JC student considering to study in Japan after my A levels at the end of the year, and I would like to ask a few questions about studying in Japan. I've been wanting to make this post for quite a while and have only just mustered the courage to do so. This post might be a bit long and i apologise for that, but I would really love to hear from you!!!

I'm hoping to study music composition in either Senzoku Gakuen College of Music or Tokyo University of the Arts(Geidai). I don't take any music related subjects in JC (I take h2 BCMTranslation), but I do have a musical background so I'll be able to prepare for the auditions. I know that Geidai admits students under the MEXT scholarship, but the official website doesn't really explain much about the scholarship itself, and I haven't been able to find the 'Music' subject under the 'Fields of Study' section in their application guidelines (I only found Social sciences/Humanities and Natural Sciences), so I'm kind of confused. I will look into it more after A's.

I'm not thinking of studying music locally after hearing from quite a few different people(including my music teachers) that having a music degree here wouldn't really get me anywhere realistically. I was actually hoping to graduate in japan and work in the music industry there.

Regarding my Japanese speaking level: I did Japanese O levels back in sec school, passed JLPT N3 in sec 3 (98th percentile), and N2 in sec 4 (88th percentile). I've also done a few exchanges with the Japanese Secondary School here in SG. Although I can understand around 85% of what is being said when I watch or read the Japanese news, I haven't exactly spoken the language since Sec 4, so I'm nowhere fluent as of now. I'm also well aware that N1 is an entirely different ball game and that I'll never be able to become truly fluent or as good as a native speaker.

My questions are:

* How realistic it is to take a gap year after A levels to work part time, study the language, take N1, apply for MEXT and familiarise myself with the Japanese musical terminologies? (i'm familiar with a portion of it from following the japan music scene for several years).
* MEXT: What is it like exactly? I haven't been able to understand much from their website. How hard is it to get it? How difficult are the papers?
* Fitting in: How hard is it to fit in with the locals? I've heard about the 'circles' thing in japanese uni's, how exactly does it work? For the people reading this who have studied/ worked in japan: what kind of experiences did you have?
* Part time jobs: Would it be realistic to take on a part time job while studying in uni? How hard is it to find a job as a student? What are the common jobs that students take on? Are the working times flexible? How is the pay?
* I'm aware of the pretty toxic working culture (hierarchy, ot, subtle racism etc) and the generally lower pays in Japan. I'm not 100% sure of what it's like in the music industry, but as long as I'm doing something I really like, I'm prepared to deal with them and I'm willing to make compromises to adapt.

Lastly, I would just clarify that I'm only considering to study in Japan. If all things go south, i would just follow my original plan of applying to NUS life science/ NTU biological science. The thing is that I've been considering studying music composition since secondary school, and not to mention that JC has successfully killed my interest in the all subjects I take. Music is the only thing that doesn't constantly make me want to fling myself off the balcony. But then again, according to the lists of international students on the university websites, apparently there hasn't been any Singaporeans studying in Senzoku, and there is currently only 1 Singaporean studying music in Geidai graduate school, so I don't really know if I should even consider pursuing this route in the first place.

If you've managed to read till this far, thank you so so much!!! I'd really like to hear from you so please do consider leaving your thoughts.

macyychew,1590492251,gqv7no,10,1,"Let’s be real. People are breaking the rules and not giving a shit about this pandemic. I think we should shut down everything except for nutc, shengshiong etc. 

- what about the lower income family? How can they survive without any income? 
 The government can give them more money per month base on their income/ children they are looking for. I’ve seen a few documentaries base on the poor families in Singapore and many of them cannot apply for ( i don’t know what’s the word but it’s a organisation to help out the needy ) as they don’t meet the criteria. For example, they can earn $1.2k per month but they have to look after 6 kids and to apply for that, you need to be earning less than $1k. 


- what about buying groceries / whatever you need? 
You’ll get them online. The person delivering them will all get tested before they are able to work. Everyone will only be able to get a certain amount of item unless they got special 
permission from the government or something. Before lockdown, families who have no access to the internet will go to the nearest community Center to get help and they will do a background check making sure no one is taking advantage it to abuse the system. Maybe the start of every month they can state how many of what they need and it will be delivered to them. ( this might not work as they will need to hire a lot of people. Well this can be fixed if we take turns to order? Like the east will order this month while the west will be next month ) 

While everyone is staying home, a test kit will be given out to see if they have covid cause I heard some ppl don’t have symptoms. Not sure if there’s a kit right now but I remember someone saying there is one but it’s not 100% accurate but hey it’s better than 0%? Imagine how many lives we can save 

I hate cb but the government should not end the cb so early. I get how people want their jobs back and not feel like dying with their toxic family members but I feel like the covid 19 thing is gg to continue considering how many people are not taking it seriously.

Take note : I’m just a bored teen so please don’t bash me in the comments. There might be a few problems I’m missing out on so please let me know and maybe we can discuss it

Solid_Election,1590422985,gqdpry,20,1," Hello  all. I am a Chinese American currently living in the Bay Area. I am 42  years of age, am well educated with a bachelor from a highly ranked  university. I work in the field of real estate.

I  see the political and social situation in the US becoming very hostile  to Asian Americans in the next couple decades because of ongoing tensions with the PRC. This society is becoming  very toxic and increasingly dysfunctional. My family is of the Southeast  Asian Chinese diaspora and I would really like to consider relocating  to Singapore for the safety and mental health of my young child. My wife  is biracial, White/African American. My child is mixed race, how is  Singapore like for mixed race children?

I feel that the level of racism shown in Singapore is very low compared to most countries. In school, when there’s students that are mixed race I don’t see them get bullied for their race at all!

The US hates China because China is supplanting American dominance. And the thing is, China won\'t stop growing or rising just because the US says so. There are simply too many people in China, too many smart people and too much ambition. China will not stop rising.

Almost a year since I’ve been in this job and things are getting toxic really fast. Colleagues don’t seem to care about the patients, all they care about is the time they clock in and clock out. No one takes the initiative to help one another but they’re excellent at making the newbies do their work for them. Not to be racist but I find it rude when people talk in their own language and single the others out (whether it’s in mandarin, Malay or tagalog). 

They’re hypocrites cause it seems that they can do whatever they want but when it comes to some of us, they expect perfection in everything we do. People are passive aggressive and communication is a huge problem here. 

Miscommunication happens so often that it even got the wrong people fired. I can go on but it’s ironic how it’s a healthcare sector but no one seems to care about their colleague’s.

Lupical,1600158656,it4swn,111,1,"I live in a condominium with my mom, dad and aunt. No siblings.

Recently this year I have found out that my family is very toxic. All of them and I mean ALL, are sooo toxic.

My mother recently shouted very loudly at me because I was only resting for FIVE minutes and she said I will be a failure and even said “Then you’ll be sad when you fail”
I am a person that does not get angry, or sad easily, and all of their behaviors back them up

I softly replied “You don’t have to shout” to calm her down, yet she scolded me very angrily and even said “WOW, SO DISRESPECTFUL” even though whenever I have a fight with my dad or aunt she would advice me to say “Just tell them politely not to shout”

I am really angry, and this isn’t the first time she acted like the good guy. She is a narcissist, a hypocrite and a toxic person.

My parents fought almost everyday for very small reason ever since I was born, and I have learnt to bottle all my anger up.

When I explained to her that this was the exact response she told me to say she huffed and pretended I didnt say it. The problem with my mom is, whenever she knows she is in the wrong, she would “accept it” and in the future when I do something wrong she will suddenly bring it up

When I cried last time due to an argument with my aunt, she brought it up yesterday when I had an argument once again with her and said “Then you will cry”

I have faced numerous bullies in my life, but the biggest one is my mother. She never once said sorry to me, neither did my dad.

Because of this I have attempted to commit suicide twice, and I even tried to explain this to my “friends” but they made fun of it.

From what I experienced and heard, this kind of behaviour is mostly because of conservative and close-minded parents stuck in the previous generation where they think kids don't know anything(and thus a lack of humility towards their children) and mental health is just a joke. They probably might have gone through similar experiences as a kid and might think that what they are doing is normal. They fail to recognise the changes and priorities now compared to their time. But usually, as you get older and become an adult(like 20++) they will become more 'normal'(hopefully).\n\n Your best shot is trying to minimize interactions with them and create a strong support group(close friends who will be there for you) or just ways to rant and seek comfort(anonymous account online etc...).

Or making the ‘orrrrrhhh’ sound or ‘alright’? Something as short as possible to limit the interaction. \n\nOf course, bottling up is not good. You need to find an outlet to release these resentment (making an assumption here) you have. Be it exercising, going for a walk, cycling, gaming, eating, taking long showers.

According to the internet, narccisists are the kind of people who bring others down to make themselves feel better, so one possible way to just prevent all of it is to throw your pride away a bit and just let them hear what they want. I know it's not good and it's pretty much avoidance but I'm sure it's really really hard for you to be able to talk sense into them.

I generally don't talk to my patent about anything because she always finds a way to make it worse\n\n- find an excuse to stay outside of your house (eg, consults in school/ studying in school etc) But this isn't very easy esp with the COVID situation right now, but it still is one of my favourite ways to avoid all the scoldings affecting my mood and productivity \n\n\nI know it's really hard for you to voice out on this as filial piety is a huge thing in Asian countries. As a minor in Singapore, I also know there's definitely next to no way for you to just decide to move out (most ppl say to cut contact with narcissists, but it's unfortunately not very possible in Singapore if you're a minor and they're your parents) If you ever feel like ranting you could private message me or just post another rant, I'm sure everyone will be willing to help you out"", 'Hey hey welcome to the club!\n\nWe have:\n\n•Dad that wishes me for not to be his son but wished my cousin was me instead\n\n•Dad that plays victim in every arguement\n\n•Dad that will eventually use ""just move out"", ""my conscience is clear"" &amp; threaten disownment in every arguement.\n\n•Tryhard hokkien &amp; chinese vulgarities even tho our household is indonesian and no one speaks chinese.', 'Hi bro, it\'s sort of good that you realized the damage at age 13. I only realized the toxicity of my parents when I was 17-18. \n\nEvery thing I\'d like to try, my parents would criticize, tell me about the negative side of that thing. Whenever i sound out my ambitions, same thing. I\'d be criticized and scoffed at. That\'s when i learned that not every move i make has to be known by everyone. \n\nEvery little mistake i make will be followed with a groan by my parents, making it seem like they\'re very disappointed in me. My mother would prefer to be passive aggressive in her words sometimes when something\'s not right in the house like in the kitchen. It\'s not much her voice but more to her sharp words, criticizing me, bringing up all the negative things she sees in me. \n\nThen it hit me that they\'re really negative, and that\'s how they were brought up. They don\'t know how to stop and change their ways. My mother actually got way way better after she started learning a bit more about islam..Last time was worse when she got very physical. In fact i have social anxiety and confidence issues due to the way my parents dealt with my weaknesses as a child. But it is my fault if I don\'t improve myself and get rid of the anxiety and increase my confidence. \n\nOne thing you have to understand, or what i understood, is that my parents still love me even though they don\'t say it. I can see this when they ask me if I\'ve eaten, offering me to eat, when they speak to me etc. it\'s in the little things la basically. \n\nThey work their ass of everyday so i can play my Minecraft with my brothers, and watch TV, and use water heater, and cook, and enjoy the lights and wash my clothes, without ever stopping just because they\'d want to. They\'re not selfish and i can see partly they work because of their children.\n\nIn islam we are told to be respectful and kind as well as humble towards our parents no matter what they do. Do your best to make them happy. No sane parent would actually hate their child. Sometimes I\'d look at my baby pictures and see my parents caring for me. Especially this one photo where i was sleeping on top of my dad\'s chest, causing him to accidentally sleep there too.\n\nIt\'s a sad truth but sometimes you can\'t even tell your friends of your family issues. Also side note, check for toxic friends. Your friends cant do anything but advise you and listen. They can\'t actually fix the issue themselves. \n\nYou\'ve a long way to go in life and know that it\'s not bound to just your family. If you\'re the one ""causing"" your parents to shout and stuff, you\'ll one day be more mature and have a more ""zen"" approach in life. Just chill2, like me right now haha. \n\nFor example when my mom always brings up issues like ""i cook but never finish"", i never talk about anything related to food anymore (I\'m still fat, so not malnourished). Or ""Room is a mess"", i clean my room. Sometimes try to put her screaming aside and actually listen to what she\'s saying. If the cause of her screaming is due to what you\'re saying, the solution is to not say the thing\'s that\'ll trigger her. It actually helps but now i sort of speak less with my mother and choose my words very carefully. I realized that if i were to give her the silent treatment, things would get way way worse. I still joke around sometimes, trying to make her laugh. Psychological wise, people respect those who speak less and choose their words properly. \n\n\nAll in all, a very good advice I\'d give is to ""show"" your family that you\'ve matured without trying. Clean your room, find a hobby, work, speak carefully, assist the house however you can and so on. Think about it, would your mom scream and nag a 30-40 year old man the way she screams at you? It\'s because that person is mature and has other things to worry about in life than her nagging and scolding.\n\n\nAlso one tip i found on the net. List down one by one all the things you\'re grateful for. Like things you\'ll miss if they\'re not there. Water heater, wifi, condo (lucky you get to stay in condo. I sleep on couch and no swimming pool u know), air con, nice food and keep writing till you smile.\n\nNot sure if this one will help, but pick a time, lie down in bed and close your eyes. Then picture yourself waking up one day, and your whole family is gone. Your mom\'s not cooking, your dad\'s not watching TV, your siblings not coming into your room. No more family laughters or outings. No more jokes with family. I\'ve a friend who left his house, situation a tad bit worse than yours. Mom didn\'t even want him anymore (disowned). He\'s now homeless at 20, house hopping at friends house and works minimum wage part time job. Thinking of him makes me grateful for my current situation no matter how bad it gets\n\nHope this helps.', 'replying with ""ok"" and ""sorry"" for me is not a very good idea. I keep quiet while trying not to seem like I\'m ignoring them, cause if they see that I\'m ignoring them, they\'ll get even more pissed off..\n\nI totally agree with the being mentally strong stuff. Obviously everyone becomes mature and mentally strong in different ways, but I\'ve become a mentally stronger person and learned to not really give a damn about what other people think of me (of course doesn\'t mean i need to be a slob and an ""asshole"" to others)\n\nBut it comes with side effect though.

Imagine an adult doing that?), when I buy something for myself no one is gonna scold me for wasting money, someone to praise me for things I do even if it is small like remembering to turn off the lights.

Putting my nerd brain aside, you can alternatively head to your nearest FSC (Family Service Centre) to seek for help. FSC provides an abundance of support ranging from financial to homelessness to toxic family relationships! They also provide counselling and will be able to refer you to external help if needed. They will be more than willing to help you through your toughest time and are really really nice people, best of all it’s *almost always*  FOC!

1. Colleague (now ex-colleague) got fired for simply for spreading negativity

Colleague was very vocal that the company was not honest and transparent as a business start-up. For example, whenever there are negative customer feedback on their social media pages, the company will simply hide or remove all negative comments. They also do false marketing - saying product X is from country A but it's actually from country B.

Someone else in the company eventually feedback to higher management. That colleague was branded as the 'bad seed' and was forced to resign. 

2. Repressive work culture

After colleague was fired, it was as if nothing had happened. The department head did not address the sudden absence or explain to the team what happened. We had to find out ourselves through gossips and from the colleague who got fired. Heard from that ex-colleague that the company will simply fire the next 'bad seed' if it ever happens again.

3. Romantic relationships in the office

The boss's S/O works in the company too and often comes late to work and plays game out in the open during office hours. Is this even appropriate? Have to certainly watch your mouth since u risk losing your job if u say the wrong thing (and you will get snitched).

I was also really thinking if I should just quit and I was feeling really depressed about my situation. (Very) Luckily, I found a job and left that company.\n\nBut I would want to share my thoughts on why you should find the next job before quitting.\n\n**Money**\n\nAs a few commentators have stated, work is for money which is not wrong. However, ask yourself this, do you have enough money to last you through the time of unemployment till you find a new job? I would say you would need sufficient savings for 6 months' worth of expenses if you want to quit without a job. It will be worse if you have a family to feed and you are the sole breadwinner. To be honest, in Singapore, you won't starve one as long as you are willing to take jobs like grab driver, food delivery or even go sell bubble tea, It comes down to willingness only.\n\nWhy 6 months at least? Cause it's really hard to get a new job at this timing. \n\n**Current Job Market**\n\nThe job market during COVID 19 is super competitive. You are facing people who are thinking of quitting + Fresh Grads + retrenched job seekers from renowned companies (AirBnb, SIA etc). If you want to quit without a job, make sure that your portfolio will be as impressive as renowned companies. My advice, send out a few resumes to job markets and see how many get back to you. From there, you can assess the job market receptiveness to your portfolio.\n\n**Lastly, what really matters to you at work?**\n\nI asked myself this question to assess what keeps me at my previous workplace. It was not the work as the work doesn't give me satisfaction and definitely not the management. Therefore, I am really not attached to my work. I was glad that you actually like what you do and learning things there cause I do know quite a few people who hates what they are currently doing in their work.\n\nTo be honest, every workplace has its politics and toxicity but ultimately, they are just NOISES and nothing more. I would say it will be more on how you manage yourself in this toxic environment and excel in it. (what doesn't kills you makes you stronger right?) Cause if you are in a much less toxic environment in your next job, it will be easier for you to stand out too.\n\nI hope the advice above helps and I will still advise you to pay less attention to your colleagues and find a job first before quitting.  I preserved till I got my current job and I never regretted staying till I found one.  :)"", ""Definitely leave the job, as it sounds like a horrible place to be.

Based on the limited info that you\'ve shared, I\'ll share my perspective here. Hope this allows you to be more circumspect in the future.\n\n**1. Colleague (now ex-colleague) got fired for simply spreading negativity**\n\nRunning a company, whether big or small, is not easy. When values between an employee and the company don\'t match, it will not be a long bond. I\'m not advocating that what your company did regarding deleting or hiding bad reviews, or false advertising, is correct. Neither am I saying they are wrong. (Idk what exactly did they do) The fact is this is an SME and this is their way of doing business and ensuring survivability. They could be learning along the way too. But from a management\'s perspective, they need to stay \'alive\' to amend and learn and grow. Just like how we all fell down when we were kids just to learn how to walk, then run. Don\'t be too critical at the onset until you have full perspective.\n\nWhich brings me to the next point, you only have the perspective of your ex-colleague and the rumours going around. Please don\'t let this form your only world view. Until you hear from the company\'s management or HR, you have to remember what you think you are seeing as a whole, is only a part of.  ""Forced to resigned"", or fired? These are too different notions. A job is a contract between 2 willing entities. If your ex-colleague was not sorry for what he did, his values just didn\'t match and he left. If he understood what he did was wrong, then how did the company forced him?  Company rumours usually aim to lower everyone\'s morale for the rumour spreader to garner his own cause (which at this moment, we don\'t know what that is). There could be so many more permutations to this story. Always examine at least 6 angles to a situation before forming judgement.\n\n**2. Repressive work culture**\n\nAs above, how was this repressive?\n\nIt could be a genuine situation that the ex-colleague quit and management felt no need to address this issue. People quit their jobs for various reasons all the time.\n\n""Bad seed"" is just a  wet-market term for employees whose views are not aligned with the company\'s vision/ mission. Elevate your perspective and don\'t view it negatively. Not everyone in the world sees things the same way.\n\n**3. Romantic relationships in the office**\n\nHow is this bad? Especially to you?\n\nConsider other similar scenarios: What if it was Boss\' elderly mother who only comes in a couple of hours each day? Would you be more sympathetic? What if SO was not getting paid? What if SO still has to discuss work matters with your boss\' late into the night (because work never ends in a start-up) while you are already off work and relaxing, spending time with your own SO?  What if SO has other skill-sets that helps your boss that you are not aware of?\n\nRemember that your view of the situation is not a whole. It is only a slice.\n\nOn whether you should stay, my advice would be - depends on whether your view of the company changes. If you are adamant that the boss and company is evil, has no morals and has values significantly different from yours too - then go (after you find a job, as advised by many in this chat. Since money is important.) However, if you can look beyond what you currently see and is interested in finding out the truth of matters, then befriend higher management and move forth padawan! The world is much more fascinating if you give it a chance to surprise you.', 'Thank you for taking the time to share your pov!!

My old ikea non stick pan is spoilt and I haven’t decided what to replace it with. Recently read up about toxic non stick pans and other alternatives like stainless steel and cast iron. 

I’m leaning more towards another non stick + stainless steel. I haven’t been able to find good reviews on any specific pans. I recently saw this Korean brand - Modori which seemed q nice but got some bad reviews also...

Anyone here can recommend any stainless steel/ non stick pots/pans and where to buy? Greatly appreciated!! :)

jujuonthebeat99,1598925765,ikbltv,38,1,"Hi, i just ord not too long ago and i will be studying in Poly. Ok so my mother and grandma(Dad's side) hasn't been on good terms for more than 20 years.  When my mum gave birth to me, my family had a maid and she shared the same room with my grandma. My grandma couldn't handle the sight of seeing how well my mum treated a stranger compared to her so she left the house. When my maid officially left, my grandma came back to the house and live with us again. This is probably the main reason why the tension begin. Another reason could be my mum not willing to live with my grandma(?) My dad always argues with my mum because of how badly my mum treated her and always scolding her over the smallest things. This has been happening ever since i was born fyi. My mum is the breadwinner of the house, working 5 days a week and does the housework on weekends. My father business has been doing badly ever since a decade ago. Since then, he doesn't work and always stays at home singing karaoke while my mum is working. So my mum and dad hasn't been on talking terms for 2 weeks because they fought. Recently, they fought again because my grandma bought a new kettle. The old kettle has some minor issues but still functional. Yes over a bloody kettle....so my mum scolded her. I stand up for my grandma and scolded my mum. My mum jumped to the conclusion where she thinks i side my dad and ask me to move out with him. Seriously though, i stand up for my grandma because she is 82 years old and i find this to be bullying. I fought with my mum everytime whenever i try standing up for my grandma. My mum also gets impatient whenever my grandma ask her like ""Can i cook dinner?"" or ""Do you want to drink some soup?"". My grandma honestly does alot of household chores like laundry, go downstairs to buy food for my brothers &amp; i and many other things. On weekends, my grandma will go out of the house to give my mum space. There are times where i see my grandma alone in the park just staring at empty space. Whenever my mum comes home from work, my grandma will go to her room and sits on her bed quietly till she sleeps. Its really saddening to see an elderly living her life like this. Sometimes she can be seen looking at pictures decades ago which honestly breaks my heart even more. My mum never once give a shit about what my grandma done and start picking on her over the smallest things. Both my brothers never really appreciate my grandma and find her to be annoying sometimes.  I ain't close with them either and my second brother would randomly flare up, calls me good for nothing and hopeless because i am not good in academics. I am ok with my eldest brother but we don't talk alot. My mum is really a good mother by supporting us. I really just can't stand the way she treats my grandma.  As for my dad, he don't contribute anything to the family. I am in a situations where i can't feel like this is a family. My mum and dad has been considering divorce for years but they are staying for the sake of this ""family"". As much i want to side one of them, i don't have an apparent reason to do so. I simply stand up for what seems wrong. If there is a situation where my grandma ill treat my mum. I will definitely stand up for her. There are thoughts where i really wanna move out from the house but i am only 21 and the youngest. I sleep on the couch because i don't have a room myself despite living in a 5 room flat. The only time i felt peace and positivity was during NS where i had a bed and being away from home. I am really mentally drained and might have a breakdown anytime soon.

I went to boarding school and then university and such. I'd suggest you pick yourself up and get out of there. What are your plans currently ? think about it. Think about what you really want.

He has been in low morale ever since, for a businessman to have lost everything he has sacrificed for: time away from kids ,wife , silently suffering the days where theres low profit, anxiety , loneliness. \n\nIt hits a man hard. Hits the family hard. \n\nIm guessing your dad is trying to recover from this trauma. Help him out a little , go out for suppers , drinks. Men don\'t grow up, so they do enjoy what we enjoy too. Then bounce some ideas off him and spark his passion again. Thats what i would do. But when i came to realise it , it was too late , my dads too tired and old to want to do anything now. He just wants to chill . \n\nYour mom probably has it hard at work. Probably stressed everyday. When she comes home she just wants time alone. Quietly. But its never gonna be quiet and items and systems will never be in place because theres a ""stranger"" in the house. She doesnt have the mental capacity to even begin understanding your grandma. Just look at all the ""terrible bosses/ toxic work culture"" posts in the recent times and you get a taste of what it could probably be like. \n\nSo here\'s where it breaks down. \n\nYour grandma just trying to be nice but your mom cannot begin to put herself in gma\'s shoes cos shes so tired. I mean she feels like shes carrying everything.

Im thinking he finds it hard to speak with her. \n\nYour dad seems to be in the pits. Im just guessing this now since not as much has been written about him. \n\nYou and your brothers are probably in the best position. Your mom won\'t pick on you like she does your grandma and dad. So bring her out and separate her. Even if its just a meal. It helps. \n\nYour dad well, men don\'t express as much unless they feel they can. So go drinking , have a beer or two , talk nonsense. Things naturally will open up eventually. \n\nGrandma needs someone to speak to. In old age everything deteriorates fast. Especially in this scenario. Its alot to handle being the victim of the house but at the same time trying to understand your son and daughter in law. Also that gap in age doesn\'t help.\n\nSo thats what i would do. Then see how it works out before thinking about whats next. If you  instead choose escape the situation like moving out or what not. Theres a massive risk that what you see now will breed into something worse in the future.', 'This is probably the right way.

To me, a family is a group of people (often related by blood or marriage) willing **to coexist** together. \n\nBe it grandma at fault or mom at fault, your dad will always be the one in the middle. It is up to your dad and  mom to decide how this family will coexist. If no consensus can be reached, divorce isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If living apart means both parties can live happier, why not? Whether it’s divorce or getting grandma to live elsewhere, same reasoning.\n\nI have no clue what I’m trying to say, just stuff that’s off the top of my head.\n\nAt the ends of the day, their marriage, their decision. Divorce does not necessarily mean a disintegration or a family (again, depending on your values). The responsibility is not yours, you are not obligated to feel sorry or guilty.', 'Hello, I have had similar experiences myself. I was always the middle person preventing fights and standing up for either one of them. I never picked sides but everyone misunderstood and thought I was with the other and started emotionally blackmailing me. Didn’t help that they decided to live together “for the kids” after a fierce divorce either. I’m suffering the after effects of all that simply because I decided to intervene whereas my sister was not affected in the way that I was (she just became apathetic). I don’t see how the situation could be helped and I don’t see how your situation can be solved either. Sorry if it sounds too harsh. If you continue intervening this way, it’ll do nothing and cause you more trauma and pain. \n\n\nThe “other” side is always the villain in the other side’s eyes and they’ll never change unless the circumstances change. The others who commented that you should relieve your grandma’s suffering or your dad/mom’s stress by getting them away from the house though? I think it’s the only thing that may work. You’ll need a lot of emotional capacity for this and I’m so sorry that your brothers are like this. They probably unknowingly tuned out their sympathy/empathy from the stress or simply do not have the maturity to realise this needs to be fixed and it’s not just an annoyance. You could try to have a heart-to-heart talk with them if possible. It may not work. \n\n\nI hope that you’ll monitor your mental health alongside all this and know when to step away. Sometimes, things are just a certain way and there’s nothing we can do but help make someone feel a little better. If you do decide to abandon everything, it’s not your fault either. You never chose this situation.', 'Hey there, coming from a dysfunctional family whose parents once tried to stab each other.\n\nThere are some really useful advice provided, wish I have known this a lot sooner. Adding my 2 cents worth:\n\n- Family: it may be easier to break the ice with more “effort” to be seen in building relationships or contributing to the family. It is not purely about doing things. It is about slowly making the family know that you are doing things (without you telling them).\n\n- Allies: You wont be able to change the world alone. So enlist the help of your family. Delegate tasks to others, propose ideas and let others be responsible. This will help to amplify the impact you are making, and at the same time allowing others to be involved as well. You are just human, and will need help.\n\n- OP: Please remember that you are the most important person to you. You will not be able to do much if you are burned out, frustrated, or all in all not functional. As such, please take care of your own emotional &amp; mental health.  Take time to relax, know that you are doing your best. With that, even though it is uphill, you will have the strength to go through.\n\n\nThat’s what I did to survive. So take care and know that you are a filial son wanting to stand up for your grandma and to make a difference. Reach out if you need help, and Jia you!', 'Hi hi! Hope you are feeling better. Just know that your situation isn’t that unique (and therefore you might not be alone in facing such familial issues) and things will get better as you become older.\n\n1. It’s not for you to ‘figure everything out’. So if you feel tired and don’t want to think too much it’s okay. The people here on reddit can give advice, but you have to steel yourself because you are in important years of forming your identity for the rest of your life.\n\n2. Whatever you do, don’t get bitter. It’s okay to get angry/frustrated/tired, but don’t let it corrupt your spirit. I’m an auntie and I would like to tell this because I know from experience when you become bitter, unfortunately good people might stay away because they might not understand your back story. Get help, but don’t get bitter.\n\n3. I highly suggest you start looking for SAFE accommodations be it with relatives or perhaps if you are able to get into University hostel etc. then visit your gran on weekends where she is the most vulnerable as your mum is not working. I was the opposite of you. My grandma was abusing me on a daily basis. I regret not moving out earlier, thinking I can’t do it. \n\n4. Your dad might feel helpless also as he is not the one earning money. Rope him in for help as he might still feel tender towards your grandma.\n\nRope in your elder brother’s help. I know he doesn’t talk to you much, but sounds like he might be reasonable. Let him know your concerns Eg grandma staring into space during what is supposedly her golden years. He might not be as unreasonable as your second brother.\n\n5. If you feel you cannot take it, try to make new friends. Be it church, or hobby group etc. there are many adults who are willing to help.

Whatever your parents decide to do with their marriage, however your mother treats you grandmother, none of it is your responsibility. You just have to accept whatever is happening and find ways to make the best out of whatever you can.\n\nThe most pragmatic advice I can give you is: focus on yourself. If you can't take care of yourself, there's no way you can even try to take care of the situation you have at home. Do what you can within your means if you wish to improve your family situation, but do not go to the point of exhaustion.

jujuonthebeat99,1598925301,ikbhct,0,1,"Hi, i just ord not too long ago and i will be studying in Poly. Ok so my mother and grandma(Dad's side) hasn't been on good terms for more than 20 years.  When my mum gave birth to me, my family had a maid and she shared the same room with my grandma. My grandma couldn't handle the sight of seeing how well my mum treated a stranger compared to her so she left the house. When my maid officially left, my grandma came back to the house and live with us again. This is probably the main reason why the tension begin. Another reason could be my mum not willing to live with my grandma(?) My dad always argues with my mum because of how badly my mum treated her and always scolding her over the smallest things. This has been happening ever since i was born fyi. My mum is the breadwinner of the house, working 5 days a week and does the housework on weekends. My father business has been doing badly ever since a decade ago. Since then, he doesn't work and always stays at home singing karaoke while my mum is working. So my mum and dad hasn't been on talking terms for 2 weeks because they fought. Recently, they fought again because my grandma bought a new kettle. The old kettle has some minor issues but still functional. Yes over a bloody kettle....so my mum scolded her. I stand up for my grandma and scolded my mum. My mum jumped to the conclusion where she thinks i side my dad and ask me to move out with him. Seriously though, i stand up for my grandma because she is 82 years old and i find this to be bullying. I fought with my mum everytime whenever i try standing up for my grandma. My mum also gets impatient whenever my grandma ask her like ""Can i cook dinner?"" or ""Do you want to drink some soup?"". My grandma honestly do alot of household chores like laundry, go downstairs to buy food for my brothers &amp; i and many other things. My grandma will go out of the house on weekends to give my mum space. There are times where i see my grandma alone in the park just staring at the empty space. Whenever my mum comes back home from work, my grandma will go to her room and sit on her bed quietly. Its really saddening to see an elderly living her life like this. Sometimes she can seen looking at pictures decades ago which honesly breaks my heart even more. My mum never once give a shit about what my grandma done and start picking on her over the smallest things. Both my brothers never really appreciate my grandma and find her to be annoying sometimes.  I ain't close with them either and my second brother would randomly flare up, calls me good for nothing and hopeless because i am not good in academics. I am ok with my eldest brother but we don't talk alot. My mum is really a good mother by supporting us. I really just can't stand the way she treats my grandma.  As for my dad, he don't contribute anything to the family. I am in a situations where i can't feel like this is a family. My mum and dad has been considering divorce for years but they are staying for the sake of this ""family"". As much i want to side one of them, i don't have an apparent reason to do so. I simply stand up for what seems wrong. If there is a situation where my grandma ill treat my mum. I will definitely stand up for her. There are thoughts where i really wanna move out from the house but i am only 21. I sleep on the couch because i don't have a room myself despite living in a 5 room flat. The only time i felt peace and positivity was during NS where i had a bed and being away from home. I am really mentally drained and might have a breakdown anytime soon.

This job is definitely not recommended no matter how starved/broke you are, my colleagues are either divorced/ on the verge of it or always in constant argument with their loved ones. Pay is low , commission is slow. Payraise never happened to anyone except the only favorite staff. If you don't OT till 9pm everyday , you basically suck. Any lesser OT than that is not recognised. 

Been working extra hard through cb and now my boss says "" you didnt do much "" in a 1-1 session. 

It was the final straw and I talked back proving all the work I have put in , cornered her words and excuses till she was forced to change topic. She was forced to admit her wrongs along the way as well. 

Im a nice guy, but if things just go too far, I have my way with words enough to break a person. 

That's what happened. She almost broke, but held it in infront of me( I know because she started off in a bully tone and ended the meeting in lowlife tone) . Which means I guess I have a ticking time bomb on this job. 

Ive been looking for a job since before CB and im guessing its mostly because of my 2 months notice period that is causing hirers to look the other way. Since theres so many applications this year anyway. 

Should I leave and serve the notice so I can have higher chances at other jobs?

It was that bad. And you shouldn’t trivialise whatever you’re feeling - it’s definitely not acceptable. \n\nThere was a company I worked in where my manager made me pay FINES whenever I made a mistake. For instance, the excel sheet is not formatted in her ideal way. ($2 per mistake). I dreaded work like crazy - one day I resigned and I told the HR about the fines. HR was shocked, but obviously since I’m leaving they couldn’t care less. It doesn’t matter that they didn’t do anything about it - the culture is effed up.

Good job man, it’s really good to be as flexible as you can now\n\n- Take up a couple of part time jobs\nie. cafes, promoters, ntuc, scan temperature to get some extra income. It won’t be a lot but it’ll keep you sane esp if you have parents like mine who cannot accept you being jobless (you’ll feel so frustrated that you’d want to move out - DONT MOVE OUT: rental debt is another issue altogether) \n\n- Take up a relevant skill or course on the side to beef up your resume\nThis can seem like you left your job to do a course for a few months rather than leaving your job for nothing - which can put a mark on your resume) - if you’re Singaporean, use your skillsfuture credits \n\n- Consider freelance work \nI am a freelance writer, graphics designer and web designer to fall back on if I need extra income - the profit I earn is not substantial enough to feed me monthly like my regular job would, but it’s nice to have some cash coming in on an ad-hoc basis\n\n- Start an online fail-proof business\nOk, not all businesses are fail-proof but perhaps if there was something you have been wanted to do a Long time now but haven’t had the chance to, it might be a good time to try if you can spare some cash and time investment on it\n\n- Seek help \nInternally: Not sure if I missed it, but you might want to seek help from HR or your welfare team. If that doesn’t work, how about changing departments? \nExternally: Talk to friends, take breaks regularly, try to focus on what really matters to you, go out &amp; enjoy your life\n\nAs to whether you should stay on and serve the notice, it seems like you already have the answer. If it’s me, I would serve the notice as I would want the extra month of salary. Another thing you can consider is negotiating the notice period (if they’re open to it).\n\nThis workplace seems like a truly toxic company. If you don’t OT after 9pm it’s not OT? Well.... all these people in the company don’t have a life. I don’t know how old you are, but regardless of your age, you have a whole life ahead of you. \n\nTREASURE IT. Because this time of your life will never come back again. Good luck, OP. Stay strong 💪🏻 you’re not alone!\n\nFYI: I’ve also quitted a company without a job (that was years ago, I ended up jobless for almost a year but... if you have your family’s support &amp; some money to tide you over - you can always pick yourself up again).', ""Hey, thanks for the advice and sharing!\n\nI've got a part time job in the past couple of months and I've tried several modes of online businesses before (FB live stream , blogshop , carousell ) , though it profited I eventually closed it due to lack of time and experience to take it to the next level.

I assume this chain of events really was the breaking point for her and asked me if I knew some place that was high(red flag yes). Fortunately she didnt do the deed but she is breaking up with her BF ( reason was cause she didnt want him to get involve), making bad decisions over all etc.

I told her that she had to speak out but she didnt want to. (maybe  due to previous incident and the beating she will recieve.) Is there anything I can do that will help intervene.

I hope it's not arrogant to say I look okay and am of healthy weight (though current beauty standards will probably call me fat anyway). Insecurities about my appearance aside, I'm generally quite approachable. I make friends with men quite easily and have been asked out (by undoubtedly toxic men before) but with the guy friends I actually like, I always reach that cliff where a guy will hint at wanting more, then chicken out at the last minute. It's happened so many times across the years I'm so frustrated. I feel like there's something I'm doing wrong or some cultural taboo I'm committing. I'm too embarrassed to ask my friends and my family is useless as they are the strict, conservative type. 

I'm quite bad at distinguishing when a guy is joking about liking me (and it happens a frustrating lot of times 🙃) so for them to get annoyed with me for missing signals is their own fault. (Also when I was younger, I was the prime target for the ""ehhhh so and so like you LOL"" pranks so it's quite unpleasant also). Again, I hope I don't sound arrogant, but I'm blessed (pr cursed) with feminine curves so I get the wrong kind of attention too, and it has given me grief in the form of guys somehow associating my body with me being promiscuous and being happy to have one night stands.

Every game i played i'd 80% say 80% of my team (pubs) are toxic or sexist. Somehow, me being a girl means i HAVE to play support. Somehow me being a non male means I AUTOMATICALLY SUCK 

My experience when i use mic

**Overwatch:**

- ""Ure a girl play mercy"" 

- ""Ur dps suck go play support like every girl"" 

- I will carry you every game if you give me your instagram/snapchat/(insert social media name)

- I get trashed talk when i pick ANYONE that's not support, even before the game starts im AUTOMATICALLY SHIT BC IM A NON FUCKING MALE

**Apex Legends: (copy pasting from my other post)**

- Duos leaving the game once they hear mic, female voice. mostly it's ""(grunt/sigh sound) we're matched with a girl, let's just go next"" 

- 1st one to be down (dead) out of the team in a fight, got  flamed for not picking someone like lifeline or loba to support them 

- (this is a funny one) When i was newer (few weeks) to the game, i found a golden evo once and mic-ed just to ask why didnt it have a number to upgrade to red evo. i got asked to stfu because he said i'm only attention seeking for simps to carry me (lol) 

- Got trashtalked for not wanting to provide them with my social media 

- Got asked to ""just follow us don't shoot unless i ask you to"" because apparently, and i quote: ""u're a girl and girls are bad when it comes to shooting games generally"" 

- Got a golden havoc once (best gun don't @ me) at a high tier loot area and got shouted to drop it because girls dont deserve it???????  i didn't and he disconnected straightaway haha

**League of Legends:** (Mostly on ingame text chat or with vc over people that added me) 

- ""Which support do you play? Soraka?"" 

- Give me your (insert social media name) 

- I can carry you if you give me your (insert social media name) 

- Every time i feed, i get trashed for not my skills but BEING A FEMALE. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO Y'ALL FEMALES CAN'T PLAY OR DO WELL IN GAMES AT ALL.

I started playing league when I was 11, and I really loved leaguing from the bottom of my heart. I met many people through the game and one of which is my bf. I met him when i was 14, and we started dating when we were 15. It wasn\'t him that got me into the game - when I was 14, he was barely level 20. You know league used to be capped at level 30. Then, he played a lot more than me, and spammed games to the point where he has multiple accounts at plat - diamond. It came to a point where he can wake up, play league the entire day, sleep, rinse and repeat. And obviously as his gf I was obliged to play with him.\n\nThere were many other things I wanted to do - things in real life. But I couldn\'t. I wanted to play with my other friends, but I couldn\'t. It became so toxic because he would guilt trip me and keep being like ""okay lor sua then i play alone"". Otherwise he will persistently ask me non-stop for more than 10 times (with no sarcasm added) to play with him league. If I play with my other friends he would get upset.\n\n\n Furthermore, what irritates me even more is that he would ONLY play ranked. Well, I don\'t mind playing ranked, but I mind playing ranked with HIM. Because when he plays with me it\'s gold, it\'s ""low-elo"" he would troll and feed because ""our team is so bad they dont deserve to win"" or ""hahaha it\'s just for fun, very easy climb back up one"". He would run it down in my games in a ALL LANES WINNING GAME. (We lost btw, our team was like 17 kills to 4 on the other team, i still don\'t understand how i lose games that i was clearly hardwinning.) \n\nThen he doesn\'t main AD (I main AD!) and he forces me into a support role. Then because we have no synergy bc no communication then he just goes like ""lol you can\'t play support as well"". He has basically named every single champ i played before and said i can\'t play it. I might as well never touch league ever again since i can play 0 champs. My provis was 1 W 4L when i played with him. Guess what, when I was playing without him, it became 6W 4L. Funny isn\'t it. I became a 60% winrate. I finally had the time and ability to climb to plat. But he got upset that I was playing without him. Then after playing with him my winrate is once again it\'s below 50% (probably at like 40% lmfao), i gain from like 25 LP per game to 14 LP per game at gold IV it\'s pathetic. I don\'t even want to league anymore because it\'s too hard to climb. He felt bad and offered to play my account - that upset me even more. So in his thoughts he can just fuck my acc\'s elo just because he can play it and boost it whenever he wants? Does he even care for my feelings as a girl? I\'m in uni rn with not much time to play.

coldpalecheeks,1603870050,jjjdn6,63,1,"I actually have been considering quitting my job before the pandemic, but I thought I should just suck it up to what is the supposedly ""working environment"". However after working for about 1 year plus, my anxiety level has increased drastically and I even have slight panic attacks when I hear my work laptop alarm ring. As common as it may seem, my superior is very toxic towards me (I know it happens all the time that is why I sucked it up even though I realised this 3 months after I started working). I didn't like my job because I was ""lured"" into it due to its vague jobscope (partly my error but I just graduated thus I thought if I can land in a job, it's already good enough) and I'm doing something that is not even something I enjoy, which is IT. I'm actually not stressed over my workload because tbvh my workload is not heavy. But within the things that I need to do, I am always picked on and reprimanded as if I can't do small things right and I feel very very very worthless in the company. I stopped learning new things within few months after I entered the company, and I even sometimes do nothing at work because I am too ""new"" to handle those work. When I request for more work, I am always rejected and will be told that if there is any work, it will be assigned to me. In more than a year, I can say (feeling so embarrassed) that everyday, I only do work for maybe 2 to 3 hours. It seems like a luxury, that's what everyone is telling me. I do the minimum but yet I can earn proper salary. But this is causing me to have so much anxiety especially when my supervisor pick on me saying things like: you only have these things to do. I followed EXACTLY what my supervisor said for the work to be done, but in turn she said she didn't, which makes 1 hour work become 3 days of work. This is just one example, there are more, but basically I faced anxiety on a daily basis like mentioned previously and any work alarm triggers my panic attacks. As this is my first job, I very new and I really want to learn more and add values. In my current company, I can say that I contribute zero. Okay maybe 0.5, I shall give myself some credit. On top of that, I have zero employment benefits from the company even though it is a big one as I was signed through an agency. No bonus (talking about before pandemic, but obviously now still don't have any), whatever you name, I don't have them, except for basics like annual leave medical leave etc, but all the bare minimum. I feel I'm actually way better if I find somewhere else with lower salary but with slightly more benefits. 

I won't say I exactly have a lot of savings because I have school loan to pay.  If I really quit my job, I am planning to take up part time jobs such as tutoring, transcribing, or whatsoever event based job. If not, I will take some short term contract jobs in hospitals etc. I plan to quit not to rest, but just to stay away for the toxicity in the current company. I'm very lucky to be a Singaporean, as well as living with my parents. My only commitment in terms of money is my loan and phone bills. If I am jobless with no income, I have savings that can pay off my debt for at least 4 months. I am also lucky enough to still have this job, I know that. But I feel like I'm suffering and I cry every time I talk about work, especially what I do at work. 

I know it won't be easy to quit my current job before getting another offer, but I realised I was not consistent with finding job due to my mental health and I basically start to become less productive. I have insomnia, and my hair falls like mad, till the point when people see me, they ask if I've been dropping lots of hair. My appetite became weird, like I ate quite a bit but I lost weight. I'm so confused about what I should do. Any advice is greatly appreciated!

Like what you wrote, you have no commitment so you could save up first as much as you can to pay your necessities for a few months. You can take a rest a month or so before going to the next job. I think most companies would most likely turn a blind eye if there's a period of unemployment during this time since it's hard to get a job in this pandemic.\n\nYour mental health is important. Don't try to 'tank' this company beyond what is really need. If you need about 1-2 months of work before you can have enough savings to rest for 3 months then work and then resign once your target is reach. Your workplace sounds toxic AF and the longer you stay, the longer you will suffer. \n\nI was in a similar situation. I 'tanked' about 2 years in the company. The boss was passive aggrasive and overly sarcastic. Spies are planted everywhere so you don't even know who you can trust. Colleagues were overly aggressive. They would shout and fuck you in public over the most smallest things. I was so stressed that my chest hurts constantly when I think about work. I would get panic attacks when I get a message notification. My mood was shitty and I had anxiety. The tipping point was when one of my 'colleagues' started shouting and screaming and threatened physical harm because of a supposedly wrong doing. \n\nI'm now in a different workplace. It's been a few months since I left. People are very nice here. But I still have the sense of paranoia and anxiety. Everytime I ask my superior something, if they were to reply in a different tone or with one word I would start to overthink and get panic attacks. Always anticipating the moment I will get fucked by my superior. Sometimes I will revert to old mannerisms like apologizing more than needed or telling more information than needed.\n\nSo OP, I advise that you look into quiting the company as soon as you are ready and to save some money and take a mental break.

I feel like I’m in the same shoes as you right now. For obvious reasons, I can’t tell you what company I’m working for but it’s a huge one. I landed the job in the middle of a pandemic and I’m actually pretty young so I thought I hit the jackpot. Now I’m struggling because I realised it’s just not for me, I’m not passionate about it and it’s too mundane for my liking. Between juggling my job and Uni, along with some family issues, I have breakdowns really often. I still stayed because I felt really ungrateful for resenting my job. A job that people would literally kill for in this period of time. But I really couldn’t take it anymore so I’m in the midst of leaving the company. In conclusion, always prioritise yourself over anything. Mental health is extremely important and I think you owe yourself your last bit of sanity.', ""Hey I think you should quit!

toystorycat,1601975728,j61wvu,65,1,"It's really hard for me to say this or share with anyone .. 
But I honestly feel trapped....

You see, I was raised in a lower income family (but it didn't used to be that way). Before I was born, my dad made $5-6k/month back in 1980s which was considered a lot and my mom was making decent as well. They both only have secondary school qualifications. I have 2 older brothers and I'm the youngest. My family lived in a maisonnette but shortly after I was born in 90s, my dad declared bankruptcy and had to mortgage the house and downgrade to a 5room flat (with outstanding housing loan to pay as well). My dad was gambling a lot and generating credit card debts. My mom would shop to de-stress and ended up with credit card debts as well. With financial problems comes frequent arguments in the house. 

Growing up, I never really saw my parents. My dad was always out and my mom was out working 3 jobs. Still, we had days where there were no electricity and water for days. It happened quite frequently when I was in primary school....

When I got to secondary level, I mixed with the wrong company. I was never at home cause I didn't want to (my house was a mess and I didn't wanna be around the constant drama). My first bro is 12 years older than me and he got diagnosed with schizophrenia and was hospitalised at IMH before. He has been paranoid and kept accusing us as spy from the govt. He would beat people up and he would say things that don't make sense but annoys you. As for my 2nd bro, he's into gambling online. He started since he was in sec school and he bet on soccer online. Obviously, he asked for money from my mom to gamble.... Both of my bros are drop outs from poly. They spent all my parents' CPF on their unfinished education. 

I was also working part time jobs earning from $5-8/hr on weekends and holidays when I was just sec 2. Eventually I got to a point in my life where I figured I needed to study hard so I could make money and get myself out of the situation.. so by sec 3, I turned around and concentrated on studies. I managed to do alright on my O levels and ended up in a science course at a polytechnic. I studied hard while still working part time and was aiming to get myself accepted into a local university and I did. But the next thing was, how am I gonna pay for it? 

The best thing that happened was I applied for a scholarship and I actually got it. I never thought I would make the cut but I glad I got the chance to go for the interview and was actually offered. I traveled overseas for school and I couldn't be happier for the next 3.5years of my life. I was away from the drama and I had the freedom to do what I want to do. I also met the love of my life.

I am the middle child.\n\nWhen my siblings and I were still studying (secondary sch), my dad was an avid gambler. One day, loan sharks came to my house and spoke to me and my little sister during broad daylight. They were very fierce and constantly banged on the door. Obviously we were frightened and quickly called our parents for help. At night when my parents got homed, they quarreled and my mom literally chased after my dad with a kitchen knife. I swear to God. She wanted to kill him because he is ruining our lives. My dad held her and later on went on his knees begging my mom to stop, promising us that he would change.   \n\nHowever, this change that he promised did not fully stop him from gambling. The only thing change that he did was reducing the amount of stake. And because of the debt, my siblings and I have to start working after school and during the public holiday to earn our own allowance. We have worked as a packer in NTUC, to frying fries at Macdonald's along with several other event jobs too. I almost dropped out from poly because I made so much money (or i thought was so much money) selling the first batch of iPad at expo, rofl.  \n\nFast forward to today, both my sisters have already graduated from local university and are both working in corporate while I am happily working in my career of 3 years. Sometimes when we talk about our lives as a student, we can't help but wonder how did we pull it through. My mom sometimes tears up when she felt that she failed as a mother because she could not afford education for us and have to see us juggle between work and study. However, we honestly don't feel that way. Life just happens. And all that experiences made us who we are today. As for my dad, he completely stopped gambling because the 3 of us are old enough to literally told him off and would not hesitate to stop giving him allowance (he's retired with no money. Yup.)  \n\nAt the end of the day, there are always people in the world having a much difficult situation than us. Some don't even have the privilege to attend tertiary education. Think about it: You have a fully-paid 5 room flat to live in and right now you can really focus on saving for your future. No matter how bad/stagnant/trapped you feel, your second phase of life is only just getting started. So embrace it! Earn and save lots of money but don't forget that life is not just about money! Sometimes it's good to just spend a little bit of $ buying that expensive ice cream, that short getaway with your bf/mom, or that pair of cool sneakers to bring you to more places. Life is full of discovery. I wish you happiness and best of luck."", ""Not a lawyer, but I just want to throw it out there.

Was just wondering if anyone has links to people who have spare room or bed spaces to rent out?

Been retrenched for a while and trying to find an economic space (&lt;$500). Don't have confidence to aim for a costlier option at the moment.

One reason why I'm here on Reddit instead of social media or property websites is the presence of agents in websites. I've tried contacting several listings (40+).

There were two problems I encountered.

1) Landlords prefer Chinese. Malaysian or local.

2) The cheaper options are usually females only.

If anybody can link up with any suitable option, I will be more than grateful.

For common info, I live in a toxic space with a step family. Don't really want to elaborate on it. So living with parents is out of the question.

But there are differences in percentages of ""A""s varying across JCs, I think main reason is better leadership (Subject Departments, IC of content to teach and studying notes) and administration (Mainly School staff, how they provide info to students). Reputation plays a role, for example I found out that better-tiered JCs have H3 subjects offered by NUS, but they do not have H3 Game theory offered by SMU for my school, vice versa. \n\n\nObjectively speaking, there are differences in different-tiers, but if we are talking about quality of teachers it should be roughly the same, because MOE rotates teachers around to ensure equity.\n\n\nHigher tier students being toxic? While there are stories, but ""lower-tier"" students can also be toxic. So it may not be completely accurate to label this school or that school to have ""toxic"" people, we wouldn\'t know. That being said, from my experience I heard some teachers from higher-tiers may use the school\'s reputation to stress the students, but please don\'t let that bother you.\n\n\nAnswering main question: Yes, choices do matter. Perhaps you\'re already set for wtv career path and will prob pursue that regardless of JC picked. However, various factors amongst JCs affect a major aspect of 2 years in your adolescent life (A period where you are still understanding yourself).\n\n\nFactors to consider include environment, location and facilities, friends who you know are going there, food (dk if you\'d consider this), subjects offered, quality of the subject department, CCAs and school characteristics.\n\n\nFor example, my JC has a standard reporting time of 8.45am, other schools don\'t. Ik that TMJC and TJC have tedious examination papers -- they follow the A Level Standard format, so JC1s will take the A Level Difficulty for their promos. My school on the other hand modified the papers to be simplier for JC1s. [Not promoting my school, just using illustrations]\n\n\nI suggest you look up online as much as you can. When I was Sec 4, I looked up details of the JCs I want to go to, determining which stream is best for this and that JC and the environment. \n\n\nNot sure if you know, but there are some people who regretted their choices, in terms of stream or subjects picked, or maybe their entire JC in general. Ultimately, JC takes up 2 years of your life, so I kinda suggest you to spend at least a decent amount of effort looking up. This way you\'ll be confident by knowing what you\'re getting into and hopefully not regret your choices.\n\n\nHope this helps!', ""most importantly is to choose the subjects u know u can do well for A levels. \n\nbecause once u r screwed on the results, and u cant get into local uni, u will b more stressed for a long time than which JC to enter.\n\nif u have alr decided to go JC, please take this time to know find out about urself on which subjects u can excel in. be very very sure. \n\nif u arent that good in physics, but insist on taking physics because of ur family advice / because it's STEM, no teacher can help u to bring u to an A."", 'I’m not really sure which subjects I’m good at haha. They are all average, I take physics and chem but I know I’m definitely not going to arts stream because my humanities suck. I’m also quite worried... because my sister is in Jc currently and most of her Chem questions are organic? Because of covid then I didn’t get the chance to learn... so I’m quite scared if I’m able to do well.', 'I did try looking up but not much information given haha.... I’m trying to go for jcs near my home because I’m not really keen to travel such a long distance after a long day. What ccas do you recommend? I’m more into clubs since they are less tiring than performing arts and sports which I’m going to totally avoid because I’m not good in sports and also I don’t want to be in performing arts anymore(too stressful)', 'Ooo. Congrats!! Was it difficult to get into the course?', ""I think it's alright. Got &gt;80rp so more choices for myself."", 'I think the JC isnt the most important factor in determining your chances to enter uni. Its more of your attitude and how hard you work during the 2 years.. nonetheless i feel you should try to find out the environment and culture from your seniors regarding the JCs youre interested in cos i guess the environment plays a huge factor in your performance too. For me, i thoroughly enjoyed my JC life although it was kinda stressful and i believe that was one big reason why i managed to do relatively well eventually. And i think its not v worth to pick a jc that you gotta spend like 1h travelling to cos its really tiring on a daily basis. Just my 2 cents haha', '\nSince you\'re planning on sajc, I can\'t give much details cose I\'m not from there xd. \n\n\nBut yep, avoid sports and performing arts as there will be competitions in JC1, so most schools would train their members vigorously. Though note it\'s COVID period so next year there may not be much to do. JC1 is an important year cose it\'ll set your foundation for A Levels and determine if you take up a H3 Subject (Not sure if you\'d want it). Another tip to not pressurize yourself in your JC years is avoid Student Council - depending your the role, you may be more busier than those in sports/performing arts. \n\n\nSide note: If you\'re planning on building a portfolia to apply for scholarships after A Levels, I suggest applying for your CCA exco, or be part of your class committee.\n\n\nAs for JC researching, one way is to use google and type ""Reddit [Insert JC name]"", or any other variations of key words for that matter.', 'As much as I want to ignore it, I believe in the social circle effect that schools can have on the students. So yes it does matter. In terms of results, maybe it is still 85% you and 15% school. I went to a JC which was just 10mins from my house. It was partly cause of my bad/mediocre O levels (15) . I was disappointed with myself but for JC, I had my enlightenment period where things made sense. Lucky for me, I had a good results for A levels (AAA/B). The teachers are definitely capable and knowledgeable, just that you might not appreciate their style of teaching and thus am unable to achieve subject mastery. \nI\'ll advise you to try your best for a good result and get into ""better"" schools. But definitely do not be dismayed if you fail to do so.', ""\nDo u alr know what u want to work as in the future? Or what uni course u want to do? u can work backwards from there. \n\nImagine urself to be working and think about the company or the scope. Go to jobstreet and look at the job scope u imagine urswlf to be doing . Look at what their uni deg requirements. Go to local uni and check the website for the grades to enter. Then choose ur subjects that u can get A or B\n\nIf u r going to be uncertain, then pls think if gg to poly would be better.\n\nPls ask ur sister or friends or Google online to see if u can cope w the science materials. \n \nIt doesn't matter what u take,  what matters most is u must be sure u can at least get bbb/b for a levels .\n\nDo subjects u enjoy and can score easily. Thats the most important. Unless of course u want to do STEM in uni then pls choose the necessary course for jc to qualify ."", ""If its just about jc, I think people from those affiliated schools  would probably alr have their own cliques from secondary school. I'm not sure how open they r but well, if it matters. \n\nNot sure the culture in ur sec school but choose the school that fits u better. Say if u r more Chinese speaking then well dun pick acjc because its like a misfit."", 'This may be an unpopular opinion but that’s just how I feel.\n\nJCs don’t matter when it comes to academics. Ultimately, if you hit your target for A’s, you can get into whatever course you aimed for.\n\nWhat differs a whole lot is culture and environment. It can make or break mental health, it can change your social networking, it can change your views in education and career.', ""In addition to the social circle you'll develop in the chosen JC, the other often overlooked factor is availability of support for the students on post-JC paths. \n\nYour so-called higher tier JCs will have support beyond simply prepping you for A levels. They have programs and expertise to identify and navigate scholarship applications, which is something most other JCs do not - this is something I learnt much later. They also have strong alumni networks and career counseling / career talks that they invite their alumni or others to give. Some even have avenues for internship opportunities.""]"

Hi, I am a Year 2 university student and I have been staying in hall for as much as I can because I can’t get along with either parents. Today I confronted my dad publicly on his affair because I was sick of this bullshit and now I don’t know what to do because my mum is pretty immature and expects me to be the adult here. Not local, whole family PR. 

Context on my dad: my dad is a serial cheater and my mum claims he has been cheating since I was a baby. I myself have also found evidence of him cheating when I was in secondary school, in JC, and now in uni. The most recent one has been for 2 years+ and it’s someone who is half his age. They have been shamelessly publishing their relationship on Facebook and even did a wedding photoshoot, the girl thinks she is married to him.  I have tried to confront my dad several times regarding the girl, asking him his future plans, if he loves my mum, what he want for his happiness etc. He constantly lies, denies, and just say he want to stay with my mother. He can lie straight to my face even when I have photo evidences of the girl. I have tried my best to be understanding, rational, open. 

I was too tired of living in his lies so I followed him today secretly, confronted him and the girl when I saw him. Now I don’t know what to do next. 

I filmed most of it in case anything happens, it ended badly with him trying to throw my phone onto the road, shouting at me and threatening me, trying to assault me in public. My boyfriend protected me, I wanted to call the police but I did not out of consideration for my mum. Aside from his cheating, he is also financially irresponsible like he neglect all the bills, got scammed out of over 30k over the likes of African prince scam, no properties, no future planning. He do have CPF to draw this year but I am extremely worried because it is a sizeable amount and this man has the brain of a peanut. Example, he spent 10K on betting within a week.

Context on my mum: She haven’t worked since she came to Singapore to be a housewife since like 2006? My dad asked her to stay at home. She has no money, no savings. She has a lot of illnesses, every conversation with her will start with something hurting. At this point I am not sure if some of them is her victimizing herself for attention/placebo. Diabetes, eyesight affected by diabetes, ovarian issues, stomach, legs, etc. That one time she worked, my dad took her salary. I suspect she also has EQ issues because she is highly vulgar with me/my dad, can’t get along with anyone including me (I grew up being called the likes of “fucking slut” “whore” “fucking bitch”), has no friends &amp; her family cut ties with her (partly due to money issues caused by my dad). But with outsiders/locals in Singapore, she come off as a frail person who can’t even speak English properly. She has a Masters degree from her native country but she is fully reliant on my dad for food, shelter and healthcare (currently using his Medisave). 

She knows what I did, she was aware of it but she is kinda bipolar about it (as always). She was roughly aware of my intentions, and she added fuel by talking badly my dad and the girl all that, encouraging me. But she accused me of dragging her into the picture, like she is just an innocent bystander. I mean, she did cuss out the girl on call also so like?? Bro whose husband is that? I suspect my mum is a toxic mum with the hero dynamic/expectations all placed on me. 

———

All I wanted was a family. All I ever got was trust issues. Now that I finally took action for their bullshit, I am terrified but also clueless where to go next. I am not sure if I was stupid in doing this but living in lies and play pretend was tiring, the weight was too heavy. I also recently quit my part time job because I was not growing and it was suppressing me, making me depressed.

Take the United States for instance.  Only about 35% of working adults own houses.  But the ownership rate increases to about 80% for adults of age 65 and above, people who have or are about to retire.  And this is comparing the whole of the United States with Singapore, which is essentially a city.  If we take major cities as comparison, the total home ownership averages about 35%.  Which means most people in major cities, regardless of their age, do not own a home, but instead rent or are homeless.\n\nDon't forget that home ownership measures the percentage of houses occupied by their owners, not the percentage of people owning houses.

pinkgiselle,1609736012,kq1ljd,80,1,"How do i find friends who make at least the same amount of effort as i do?

I made a friend or two during my first job which was toxic. But they didn't bother contacting me much after I left. I tried making an effort to ask them to meet up for a meal, sending them birthday messages, giving them gifts yearly. Well, they just accepted everything with a smile and said thank you. Year after year, I was the only one making an effort. 

Throughout my other jobs, I made a few friends who.. are the same. They all make zero effort which hurts. No one ever remembers my birthday when i remember theirs. 

A friend never remembered my birthdays or sent me texts for 4 years. I was the one doing it until i called her up because i needed to buy an insurance policy from her (things happened and had no choice but to ask her). She started sending me birthday messages, asking to meet up, and sending Christmas gifts after!! It feels so superficial. She also told me that she was too busy to remember my birthday and felt bad about it (before i bought something from her), then proceeded to continue forgetting it the next year. 

One other friend likes leaving me on read for days and weeks because she claims to be forgetful. 

Another friend tried taking me to church and making me a believer which i rejected. And another asked me to recommend her a WFH job because it seemed easy to her when i searched for months for one, and got mad at me when the company paid her late. They both stopped contacting me after those incidents. 

I... didnt have a problem until I met my bf online. I was fine being alone and being used. He's sociable and hangs out a lot. I was attracted to that side of him. He has so many friends and i just cant understand how. His friends even send him birthday messages, new year messages, and ask to meet him up! I'm envious. Despite all the effort I made, no one would do those things for me first.

I’ve noticed this happens more for the prettier and more popular among us. \n\nAnd it’s not that they don’t consider you a friend - they still do - but their idea of friendship is accepting your invitation to hang out and participating, not organising a gathering or reaching out to you. \n\nSame with some extreme introverts. They would always make time for you if you reach out to them because they like and care about you but don’t naturally reach out.\n\nI would suggest that you join a few different clubs or groups. Gardening, rock climbing, yoga, dance, or martial arts - or a language class too. Work on being comfortable with some superficial friendships first, since it takes time for friendship to grow. If someone reaches out to you, do reciprocate (if you want to be friends with them - this doesn’t mean you must force yourself to spend time with people who make you uncomfortable). \n\nAlso try and be more comfortable alone. People can sense if you are desperate for friendship and if they’re normal they are likely to distance themselves. I made a lot more friends when I was chill and older than when I was a lonely teen. Being comfortable alone made it a lot easier to be able to interact with someone as much or as little as we both would like.\n\nAlso I’m a horribly flawed person and since I was a teen I always picked something about myself to work at (interrupting less, listening more, learning more about a topic, etc) and eventually you end up a better person. One reason why no one liked me as a teen was because I was so sad and angry about my family situation that it coloured myself every interaction. Even now, I have some people who only reach out to me because they have some really bad stuff going on and need someone to talk to. I wouldn’t want to abandon them. But they aren’t my close friends who I talk nonsense about random stuff with as well as all the real stuff that happens. Some of us only catch up once every few weeks or months but every time we talk it’s like no time has passed. I hope you have something like this  - or whatever it is you need - one day :) \n\nAll the best!', 'you just need to find the right grp of ppl.

Shit happens in life!! But to let shit make us stop believing in the good in this world...means that we have allowed a part of ourselves to die. *which is not supposed to be this way*\n\nI am very much the same as you. Always initiate things, start groups, talk to people first. But then I expect a lot in return, and that’s when I think there isn’t mutual appreciation of expectations. Friendships crumble and then I fall into this spiral of self despise/pity...you name it.\n\nNow that I am starting to be more congruent with my needs and wants, I am getting better at telling people what I want from them. Of course, by not demanding things from others and also shielding myself from people who keep wanting to make use of me.\n\nHere are some of my learning points:\n\n+ Know our worth\n+ Respect our time, spaces and needs\n+ Rather have no friends than shit (exploit) friends\n+ Set clear and good boundaries\n+ Choose the people I spend time with, very wisely\n+ Be more truthful in relationships and quit the guessing game - this requires players of maturity level 20 to partake in mutual understanding. Players below level 20 cannot unlock this quest.\n\nGiven all these learning points, even though I am pretty much alone these days, I am happier and do not need to feel burdened by friendships. I just be myself, be respectful of my own and other people’s boundaries. Make friendships less stressful and chill while we are at it. \n\nAnd then, here we are, having a little more faith to uncover the surprises in friendships and whatever ships that comes along the way!\n\nDisclaimer: I don’t actively seek friendships already, because, I want to become my own best friend.

It’s just that as we grow up, the things we care about change. People change. We just gradually grow apart. I’m also starting to understand why it’s getting harder to make real friends. What I’ve learnt is to sense people out. I’ll try to reach out to them every once in a while but if they seem like just remaining as school/work friends, I’ll just let it be. It’s a little sad, but I get it. There’re some people I can’t fully click with and rather just be school friends too. All relationships must be reciprocal else it doesn’t work out. You being the one to always reach out first isn’t a real friendship and you’ll eventually drain out. \n\nYou can try joining a community of your interest, maybe you can find some friends there.

HoneySnowFlakez,1609683441,kplbhl,25,1,"Hey, I just want a fair share of how often do people get provoked or confront by random strangers in public before. 

This happened to me yesterday, while I was waiting for my friend for dinner. These shopping mall we are suppose to go is beside the MRT station. So I waited for my friend at a seating area(mind you, that’s not a smoking corner) as it’s sheltered by the MRT station. 

There’s this guy who was seating there before me and I sat beside him(obviously not close beside him). While I made a glance at him, which is completely normal in public. As he was talking away on his phone. 

Minding my own business and texting on my phone. This guy stood up and walk to my right and started puffing on his cigarette while still on his phone. However The smell was really bad despite having my mask on and made 1-2 gentle coughs while adjusting my mask.

fleshmarket,1609410094,knnn0w,7,1,"Take this as a rant as it's gonna be a long post. 
TLDR: Director micromanages, toxic working environment, requires to workong hours and weekends. One week into the job and I felt like quitting. 

Been given an opportunity to work for this company which I will leave unnamed.
Basically the interview process has been a pleasant one, be it with my hiring manager, HR, and someone from Finance which turns out not to be someone whom I will be working closely with.
First week into the job and I got invited to numerous meetings, and apparently they were mostly meaningless ones.
What do I mean by meaningless? It's mostly updates after updated after updates.

As  the manager/director of this department, he probably only have to oversee the whole operations and doesn't have a daily jobscope to do. But for us, the mid management and ground employees, we do have daily job tasks to complete. And inviting us to countless meetings everyday just to fulfill and satisfy his micromanaging and power thirst.
He's a regional director, but I don't get why is he micromanaging us so much that the hierarchy in this office is so flat. There's no hierarchy here because everyone reports to him even though there's a manager here.
He micromanages so much that he cares about how lockers should be labelled, why are they left ajar after a work day, how should we name our files in Teams, why are we sick and whats the diagnosis.
I just feel that he's being very toxic.

You might ask why didn't I find these red flags during the interviews, I would say that he's a different person during interviews and gave me a sense that he's a very good mentor and someone I can learn from. 

I would say that the environment and culture is toxic, but I would also point it out that he's the one creating all these politics shit. He treats different people with different treatments based off their pay range and whether they're under HQ headcounts. Thankfully for me, I'm under HQ. With this, it kinda puts the other employees in a difficult position, prone to jealousy and insecurity. 
Most of the employees in this office are foreigners and they're able to work long hours and on weekends. But for me and this new colleague, we both have families and social life that we would like to balance with work.
Every passing day I find myself dreading to work. In the long term I can't find myself putting in 100% effort here. 

Overall, pay is significantly good and the jobscope is something that I would like to stay in and learn more.
Tried applying for weeks but to no avail for now. And most of the jobs in the market now are contract roles.

So after such a long rant, if you were me, would you quit?",askSingapore,33243,Should I quit?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/knnn0w/should_i_quit/,1.0,"[""As you said, the job market isn't favourable for employees now so if you do quit, are you able to stay unemployed for months to come? If you are and you feel like you are barely hanging on then go for it. Ultimately it's not worth sacrificing your mental health for a job but I'd stay on just for a month or two at least to see the bigger picture if possible.\n\nIf you have a micromanaging boss, they tend to enjoy the feeling of control more than the understanding that it undermines morale and can build resentment. Get to know his habits. e.g. If he comes into your office 3 times a day to get an in depth look at what you are doing, plus details, take charge. Note what time he does this in a day, enter his office 10 min prior on a regular basis. flood him with the details. Don't bullshit him, but flood him with details that a supervisor/management shouldn't need to know. You'll accomplish two things. you are signalling you know your job and are in control, you established his office as the place to discuss workload, and yours as a place to get things done. He won't bother you, since it's pointless to get a rehash of what you've already gone into. If you get visits later in the day, just reiterate he knows the plan, and you will see him when complete.\n\nAs for meetings, I personally never go into meetings that have no clear agenda that is visible to all (duration, goal, desired outcome etc.). Some management just like to invite every and anyone but everyone in a meeting should have agenda points and possible actions to perform after. I there is none, they should be allowed to excuse themselves.

Then another one as a group, and then COUNTLESS meetings for stupid updates.

I thought I would be able to withstand the effects of heartbreak but it seems like there is a real difference between what you think and how you feel in the moment.

Recently, my girlfriend has suggested a break, which eventually turned into a breakup and I must admit that it has really affected me. Unlike my usual calm and composed self, I began to feel a sense of loss and her absence has really made me anxious, and the reasons she stated were understandable, but really deep down I knew that I wouldn't be able to accept the reason because it seemed so sudden.

I've been with my girlfriend through thick and thin, and I've always stayed by her side when she needed me the most. From my posts you can also tell that I'm a caring and loving partner, but alas even all the love in the world could not get someone else to love you back. To have someone who is the love of your life essentially admitting that she has 'less' feelings for me than I have for her hurts. 

She reasoned that our **三观** is very different and she is afraid that down the road, if we get married, things might change or become worse than before. She hasn't explicitly told me how we are different and I'm still trying to figure out our differences even now, when she has already said that she wants a break (it's actually breakup but in my mind I just have that little hope that she might change her mind) 

Another one of her reasons was that she doesn't love me as much as I love her and she feels very guilty about it. I told her that most couples don't love equally and she understands this as well, but to me it wouldn't necessarily affect the entire relationship too much. Although the dynamics may be different, it isn't worth breaking up. She has also told me that she has never gotten over her breakups and that we started the relationship on the wrong footing and initially she thought, ""why not give it a try and see how it goes"" and now it has become ""I'm unsure if I want to be with this person"". This were her exact words, ""与其让你在跟我相处很久后，甚至结婚后，我才发现勉强是没有幸福的，对你不公平爱不是convince 自己to喜欢一个人, 而是确定眼前就是你想要过一辈子的人, 不是他谁都不行; rs 是两个人经营的, 任何一方的输出变弱了, 它就变了)

Her mom is incredibly toxic and might likely scold her for my disappearance as I'm supposed to teach her brother O levels chemistry. I can't believe that I still care so much about her even at this stage when she has dumped me. 

I'm getting sleepless nights and I have hardly any appetite. I also don't have the motivation to work and it's seriously affecting my life when her absence makes my life hollow. I don't know how to pick myself up, can you guys offer any form of advice? I know breakups maybe cliche, and to the outside world it might seem like just another ordinary breakup. But to me, my world has shattered.

Even if you do, as you have mentioned before, your ex has many stressors in her life to deal with and even if she decided to restart the relationship with you, your clear emotional dependence would only serve to exacerbate her emotional state. \n\nThe important thing for you to do right now is to regain your emotional stability and continue on with whatever is going on with your life now like studies, family, etc. I think you should seek some professional help if you continue to have difficulties moving on. Ultimately the most important thing that you should remember is that you should not be emotionally dependent on others because people will always come and go whether we want them to or not. As a piece of advice for the future, avoid relationships with people who are not able to be their own source of happiness. One can only love freely if they are not emotionally dependent on others and one cannot love truly if they are unable to love freely. Wish you all the best in your recovery. If you wish, DM me and I can share my own experience.', 'I went through a very similar experience as you. I hope that in sharing my experience, it might help you deal with what you\'re going through now.\n\nWe dated for 10 years before getting married. So you can imagine how intertwined our lives were in terms of friends and family.\n\nThe state of our relationship was also a very unequal one in the way you\'ve described yours. It was me doing most of the ""giving"" in the relationship.\n\nI didn\'t know it at that time, but this unevenness made her feel a strong sense of guilt. There was love of course, but this inequality made her feel like she was obliged to stay in the relationship, rather than actually wanting to be in the relationship.\n\nAll this culminated in her feeling extremely stifled in the relationship and she eventually cheated. She confessed, but it was so sudden and it hit me like a truck.\n\nI didn\'t even have time to process being angry about the cheating. I was so desperate to avoid losing her because she was such a big part of my life. I even felt responsible for her cheating. I kept thinking that I should have known this, I should have done this and that. And as her husband I thought it was my duty to forgive her and work things out with her. I was just terrified that if I lost her, there would be no meaning in my life. I had so many visions of our future together, and it was completely ripped away just like that.\n\nThe thing is, the more I pushed to try to work things out, the more it exacerbated those feelings of hers. My repeated attempts to work things out was basically emphasizing that inequality in the relationship. It made her feel even more guilty that she just couldn\'t face me or herself if she stayed in the marriage.\n\nI think I know those feelings of desperation that you\'re feeling right now. But my experience tells me that your efforts to work things out may be counterproductive and cause your other half to close her heart up even more.\n\nI believe that what she needs right now is space. Time and space away from you to sort her own feelings out. I think it\'s good to try to suggest to meet up with her face to face, but don\'t push her if she\'s not willing.\n\nIf you do meet her, I don\'t think it would be a good idea to use that meeting to try to work the relationship out. I think you should use that opportunity to understand fully why she wants the break/breakup, and then after that give her space to work her feelings out.  You can let her know your stance, that you want to try to work things out. But you cannot keep trying to persuade her. At the end of the day, a relationship needs to have two willing parties to work. What you don\'t want is to do is to force her to try again when she\'s not ready. If she agrees to get back together out of obligation to you and your efforts, the same problems will arise.\n\nWith that in mind, you also need to be prepared to let her go. That is the hardest part. It took me 2 years to start to come to terms with things, and even now I still regress into that state of hopelessness and hollowness every now and then.\n\nBecause she was such a big part of my life, every day there was something that would remind me of our life together. The worst moments are when you\'re alone and you start recollecting all the memories, and thinking about what you could have done or should have done. So I did things to minimise the time that my mind would wander. I tried to occupy myself with work. I used the singlehood to focus more on myself, pick up new hobbies, doing things I wanted to do, or things I didn\'t get a chance to do when I was in a relationship. Importantly for me, I was fortunate to have good friends and family, and spending more time with them reminded me that there are people who appreciate me. I hope you are able to find people who appreciate you too.\n\nI know some people who immediately looked for a rebound to cope, but that\'s not something I could bring myself to do when I was in such a mess.\n\nHonestly there\'s no easy way around it, except to just let time pass and minimise the time you spend thinking about things. It will hurt like hell. But as time passes, you start to get used to a new status quo without her in your life, and you start to think about new possibilities. Things will get better from there, and I hope you get there sooner rather than later.\n\nI think my advice is somewhat pessimistic in that there\'s no easy way out in dealing with the heartbreak. But I get the sense that you and I are very similar in how we approached our relationships, so I hope that it will give you a little bit of comfort in knowing that you are not alone in feeling all these feelings.\n\nRemember to be good to yourself, and beat yourself up a bit less as time passes.', ""Move on bro. It's her loss anyway. There's a plenty fish out there. You will find the one who really appreciate you. I've been there before It's gonna be a hard few months. Make sure you make your self occupied.

Most comments will tell me to move on, but it's incredibly difficult to move on only days after the break up.

In this case, hope can be a very deadly thing, especially when we are on the road to recovery. \n\nAt this point I'm not sure what to think or what to feel, and most have tried to demonize her for leaving me, and it might help me feel a little better in the short term but in the long run, it doesn't really help me that much.\n\nDo you mind pm-ing to share more about your relationship?"", 'Dude gonna break it to u straight up\nShe fell for another giy sometime ago already..its pretty obvious fr her reason or lack thereof \nDont lose slp over her cos she ain’t,she busy w the new guy.\nRem..拿得起 放得下.many fishes in the sea,go socialise n date,u will b surprised n wondered y u stuck w her for that long.

But what happens when the coils carrying the refrigerant are dusty or dirty. The heat transfer cannot take place evenly. The hot water vapor in the air gets cooled too much at certain spots and changes into its liquid state (or if it is really serious, freezes on the coil).

iamweird999,1623632125,nzaoem,111,106,"Hi guys, I'm seeking advice on here because I'm really at my wits end and I do not wish to share with my friends my current situation out of appearing vulnerable. 

So a little background about me and my girlfriend. I'm currently studying in university while my girlfriend has just matriculated into poly. She has been working part time since she was young (about 14) and has covered a lot of her own expenses because her mom refuses to give her an allowance. Her mom rationalises this by pointing out that my girlfriend has money from her part time work and does not need an allowance. I mean, what kind of logic is that? In addition, her mom is also divorced and is a single mum. She has a son who is currently studying for O levels.

My girlfriend's mom has also shown very clear bias against her from the very beginning. (her mom had another son) I'll illustrate using a few examples. When her mom is cooking food, she'll often exclude my girlfriend by refusing to cook for her and only cook for her son. This happens regularly. She will also have impossible expectations about my girlfriend and demand that she help with the household chores. But you have to understand, my girlfriend is juggling her studies in poly and she's working part time (long hours, 10 usually per shift) to make ends meet. (and because her mom refuses to pay for most stuff when she would readily get her son anything) How is it physcially possible for her to help out when she has to fulfil her obligations both as a student and working as a part timer? She never requests anything from her son (much less household chores) and I know it because whenever I go over, I'll be the one to wash their dishes after eating.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. Her mom has also explicitly mentioned that she would be better off without her daughter and said that she was ""捡回来的"" I feel as that my girlfriend is truly hurt by her mom's callous and insensitive remarks. It truly feels as if her mom only has love for her son and her daughter is an afterthought. The nerve of this fucking bitch.

On to the worse stuff. Her mum has also confirmed verbally that she will not pay her school fees (in poly it's about 3.2k/sem) and it was only when my girlfriend went to ask her dad that he obliged out of his obligation as a ""father"" and agreed to pay the school fees. Now, when the father paid up, he did it by transferring the school fees via her mother and not only did she NOT pay the entire sum given to her, she even requested my girlfriend to pay for her own phone bills + the costs of procuring a new phone. (mind you at an age where most kids are still schooling) My girlfriend's phone had spoilt, and she had to buy one out of necessity. 

Her mom has also threatened to kick her out of the house several times and for a period of time my girlfriend lived at her friend's place (close to a year) without going back. She only came back because her brother was suffering from depression and wanted to kill himself (presumably because of an insufferable mother) and my girlfriend had no choice but to go back and live with this kind of fuckface. I cannot fucking believe that a mother would fucking use economic duress on her own goddamn daughter  What kind of a fucking parent are you? She's been using finance to strong arm my girlfriend into obeying her but obviously it wasn't working.

Yesterday she and her mom had a huge fight. Shouting contest everywhere, each one try to one up the other. The reason was because her mom simply refused to wash the pot after cooking and has left it for 3 days to stagnate. I think the real underlying reason could be my girlfriend's frustrations with her  own mother + stress from her school work + her enduring everything her mom has threw at her since she was young. The pot incident was merely a trigger that exploded because of underlying resentment between both parties. I was surprised that I managed to keep cool during that period when both parties were shouting at the top of their lungs and her brother intervened too to stop the fight. (Her brother is on our side) It ended up in a stalemate but I had to pretend to cajole her mom when in reality I would love to erase her existence from this world and be done with it.

And here we are, her mom asking her to sleep in the living room. (they live in a 2 room condo, her mom sleeps on the sofa and her son takes the other room) at 3am in the morning when my girlfriend has work the next day and screaming at her for trivial things which could be done the next day. (Literal screaming)

Do you guys have any suggestions as to what we could do? In the long run, we'll most likely cut her out when we start work. We'll also ensure that she will not be receiving any form of compensation or remuneration under the Maintenance of Parents Act. (she's also not eligible) But in the short term, I'm not sure what I could do for my girlfriend. What should I do as a concerned boyfriend?

If you don’t want an official “investigation” I suggest you try walking in to the FSC, explain the problem including them not doing an intake so that you can understand what will happen next before deciding if you want to commit to this problem with an “official” protocol. \n\nYou can try having documentation such as audio recordings, bank statements or what not. It may devolve into a “he say she say” situation, but usually if there are more people on your side of the story MSF will really take a closer look. Especially if they receive a referral from the FSC. Furthermore I think if school fees are not paid, and the father has proof of a transaction history sent to the mother, that might be another piece of evidence that supports your girlfriend’s story. \n\nUsually once MSF gets involved, you’re protected by the law or some form of enforcing body. It will not be wise for the mother to try and go against it. As per my understanding they will usually make an arrangement with a safe adult, perhaps the father, to care for the children. There will be visitation restrictions imposed on the mother as well. I am not sure what happens if her father is not keen to be involved. Maybe they will turn to the grandparents or other adults. I believe in such scenarios they might make other arrangements. \n\nIn sum I suggest both of you to go find out more, then pick the lesser evil. It sucks that this is what your girlfriend is facing, and this isn’t anybody’s fault on any of you. It’s just an unfortunate situation especially growing up. \n\nIf in the end nothing changes because your girlfriend picks status quo to be the more palatable option that’s her choice as well. Change is difficult. I would then suggest drawing up a plan on how to move on from the mother in the future. I see that you’ve already started looking into the Maintenance Act; not sure if FSC can advise you about it but give it a go. Maybe Legal Aid is able to provide clearer answers as well. \n\nI am not sure how to help your girlfriend and her brother accept the possibility that they might lose their mother. They might need time, and they actually might need to talk about this as well. Even though the brother can see the biased behaviour, he is still in a favourable position if things remain status quo and might not approve or support of this decision. \n\nLastly I would like to point out that it is not MSF’s goal to simply remove the mother from the situation. Their goal is to encourage or “coach” a healthier relationship and eventually reintegrating everybody back into one cohesive unit again using whatever means necessary. Although I believe it is still your girlfriend’s choice on whether she wants that in her future. \n\nI hope this helps, and do take care of yourselves.', ""So glad your girlfriend's brother turn out to be nice kid. Because to be frank, often we heard children from toxic family issues always turn out to be Ah Beng or go off the right road very often or worse end up in boy's home. \n\nAnd since you mention he's going to study for his O level, I seriously think your girlfriend and her brother should go seek help from family service centre and see if staying at youth shelter is available option for him. The action her mother is projecting is child abuse already so I'm sure family service centre will have some solution options for your girlfriend and her brother. And once if you seek help from family service centre or maybe MSF, maybe financial aid will be an available option as well.. Don't give up hope!\n\nActually if her parents really do want to chip in money for her education, then that's fine though it's gonna be tough for both of you.

LMJR500Army,1621833676,njqd0v,8,1,"Recently, I made a post complaining how I would get repeated calls from insurance companies while in the hunt for jobs.   
Well, I would like to tell everyone that, I have gotten couple of confirmed offers from companies after countless interviews. 

I am yet to submit my resignation notice letter to my current company, however I can't get rid of a irrational fear that I have. 

I have a stable job, just a very toxic company culture. Can't stand it. Decided to change jobs.   
However, I fear after I sign the contract and leave my current job, the new company might cancel the contract. 

In the event of such a cancellation, I am not protected under the Employment Act. Because it states that if I don't turn up on first day or work, its as it says the employer-employee relationship did not start.

Basically, it means I leave my current job and the new company says ""Sorry, we decided last minute we going to reject the offer we gave you."" And plus to get any compensation, have to go to civil court, lawyers and stuff. Like wtf. 

So I am at a crossroad. Do I leave stable toxic job for a shaky new future, that does not give me any guarantee?

sssskkk211,1621578856,nhlwoz,135,1,"Hi everyone I’m just seeking some advice, I’m 30F and I’ve decided to move out of my family home. It can be quite a toxic environment with verbal abuse and sometimes even physical (but not towards me). The financial situation at home also isn’t good with father under heavy loans (borrowing from one to pay another). Previously I’ve also taken 2 loans to help tide him over because at the time he told me he had money coming in and would pay me back in 1 month but now 2 years later I’m still paying the loans. Because I am living at home for the first year that I was working I would use my salary to help him offset any bills he had and this sometimes left me with barely any money to be able to top up my ez link card. Eventually when I took the loans for him I stopped contributing to his bills because he knew I was paying the loans instead. His financial situation has worsened since (in all fairness he has property he can sell to fix his life but chooses not to). 


I just shared my news of moving out with both parents and they took it well (very unemotional and quite meh okay lor) but subsequently my father had a calm conversation with me to say if I move out now I’m making a big mistake and I will never get successful in life, he also added that because it’s just a hard time for him financially and if I have money to pay for rent I should have just contributed the money to him and the house instead (but how many years can I bleed myself dry without being able to make a life for myself?)

As a side note, the past few years at home have been quite bad, he is very controlling and as a result I barely have any friends and definitely no romantic prospects because he doesn’t accept having a boyfriend then getting married, thinking instead that good girls are just supposed to get married without having a boyfriend (but he also doesn’t believe in matchmaking so I don’t even know what to do). I’m lonely, depressed and extremely terrified. 

Since I decided to move out and found a place I’ve had 3 big emotional meltdowns where I cry until I cannot breathe but I also can’t stop.

More on that in a bit. \n\nHe likely did what he did because he had years of bad parenting himself, or allowed friends or whoever to undo any good parenting he received.

If he changes, great, but should the leopard not change its spots, then remember that it\'d be silly at best (and life-threatening at worst) to expect hugs and cuddles from the same leopard that enjoyed biting you. \n\nLastly, you mentioned that a good relationship with family is of some importance to you. On that note, I\'d suggest \n- redefine ""good relationship"". Consider settling for peace and cordiality rather than actual happiness. It\'ll already be better than what a lot of families wrecked by debt can hope to have. \n- treat your mum better than your dad. But not too well. Sure, she didn\'t emotionally blackmail you for money, but I sense she didn\'t protect you as much as she could have? \n- just be cordial. Every time dad gets emotionally abusive or talks about money, change subject, cut loose, walk away.\n- to facilitate the previous point, if you can, don\'t go home.  Meet outside for a meal like once a month or two.

LMJR500Army,1620832352,nar1c9,16,1," Recently, I started looking for jobs again. I've got a job at the moment, stable one but due to ever increasing toxic company culture, I decided to look for a job. I made my status live on LinkedIn first, letting all recruiters and connections see that I'm open to jobs in the IT area. I'm in the IT sector, mainly doing on network and infrastructure security.

Not only on LinkedIn, but also on JobsCentral, JobsStreet and etc. My experience with job hunting. When companies are interested in you, or the application you made to their open position, they will contact, get some basic information about you, and if wanted, they'll schedule a interview with you via email or whatsapp.  
But I guess, insurance companies have a different SOP. I received a missed call from a insurance company. This was the very first call from a insurance company. I got a corresponding whatsapp message, ""Hi \*\*\*\* here. I am from \*\*\*\*\*\*. Would like to know when you'd be free for a call."" I call the number back. So here's how the convo went:

Me: Hello, I received a call from this number.  
HR: Hi good afternoon. Thank you for calling back. Actually we found your profile through LinkedIn and we think that you'll be a really good fit for financial advisor role. We have arranged an interview with our manager, just would like to know if you'd be available for an interview at this time and date.

Me: I have not stated an interest in financial advisor position. My experience is in security and iot.  
I get cut off by HR.....

HR: I know, however you see the insurance sector has changed and has come a long way. I believe that insurance is a viable career path for you, you might not know.

Me: I thank you for insights, however I'm not interested in the insurance sector nor the financial sector as a whole. Hence, I would want to pursue this path. Thank you and have a great day ahead.

HR: Sure, goodbye.

But guess what, the HR is relentless. Around 6pm she whatsapp me this again:

HR: I understand that you've a certain notion of the insurance industry, and I don't blame you. However, if you give it a try, you'll see that this is sector is different from what everybody says. I and my manager will give you a detailed walkthrough of our company, our products and we'll answer any questions you have.

After that, I just blocked their numbers. Got more missed calls from the company, but ignored them.

\-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I had 8 such calls from different insurance companies. All of these were insurance companies. Trying to pressure me to a meeting with them, for a position that I didn't want and repeatedly declined. Plus I like the phrase they use 'non-obligatory interview'.  
Walao if non-obligatory then why keep messaging and calling someone to attend skype meeting when they already tell u dun wan?

I've gotten calls from healthcare, hospitality sectors proposing me jobs on healthcare assistant, hotel front desk &amp; etc. Once I decline their requests for interview, they're rather more understanding and don't bother me after I say no thanks.

But the insurance companies sop damn diff. Irritating sia. Keep calling me and trying to pressure me to go for a meeting or 'interview'

P.S. I got no beef with insurance companies. They've got their own work to do and responsibilities to fulfill. But seriously, I get irritated when someone tries to turn my no to a yes.

Chains_2000,1619626305,n0ibvw,7,1,"    Hi people. I am feeling very frustrated right now, in fact for my my entire life. I live in a toxic family (assumed by me) where my father (70+ yrs old) is always screaming and yelling at my mother. Whenever she does something that he don't like or is unhappy about, my dad would shame/diminish her, say that she is dumb, stupid, basically bad in all sorts way, and loud enough that you could hear him at least 3 house away along the corridor (HDB house). I tried to talk to him, told him that there is no need to yell, but he say he does it because he has bad hearing (which is true), resulting in the tone. But a week ago, when I just got back to my house, I saw my dad occupying my room watching his show (he has a TV with a CD player in my room) and because its my room, and I hate the sight if him, I just want to go into my room and shut the door. My mom then tells him to off the TV and give me the room, but eventually he got frustrated and threw one of his many tantrums by yelling (yes again) and this time raised his hands up holding his CD as though he is going to smash it down, trying to intimidate her. My mom is short while my dad is &gt;175cm (taller than me), so yelling + size + the act of smashing the CD (which he eventually did) is just overboard. This kinds of events has been occurring since my childhood and when I was young, my neighbors did call the police due to the noise, but I think they eventually gave up. I was scared back when I was a kid, so I didn't do anything then. But now I just want to get out. Thought about renting a place, but I just graduated from poly, going to NS soon and planning to enter Uni after, so got financial difficulties. My problem with my dad now is his screaming, bad hygiene (how bad? Well, we have ants, lizards, cockroach, and recently bedbugs, silverfish, you name it. Also way too much dust and furniture that there isn't enough space to walk, he shits in the bathroom, he doesn't flush, etc.), and him being a hoarder (like most old people are), I just don't see how I can move forward with uni. I barely made out of poly, how am I going to handle Uni?? Limited study space (35% of my room is his stuff and half of that he never even use in decades), his yelling...idk. I feel helpless. Its definitely affecting my mental health, and Uni will fuck my mental health even more. I already had a small taste of it in poly.

long story aside, i am wondering if future insurance agencies will reject me if they know i'm diagnosed. but afaik, when applying for insurance they will ask you to go to your gp for a checkup? so if i get diagnosed by a govt doctor or private clinic/another gp different from the one I get a checkup from, will the gp know of my 'past diagnosis' if i do the health screening with them, assuming i don't tell?

do insurance companies do 'background checks' with your health records from elsewhere before insuring (this doesnt sound legal tbh)? and if they somehow find out that i have or had a mental health condition what will happen, is it just a termination of the insurance or is it a legal issue?

and lastly would a uni clinic store their records in the government's health system? im assuming my uni health centre is considered private and not affiliated to govt. idk man. would be pretty fishy of me if i were to ask them directly haha but if anyone happens to know this or has past experience, please share thanks :)

alexathy,1588953867,gfvvox,29,1,"Hi guys.

So since 1.5 month ago I’ve been feeling very depressed, mainly due to the issues that the coronavirus had caused. 

Long story short, I am graduating right into the worst-ever recession, lost many hard-to-come-by career and self-development opportunities which I have planned and worked hard for the past year, and got myself heartbroken over a LDR. It literally felt like my whole world fell apart within days.

I haven’t really been myself this 1.5 month. I used to be a motivated individual, but I’ve lost all motivation to do anything. It felt like everything has lost its meaning, like life has lost its meaning. I also have constant anxiety attacks and spend most of my nights crying myself to sleep, in addition to having insomnia. I find myself trying to push everyone away, and leaving myself to wallow in sadness. Initially, I did try to confide to my parents, but every time I do I felt useless as they try to talk down my emotions by saying “they had it worse”. I don’t really need that. Friends who showed their concerned have been a little helpful, although I’ll get depressed again once the anxiety hits. Now they’re urging me to see a therapist.

But I’m lost at what to do. I haven’t been this depressed for a long while, and have never received professional help prior to this. I don’t know if I’ll be comfortable with a face-to-face confrontation with a stranger. I also don’t want my parents to know that I’m seeking professional help for my mental health (I don’t want to add on to their worries), but it’ll be hard to hide it from them now due to the circuit breaker. Also, I’m afraid that therapy is gonna be expensive, and I don’t know if I can afford it or not. I’m thinking of opting for anti-depressant meds but I’m not sure where I’ll be able to get them prescribed here.

I’m not trying to gain sympathy here, just asking for suggestions to make my current situation better. So if anyone has got any recommendations, do let me know.

Remind yourself no matter how bad things may appear to be, they will all pass. All things come to pass, eventually. You are not alone feeling depressed during this period. Try to reframe your perspective. As sucky as it is to graduate during this time, your entire career still has a long road ahead. Believe it or not, you will have ample opportunities to do well in the future. You are young. Worrying is normal, but don’t let it paralyze you. Exercise or start exercising. It will help lift your mood. Get some sunlight on your skin. Find a strong friend who can listen without being affected. Stay away from anyone who makes you feel worse when you are down. Cuddle but beware of getting into a rebound relationship. Rant on reddit if you have to. Thinking aloud and sharing with another human being can be cathartic and it can help sort out your thoughts.  Try to be your own therapist. Imagine yourself as a friend you care very much and needs an outside perspective. Some circumstances are really beyond our control. Pandemics are one of them. Find the silver lining in every misery or make one up! You can always decide how to respond to external events.\n\nHang in there. The CB is ending soon. Every time you wake up, you are one day closer to the return of a more normal life. I believe with the change in atmosphere and the return of more freedom, you will find your depression going away. That day will come soon. Meanwhile, use that smart brain of yours to do something productive. You used to be highly motivated yeah? Remember why you were so. Watch the same kind of movies, read the same kind of books, listen to the same kind of music that pumped you up. Anything. What’s happening now is a speedbump in your life, not a catastrophe. Or give yourself permission for once to take things slow. Use this time to reacquaint yourself, contemplate and find clarity in your life. Maybe you’ll realize you don’t need much to be happy. And you can emerge from this episode and eventual depressed economy a stronger person.\n\nIf CB is over and you still feel the same, you can choose to seek medical intervention. A private therapist maybe expensive but you can find relatively affordable help and medication at IMH if you have a public (polyclinic) doctor’s referral. They will probably give you Zoloft for depression, but drugs can bring about other problems.  I am not a professional, but I’ve been there. Anyway, although you shouldn’t really be taking advice from a strange old man on reddit, I am not unfamiliar being depressed. I feel you and I wish to be of some help.

It’s a one stop platform for you to find volunteer opportunities with different agencies (Youth Corps, National Arts Council, etc). Or if you have a calling or something you wanna start, why not?\n* Family;  \nIf they contribute to how you’re feeling, try to establish space if you don’t. If they’re fussy, like mine, just appear in the living room every once in a while and get them a glass of water so they can’t scold you for copping yourself in the room. Just wayang. Sometimes you gotta do these small things to prevent other things. That’s reality.\n* Friends;  \nYou already did that so just continue. Check in on them, talk to them, have lunch/ dinner on discord, zoom, houseparty or whatever you prefer.\n\n**Continuous learning**\\- You can use this time to spice up your portfolio (which you usually won’t have the time to do it unless the company asks you for your resume lol). Clean up your resume, write up a personal statement. Take up courses/ learn a new skill.

Anything that was really funny only lasted like a few seconds. Nothing was interesting. Lost the spark in my life.\n\nI\'ve looked at youtube videos of people born without limbs yet doing fine in life.

No one teaches them how to react when their kid goes into depression, but it is still best to share that you feel the need to seek for medical help.\n\nDidn\'t seek help back then, because guys were suppose to be strong.

Yellow-Apple-Tree,1597052369,i71sf6,29,1,"Lately I’ve been seeing many questions regarding seeking help for mental health. As someone who has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and taking daily doses of antidepressants and insomnia pills, I think I can give some insights to how the process and the costs would be like.

**Public Sector**

* Most polyclinics have a psychology department with some psychologists and psychiatrists (sometimes regular GPs are used) on staff.
* I was encouraged to see a GP first to book an appointment with a psychologist to be assessed and diagnosed for my condition. You can do this if seeing a psychologist straight away is too big a jump for you. Tell the GP about your symptoms or as much as you’re comfortable sharing. This will give the psychologist more information to start off with and your next session with them can progress faster. This first session won’t cost too much (regular GP consultation costs)
* When you see the psychologist, they’ll assess your situation and try to come up with a diagnosis. If you need medication, there are usually some available at the polyclinics already. If not, you may be referred to SGH or IMH to get your medication.
* On a regular basis, you’ll see a **psychiatrist and a psychologist.** Psychiatrists are the ones giving you prescriptions (they are medically trained) psychologists don’t give prescriptions but they are the ones handling your therapy (which you will be recommended to go for).
* **Psychiatrist consultations costs:** can be around SGD30+, not including prescription. The medication is rather affordable. I’m on 2 tablets of Sertraline a day and a 2.5 months’ supply of that is around SGD40.
* Finding medication may need some time because everyone’s bodies react differently to different medication. I had to switch from Mirtazapine to Sertraline because I got some side-effects that weren’t considered normal - fever. Sertraline gave me chills once in a while but other than that, I’m mostly content with taking it for now. Some people may have to keep trying different kinds of medication to see which ones are more suitable for your body. What works for me might not work for you.
* **Psychologist consultations cost:** therapy is about SGD87 per session. I’m not sure if there are different kinds of therapy that have different costs but this was what I always got. My first session was simply getting to know my situation. So don’t worry if it feels like a wasted appointment. First sessions are usually used to let the psychologist know what’s going on with you, how you want to be helped and planning the goals you want to achieve in therapy.
* **If you’re a student:** not sure about JC students, but I’m aware that some universities (like NUS and SUTD) have medical insurance that covers mental health treatments (both therapy and medication). Primary schools, Secondary schools and JCs have school counsellors. Some universities have counsellors too. They usually aren’t licensed therapists but they do listen to you and try to help albeit to a limited extent. If you would prefer to start small, or if you want to save money, school counselling is a decent start.
* **If you’re a working adult:** check with your company / employer for medical benefits. If you work in civil service, you’re likely covered. (Or so I’ve heard)
* **Personal information:** Don’t worry about your psychologist or psychiatrists contacting your parents or relatives about your situation unless you are showing obvious signs of getting yourself into danger like if you have clear plans on attempting suicide. They are professionals and mostly know how often dysfunctional families are contributors to mental illness.
* **Short-falls of public sector mental health treatment (appointment availability):** the psychologists and psychiatrists mostly work on weekdays and don’t extend to weekends. That means you will have to take time off your weekday schedules to attend your appointments. Appointments are also not easy to come by. After one session, your next appointment can be 2 months from then. You can always call in later to see if people cancel their appointments and free up space for you but public sector healthcare usually tends to a large number of the population so it might take some time before they get to you.

**Private Sector**

* I haven’t been through the private sector but based on what my psychologist has told me and based on personal research too, it’s considerably more expensive. (Nearly twice the price) 
* **Psychiatrist consultation cost:** I’m not sure about this one but I heard it can go up to SGD200 (before GST).
* **Psychologist consultation cost:** from SGD150 (before GST) per therapy session with a psychologist in a private clinic.
* **Upsides:** private clinics actually have weekend consultations. So you won’t have to miss school or work just to turn up for your appointment. More appointment slots are available and the waiting time for the next appointment (or even just waiting time outside the consultation room) is much shorter. Convenience and efficiency for your money.
* If anyone knows more about the private sector, please add on to this. It will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Lastly, IMH is open 24/7. If you feel that you are unsafe to be left alone with yourself, if you feel that your mental health state is not well for you to safely get through the next few hours, you may make your way down to IMH at any time of the day. You don’t even have to ring them up. Even if you do, they’ll ask you to head down to the institution anyway. Here’s the number just in case: 6389 2000

My mom is currently warded at IMH’s MDU(Mood Disorder Unit), she has been battling with minor to severe withdrawal symptoms from Benzo abuse for the past few months (even attempted suicide). It’s almost been a week since she was warded and there seem to be no or little improvement to her mood/condition. Me and my father have been visiting her on a daily basis.

I wished I could have stepped in or intervene earlier when I started noticing her taking doses of Benzos that was way above what she was pescribed by her doctor but I brushed it off, which may have led to her current condition. This was observed by me during the circuit breaker period.

Her list of withdrawal symptoms which I have recorded till date, most of the symptoms occur when she is having an “episode”.

Recurring:
1. Anxiety Attacks
2. Depression
3. Heartburn (Burning sensation in abdominal region)
4. Acid Reflux
5. Lost of interest/mood/appetite
6. Insomnia
7. Always in a daze
8. Difficulty in swallowing (Most recent)
9. Difficulty in urination

Previously/Uncommon:
1. Pins and needles in limbs
2. Cold Sweat
3. Dry Mouth
4. Hypersensitivity
5. Delirium

Her abuse was mainly on Apralozam(Xanax) and Zolpidem(Ambien). With Zolpidem being the main abuse.

Honestly I just hope someone that had similar experiences or someone that is in this field of expertise to share with me on how to cope this issue. Will my mom ever able to be rid of all these symptoms or will there be some permanent damage to her nervous system/cognitive ability. Is there other options or places to seek treatment that is focused on this (Benzodiazepines Withdrawal Syndrome)?.

What I am to say next is easier said than done, however, you must not feel entitled to being the solution to your mother's issue nor must you even try to seek being a part of it.

coldpalecheeks,1603870050,jjjdn6,63,1,"I actually have been considering quitting my job before the pandemic, but I thought I should just suck it up to what is the supposedly ""working environment"". However after working for about 1 year plus, my anxiety level has increased drastically and I even have slight panic attacks when I hear my work laptop alarm ring. As common as it may seem, my superior is very toxic towards me (I know it happens all the time that is why I sucked it up even though I realised this 3 months after I started working). I didn't like my job because I was ""lured"" into it due to its vague jobscope (partly my error but I just graduated thus I thought if I can land in a job, it's already good enough) and I'm doing something that is not even something I enjoy, which is IT. I'm actually not stressed over my workload because tbvh my workload is not heavy. But within the things that I need to do, I am always picked on and reprimanded as if I can't do small things right and I feel very very very worthless in the company. I stopped learning new things within few months after I entered the company, and I even sometimes do nothing at work because I am too ""new"" to handle those work. When I request for more work, I am always rejected and will be told that if there is any work, it will be assigned to me. In more than a year, I can say (feeling so embarrassed) that everyday, I only do work for maybe 2 to 3 hours. It seems like a luxury, that's what everyone is telling me. I do the minimum but yet I can earn proper salary. But this is causing me to have so much anxiety especially when my supervisor pick on me saying things like: you only have these things to do. I followed EXACTLY what my supervisor said for the work to be done, but in turn she said she didn't, which makes 1 hour work become 3 days of work. This is just one example, there are more, but basically I faced anxiety on a daily basis like mentioned previously and any work alarm triggers my panic attacks. As this is my first job, I very new and I really want to learn more and add values. In my current company, I can say that I contribute zero. Okay maybe 0.5, I shall give myself some credit. On top of that, I have zero employment benefits from the company even though it is a big one as I was signed through an agency. No bonus (talking about before pandemic, but obviously now still don't have any), whatever you name, I don't have them, except for basics like annual leave medical leave etc, but all the bare minimum. I feel I'm actually way better if I find somewhere else with lower salary but with slightly more benefits. 

I won't say I exactly have a lot of savings because I have school loan to pay.  If I really quit my job, I am planning to take up part time jobs such as tutoring, transcribing, or whatsoever event based job. If not, I will take some short term contract jobs in hospitals etc. I plan to quit not to rest, but just to stay away for the toxicity in the current company. I'm very lucky to be a Singaporean, as well as living with my parents. My only commitment in terms of money is my loan and phone bills. If I am jobless with no income, I have savings that can pay off my debt for at least 4 months. I am also lucky enough to still have this job, I know that. But I feel like I'm suffering and I cry every time I talk about work, especially what I do at work. 

I know it won't be easy to quit my current job before getting another offer, but I realised I was not consistent with finding job due to my mental health and I basically start to become less productive. I have insomnia, and my hair falls like mad, till the point when people see me, they ask if I've been dropping lots of hair. My appetite became weird, like I ate quite a bit but I lost weight.

Context: I’m looking for a new job since my promotion was blocked by global HR (not sure if grandboss also did stuff). Manager was unhappy on my behalf (he has been strongly advocating for me and even said outright in my performance review that I am ready to move up) and told me to look for a job and ask for a counteroffer if I really want to stay on at the company. I’ve been looking out somewhat in 2020, but it was not until my manager’s words that I seriously started looking out. 

So, I’ve had a couple of opportunities, most of which I’m not exactly interested in (those are like the tier 2/tier 3 jobs and companies I’ve applied to as a backup just in case my tier 1 companies reject me (which is currently the case). 

The only one that I’m at least interested in right now has a commute of about 1hr 10 mins on paper. It will be purely by bus since it’s located in an industrial estate with no connecting MRTs, so the time might increase depending on traffic. The only reason why I’m considering this job is because it has potential to put me on the path I want to be.

Another consideration is that I suffer from insomnia, and the long commute has an impact on my sleep and health. 

No idea about the salary and benefits yet as I’m still in the midst of the interview process but I’ve made it to the final round, while continuing to apply to my tier 1 jobs in the hope of landing an interview. 

As all of the interviews are done online currently, I’ve requested an in person meeting just to get a sense of the commute to help me make my decision. Even then, should I continue with the process or drop out early if it is something of consideration to me though?

Of course, all these considerations will be pointless if I get rejected in the end.

Saw this in a local forum. Are there any local political party that advocate such policies?

* Reduce public service headcount and wages (no more million dollar salaries for government)
* No more welfare programmes (take away all those PG/Merdaka/CHAS/Skillfuture/Careshield/ etc)
* Privatize CPF into a super-annuity. People have choice to choose which companies they want to appoint to manage their retirement funds. At age 62 statutory retirement age, they get back 100% of the money.
* Privatize our MRT system and allow the market to price the services of bus and train services.
* Legalise trade unions so that trade unions can fight for higher salary, not allow government to dictate the salary.
* Reduce legislation, take away all those unnecessary licenses and laws. Only keep crucial laws that protect lives, uphold personal responsibilities (e.g. no drugs) and not take away free enterprise.
* Reduce number of statutory boards, ministries and government linked companies to a minimal.
* Negotiate treaties with foreign countries to allow freedom to trade but not freedom of labour movement. We are a sovereignty after all.
* Abolish progressive taxes. Instead, every citizen pays a flat percentage of their income at 5%. Government should only operate within that income and cut off any slack/fats within the bureaucracy.
* Cut GST to 5%.
* Legalise voluntary euthanasia for bankrupts and anyone above retirement age. Person who sign up for voluntary euthanasia must go through a 'cooldown' period of 2 weeks before the process can proceed.
* Allow privatization of HDB flats after 50 years lease (i.e. \[I\]able to sell HDB flats to foreigners for any flats that last lesser than 49 years lease\[/I\])
* Increase corporate tax to 20% from current 17% for those with at least 2 million turnover.
* Privatize all schools and educators by 2050. Government should not be paying for teachers and principals. Instead, introduce private school coupons for local born students which students can use to offset their school fees.
* Privatize and create an Open Water Market(OWM). People have the right and freedom to choose their water supplier and cheaper water. The national water grid will still be maintain by the same agent (i.e. SP Services) but water suppliers can supply their own water as long as water conform to the PUB standard.
* Legalise late-term abortion(TOP). Parents shouldn't have to choose between their finances and having a baby. It is the couple's own choice to choose whether or not to have the baby. ​

Drugs on the other hand are pretty overweighted on the negative side through and through (though medical marijuana is another whole can of worms).

I mean, if society really cares about harm on the body, mental health and obesity will be treated with a more serious tone and a gun to your head.\n\nThe main issue with drugs lie with funding to terrorism and secret society. The drug trade is largely controlled by those on the other side, especially produced by rebels and terrorists, to fund their campaigns. (Of course, we can debate if certain governments are involved and taking a cut out of it, but not the purpose of discussion here). \n\nSo, by banning drug trade and effectively curbing demand will deplete fundings to illegal organisation greatly. The margins on drugs are especially high after all. \n\nAnd on the other note yes, drugs is harmful. A society largely dependant on drugs is no joking matter, just look at the opioid epidemic in the US. It will create societal effects that cause people to stop functioning, being a burden to society and what not. \n\nSo why not alcohol and cigarettes. I think its largely to do with also how it can be taxed. Cigarettes by quantity and alcohol by volume amount. Furthermore, while these consumable have effects which are harmful, its not to the extent of drugs. Imagine the effects of heroin vs smoking. While users can highly depend on both, the effect of heroin is definitely more significant than smoking. This is also highly suspected as to why e-cigs are banned because theres no fixed amount to tax for the nicotine. \n\nBy and large, there are certain 'vices' that Singapore do tolerate, as long as it is not too much of a bane to society at large.

I want to know if there is any help available despite Covid. Are there any residential treatments or places he can go currently for therapy? I once was almost admitted to IMH for suicidal tendencies. Is it possible for him to be admitted there as he states that he is using drugs to also cope with his depression?",askSingapore,9633,Where to get help for drugs?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/g9cm1s/where_to_get_help_for_drugs/,,"[""NAMS @IMH. That'll be your best bet without getting the authorities involved. Main thing is that your brother has to be committed to the cause and wanting actual help. The application and waiting time for admission into NAMS could take a while unless you have a recommendation from some social organization/halfway houses. \n\nOnce admitted, he'll be assigned to a counsellor to begin the rehabilitation program. Do keep in mind that they cannot keep any patients that admitted themselves willingly from leaving though, this means that your brother has the right to leave the facility as and when he wants(best to keep this knowledge from him). And if he leaves anytime before his treatment is completed then it'll be exceptionally difficult to re-enter into the program again.\n\nThis is going to be very difficult for both your brother and family. Support from family members is really the key factor, and in order to support them, abolish whatever prejudice you guys have in regards to the addiction he has, drug abusers often have no control and give in to their urges.\n\nWhen all else fails, then I'm very sorry to tell you that the only remaining option is to get the authorities involved. That is going to be very heartbreaking but is also the needed step for both you guys and him to be able to move forward.

Things don’t stay secret for long. If it concerns a safety issue (such as taking drugs) the person/organisation might be obligated to report it under their “code of conduct” \n\nI’ll be specific. If you and your brother are seeing any psychiatrists or psychologists, NEVER EVER tell them about this. Under their practice, they can be OBLIGATED to take action, be it hospitalisation or IMH because this is considered a safety concern. As for authority side, i’m not sure how it functions and if the psychiatrist/psychologist will release any info to the authorities.\n\nBut of course if there’s really no other choice, you can look for an organisation that helps, but only give the necessary details, don’t say too much, they can use it against you.\n\nSingapore isn’t lenient with drugs, it’s not really safe to talk about it unless there’s no other way. In the harsh way, they rehabilitate, detox and throw you in jail if you take drugs. \n\nDetoxification is a hell process. The body goes into withdrawal and everything feels like crushing down. But loved ones can always ease the process. No matter what you decide, please support your brother positively in any way you can. (Just don’t be overly helpful)\n\nThe type of drug used is also a key factor. Some drugs hit harder than others, cause different symptoms and some may even have different penalties. Maybe you can tell us what kind of drug it is if you know. Some drugs pass through the body faster, meaning it detoxes faster and it’s harder to detect as time goes on\n\nAs for online security, you’re safe. Singapore government cannot remotely hack into your phone etc and perform any arrests. This comes down to the matter of who you say it to and what information you give. Now that you’ve said it’s your brother, make sure the authorities can’t identify you, or they’ll easily trace to your brother and that’s it. \n\n**Short answer: Try not to find any people/organisation for help, we don’t know if they’re legally bound to reveal the truth.

If the clinic is privately owned, they are technically supposed to report any cases they come across, but some may practice discretion.\n\nI previously worked in a private psychiatric clinic where the policy was to ""forget"" to report clients that were active drug users, and we would wait till they were clean before performing any official drug tests. This was done so that the clients would trust us. If they were afraid of being reported each time they came in, they would not be honest about their drug usage and this would prevent them for receiving the care that they need.\n\nThis is, of course, specific to the clinic I worked at and I cannot speak for all private clinics.

Recently I saw a disturbing post. It was quickly removed, but it was a sec 2 student who asked if he could take triple humanities in sec 3. https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/jdie1u

This would have been unthinkable during the LKY years.

I am disturbed that our youths can think like this.

After the HCI humanities teacher was arrested for drug usage and the NUS prof was arrested for sexually harrassing students, I was roused to action at this seeming growing problem in our society.

Our ideas of arts and humanities cultures are mainly imported from Europe and the USA, basically western liberal societies. This is fundamentally incompatible with our asian society.

Furthermore, these liberal values are often corrupt and degenerate morality. While stem and science push students to search for truth and promotes a structured way of thinking, arts has 'no right answer' and causes young minds to become muddled and susceptible to being corrupted by these sorts of western values. It culminates in drugs and rape as has been proven time and time again.

I feel this is unacceptable in our society.

Furthermore we are a society where arts has never been a big part of our heritage. We are after all just a small island.

Instead, for society to prosper, we should lean into our comparative advantage. Which is stem and the science subjects.

It was the stem subjects that built a society of an island nation so prosperous that our young are able to indulge in arts education.

I feel that our young cannot appreciate this

Reeducation might have benefits.

I was talking to my nephew who had decided to go into the arts stream in JC. He was such a promising child and when I heard the path he was going down, I was very very upset and disappointed. I talked to his parents and apparently they are supportive.

I asked what they would do if he started doing drugs, or came out as a homosexual.

It is sad that even the older generation is starting to bend to the young generation. In truth, it should be the other way around.",askSingapore,26838,Do you support re-education programmes for arts and humanities students in Singapore?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/jya52j/do_you_support_reeducation_programmes_for_arts/,1.0,"['Interesting view, but i cant say that u are wrong.

Whereas, STEM plays a role in progressing society.

This is fundamentally incompatible with our asian society.\n\nhistorically, asians tend to be more conservative unlike the westerners. that, i have to agree. however, with the rise of globalisation, our society's way of thinking has already merged with those of western societies. i guess what may concern you is the freedom of speech that we have in singapore, supposedly brought about by western influences. sometimes it may get overwhelming. however, we humans are meant to be social creatures. we have to communicate our thoughts. in order to have proper conversation, we need to learn how to put ourselves in other peoples' shoes and view from their stand. humanities, more specifically literature, teach us how to do so. oh, also to add, you brought in history in your post too, which shows that you have benefitted from history albeit only to a small extent, for it had expanded your knowledge. \n\n&gt;While stem and science push students to search for truth and promotes a structured way of thinking, arts has 'no right answer' and causes young minds to become muddled and susceptible to being corrupted by these sorts of western values.

Let people live the way they want.', '[deleted]', 'I sincerely hope that you are joking. But in the unfortunate and sad event that you are not, and that you truly believe what you wrote, here are some things to consider:\n\n(1) You are equating arts and humanities with Western cultures, which is fallacious. It may be true that much of arts and humanities, especially in globalised countries like Singapore, is heavily influenced by Western cultures and ideas. But this does not mean that arts and humanities just are Western cultures, or that the study of arts and humanities just is the study of Western cultures. Do the thousands of years of East Asian and South Asian civilisations mean nothing? Case in point: I took some humanities modules at university, which included the study of Confucius\' Analects, Mencius, Upanishad, Mahabharata, etc etc etc.\n\n(2) You are equating Western cultures with \'liberal values\' or \'progressive values\', whatever these terms may mean, which is fallacious. If you read the news and know your world affairs, you will realise that Western cultures and ideas are not limited to just \'liberal values\'. (For that matter, there are Chinese thinkers that also promote \'liberal and progressive values\'. But that is another topic.) In the thousands of years of Western cultures and ideas, you can find ideas that are comparable to what you might call ""Asian values"", again, whatever that term may mean. Values that promote piety, family, public decency, social responsibilities, these are not the preserve of ""Asian values"", even if they are typically and incorrectly thought to be.\n\n(3) You are equating getting a scientific education with studying science subjects and getting STEM jobs. I am a strong and loud advocate of scientific education, by which I mean, teach people to be inquisitive, to be able to distinguish facts from opinions and speculations, to understand the process discovery and experimentation. Everyone should have a scientific education, so that they do not fall prey to fake news and indoctrinations. But having a scientific education does not necessarily mean that the person must end up studying just science subjects, or getting an STEM job. A person studying arts and humanities can, and in fact I would argue ought to, have a scientific mind too. I applaud your nephew\'s choice of study, and applaud his family for supporting him, for at least this shows that he and his family did not fall prey to your indoctrination.\n\n(4) You are equating getting an education with being indoctrinated. Receiving an education involves being taught how to think by oneself, based on all available facts, opinions and ideological frameworks, without being influenced by pride, prejudice or presumption. It does not involve being taught what to think, as your post seems to be suggesting.\n\nIn fact, I highly suspect that people who think in the narrow and careless way that you do are typically people who have not had the benefits of a proper scientific education, but instead are indoctrinated by extreme conservatism. Any scientifically minded and educated person would be able to point out the myriads of fallacies in your post.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\n&gt;""for society to prosper, we should lean into our comparative advantage""\n\nIndeed, well said. And Singapore\'s comparative advantage lies in the fact that we learn from the best, regardless of whether it is the West or the East, and we try our very best not to be dogmatic or bigoted about our values. Your post, and what you seem to believe in, is exactly the kind of things that does not exemplify our comparative advantage, and therefore ought to be discarded.\n\nAlso, just as a counterpoint, there are also scientists who do drugs, sexually harass minors, rape people. Just read the news. And before you say, because these scientists are influenced by Western education, I would also point you to Chinese, Korean and Japanese scientists that do these things. Just read the Chinese, Korean, and Japanese news.', ""Also, being a homosexual, or an LGBTQ+, is not a choice, as your post seems to suggest. If it really were a choice, don't you think thousands of LGBTQ+ around the world would have chosen to be straight, instead of suffering the mental traumas and facing the discrimination from people like you? Who doesn't want to be accepted by their families and live a normal life? If only it were a choice.""]"

Saw this in a local forum. Are there any local political party that advocate such policies?

* Reduce public service headcount and wages (no more million dollar salaries for government)
* No more welfare programmes (take away all those PG/Merdaka/CHAS/Skillfuture/Careshield/ etc)
* Privatize CPF into a super-annuity. People have choice to choose which companies they want to appoint to manage their retirement funds. At age 62 statutory retirement age, they get back 100% of the money.
* Privatize our MRT system and allow the market to price the services of bus and train services.
* Legalise trade unions so that trade unions can fight for higher salary, not allow government to dictate the salary.
* Reduce legislation, take away all those unnecessary licenses and laws. Only keep crucial laws that protect lives, uphold personal responsibilities (e.g. no drugs) and not take away free enterprise.
* Reduce number of statutory boards, ministries and government linked companies to a minimal.
* Negotiate treaties with foreign countries to allow freedom to trade but not freedom of labour movement. We are a sovereignty after all.
* Abolish progressive taxes. Instead, every citizen pays a flat percentage of their income at 5%. Government should only operate within that income and cut off any slack/fats within the bureaucracy.
* Cut GST to 5%.
* Legalise voluntary euthanasia for bankrupts and anyone above retirement age. Person who sign up for voluntary euthanasia must go through a 'cooldown' period of 2 weeks before the process can proceed.
* Allow privatization of HDB flats after 50 years lease (i.e. \[I\]able to sell HDB flats to foreigners for any flats that last lesser than 49 years lease\[/I\])
* Increase corporate tax to 20% from current 17% for those with at least 2 million turnover.
* Privatize all schools and educators by 2050. Government should not be paying for teachers and principals. Instead, introduce private school coupons for local born students which students can use to offset their school fees.
* Privatize and create an Open Water Market(OWM). People have the right and freedom to choose their water supplier and cheaper water. The national water grid will still be maintain by the same agent (i.e. SP Services) but water suppliers can supply their own water as long as water conform to the PUB standard.
* Legalise late-term abortion(TOP). Parents shouldn't have to choose between their finances and having a baby. It is the couple's own choice to choose whether or not to have the baby. ​

&amp;#x200B;

***Background***: Graduating with mass media/marketing bachelor's degree from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. GPA is 3.5/4. 2 3-month internships at a reputed startup (which is also famous in SG). Age 20. Requirement is an entry-level job in marketing &amp; communications in Singapore. Currently living in KL. 

&amp;#x200B;

***Question***: 

&amp;#x200B;

1. First off, is it realistic for me to aim to get an entry-level job in SG? I know there's competition for visas but is it that bad? 
2. Second, do I first apply for jobs, get online interviews, then ask them to apply for a work visa on my behalf? So will they have to sponsor me? And how much time would that take, assuming a company is ready to take the efforts? 
3. Third, can I first come to SG on a tourist visa, hunt for jobs, and then convert it to a work one? Or is there a special work-search visa I can apply for? I think I stand a better chance first coming into the country and then hunting as employers would prefer F2F live interviews over video online ones, anytime, right? 
4. Any tips you can give me to increase my chances of getting in? 
5. What's the timeline like? 

&amp;#x200B;

I really love this country and its my life's biggest dream to come and make a mark here. Any guidance would be appreciated. I'm willing to fight for it but only if I have any chance.

wanted to post this on r/singapore but didnt have enough karma/account age but i really need your opinions and insights on the topic as the strike is coming up soon. so if you can get redditors on other subreddits to comment below, please do! thank you all.

there will be a global #fridaysforfuture strike on the 24th may. the fridays for future movement is a movement that was started by Greta Thunberg to protest against the lack of action on the climate crisis. the hashtags #FridaysForFuture and #Climatestrike spread and many students and adults began to protest outside of their parliaments and local city halls all over the world.

however, nothing has really been organised in singapore yet even though other countries have begun doing weekly strikes and i am unsure if many students will even come aboard the whole climate strike idea. in the previous global #fridaysforfuture strike on the 15th march, there were two students who organised an online strike in singapore but that has been it since. there has not been much response from the government and i myself am interested in organising a strike for the students here.

i am curious as to see what your thoughts are on the idea of students in singapore skipping school to fight for climate action. as many of us, students and parents alike are very academic-oriented, i worry that many students will not want to go for such an event. i have spoken to a few of my classmates and friends about the topic and most of them either arent allowed to go or just cant care less. i have also talked to my parents about it and they feel that skipping school is unncessary and like we can just do the protest after school hours.

please enlighten me on any laws regarding strikes because i do not want to be arrested/shot down by a swat team or something and let me know your opinions on strikes and climate action alike. do you think an online strike would be more appealing and more importantly, effective? or do you think a strike is unncessary but just a protest outside of school hours?

My name is Johnathan, I'm reaching out on behalf of a team of analysts advising health organizations and agencies in their fight against Covid-19. Our objective is to gather data and information on how different countries deal with and fight the pandemic - and through that hopefully advise others how they can better fight Covid-19. Since Singapore is relatively dealing well with the current outbreak, we are eager to learn from you.

**We would like to ask for your help with recommendations for sources, experts and/or websites that we could learn from about Covid-19 in Singapore.**

**Also, we would like to hear from you and from your personal knowledge**, every little piece of information can help:

* **Public space** \- Are you allowed outside? must you wear masks or gloves if so? Is there still public transportation? Are there public disinfection sites outside? Does the government disinfect public places?
* **Getting checked** \- How are people being checked for the virus? What technology is being used to check? Where do people go to, to get checked? How do you decide who needs to get checked?
* **Using quarantine** \- What steps were taken and when? Who is placed under quarantine? Who still can go to work? How is the quarantine enforced? Are people under surveillance?
* **Learning from the past** \- What did you learn from SARS? How were you better prepared for Covid-19? Do you have special ""National alertness"" stages? what do they mean?
* **Medical personnel** \- How are medical personnel and their families are being kept safe?
* **Contact tracing** \- How is ""contact tracing"" done? How do you trace the paths of people who became sick and might have contaminated others?

That's it for now - If you are able to help us with these questions, if you know some sources or websites where we can find data and information, or know someone who is an expert in the field and is willing to help - we would appreciate it greatly.

We are currently not under lockdown, but certain groups of people are either advised to stay home or are strictly no allowed outside, such as those who have returned from other countries have to serve a 14-day Leave of Absence at home, those who have come into close contacts with confirmed cases will be under strict quarantine, and those who show respiratory symptoms such as cough, sore, throat or fever are given a 5-day medical certificate and required to stay at home for the whole duration. \n\nThe government has assured us that public transport is still fully functional and have been regularly disinfecting public places.

If mild, the doctor will give the patient a 5-day medical certificate and advise them to monitor their health closely, but if severe/the patient’s symptoms worsen, the doctor will refer the patient to a hospital to get tested. As of now, I am not sure what technology they use and how the testing is done, but one thing that I am sure of is that testing is free of charge.\n\nLearning from the past\nA quote from Minister Leong Hoe Nam: “SARS turned out to be a blessing for Singapore. We realized how infectious diseases spread and how we have to be on top of the curve,  in terms of quarantining and surveillance, and being aware and having the diagnostic kits, as well as the health care workers all ready. That SARS experience has prepared us for the current epidemic. And if you look at it, Singapore is emerging out of this epidemic earlier than expected. We have controlled most cases and all of this comes from the roots from SARS. We actually see the government being proactive. We actually see the people being cooperative with the government.”\n\nI personally do not have much to comment on about this topic, but if you would like to read more the link is here[...](https://www.pri.org/stories/2020-03-02/covid-19-lessons-singapore-and-how-it-handled-sars)\n\nMedical personnel\nHaving no firsthand experience as a medical worker, I am unable to comment much on this topic either. However, Singapore’s hospitals are definitely well equipped with medical equipment. When dealing with confirmed cases, our healthcare workers wear full-body protective gear, including goggles, N95 masks, and hazmat-style suits.  There is currently no shortage of surgical masks either, as the government has informed us that these masks are not necessary for our personal protection, they are for people who feel unwell to use so they may not infect other people. \n\n\nContact tracing\nSingapore has ramped up its contact tracing efforts by having 20 contact tracing teams instead of just 3. In schools, students have been made to sit in fixed, exam-style seatings to reduce intermingling, and if lessons are held with students of different classes the students are to be seated in groups(within their classes). Teachers are to take pictures of every seating arrangement for the sole purpose of contact tracing. At our Community Centres, we are also made to scan QR codes and give our names, identification numbers, mobile numbers, and declare we have not had any contact with suspected cases or those on LOA.The government has also recently developed an app just for contact tracing named TraceTogether.

Then, I started to notice that my face is on his screen for a while, he used it the check up on me and I stopped him before he could take any photos of me.

I asked him why he did that, why the camera was pointed at me. He yelled at me and tried to prove that I’m insane, he kept saying BS like “I’m playing with my phone, what the f is wrong with you? Who do you think you are? I was playing with my camera, my phone, u dont allow me? You are wrong”.

I told him, “No, I don’t care what you do with your phone, just don’t take photo with my face on it. I saw my face there. You’re the wrong one”. The old perv kept bullying me verbally until he got tired.

We are brought up largely to be told to stay away from danger and avoid getting involve into trouble with others, this sadly did not consider the need to stand up against what is wrong. The good news is things are gradually changing. More and more people from the younger generation are standing up against others' wrongdoing. But this will take sometime before it becomes common in the country.\n\nMeanwhile, do stay safe and don't be afraid to stand up for yourself. Bus Drivers are trained to handle such situation. If you feel that you are being harassed in a bus, you can walk up to the bus driver and inform him about the situation. The driver has a specific SOP to follow when such situation arises. Similarly, any public areas, if you found yourself to be in danger, ask for help from a stranger, walk quickly towards a service counter and tell them about it. Someone will be there to help you."", 'Thank you! I’ve always expected Singapore to be the safest country.

Hope you get over this incident soon! \n\nOne other thing. People not interfering in someone else’s affairs (including incidents like these) is a cultural thing. As many people said already, most of the people here avoid such situations, doesn’t mean they are coward or so. Hence i would request you to please do not call any nationality/ society coward, trying to give them learning about how they were brought up, because of one incident. \n\nTaken care and stay safe!!', 'Welp i hope this doesnt leave u the impression that all sgreans are like this, i think at least for me i would be more than willing to stand up for u in the scenario.', ""Sorry you had to experience that.

Thankfully another passenger grabbed the man's phone and used it as bait to get him off at the next station where we went to the SMRT concierge. Police was called and the man was forced to unlock his phone and show the camera roll which lo and behold had me among many other school girls pictures. \n\nCan't remember what happened next because I just wanted to get home. Instead the kind passenger said he'll talk to the police etc. They did take my information down but I don't remember being reached out to. \n\nMy point is, please don't lose hope in the system.

You got the side view seat and start to daydream while looking outside the window. Then you get this eery vibe (spider-sense!) and turn to see a man that looked like he was in his twenties facing your direction. He just stares at you with a fixed expression. Seconds become minutes and the uncomfortable reality sets in that he was doing it purposefully. The intentions remain unclear, and yet it feels threatening. When you try to hide your face behind a person, he moves just slightly to his left to get a clear view of... you. You can feel his eyes piercing through you as you struggle in the seat to find a haven. Luckily for you, an SIA flight attendant came on the bus and has gotten a gist of what was happening. She blocks the view, only to realise the view has now changed to her. Tension rises when she realises she was the next target. Fortunately, a muscular man, despite being slightly shorter, stood in between her and the perv. He had noticed what was happening and stepped in. That\'s when the perv gave up and turned away. A while after, he alights from the bus and the stressful tension instantly vanishes. Phew! Shoulders around me relax, and that\'s when I realised I wasn\'t alone. The hero and heroine now stood in a more relaxed posture, and so did the ""bystanders"". \n\nI was really glad that this crowd was filled with good and brave people.

I'm a female, 23 and my financial is enough for me to last 4-5 years if I move out. I know I'm way past the 21 years old, and I may get people saying ""then you should make decision yourself instead"" but

with my family has traditional mindset and the entire family tree likes to play political, guilt tripping and tight me down. It's hard to make the decision because it makes me guilty for leaving them?

I'm not very close to my family, I used to be. I have a sibling, let's call it ""S"", older than me and yet very controlling maniac and have severe anger issues. S will hold in lots of minor issues and will burst out in a snap if I happened to pull its nerve accidentally.

There were quite a few episodes of S, with its anger issue, it threw things at me, including a medium size thermal bottle. After that night's fight, I was inflicting pain to my arm to overcome my fear. My mum didn't help me but instead stand along with S, and labelled me as  ""a monster"",""she's different person already, changed already"". I left the house that night for 1 month, fear that S will kill me in my sleep in spite of his anger.  Although I moved back after 1 month, S didn't bother to apologize sincerely, my mum did apologize by saying ""Im sorry okay? you happy now?"". It's as good as don't apologize to me if you don't mean it. Even we have moved house, I still fear S will kill me or beat me up in a pulp hence I demand for a room for myself. You think I got it straight away? S also did fight with me for this, saying ""you getting your own room alone, its like you don't even want to do with anything in this family, wtf you want now?"". In the end I got it but the reason is because Im extremely fear that he will kill me in my sleep, locking the door before sleep ease my fear even just for a bit.

Every fight S will keep mentioning ""I will F\*\*\* you up/I already trying to hold my anger, you can try to provoke me because else I make sure I destroy things in this house, break the door down/I will destroy infront of your face"" etc 

It's already threatening me, isnt it? Everytime my mum away from SG for 2 weeks, the house is always in a mess, very dirty and certainly it's not me because I always stay in my own room. It irks me to see dirts all over the house. fyi I'm not the only one live in this house, total 5 people live here.

I'm going to leave my job and study so I can switch career because to add on, S doesn't respect me as a healthcare staff, it fabricated its words to sound like it appreciates healthcare staff. 

For example, it said ""nurse just anyhow take orders(suggestion) from the public or dont even let doctor in-charge to come and review patient"", when I was suggesting a minor ailment to the nurse in-charge to ease the admitted family member's respiratory supports.

The rest of family tree thinks ""Aiya she works in healthcare, we don't have to worry much"" while it's their parent was on the hospital bed, I'm just one of maternal granddaughter to the family member and I'm not even close to them. 

I know I'm all over the places in my mind.

How do I handle this? I just want to move out but the entire family is roping me tight with emotional abuse. Do I need to seek legal advice? I don't want to spend so much money as I preparing for future plannings.

fyi I have a bf, his family is very supportive of me and they okay with me moving in with them to live but with the guilt I have, I feel whatever I do is impossible.

throwaway3278532,1593162218,hg45hs,15,1,"Sorry this turned out way longer, tldr at the end. 

Posting here because at this point, I’m extremely desperate and have no idea what else can be done so any advise is greatly appreciated. 

Some background info, I spent the last year working on my master’s thesis in a design major. Now, I understand that design majors are often subjective and I completely understand that. I have never tried to appeal for my grades even when I felt like I didn’t deserve it as I’m one who simply just accepts the reality as it is but now it’s affecting my future career and my degree which I’ve been working so long for. 

So I received my results some weeks ago and realised that I had missed the graduation requirements by one grade. I spoke with my thesis professor and he explained that during my final presentation, the two professors couldn’t agree on a grade for me (B+ and B- respectively) and so they submitted separate grades which later resulted in an external review for my grades. The thing is, had my prof given in to the B- instead of insisting on a B+, the external reviewers wouldn’t be involved and I would have graduated with the B- grade. However, the external reviews who had no prior understanding of my project decided that they were giving me a C+, did not discuss this with my professor and simply told him the grades were final. 

The only thing I could do was to appeal for my grades. But the school policy states that grade appeals would only check for our examination scores to make sure it was tabulated correctly. Design majors however, have no exams at all, the grades I were given was probably the only grade they had on record so there was essentially nothing to be checked. I also wrote an appeal to the head of department who promised to form a review panel to look into my appeal. 

A few weeks passed with no news and I received an email from one of the admin personnel stating that my grades were to be unchanged, and the email was cc-ed to the head and the external reviewer who gave me the C+ and basically told me to redo my entire thesis. 

I’m at a lost now. I have a friend facing a similar issue who was also working on her thesis under the same professor. The university had a video conference with her and basically told her she was dismissed from school (she’s in a much worse situation than I am as she wasn’t doing well since the previous semester whereas for me it’s the first time I’m facing this). According to her, it sounded like the school was putting the blame completely on the students and told her that as a student, she has to take charge of her own learning and that the professors were simply there to guide her. 

What then, is the point of paying tuition fees when we’re suppose to take charge of our own learning? are we not suppose be learning from the professors which the school hired? I asked my professor after i received my results what could have possibly resulted in my grade and he told me that he too was clueless. If a professor doesn’t know, how am I suppose to as a student know what else could have been done? 

At this point, I feel like I’m fighting a losing battle with the school that’s exerting their power over students. I know I could just redo the entire year but I’ve got a full time job lined up and according to my professor, I should have been able to graduate. Furthermore, I can no longer receive the tuition grant from the government if I were to redo. This is completely unfair towards me and the school hasn’t been the most transparent in this entire process so if anyone has any suggestions who else I can approach, please let me know. 

Tldr; profs couldn’t agree on my final grade and submitted different grades which resulted in an external reviewer that gave a much lower grade than the two grades that were initially given, and said it was final.

American media has been suffering a downward spiral in the last three decades in its professionalism, credibility and adherence to integrity.

Lupical,1600158656,it4swn,111,1,"I live in a condominium with my mom, dad and aunt. No siblings.

Recently this year I have found out that my family is very toxic. All of them and I mean ALL, are sooo toxic.

My mother recently shouted very loudly at me because I was only resting for FIVE minutes and she said I will be a failure and even said “Then you’ll be sad when you fail”
I am a person that does not get angry, or sad easily, and all of their behaviors back them up

I softly replied “You don’t have to shout” to calm her down, yet she scolded me very angrily and even said “WOW, SO DISRESPECTFUL” even though whenever I have a fight with my dad or aunt she would advice me to say “Just tell them politely not to shout”

I am really angry, and this isn’t the first time she acted like the good guy. She is a narcissist, a hypocrite and a toxic person.

My parents fought almost everyday for very small reason ever since I was born, and I have learnt to bottle all my anger up.

When I explained to her that this was the exact response she told me to say she huffed and pretended I didnt say it. The problem with my mom is, whenever she knows she is in the wrong, she would “accept it” and in the future when I do something wrong she will suddenly bring it up

When I cried last time due to an argument with my aunt, she brought it up yesterday when I had an argument once again with her and said “Then you will cry”

I have faced numerous bullies in my life, but the biggest one is my mother. She never once said sorry to me, neither did my dad.

Because of this I have attempted to commit suicide twice, and I even tried to explain this to my “friends” but they made fun of it.

And the sad thing is, I told her I got a high A for my exams, and she dismissed it and continued to argue...

I believe you know there is more to life than what you are currently going through. Morally, I would say not to die. But the truth is, it is the easy way out, isn’t it? But you showed that you do want to be helped/saved, so you have to hear this from me. Please cherish your life. I don’t have all the reasons why you should stay/live, but I promise you, if you die right now, you would never get to live the life you envision. You put a full stop, and eliminate all the opportunities that awaits you. So please, stay. Live for all the dreams you have, live for all the relationships to happen, live for all the memories and feelings you are going to experience. \n\nNow onto your situation. Since you recognise that your family is toxic, you probably know how to handle them better. That is, do not ‘fight back’. I feel like narcissist or people who can’t see that they are wrong/does not apologise have this urge to argue/debate with people who enable them. Is it possible for you to muster all your strength to say ‘ok, I understand/I will take note’ to all their words even though you don’t feel like it? The more you do not give them the satisfaction of winning, the more delusional they become, and hopefully they stop looking for you to be their verbal punching bag. \n\nUnfortunately, since you are not capable to find a house/job being so young and in an Asian country, your only hope is to work your butt off and get that scholarships. Why? Because if you have scholarships (assuming it is a bond/provides you internship), that means 1) you will be busy keeping your grades up 2) you get to be away from your family, assuming you have projects/presentations/internships/work 3) you have money, which you can save up to rent a room outside. \n\nIf I recall correctly, you can probably rent a room at 18, otherwise you need to stay under the fire until 21. \n\nAll the best, and here’s hoping you overcome this difficult phase!', 'Man, I do that all the time. I NEVER fight back, until this post. I have been containing and bottling up all my anger from the stupid pointless arguments, and whenever they reprimand me for something I cant control I just shut up, even if I say “ok”, they get more pissed', 'I’m not saying you shouldn’t fight back, but fighting back is sort of a way to enable/validate whatever their point is. It seems like they always see you as the scapegoat for their negative emotions. In that case, will nodding your head in agreement be a better choice than saying ‘ok’? Or making the ‘orrrrrhhh’ sound or ‘alright’? Something as short as possible to limit the interaction. \n\nOf course, bottling up is not good. You need to find an outlet to release these resentment (making an assumption here) you have. Be it exercising, going for a walk, cycling, gaming, eating, taking long showers. Your feelings matter, your thoughts matter. It’s ok if your parents don’t see it, because they are not fit to be parents after how they treat you. But you need to treat yourself with love and compassion. Embrace that you can control how your actions and feelings will be. That, is the power you have that no one can take away.', ""As a kid and a teenager,my mum said a lot of hurtful things to me. Some of them even fuelled my suicidal feelings. She chose my poly course cause helicopter asian parents are afraid of their children failing. After that,I decided to stand on my own two feet.

She said nothing will come out of singing lessons but I joined some lessons n made it through the first round of a mini comp. Use it as ur driving force.

I've only managed to get by with a friend who has equally if not more insane parents and we offer all the support we can to one another since we can understand each other's predicament. do try to find someone that you can confide in and very disappointingly accept the fact that our society doesn't give two shits about dysfunctional families and abuse unless its physical. you can always dm me if you wanna rant about your situation!"", ""My situation definitely isn't as extreme as yours because only one of my parents are like that, but here's my take on what u might be able to do:\n\n- try to find out what they like hearing and just change your way of talking according to that. According to the internet, narccisists are the kind of people who bring others down to make themselves feel better, so one possible way to just prevent all of it is to throw your pride away a bit and just let them hear what they want. I know it's not good and it's pretty much avoidance but I'm sure it's really really hard for you to be able to talk sense into them. I've been doing this for pretty long and it's saved me a lot of energy\n\n- don't talk to them unless necessary. I generally don't talk to my patent about anything because she always finds a way to make it worse\n\n- find an excuse to stay outside of your house (eg, consults in school/ studying in school etc) But this isn't very easy esp with the COVID situation right now, but it still is one of my favourite ways to avoid all the scoldings affecting my mood and productivity \n\n\nI know it's really hard for you to voice out on this as filial piety is a huge thing in Asian countries. As a minor in Singapore, I also know there's definitely next to no way for you to just decide to move out (most ppl say to cut contact with narcissists, but it's unfortunately not very possible in Singapore if you're a minor and they're your parents) If you ever feel like ranting you could private message me or just post another rant, I'm sure everyone will be willing to help you out"", 'Hey hey welcome to the club!\n\nWe have:\n\n•Dad that wishes me for not to be his son but wished my cousin was me instead\n\n•Dad that plays victim in every arguement\n\n•Dad that will eventually use ""just move out"", ""my conscience is clear"" &amp; threaten disownment in every arguement.\n\n•Tryhard hokkien &amp; chinese vulgarities even tho our household is indonesian and no one speaks chinese.', 'Hi bro, it\'s sort of good that you realized the damage at age 13. I only realized the toxicity of my parents when I was 17-18. \n\nEvery thing I\'d like to try, my parents would criticize, tell me about the negative side of that thing. Whenever i sound out my ambitions, same thing. I\'d be criticized and scoffed at. That\'s when i learned that not every move i make has to be known by everyone. \n\nEvery little mistake i make will be followed with a groan by my parents, making it seem like they\'re very disappointed in me. My mother would prefer to be passive aggressive in her words sometimes when something\'s not right in the house like in the kitchen. It\'s not much her voice but more to her sharp words, criticizing me, bringing up all the negative things she sees in me. \n\nThen it hit me that they\'re really negative, and that\'s how they were brought up. They don\'t know how to stop and change their ways. My mother actually got way way better after she started learning a bit more about islam..Last time was worse when she got very physical. In fact i have social anxiety and confidence issues due to the way my parents dealt with my weaknesses as a child. But it is my fault if I don\'t improve myself and get rid of the anxiety and increase my confidence. \n\nOne thing you have to understand, or what i understood, is that my parents still love me even though they don\'t say it. I can see this when they ask me if I\'ve eaten, offering me to eat, when they speak to me etc. it\'s in the little things la basically. \n\nThey work their ass of everyday so i can play my Minecraft with my brothers, and watch TV, and use water heater, and cook, and enjoy the lights and wash my clothes, without ever stopping just because they\'d want to. They\'re not selfish and i can see partly they work because of their children.\n\nIn islam we are told to be respectful and kind as well as humble towards our parents no matter what they do. Do your best to make them happy. No sane parent would actually hate their child. Sometimes I\'d look at my baby pictures and see my parents caring for me. Especially this one photo where i was sleeping on top of my dad\'s chest, causing him to accidentally sleep there too.\n\nIt\'s a sad truth but sometimes you can\'t even tell your friends of your family issues. Also side note, check for toxic friends. Your friends cant do anything but advise you and listen. They can\'t actually fix the issue themselves. \n\nYou\'ve a long way to go in life and know that it\'s not bound to just your family. If you\'re the one ""causing"" your parents to shout and stuff, you\'ll one day be more mature and have a more ""zen"" approach in life. Just chill2, like me right now haha. \n\nFor example when my mom always brings up issues like ""i cook but never finish"", i never talk about anything related to food anymore (I\'m still fat, so not malnourished). Or ""Room is a mess"", i clean my room. Sometimes try to put her screaming aside and actually listen to what she\'s saying. If the cause of her screaming is due to what you\'re saying, the solution is to not say the thing\'s that\'ll trigger her. It actually helps but now i sort of speak less with my mother and choose my words very carefully. I realized that if i were to give her the silent treatment, things would get way way worse. I still joke around sometimes, trying to make her laugh. Psychological wise, people respect those who speak less and choose their words properly. \n\n\nAll in all, a very good advice I\'d give is to ""show"" your family that you\'ve matured without trying. Clean your room, find a hobby, work, speak carefully, assist the house however you can and so on. Think about it, would your mom scream and nag a 30-40 year old man the way she screams at you? It\'s because that person is mature and has other things to worry about in life than her nagging and scolding.\n\n\nAlso one tip i found on the net. List down one by one all the things you\'re grateful for. Like things you\'ll miss if they\'re not there. Water heater, wifi, condo (lucky you get to stay in condo. I sleep on couch and no swimming pool u know), air con, nice food and keep writing till you smile.\n\nNot sure if this one will help, but pick a time, lie down in bed and close your eyes. Then picture yourself waking up one day, and your whole family is gone. Your mom\'s not cooking, your dad\'s not watching TV, your siblings not coming into your room. No more family laughters or outings. No more jokes with family. I\'ve a friend who left his house, situation a tad bit worse than yours. Mom didn\'t even want him anymore (disowned). He\'s now homeless at 20, house hopping at friends house and works minimum wage part time job. Thinking of him makes me grateful for my current situation no matter how bad it gets\n\nHope this helps.', 'replying with ""ok"" and ""sorry"" for me is not a very good idea. I keep quiet while trying not to seem like I\'m ignoring them, cause if they see that I\'m ignoring them, they\'ll get even more pissed off..\n\nI totally agree with the being mentally strong stuff. Obviously everyone becomes mature and mentally strong in different ways, but I\'ve become a mentally stronger person and learned to not really give a damn about what other people think of me (of course doesn\'t mean i need to be a slob and an ""asshole"" to others)\n\nBut it comes with side effect though. School and parents ruined my self confidence, but i rose back up and increased it myself and can say I\'m a better and chiller person now.', 'Successful people keep their goals, achievements and next move to themselves.

Don’t give in man being only 13 you have so much ahead of you. Find people who will acknowledge and show concern instead of judge you when they probably barely know half the story. \n\nAs for your parents, try to understand that they do not have the experience of raising a child beforehand since you mentioned no siblings, so don’t hold it against them a 100%. \n\nStay strong, remember you’re not alone in this world', 'Thanks for the advice haha, I’ve never really had a family outing with them so idk how that is supposed to feel, stay safe 👍', ""I know how it's like I've been in a similar situation with my parents.\n\nFirst, I wanna say that you are valuable.

Or somethings I have to relearn, like my self esteem, being extremely judgmental about myself and subsequently other people.\n\nBut there is light. With my partner, I learn what it's like to have people support me instead of criticise me, for the first time when I break something no one shouts at me, I don't have to ask permission to do things I want to do (I used to ask if I can eat snacks. Imagine an adult doing that?), when I buy something for myself no one is gonna scold me for wasting money, someone to praise me for things I do even if it is small like remembering to turn off the lights. Everyday I become a better person and my mental health improves, and I leave a little bit more of the darkness behind.\n\nI hope you find your light soon."", 'start planning your way out in the future. get a job or two, part-time, or whatever, save. once you can afford 1 year of rental (rental with sharing room, meaning cheap, safe and decent), make sure you continue to have steady incomes. when the time really bad, pack your things, move out, distancing yourself. \n\nkey note: make sure you are fully independent financially and all from your family. there is no point you move out but still expect handouts from them.', 'Omg your situation is so similar to mine!

During the peak of the toxicity, I would try to spend the entire day outside studying and only come back at night to sleep.

It is vey frustrating to have to deal with such words only to be brushed off when you bring it up and try to fix things and no one listens to you because you’re “just a child” who doesn’t know better or hasn’t seen the world yet. And trust me I’ve thought of running away/suicide multiple times for the past 2 years. \n\nHOWEVER, unlike you, I’m old enough to be able to move out and support myself. If you’re thinking of running away, DON’T unless you have a place to stay (hotel, friends house etc.) It will be hard to run around aimlessly and also could possibly be even more detrimental to your mental health. \n\nThis is not the end, I promise you! \n\nFirstly, props to you for noticing the signs of a toxic family at such a young age! (I’m 20 and I only just realised it when I was 18) \n\nSecondly, seek help! Other than SOS or your school counsellor (who I’ve read is a snitch but don’t blame them! Sometimes when the students life are on the line they will tell the parents even if they are told not to by the students. This is to protect the students and it’s called the EPS (ethical principles screen) search if you wanna know more!) Putting my nerd brain aside, you can alternatively head to your nearest FSC (Family Service Centre) to seek for help. FSC provides an abundance of support ranging from financial to homelessness to toxic family relationships! They also provide counselling and will be able to refer you to external help if needed. They will be more than willing to help you through your toughest time and are really really nice people, best of all it’s *almost always*  FOC! Please don’t be scared to approach an FSC as I know it can be very daunting but trust me the social workers there will be more than happy to help you but they won’t be able to unless you yourself take the first step :-) \n\nLastly, thank you for sharing your story! It can be extremely scary especially for someone your age to come out and speak about such issues happening at home and I thank you for being so brave about it. Please seek help if you need and don’t be afraid!\n\nMy last piece of advice: If you’re unable to seek help, take it for as long as you can and find friends who are willing to move in with you once you’re old enough to.

wilschz,1598258411,ifla8i,50,1,"Background: I was born and raised in Singapore but moved to the US for work when I was 26. 

Recently when me and my mom would chat, she would tell me things like “US paid Hongkongers to riot because the US hates China”; “US banned Huawei not because of the sanction violation but because US couldn’t catch up with 5G development”; and when I tell her how horribly the Uighers are treated in Xinjiang she would deny it and dismiss it as “fake news by western countries to slander China’s reputation”. 

When I ask her where she’s getting these news from (because I did google but couldn’t find anything online about HK rioters being paid etc), she would insist that it’s from Lianhe Zaobao or Ch8 news. I obviously don’t read them so I don’t know- but is that true?

If I try to quote/ send her articles from more neutral news sources like NPR or Reuters, our conversation will end up in a fight where she would tell me things like “you’re yellow skin Chinese and nothing is going to change that”; “when China becomes the superpower we can all be proud”; or “you’ve been brainwashed by the Americans”. 

I am absolutely speechless and puzzled. This is especially close to my heart since there are widespread instances of fake news in the US and I am concern that my mom is falling for it. My mom is a smart woman but I don’t understand why she would conflate being Singaporean chinese to be the same as being PRC chinese?

Most if not all of his work is not peer reviewed, and in the few cases are, e.g. in the Journal of Political Risk, the editors consist of other ""China watchers"" exhibiting immense bias, also all citing the same uncorroborated, unverified, and largely if not completely speculative-at-best work of Zenz.\n\n2. China\'s laws and legislation regarding religious accommodations have been strict in terms of protecting the right to practice religious faith, including that of Muslims. This has included requiring firms, factories, etc that have dormatories -- a system China has had for years which has been a large part of how so many people have gotten out of poverty in China -- to build food canteens that specifically cater to Muslim diets, as an example. A lot of this information can be found when looking at the sources for the ASPI report on ""forced labor"", where all official government sources contradicts the ASPI\'s claims, and where all other sources are unverified, uncorroborated, reliant on ""testimonies"" which have been [highly problematic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nayirah_testimony) in [numerous cases](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/13/why-do-north-korean-defector-testimonies-so-often-fall-apart). Besides, in terms of religious provisions, it\'s worth pointing out that China has 39,000 mosques, 25,000 of which are in Xinjiang. For reference, Iraq has a higher population yet fewer mosques than Xinjiang has. That doesn\'t sound like ""genocide"" to me.\n\n3. China has also been heavily encouraging of Uighurs to have their own autonomy, encouraging learning their ethnic language, having signs in Xinjiang that feature both Uighur and Mandarin script fairly equally, and so on. Most of China\'s internal propaganda has been about Xinjiang being a beautiful part of China, and has been about celebrating Uighur culture, and many programs in China have been about encouraging tolerance and integration. People claim China has tried to force Uighurs to marry Han Chinese, but there has never been evidence of that (and Chinese law prohibits forced marriage anyways); rather, China has encouraged relationships between Han and Uighur people. In other words, nothing China has done has resembled Fascist or bigoted nations; none of their propaganda resembles Nazi propaganda in disparaging Uighurs, and instead of propaganda about ""race mixing"" like the US had, they encourage healthy and tolerant integration and coexistence.\n\n4. China\'s foreign policy with many nations has largely been positive, reciprocal, and beneficial. This has included providing medical equipment, medical aid, and masks to nations effected by Covid-19, being transparent about their actions in Xinjiang to prevent radicalization by the use of humane vocational schools and boarding schools, and so on. China has invited the UN, US, and many other nations to come to Xinjiang, and has allowed people to openly film Xinjiang life without issue.\n\nSources, categorized:\n\n1) source compilations\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RodericDay/status/1287411708374454273?s=19&amp;fbclid=IwAR2Ca2sA4KV_gozHtWRsi10i9uHhESKVrtIolscoBr0LlGyh4UAfMiO9YOU\n\nhttps://twitter.com/isgoodrum/status/1004884261051092993?s=17\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JoshuaYJackson/status/1285578359100112896?s=19\n\n2) Individual issues, documents, etc\n\nNYT ""leaked documents""; many were [likely fabricated due to clearly improper Chinese](https://twitter.com/ChineseBot2B/status/1207019748103356416), and those documents that were more clear or unedited [were from public speeches, and NYT translators purposefully misquoted them](https://www.quora.com/What-will-be-the-consequences-of-the-New-York-Times-expos%C3%A9-on-Xinjiang/answer/Jamin-Chen-1?ch=10&amp;share=5d1244b5&amp;srid=hXpBn)\n\n[The blindfolded prisoners drone video](https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/06/asia/china-xinjiang-video-intl-hnk/index.html) is video of a regular prisoner transfer in Kashgar.

Trash_Panther,1596111528,i0l1p3,10,1,"Ns is a total waste of time and brings about more cons than pros for us sons of Singapore. Im speaking from experience.

I am currently serving national service about 8 months in and my vocation is transport operator.
As a transport operator, one would think how 'lucky' we are as we are able to get free license, but in my opinion that is merely a tiny benefit which is massively overshadowed by the cons of this vocation.

Why do i think ns is a total waste of time?

Because aside from actual driving, the rest of the time we either sit in the car or in the bunk and do nothing. On days where we do not have drivings to do, we sit in the bunk the whole day, using our phones and wasting our lives and youth while our female peers pursue uni and find jobs, enriching their lives. Speaking from experience, i find it absolutely tiring to not do anything at all the whole day and theres only so much entertainment social media and netflix can give you before u get bored. And then theres the problem of not having enough data. If ns were to be shortened to say 1 year, it wouldnt be this bad as we could take this as a long holiday but 2 years is way too long and it has stretched from a holiday to a borefest and life-waster. I could accomplish so much in these 2 years be it education wise or job wise, but i have to 'serve the nation' by doing nothing and sitting on my bed in bunk. Is this your idea of 'serving the nation'?

My next point would be how ns takes away my social life. In driving vocation we are constantly bombarded with weekend duties and details without any pity from our superiors. My female friends who are attending uni have already minimum amount of time to go out with us and now with these weekend duties and details the chances of being able to ask them out for a gathering is greatly reduced. As they make new friends in uni and go out less with us, we will soon lose contact with them and ultimately become strangers. Is this what you want, to have your friends taken away from you just because u have to 'serve the nation'? And then theres the problem of spending time with family. For stay in units like mine, and with weekend duties, we sometimes spend up to 2 or 3 weeks not being able to see our family and spend quality time with them. My parents are getting old and time is very much cherished for them and because of ns, i have very little time to spend with them. The superiors constantly tell us how we have to spend quality time with our family but isnt it ironic with the amount of weekend duties you give us, we are not able to do so?

And my third point would be the people i meet in ns. I am an easygoing person who can get along really well with anybody but the people i meet here in my unit, they make it hard for me to do so. These people are what you would call 'YPs'. They fight and smoke in bunks not caring about the rest of us and how their actions will disturb us. I cant even complain about them to the superiors because if they were to find out im a snitch, im a goner. So in camp, everyday, i live under a constant stress for my living conditions, making me depressed and moody for most of the days. Is this really what you want your mental state to be?

Now i feel that everyone has their own experience on national service but i believe i am speaking for most of us here who have to serve. I suggest ns to be shortened to at most 1.5 years or at least make sure during weekends and public holidays all ns activities are cancelled so we can go home to spend quality time with our families. I know what im saying is pointless and the system will not change anytime soon but i just want to get some things off my chest and let it all out.

What matters is that during a war, we have the resources (trucks and drivers) who can move the supplies where we need, when we need. \n\nCant shorten NS because it takes a long time to train some vocations to reach proficiency at the individual level, even more for them to operate coherently at the small unit level, and even more to operate as a big unit and so on. Don\'t think it makes sense for us to ord them as soon as they are operationally ready, so add more operationally ready unit service time on top of that. Would it be fair for some vocations to ord earlier than others? \n\nWon\'t address your weekend and public holiday point in detail. Defence is 24/7.\n\nHaving said all of that, I agree with other commenters who said NS is what you make of it.', 'Idk friend..... it’s really wasted time if you spend the whole time unproductive and being unhappy? Regardless you’re going to have to waste your time there, might as well make the most out of it. \n\nI spent mine reading books and talking crap. Just got arrowed for more duties because I should be reading medial SOP &amp; should have been doing more work for the regulars. \n\nStill, you’ll meet people out there who might be interesting and I still have quite a few close friends I’ve made from the army.

misterdonutguy,1594700214,hqupvc,12,1,"My grandma has come down with a pretty serious infection over the past year in her foot which has led to it being gangrenous. She has been going down to the hospital pretty regularly due to this and this is the third time in the last 3 months. She has been prescribed antibiotics to fight off the infection but it always seems to come back after a while.
So today the doctor gave us two alternatives: First is to change to even stronger antibiotics which has side effects on her health and she may still need to come back after all of this given the severity of the infection. Second is to amputate her leg above the knee, but given her advanced age (she is almost 90) and her pre-existing conditions (diabetes, past stroke), they do not give her much chance to survive the operation.
I was thinking of asking my grandma’s thoughts on this but her dementia is pretty serious and so our family is probably going to have to decide for her as well.

&gt;SG gov gotta pander to weak parents, bo bian.

&gt;Everyday go training, no time for games n fun at 13yrs old, no stress?

&gt;If he didnt make it, he'd be some washed up unknown loser dude in Argentina now, so is the expectation on a young 13yr old ginah stressful?

&gt;Stress is good. TTI is contrarian.

&gt;Parents kb gov say stressful, I actually think its not stressful enough. So i ""top up"" more stress for my own kids.

&gt;No stress how does Carbon turn into diamonds

&gt;Gov policy of pandering to strawberry parents n kids is just gg to make it worse for these guys.

&gt;1 big fine day, when they have to compete with the koreans, chinese, indians etc, then theyd realize that the world's top talent has been turning up for the fight since young whereas their kids r blissfully sheltered.

If it’s too cold, we can freeze to death...if it’s too hot, we can die from heatstroke/dehydration. \n\nIt’s the same with stress.

dusty_bat,1606294602,k0oodn,31,1,"My mom and my stepfather are emotionally manipulative and I don't know what to do. For all 25 years of my life, my depressive mother has been physically, verbally and emotionally abusive to me. Because of her depression, the way she treats me changes all the time. She can be nice, and suddenly become angry with me in a matter of hours. 

Today, I ordered McDelivery and within a few minutes of the delivery guy leaving she arrived home with a bag of McDonalds, I thought it was such a funny coincidence so I laughed. But she yelled at me and asked ""Why didn't you call me to ask me before you order?"" I tried to diffuse the situation by telling her it was not a big issue, and it was just an unexpected situation. But she kept scolding me and saying things like ""We always have a communication breakdown"", ""You should call and ask if other people are buying food before you make a delivery."" 

However, I did call her. I called 30 mins ago, and she told me that her and stepdad are in Punggol cycling. But I didn't mention anything about McDonalds because I'm just ordering my own food. 

She continued scolding me relentlessly, so I tried explaining, but because I was so angry I couldn't control my volume level. 

At that moment, my stepdad came home and he heard the argument. He told me to stop shouting, I tried to explain to him that I was only explaining to Mum that honestly didn't expect them to buy McDonalds also. His response was ""Stop shouting, if you want to shout get out of my house""

Mum's attitude also completely changed, the exact thing she said was ""I thought that it was funny, I was laughing, I didn't scold her.""

What followed was Mum continuously being the ""calm"" side, and me trying to explain the situation to no avail. Stepdad told me to ""Stop screaming, Fuck off"" and plenty more hurtful words. 

I don't know what to do, I feel so wronged and helpless. Things like this have happened multiple times over the years, and my only escape was going overseas to study by borrowing a loan. However, I've been back in Singapore this year because of COVID-19. 

I am tired of living like this all this time, and I feel constantly trapped in this situation. I've always been seen as a problematic child to family members, neighbours etc. And no matter how I try to change their impression of me, a fight happens between me and my parents and I'm seen as the ""bad child"" again.",askSingapore,28092,"emotionally manipulative parents, I am losing the will to live, don't know what to do",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/k0oodn/emotionally_manipulative_parents_i_am_losing_the/,1.0,"['That really sucks man.

Sometimes when I had friends over, they’d try to talk to my friends without my presence and asked how I was doing (they found it really difficult to talk to me face to face). Eventually through my friends they got to know me a lot more and over the years the distance closed between us.\n\nOf course not all parents are like mine, but I really hope you can find a safe space outside of your own house!!

Have an avenue to let out: Talk to someone, cry (it\'s ok to cry), exercise, hang out with friends. While you are receiving ""input"" from your parents, have an ""output"" to release your emotions as well. \n6. Do things that make you happy.

But you can't solve any problems whilst caught up in your (very understandable) emotions.\n\nSo, firstly, take a deep breath, calm down, and relax.\n\nOnce your emotions has taken some time to settle down, identify the problem. Catch your mum at a time when she is nice to you to have a serious conversation. Write down how you feel so you don't get caught up in your emotions.

But you know the people around you well enough, and this isn't an one off situation. There's no point in trying to explain ourselves to someone who is already biased, like your stepfather for example.\n\n\n My dad is the same way, even though my mother is always the one who initiates arguments, I'm the one that is forced to apologise first bc she uses her depression as a way of threatening and guilt tripping the family. At this point I'm alr too tired to even bother trying to explain my side anymore. After these conflicts, I just take an hour to come down, and force the insincere apology out to my mother.\n\n\nWhat I've learnt is that life is unfair. Sometimes people take the easy way out and just side with the person they are biased towards without learning the full story. I'll advise that you distance yourself from ur family, because it is evident that their toxicity is not doing you any good. Branch out your social circles, stay out later, hang out with friends more, reduce interactions with your parents. Build up a support system and stay away from your parents and the people that they've brainwashed. Personally I always stay outside during the day, be it with friends or at work, so as to cut down on interactions with my family to prevent conflicts.\n\n\nI know how it feels right now, it feels like everyone is against you when it's not even your fault, but it can't be helped. If you can, consider moving out, maybe renting a flat with close friends. But please cut off your parents. I can't even begin to phrase how wronged I feel on your behalf. \n\n\nYour mother's behaviour is extremely manipulative, and judging from this story, she was intentionally stirring you up. If she was genuinely angry, she wouldnt have been able to suddenly change mood when your step dad came in.\n\n\n\nThis whole comment is so incredibly jumbled, bc I can't even begin to properly express how much anger this stirs in me and how much I relate to you.

Every game i played i'd 80% say 80% of my team (pubs) are toxic or sexist. Somehow, me being a girl means i HAVE to play support. Somehow me being a non male means I AUTOMATICALLY SUCK 

My experience when i use mic

**Overwatch:**

- ""Ure a girl play mercy"" 

- ""Ur dps suck go play support like every girl"" 

- I will carry you every game if you give me your instagram/snapchat/(insert social media name)

- I get trashed talk when i pick ANYONE that's not support, even before the game starts im AUTOMATICALLY SHIT BC IM A NON FUCKING MALE

**Apex Legends: (copy pasting from my other post)**

- Duos leaving the game once they hear mic, female voice. mostly it's ""(grunt/sigh sound) we're matched with a girl, let's just go next"" 

- 1st one to be down (dead) out of the team in a fight, got  flamed for not picking someone like lifeline or loba to support them 

- (this is a funny one) When i was newer (few weeks) to the game, i found a golden evo once and mic-ed just to ask why didnt it have a number to upgrade to red evo. i got asked to stfu because he said i'm only attention seeking for simps to carry me (lol) 

- Got trashtalked for not wanting to provide them with my social media 

- Got asked to ""just follow us don't shoot unless i ask you to"" because apparently, and i quote: ""u're a girl and girls are bad when it comes to shooting games generally"" 

- Got a golden havoc once (best gun don't @ me) at a high tier loot area and got shouted to drop it because girls dont deserve it???????  i didn't and he disconnected straightaway haha

**League of Legends:** (Mostly on ingame text chat or with vc over people that added me) 

- ""Which support do you play? Soraka?"" 

- Give me your (insert social media name) 

- I can carry you if you give me your (insert social media name) 

- Every time i feed, i get trashed for not my skills but BEING A FEMALE. BECAUSE ACCORDING TO Y'ALL FEMALES CAN'T PLAY OR DO WELL IN GAMES AT ALL. 


Why? Why do y'all treat females in games like shit. I've been an avid gamer for very long and It's tiring to face this in every game i play. I'm fairy new to apex hoping it'd be a fresh start but lolz. Same ol' 

Why does everyone tell me to fucking get used to it? People are telling me to get used to toxicity and sexism. It SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED OR NORMALISED. I stand by my point. However, it's just tiring. I love gaming but this keeps happening in every multiplayer game i enjoy. 

Sorry. I know i'm just complainy and whiney. I'm just sick and tired of being ""shit"" just because im a female. IF IM DOING BAD OR PLAYING BAD MEANS MY SKILLS ARE SHIT. ITS NOT BECAUSE IM A FEMALE.

I started playing league when I was 11, and I really loved leaguing from the bottom of my heart. I met many people through the game and one of which is my bf. I met him when i was 14, and we started dating when we were 15. It wasn\'t him that got me into the game - when I was 14, he was barely level 20. You know league used to be capped at level 30. Then, he played a lot more than me, and spammed games to the point where he has multiple accounts at plat - diamond. It came to a point where he can wake up, play league the entire day, sleep, rinse and repeat. And obviously as his gf I was obliged to play with him.\n\nThere were many other things I wanted to do - things in real life. But I couldn\'t. I wanted to play with my other friends, but I couldn\'t. It became so toxic because he would guilt trip me and keep being like ""okay lor sua then i play alone"". Otherwise he will persistently ask me non-stop for more than 10 times (with no sarcasm added) to play with him league. If I play with my other friends he would get upset.\n\n\n Furthermore, what irritates me even more is that he would ONLY play ranked. Well, I don\'t mind playing ranked, but I mind playing ranked with HIM. Because when he plays with me it\'s gold, it\'s ""low-elo"" he would troll and feed because ""our team is so bad they dont deserve to win"" or ""hahaha it\'s just for fun, very easy climb back up one"". He would run it down in my games in a ALL LANES WINNING GAME. (We lost btw, our team was like 17 kills to 4 on the other team, i still don\'t understand how i lose games that i was clearly hardwinning.) \n\nThen he doesn\'t main AD (I main AD!) and he forces me into a support role. Then because we have no synergy bc no communication then he just goes like ""lol you can\'t play support as well"". He has basically named every single champ i played before and said i can\'t play it. I might as well never touch league ever again since i can play 0 champs. My provis was 1 W 4L when i played with him. Guess what, when I was playing without him, it became 6W 4L. Funny isn\'t it. I became a 60% winrate. I finally had the time and ability to climb to plat. But he got upset that I was playing without him. Then after playing with him my winrate is once again it\'s below 50% (probably at like 40% lmfao), i gain from like 25 LP per game to 14 LP per game at gold IV it\'s pathetic. I don\'t even want to league anymore because it\'s too hard to climb. He felt bad and offered to play my account - that upset me even more. So in his thoughts he can just fuck my acc\'s elo just because he can play it and boost it whenever he wants? Does he even care for my feelings as a girl? I\'m in uni rn with not much time to play. But hands-off my acc. I don\'t allow him to play it. \n\n\nAlso, when i\'m tired he doesn\'t respect it. I already said I want to rest and he still forces me to continue playing and keep questioning me why I don\'t want to league. Isn\'t it simple? Because I am tired. He doesn\'t accept my answers and still ask 10 million times (with exaggeration).In games,  he goes like ""awh you should have done X Y Z"" after the things already happen and we already lost. He could have told me to do it before he ran in? He always plays very aggressively and expect me to be able to read his thoughts and catch up. Even other guys do get pissed off at how reckless he is and how inconsiderate he is for the team. It\'s not even a girl\'s thing because even the most aggressive guys i know says he is crazy sometimes. That\'s because he is always going in even at the odd chance of 10% of being able to win.

But, considering SG's declining birth rate, the govt probably tryna prevent that :0"", 'I will state that I am by now way, homophobic, but looking at our nation and the beliefs the elder generations firmly hold onto, one can easily tell why same-sex marriages are banned. This is just my opinion so feel free to add yours so I can learn something from this healthy discussion too.\n\nWhile the younger generations are progressive and are more open to being accepting of people from the LGBT community in Singapore, the reality is the opposite for the elder generations, especially the people who are deeply religious (as it is a \'sin\' and it is against what their respective religions stand for). Now suppose same-sex marriages becomes legal in our country some day, the incumbent would fall out of favour and gradually lose their seats in the parliament. Note that the ruling party is known to be the preferred party among the elder generations and they NEED their votes to remain in power.\n\nThe fertility rate has been plummeting for women aged 30 and below because men and women are both career-driven and either do not have plans to settle down or have a family for that matter or intend to have a family in their mid-thirties. In Western countries, you can have a family without tying the knot, but doing so in Singapore would strip your child off the benefits that are granted to babies born to legally married parents. With the fertility rate being hit hard, allowing same-sex marriages in Singapore would further make the population decline. There has already been growing dissent over the government recruiting ""foreign talents"", god knows what the nation will have to resort to if the population is in steady decline (yes, I am also aware that foreigners are largely hired due to cheap labour). \n\nI personally feel that while the incumbent wants to cater to the interests and beliefs of the conservative Singaporeans (who form the majority), they are also taking into consideration the decline of our population (which doesn\'t changes anything because this wouldn\'t make gays and lesbians become straight again).\n\nMy personal belief is that every single one of us should be treated equally and no one should be subjected to discrimination. People who belong to the LGBT community should be granted anti-discriminatory rights. I do not belong to the majority, so I guess I will have to hear what they have to say about this.', 'Like in SG? I dont think people really discriminate them? Maybe just not in my social circle. \n\nPersonally I dont care for it. LGBT people can do whatever they want for all I care. Just like how straight people can do whatever they want. I dont care. Just dont be loud about it. The issue I find is that LGBT groups tend to be more vocal about it and i get irritated about it. \n\nLike yeah i get you want a voice, but stop shoving my face with memes all about lgbt all the time. Do something constructive to fight your cause, not post a facebook status update on it. \n\nOh and on the topics of rights, honestly singapore is like really poor on that aspect. Like we suck at giving rights to people. Sexual assault cases. Rape against the males. So yeah, fighting for rights here is like combating climate change.

Esp since there’s also other institutionalised discrimination e.g. how BTO isn’t an option, portrayal (or the lack thereof) of LGBT by our media.

I believe that in Singapore, there is still discrimination and prejudice against our LGBTQ peers. As I am still not of adult age, some of the laws and policies I shall introduce below will be in laments term. First of all, it is hard for our LGBTQ individuals to be able to live with their partners or let alone, themselves! This is so as the government will give first time couples a subsidy while purchasing their first home. However, LGBTQ couples are not recognised in SG and therefore do not receive the same per($40k!), as such, without the financial help from our government, this makes housing more unaffordable and only accessible to those of higher SES. Such individuals are only able to buy a HDB flat when they turn the age of 35 with restrictions. Secondly, CPF. When couples are married, they are able to use their CPF funds to help out in urgent scenarios like funding for surgeries and hospital stays. To my knowledge, LGBTQ couples lack such freedom to do so. This results in such couples being more financially insecure. Another point I would like to bring out is the lack of freedom in terms of media representation. Bringing out the case study where in 2008, Mediacorp Channel 5 was fined 15k by IMDB for showcasing a family with 2 fathers. This limits representation of LGBTQ which ultimately deepens prejudice against this community. All of the above are just a few points which I feel that the govt lacks to give support in. Forgive my lack of professional language as I, as mentioned, am still young LOL but I do hope you do not use it as a reason to downplay the severe consequences of lack of care towards a vulnerable minority in our community.', ""Less powerful countries tip toe around their neighbours all the time.

But when he start to do the action, it becomes a sin. In Islam, Homosexuality is when a person does the act of  fornication or sexual intercourse with the same gender. When with a homosexual person, we cannot condemn them or judge them as we are not God. If with a muslim homosexual, we can only advice and pray for the best for him/her. Islam prohibits homosexuality or lesbianism as they may cause problems such as AIDS, broken family, etc. If one day Singapore decides to legalize same sex marriage, Islam will still be fine. For example, adultery is legal in Singapore but it is forbidden in Islam same goes for Homosexuality, If its legal in Singapore, muslims are prohibited from being homosexual.

Each individual faction has their own body that manages their interest. All of these bodies are still subject to the general law in Singapore. Thats why there are still pubs, abortions, tattoo parlour etc.\n\nUpon mentioning that, you do realise that there are LGBT plays and gay pubs in Singapore, right?\n\nSo now, the problem shifts from being accepted by the society, to being recognised by the government.\n\nI’ll say it again. Our Singapore society does NOT discriminate against the LGBT cause. Only our values are not aligned.\n\nAnd I’m sorry, the government, THIS government, takes care of its people as much as they can and towards everyone’s interest.

You can rent your own private properly in a condo. Using the majority of out CPF to pay for housing limits the retirement plan for us.

Guess I can pin that to archaic teachings whereby the elderly look down on the young because the only way for young people to learn at the time was through those who have experience. We now have google.\n\nAs for marriage, I would like to introduce some definitions to clarify some stuff. Marriage is the act of unifying woman and man through the eyes of God. Civil Union is the act of unifying a couple in the eyes of the people.\n\nPersonally a Catholic, it is a sin for one to have sexual relations with another of the same gender, hence same-sex marriages aren’t allowed. \n\nCivil Union on the other hand, ignores religion and holds the secular people to unify the persons. It is also known as other terms such as Domestic/Legal Partnerships, etc. It grands pretty much the same benefits as marriage but without the context of religion.\n\nI do not intend to come across as homophobic, but as with my religious beliefs, I do not think there should be same-sex marriages. On the other hand, I think we can agree to disagree and meet in the middle, let the LGBT have Civil Unions and anti-discriminatory rights. The only thing stopping that would probably be the stubbornness of the elderly.', 'Very biased viewpoint.', ""Really, what you have basically said to is LGBTQ should 'get over it'. Financial insecurity, right to marriage, right to be seen on the big screen, being criminalised for being you, being stigatised in CCE lessons and not being recognised by the government that is supposed to be taking care of you takes a toll on a person's mental and physical health. Firstly, the idea of religion VS LGBTQ should not be existent in our SG context. You agree that there isnt(or shouldnt) be any rules governed by any religion and beliefs. I agree, therefore LGBTQ rights ought to be a thing in SG, since it shouldnt be based on the religion of '90%' of Singaporeans. Secondly, people who claim to be 'furniture', personally have not come across such incidents, no context to go on about that, hence will not make any conclusion. Lastly, you have pointed out that SGreans can get their house, but at 35! Compared to their peers who can probably start to BTO about 7,8 years back, this is a disadvantage. You have recognised the disadvantage, but you only pointed out ways to overcome this setback and then called it 'non-discriminatory'. You then proceeded to talk about the good of Singapore(which I agree, criticising a part of SG doesn't mean I hate Singapore lol), but that is irrelevant when the context is about discrimination."", 'Care to share your opinion then?', 'See u/whentimestopped‘s comment.

Not being able to get a house before 35 and not being able to transfer CPF monies. You’re implying that EVERY single Single person in Singapore,too, should feel discriminated against by the government. They can’t do exactly the same things as you’ve mentioned. Do you think most of them are single by choice?\n\n2. Yes. Religion has to come in play here when it comes to LGBT matters because its the very reason most people do not support the movement. It’s because its not aligned with the values of their own religious values. That does not mean we cannot co-exist.\n\n3. My position have never been to put the LGBT community down. Of course there are limitations. \nBut the fact that you went on the extreme, quoting from your social studies text saying there is lack of care from the government which has done its job is just mind bogglingly shallow.\n\n4.

For my demographics, I'm 16 years old. \n\nI just want to point out how much of an echo chamber Reddit truly is as people commenting about their opinions on the matter on why they are against this matter are downvoted. Ofc opinions that don't provide much sustenance should be downvoted, but there are also opinions that have merit being downvoted as well. From what I've read through this thread, comments expressing support towards this matter are upvoted. Those against downvoted or at the bottom. Therefore, what's even the purpose of this post if people commenting their opinions on why LGBT people shouldn't have marriage &amp; anti-discrimatory rights are downvoted? I feel like most upvoted comments can be then summed up in 1 sentence, there should be no reason to not support LGBT, but politically, due to the Conservative views of the elderly, no political party would ever support LGBT.\n\nAnyway, as for my views. If I had to list reasons why the LGBT shouldn't have such rights it would be because of what it could eventually amount to. I'm sure we've all heard of the pride parades in the US, celebrating LGBT rights. Sure this is fine, but what concerns me is the sexual content of these parades. Did you know kinks and fetishes are celebrated in these parades? And there are also articles defending kinks and fetishes having a place in pride parades (https://www.dazeddigital.com/life-culture/article/44635/1/why-it-s-bizarre-to-ban-kinks-fetish-culture-lgbtq-pride). I'm for LGBT, but if LGBT people start to see this as leeway to start acting out their sexual desires in Singapore's version of pride, the pink dot, then that would be a no from me. Keep the sexual stuff in the bedroom.\n\nAnother reason would be what exactly defines LGBT? Sure, it stands for lesbian, gay, bisexual and trans but LGBT as a whole is quite broad. By accepting LGBT, and as such recognising it, does that mean that we're going to start recognising and accepting people that have neopronouns or identify as having xenogenders like 'sparklefurgender'?  (https://twitter.com/lpsonline/status/1321554038018756608?s=19) just do a simple twitter search on xenogenders or neopronouns and you'd see an outpouring wave of support from people supporting such genders/pronouns. They also literally advertise their genders like its some kind of a new product, a flashy toy for you to collect. Speaking on anti discriminatory rights, tell me then, if I were to say that 'sparklefurgender' or 'sillyfunnygender' which they identify as, isn't valid, would that mean that I'm discriminating against them? Or if I simply refuse to call them by their neopronouns of 'silly/sillys fun/funs' or 'dog/dogs/dogself' am i also discriminating against them? (https://neopronounlist.carrd.co/#animal)\n\nLastly, religion. Sure there are some comments that disparage this reason and say that using religion as a reason is just wrong and inappropriate as you're essentially hiding behind the religion. Sure, one cannot control themselves if they're LGBT, but if the Bible states that marriage is only between a man and a woman, and you claim that that's just wrong because through the religion, you're discriminating against LGBT people, shouldn't the opposite also hold true? If you decide to go against the Bible and hence the beliefs of Christians/Catholics are you not disrespecting the religion? There can be some middle ground as for this aspect, and we should consider it, instead of just fully pushing your will and stating that it's either marriage fully or nothing at all. Quite frankly, it is astonishing to see the amount of people that are so insensitive towards those who hold religious beliefs by simply wanting to push away and not take into account their beliefs at all."", '[deleted]', 'I\'ve personally thought a lot about this and i think the big concept here is the idea of morality. from what I understand, Christians believe that homosexual acts are morally wrong and we cannot deny them of that belief.\n\nthe problem to me is the intersection between religion and public life, we all largely understand that religion cannot be used in policy making. but the question here is, if my beliefs are religious, can they be used to determine policies?\n\nas many rightfully point out, most of it is a political game. the consensus is chosen so powerful people can stay in power, and consensus is conservative. and religious. mostly.\n\nthe answer here is morality. most Christians (from what I observed and researched in my mini projects) do not throw bibles at gays and say ""homosexuality should be illegal"". but instead they argue that it is morally wrong, and ultimately bad for society.\n\nthis is what troubles me. we cannot deny them of that. we as humans have also determined that killing is morally wrong, and rightfully made it illegal in (almost) everywhere. likewise, if people understand a certain act to be morally wrong, then we should at least put some restriction on it as well.\n\nthe greater philosophical question is then, what extent of morality (or immorality) is required for something to be illegal? killing is immoral so it is illegal. calling your mother idiot is also immoral but it is not illegal. so where does homosexuality lie?\n\nI have no idea', ""thank you for your opinion, I think it is unique and interesting to read.

It is still possible for them to find happiness in marriage, compared to LGBTQ couples, whereby even if they do so, they are unable of getting together to enjoy the benefits of marriage. In the case of CPF, I don't understand any negative setbacks that will come with the allowance of LGBTQ couples being able to transfer their CPF to each other. \n\n2. Yes, religion and LGBTQ can co-exist. However, in Singapore's society this is not seen whereby LGBTQ marriage is basically not recognised by the government. To me, this is simply not considered co-existing.\n\n3. I still don't understand why that statement is shallow. If a community's specific needs aren't met, the government has yet to fufil the requirement of meeting the needs of society.

That i believe should be the basic requirement.\n\n5. If such, I am curious to why we don't allow LGBTQ couples to adopt. I am pretty sure that many LGBTQ couples would be interested in the idea.

Eg, SG should set up guidelines such as those provided by UN to ensure things do not get overboard. However i disagree with your last pointtt! We pride our country as an integrated society, as we have learnt in SS. As such, diversity is an impt trait of our country!

veryinterestingweeb,1603085766,jdvyrv,6,1,"Hi, so from what I know of, most siblings in Singapore usually don’t get along very well (eg. they fight over stuff etc.)  As for me, I also experience the same. My sister is about 2 years younger than me(I’m a boy) Usually siblings don’t get along really well but they still love each other right? Because personally I don’t understand my sister really well. Even if I help her with her school work she doesn’t seem to show gratitude (such as a simple thank you) And whenever I get close to her (not very close but like maybe just 30cm apart) she just runs away. It’s like she’s allergic to me or something but idk. Some instances of this is when I sit next to her in a car, she would refuse to sit next to me (usually we sit at the back row with 3 seats) when we both are by ourselves I would sit at the right and she would at the left. When there’s 3 people she would want the person besides us to sit in the middle, if not she would throw a tantrum. We used to fight a lot when we were younger but we are quite old now (I’m 14, she’s 12) yet we still don’t get along well.

They would respect me less and physically hurt me more if i were to joke around too much and act childish around them. \n\nMaybe she has some sort of issues that she doesn\'t feel comfortable sharing, or maybe there\'s something about you that she sees that makes ber uncomfortable.

iamweird999,1623632125,nzaoem,111,106,"Hi guys, I'm seeking advice on here because I'm really at my wits end and I do not wish to share with my friends my current situation out of appearing vulnerable. 

So a little background about me and my girlfriend. I'm currently studying in university while my girlfriend has just matriculated into poly. She has been working part time since she was young (about 14) and has covered a lot of her own expenses because her mom refuses to give her an allowance. Her mom rationalises this by pointing out that my girlfriend has money from her part time work and does not need an allowance. I mean, what kind of logic is that? In addition, her mom is also divorced and is a single mum. She has a son who is currently studying for O levels.

My girlfriend's mom has also shown very clear bias against her from the very beginning. (her mom had another son) I'll illustrate using a few examples. When her mom is cooking food, she'll often exclude my girlfriend by refusing to cook for her and only cook for her son. This happens regularly. She will also have impossible expectations about my girlfriend and demand that she help with the household chores. But you have to understand, my girlfriend is juggling her studies in poly and she's working part time (long hours, 10 usually per shift) to make ends meet. (and because her mom refuses to pay for most stuff when she would readily get her son anything) How is it physcially possible for her to help out when she has to fulfil her obligations both as a student and working as a part timer? She never requests anything from her son (much less household chores) and I know it because whenever I go over, I'll be the one to wash their dishes after eating.

That's just the tip of the iceberg. Her mom has also explicitly mentioned that she would be better off without her daughter and said that she was ""捡回来的"" I feel as that my girlfriend is truly hurt by her mom's callous and insensitive remarks. It truly feels as if her mom only has love for her son and her daughter is an afterthought. The nerve of this fucking bitch.

On to the worse stuff. Her mum has also confirmed verbally that she will not pay her school fees (in poly it's about 3.2k/sem) and it was only when my girlfriend went to ask her dad that he obliged out of his obligation as a ""father"" and agreed to pay the school fees. Now, when the father paid up, he did it by transferring the school fees via her mother and not only did she NOT pay the entire sum given to her, she even requested my girlfriend to pay for her own phone bills + the costs of procuring a new phone. (mind you at an age where most kids are still schooling) My girlfriend's phone had spoilt, and she had to buy one out of necessity. 

Her mom has also threatened to kick her out of the house several times and for a period of time my girlfriend lived at her friend's place (close to a year) without going back. She only came back because her brother was suffering from depression and wanted to kill himself (presumably because of an insufferable mother) and my girlfriend had no choice but to go back and live with this kind of fuckface. I cannot fucking believe that a mother would fucking use economic duress on her own goddamn daughter  What kind of a fucking parent are you? She's been using finance to strong arm my girlfriend into obeying her but obviously it wasn't working.

Yesterday she and her mom had a huge fight. Shouting contest everywhere, each one try to one up the other. The reason was because her mom simply refused to wash the pot after cooking and has left it for 3 days to stagnate. I think the real underlying reason could be my girlfriend's frustrations with her  own mother + stress from her school work + her enduring everything her mom has threw at her since she was young. The pot incident was merely a trigger that exploded because of underlying resentment between both parties. I was surprised that I managed to keep cool during that period when both parties were shouting at the top of their lungs and her brother intervened too to stop the fight. (Her brother is on our side) It ended up in a stalemate but I had to pretend to cajole her mom when in reality I would love to erase her existence from this world and be done with it.

And here we are, her mom asking her to sleep in the living room. (they live in a 2 room condo, her mom sleeps on the sofa and her son takes the other room) at 3am in the morning when my girlfriend has work the next day and screaming at her for trivial things which could be done the next day. (Literal screaming)

Do you guys have any suggestions as to what we could do? In the long run, we'll most likely cut her out when we start work. We'll also ensure that she will not be receiving any form of compensation or remuneration under the Maintenance of Parents Act.

If you don’t want an official “investigation” I suggest you try walking in to the FSC, explain the problem including them not doing an intake so that you can understand what will happen next before deciding if you want to commit to this problem with an “official” protocol. \n\nYou can try having documentation such as audio recordings, bank statements or what not. It may devolve into a “he say she say” situation, but usually if there are more people on your side of the story MSF will really take a closer look. Especially if they receive a referral from the FSC. Furthermore I think if school fees are not paid, and the father has proof of a transaction history sent to the mother, that might be another piece of evidence that supports your girlfriend’s story. \n\nUsually once MSF gets involved, you’re protected by the law or some form of enforcing body. It will not be wise for the mother to try and go against it. As per my understanding they will usually make an arrangement with a safe adult, perhaps the father, to care for the children. There will be visitation restrictions imposed on the mother as well. I am not sure what happens if her father is not keen to be involved. Maybe they will turn to the grandparents or other adults. I believe in such scenarios they might make other arrangements. \n\nIn sum I suggest both of you to go find out more, then pick the lesser evil. It sucks that this is what your girlfriend is facing, and this isn’t anybody’s fault on any of you. It’s just an unfortunate situation especially growing up. \n\nIf in the end nothing changes because your girlfriend picks status quo to be the more palatable option that’s her choice as well. Change is difficult. I would then suggest drawing up a plan on how to move on from the mother in the future. I see that you’ve already started looking into the Maintenance Act; not sure if FSC can advise you about it but give it a go. Maybe Legal Aid is able to provide clearer answers as well. \n\nI am not sure how to help your girlfriend and her brother accept the possibility that they might lose their mother. They might need time, and they actually might need to talk about this as well. Even though the brother can see the biased behaviour, he is still in a favourable position if things remain status quo and might not approve or support of this decision. \n\nLastly I would like to point out that it is not MSF’s goal to simply remove the mother from the situation. Their goal is to encourage or “coach” a healthier relationship and eventually reintegrating everybody back into one cohesive unit again using whatever means necessary. Although I believe it is still your girlfriend’s choice on whether she wants that in her future. \n\nI hope this helps, and do take care of yourselves.', ""So glad your girlfriend's brother turn out to be nice kid. Because to be frank, often we heard children from toxic family issues always turn out to be Ah Beng or go off the right road very often or worse end up in boy's home. \n\nAnd since you mention he's going to study for his O level, I seriously think your girlfriend and her brother should go seek help from family service centre and see if staying at youth shelter is available option for him. The action her mother is projecting is child abuse already so I'm sure family service centre will have some solution options for your girlfriend and her brother. And once if you seek help from family service centre or maybe MSF, maybe financial aid will be an available option as well.. Don't give up hope!\n\nActually if her parents really do want to chip in money for her education, then that's fine though it's gonna be tough for both of you. Cause in that way, in future if your girlfriend is serious about cutting ties with her mum,she won't have leverage on your girlfriend about her spending money on her school fees and blah blah...  \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nAnd remember to give yourself a pat on your shoulder.

scuderia1234,1623051345,nu6r3z,6,1,"Ok guys so a little bit of TLDR. I've been suffering from OCD and Anxiety problems ever since the CB started and have been on anti-depressants and seeing psychologists for about a year now. Thing is I've had to switch psychologists once and now I think I might have to switch again... They are not ""lousy"" per se but I just feel that no progress is being made...

  
The first psychologist I met was a kind woman, calm and soft spoken type. The problem is that I felt that she was being more reactive than proactive. Every time I went there, I felt like I was just pouring out my problems to her. Each session would just involve me retelling the stories of OCD/Anxiety incidents that occurred in between our sessions. I felt this was too passive and after a few months of seeing her, I didn't feel like any progress was being made. I was just waiting for each episode to arrive and when it did I would deal with it. I wanted to go on the offensive in this fight and not the defensive, to take the fight to the OCD/Anxiety, hence I switched. I asked her for another colleague's contact and we parted on good terms.

&amp;#x200B;

The second one was a total opposite of the first one. When I first met her, she wanted to get down to business to attack the enemy, which I was happy about. In fact, during our first appointment I was expecting to have to retell the entire story of my war from top to toe. But in the end I only gave a brief summary as she was focused on the future. This was good news to me as I finally felt like I was going to get somewhere. But a few sessions in, I started to feel that she might be TOO aggressive. I felt like I was being attacked BY my psychologist every time I saw her and I told her that accordingly and said she would take note. She would say stuff like ""if you don't take actions to help yourself and challenge these obsessive thoughts then you won't get anywhere!"" and stuff like that. But I keep trying to tell her its not easy as the anxiety during those episodes is damn high...Overall its been a really tiring experience for me, this whole mental health situation and one year in, I don't feel like I'm making much progress at all honestly...

&amp;#x200B;

Which brings me to the point of this post. I am really confused as to what to do now. Is she right and that I am simply not putting enough effort to overcome this problem or should I switch for the 2nd time... Please advise and if you need more details do comment and I'll try my best to answer. Please do not mince words with me and if you think I am in the wrong, please tell me straight to my face so I can wake up...

However, given that I don't know you or any of your psychologists, my suggestion to you would be to reflect on the situation.\n\nInstead of pointing out that 1st psychologist is too gentle and not helping, and that the 2nd psychologist is too aggressive... think about how would you help yourself? What would you do if you were in their shoes? The field of psychology is a science, but it is also very much an art so there is no one solution to fit all. They may have many years of studies under their belt but ultimately only you'd know you best. Consider them your shortcuts to the world of how the human psyche works and work with them to device a coping mechanism that suits you the best. \n\nOn the question of whether the problems are with the psychologists or yourself, remember that there is no problem unless they have overstepped professional boundaries. Recovery is your journey, not theirs. If you still feel that the 2nd psychologist is too aggressive and you'd like to take things slow, have fewer sessions, request for another change.

Please don’t lose hope. \n\nWe have visited almost every OCD specialist in Singapore, and once she finally found a therapist that could meet her needs, I have seen her small steps forward. I would suggest to find a therapist that specializes in OCD because OCD is very complex and it can be hard for any other therapist to help you. \n\nWhat we have learned from this however is that you must voice out your needs to your therapist. If you feel that she is being too aggressive you need to voice it out, I know it may be hard but it is absolutely necessary. If your therapist doesn’t know your needs they cannot help you. At this point you probably know what you need and what you don’t need, take the time to discuss this with your therapist instead of letting them take the wheel entirely.']"

Unsure whether this is the correct thread to post on, would like some advice or thoughts on my situation.

I've a sibling which I've stopped speaking to for more than 6 months now. Prior to that, we were still on talking terms, albeit lesser. what made me stop all forms of interaction was because he was flaunting his riches during a time when I was unemployed.

Shortly after COVID-19 happened, I was made unemployed and as with any unemployed person out there, I felt extremely stressful because I've bills to pay coupled with the fact that the economy outlook was so uncertain, it was a very tough period. With a sibling who was boasting to my parents how much he made in the stock market every other few days, made me felt really trapped and helpless in my situation back then.

I did consider shifting out and renting a room, but my partner and I are saving up for a resale flat in a couple of years and the amount that goes into rental will eventually accumulate into a huge sum which we can use it for our flat next time hence that idea wasn't feasible. My partner shares a room, hence moving over isn't an option we can consider. Thus, I'm still currently living under my parents' roof. The glimmer of hope out of all these is that I've a room to call my own and that I became employed late last year.

That aside, said sibling also has a very fiery temper. Ever since the cold war started, there were a few occasions which he flared up without double checking the facts, raised his voice and hurled vulgarities at me. Mom tries to maintain peace in the family. She advised me not to take it to heart about what he's done/said, to take it in my stride and to forgive and forget. Dad is the typical Asian dad who doesn't speak much. I don't have a healthy relationship with my parents. There's a long history of unhappiness between my parents and I, most of which we swept under the carpet and I don't wish to open the can of worms. The few people I can confide in is my partner and my two other close friends.

I spoke to a counsellor before about all these and her advice to me was to communicate to my sibling and to talk things out. Tbh, I don't wish to speak to him. I really don't. I don't wish to put myself in a vulnerable position whereby I lay down all my unhappiness, fears, only to have him using all those to attack me later because it happened before and I rather not go down that path again.

His presence in the house makes me feel a mixture of feelings. Lots of anger, abhorrence, trapped, and fear. Fear because I'm uncertain when he'll start a fight, hurl vulgarities or scream at me. I'm not eloquent in retaliating back with vulgarities, hence most of the time I kept quiet. Tried and tested, speaking facts and sense didn't work. He'll raise his voice even louder and used crude words against me. To me, he's a hooligan through and through.

My work requires me to head into office daily, which I'm extremely grateful for, as I don't have to be home and face him everyday. He's at home almost daily. The office is one of the place I seek solace in. Home isn't a safe haven anymore. I look forward to the weekends because that's when I'm able to go out with my partner and get some little doses of happiness. I dread going home after work ends, and on one of the weekends when I'll be home the entire day. Being at home = have to face said sibling even if he's cooped up in his room most of the time. I felt a sense of peace and relief washes me when I know that he's not home.

When said sibling brings over his gf to stay over, my anger intensifies. This feeling doesn't make sense to me because she hasn't done anything against me but yet, I dislike her for no reason. I don't speak to her beyond the ""hello"". Tbh, I tried to actively avoid her as I don't even wish to acknowledge her presence.

Right now, all I can do is wait for time to pass, live day by day, save up as much as I can, and shift out the soonest and start life afresh. Even the soonest can potentially be another 2 years or more.

Being bigger, badder and hot tempered (he is 5 years my senior), he has even used physical force on me on several occasions. This happened when I was in poly.

I had no choice but to grit my teeth and tolerate him.\n\nOver the years things got better, and I can attribute it to factors both from myself and him:\n\n* I started practicing TKD after being invited by my peers. Though it wasn't much but I tell myself it does serve as a physical deterrence.\n* I try to avoid interaction with him, which cod potentially cause friction.\n* I entered the army soon after and was barely home. The army also did make me man up much more.\n* I strived for personal improvement. This helped to boost my confidence and eventually make me feel less fear but pity for his behaviour. In short, I made myself *the better man*.\n\nThe last bit was the most helpful. Thinking back, it was a lot of hard work , willingness to learn, and also validation from people I work with. I became a good sergeant in NS, a good employee, a good team leader.\n\nI learnt the virtues of being patient, proactiveness and how to control my thoughts and feelings without reacting to negative behaviors. I learnt to see such bad behaviour as poor mannerisms, upbringing, and character.\n\nMy greatest self achievement would be knowing that as the younger sibling, **I am much more mature than him at my age.**\n\nBuild up your self confidence.

i already know which hospital i want to be treated at, somewhere far from the place I live in, and I already have the logistics sorted out. i just wonder if theres anyone on here who can give any advice or help me in some way if that's possible. I just have to clear one more hurdle tomorrow and then i'm done. i have the rest of the week to carry out any plans if i feel like it.",askSingapore,39979,what do i do...,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/nc2lja/what_do_i_do/,1.0,"['+1 support for you OP.\n\nHave you ever sat down with your parents to have a serious talk about...

ChocolateDonutPizza,1619895142,n2opjw,23,1,"Hello, 

I am considering switching from my current job in operations at a financial institution to being a financial consultant (ie insurance). May I ask if anyone has had experience actually going through with it and if they could share how it went? 

For context, some of the reasons for considering the transition are as follows: 

I. Getting remunerated for the extra hours I put in

In Ops, the extra hours you put in for whatever reason simply means you are working for free. Putting in the extra hours in sales however may result in better chances of closing the deal and subsequently getting remunerated for it.

II. Transferable skills

The skills I pick up at my current role are mostly systems related. If I decide to join another company, knowledge from the previous firm will become irrelevant. The skill of selling products however, can be transferred. 

III. Long term prospects

Staying in my current role would mean that I have to fight with colleagues for pay raises/promotions and slowly grind my way up the corporate ladder. However,  moving to sales would mean that my work directly correlates to how much money I'll make and when I can start having people under my wing. 

Happy to hear from you guys who have had similar considerations and what made you decide to or not to make the jump.

Am currently a uni student in my early 20s and recently I've been feeling very empty and unmotivated about life in general. Mainly because I have nothing to do except to study. At least when I was in JC, there was CCA (obliged to have I guess) and a daily routine to follow but now that I am in uni, classes are irregular and few, I don't live in hall (to save costs) and CCAs are optional.

Honestly even I find myself pathetic - I have no interests, nothing I'm good at, can't sing/dance/play sports/music. Adding on to the fact that I have low self-esteem, I find it so very difficult to just join uni CCAs without prior experience (e.g considered joining dance or sports but just felt so overwhelmed by the confidence that others exuded) and I'm really at this point in life whereby I'm probably what others consider to be a NEET. Tried volunteering regularly but the thought of having to interact with people just further deters me.

Guys, I need advice

#Tl;dr I think I accepted a job offer but am now faced with a better offer from current employers to ''make me stay'' (I wasn't leaving cos I hate them, just to clarify), how do I ''cancel'' my acceptance of the job offer


I completed a part-time diploma this year with straight A's, and as I was feeling very motivated I was planned to continue on to degree in private uni. Unfortunately due to a lot of reasons I was unable to secure a loan. 

So fine, I decided that I'm simply gonna delay my plans a little and keep working to earn half my school fees, and then hopefully by the 4th term I'll be able to rely on my sibling to help me apply for a joint loan.

However, current job pays me a survivable salary (1800) that suited me before, but now with my savings intentions it is severely ''lacking'', simply not enough. Therefore I decided I need to go out there and find me a new job.

I did a bit of reading and asking around and the more common advice was to secure a job before quitting. So that's what I did. 

Two weeks ago I started job hunting, last week I did 3 interviews from 3 different clinics. This week I was offered one that was really good, offer was 2300.

I told the recruiter (middleman, have not really communicated directly with the prospective employer other than during interview) that I was really happy with the offer. 

They are aware that I'm only able to join by Jan 2021 (during circuit breaker my current employer forwarded hours to financially help me get by and so if I still intend to survive these months it would take me max until end December to return the hours) so I was especially happy that they could accomodate such a long wait time.

I finally go to my current manager to put in my resignation. Things to note: I fricking love this clinic, I love my colleagues very much, and I'd say I've contributed well as a nurse and performed better than I care to acknowledge (I have anxiety and low self-esteem, makes me think I'm the biggest fuck up). I explained the job offer and all (which clinic, which branch, expected salary) when asked. Manager didn't show any strong emotion and was very understanding. 

Within one hour of me doing so my manager sits me down again to let me know that together with my employer she has come up with an offer. In essence, it's better than the offer from the new clinic, plus I get to stay with my beloved colleagues. I didn't give any answer, said I'd think about it, simply because I was overwhelmed.

This is honestly my first time changing jobs under such circumstances and I don't know if I'm just dumb or naive but I really have no idea where I've made a mistake, I feel like I made several though. I also have anxiety and I'm honestly _panicking_ so I just need some people with functioning brains to help me

I have questions:
1. Am I now in a way ''legally bound'' to this new clinic cos I expressed my gratitude and all for their offer? I haven't sat down to sign any papers yet but they're already planning where to place me and when I start
2. Was I actually wrong to not have discussed this earlier with my current employer?
3. Am I ethically wrong to accept this offer from my current employer? I don't even know if my seniors are paid that much, plus I'm really stressed that my employers see this as a ''favor'' to me (I hate favors, never know if I can ever adequately repay them)
4. I'm very much keen to stay with my current clinic, is this seemingly greedy of me? Like I'm money-hungry? Also how do I tell this to the prospective employer?
5. Is there anything I should clarify before accepting or rejecting this offer?

TIA guys, I appreciate",askSingapore,22570,"Employment headache for an anxious and naïve person, need HELP",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/jj3kwa/employment_headache_for_an_anxious_and_naïve/,1.0,"['Get your current employer\'s offer in written form before rejecting your new offer.

Salty-Lingonberry139,1616997491,mfivv9,6,1,"I'm a 25 year old redditporean dealing with travel envy and wanderlust. I come from an upper-middle class family yet I do not get to travel as much as my peers. My cousin who comes from a lower income family has travelled to the usa and many other countries but I have not. The so called schoolmates who came from less well off families than mine,they had the chance to go overseas for their studies. No matter how you put it,going overseas to study is a privilege. 

I feel like I'm dealing with a self-perpetuating,self-defeatist cycle,like a dog chasing it's tail in a ring. I was not academically inclined so my mum chose accounting as my poly course,afraid that I may fail the course. When picking my poly course,I wasn't very enthusiastic either and if I could turn back time I would have chosen mass comms/nursing/other courses based on my interest and aptitude. 

So basically I went to poly,graduated with a shitty gpa and never lasted beyond two weeks for any accounting roles due to my severe adhd and poor attention to detail. This really took a toll on my self esteem and mental health. As a result,I couldn't obtain any scholarships to study overseas and I didn't have the means to earn enough money to go overseas on my own. 

Also,my dad believes that the usa is unsafe cause of guns and everything. My mum says that if a guy has sex with me,he must marry me.(or something along these lines). Also,I had hallucinations when I went on a CIP trip to China,making my family believe that I may not be able to take care of myself. My mum and dad also prefer guided trips to free and easy tours. As for my friends,a lot of them might not be mentally stable enough to travel overseas with me. 

I have been trying to make my mum less conservative and more liberal,so we took two solo non guided trips to australia with a tour guide. 

When I went to uni,I was already battered and beaten. Right now,I have been working for more than a year,in various jobs which require a lot of physical strength and stamina. I am trying to regain my confidence, and mental resilience. Hopefully,I will be mentally well enough to travel solo when I am 35, or maybe I would be able to find like-minded friends who would not need to worry about my mental state. 

Mental illness has taken a toll on people like us,like it or not. You may say that those ex classmates may be going through their own struggles too,but when you have mental illness you lose everything. Not many friends,an inability to earn enough income, and a myriad of other issues. Your love life suffers too. 

I have been comforting myself with the fact that there are people who are worse off than me,who may never get to travel to anywhere else except malaysia,indonesia or thailand.

So I think some of my tips could help you?\n\n1.  Make it a lifestyle and a habit - Ask yourself, what is your motivation for wanting to go to a gym? You want to look good for an event? Or you want to be healthier for a long time? If you motivation is the latter, it will be easier for you to get through your anxiety of going to a gym and going there consistently.\n\n2. Is gymming really for you? - There are many ways to exercise/lose weight. Find something that you ENJOY and have fun with rather than give you pressure. You can exercise simply by hiking / dancing/ playing sports with your friends etc. Like for me personally, i managed to lose some fats just by playing JUST DANCE on my nitendo switch for at least 30 mins everyday and I do it because I enjoy it, losing weight becomes naturally part of the process and it is an enjoyable one. Don\'t force yourself to do what you don\'t like. Getting healthier should be an enjoyable proccess (that\'s how you make it a long term thing!)\n\n3. Get a friend to go with you - get a friend that is EQUALLY or even more motivated to get healthy and fit with you to gym together. He/She would help to distract you from the ""unwanted attention"" from others. I remembered feeling the same way as you when I first started gymming. It got better when I went with a friend and I eventually prefer to go alone.\n\n4.  Remember that everyone else in the gym is FOCUSED on their own workout rather than others- IF your anxiety of going to the gym because you are scared of being judged by others then dont worry...everyone else is busy with their own workouts to care about others. Is ok to look stupid or bad in the gym because it is a place of self improvments. Other people look bad too, is just we dont know because we never look at them!\n\n5. Blast your own music, wear a cap - So you can focus on yourself and your workout durinng your gymming sessions\n\n\n\nSome other tips that are not related to gymming that might help with your weight loss journey: \n\n6. To lose body fat , your diet &gt; exercise. For losing weight, is always 30% exercise, 70% diet. Focus on your diet more, cut down on oily foods, sauces, sugar and processed food. Eat super clean and make sure you shit almost everyday. What you eat is what you are. Have the mentality that you are eating for energy/survival, cut down on all the indulgences like snacks or cakes, anything unnecessary. Dont ever eat supper too. But is ok to have some cheat days (with control lol)\n\n7. More movements - What I meant by this is not necessarily exercise but increase your daily movements. Meaning, instead of lying down on the sofa, go for a walk or do some housework. Instead of sitting down most of your time, do some stretches. Gymming wont really make a huge difference if you are just going to gym once a week because easily 70% of your week is still dependent on your day to day movements. You will be surprised at how simply just choosing to walk more/ doing more simple movements could affect you weight in the long term.\n\n8. To lose weight, cardio is the way - When you exercise, you dont transform fats into muscle (no such thing). Infact, you lose fats and gain muscle. Hence lifting weights or using those strength training equipment in the gym would  build muscles but not necssarily help u lose  your fats - you might end up looking bulky/muscular (nth wrong with that).CARDIO is the best way to lose fats and become the leanest in the fastest time so going for intense hikes ( e.g. diary farm route at Bukit Timah Hill) , jogging outdoors would help alot more. This is really based on my personal experience but this could work differently for different people.\n\n9.  Can try intermittent fasting - this is super effective but requires lots of discipline. I would usually havs my first meal at 1pm and last meal before 8pm. If intermittent fasting is too hadd on you, can try to stop eating entirely after 8pm.']"

fricklesfrackle,1618973730,mv6sf4,8,1,"hi! to summarise things very briefly things have been going pretty downhill for me for a while now - i've always struggled with low self esteem and suicidal thoughts etc and it's been really affecting my day-to-day life pretty badly. my parents want me to see a private psychologist (already have a contact), so it's my first time and i'm a little scared. but the main crux and concern of this post is how much i should divulge to my therapist?

the thing is i'm bisexual and i think this might play a part in some of my mental health? and some of my issues stem from other things i'm not very comfortable revealing to my parents. i'm really worried that if i tell my therapist though that she'll either be a) homophobic, b) tell my parents or c) judge me as a person although i'm sure that's not what she's going to do as a therapist...? but you can never really be too sure in our conservative society aha.

i'm just not sure how the personal information disclosure stuff works but i'm 18 and i also don't want it to be the case where i only tell my therapist half-truths or not tell her about issues that contribute to the worsening of my mental health. i really do want to let her know but i'm just worried about it. do you think it would be safe to tell the therapist about all this or just discuss the other factors that my parents are already aware of with her (i.e stress about studies etc)? thank you ):",askSingapore,38599,concerns about speaking with a psychologist / psychotherapy - i'd appreciate any advice!,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/mv6sf4/concerns_about_speaking_with_a_psychologist/,1.0,"['Hi there!

It isn’t simply a therapist panicking and calling your parents when you say you had suicidal thoughts, what usually happens is a risk assessment and an intervention process. Moreover, patient confidentiality remains, even if your parents are the one footing the bill. Your parents may be able to ask for a clinical report, but the therapist will not be able to share information regarding your sessions without your consent (esp if you’re over 18).\n\nLong story short, yes, you should divulge everything to your therapist. There are some situations where the therapist will break confidentiality, but you will always be informed in the process. \n\nLast but not least, your concerns about homophobia / being judged are totally valid. However, any judgement / reaction from the therapist is completely on them and their lack of professionalism and not on you. Therapists are trained to deal with many diverse situations, and they should not let their personal beliefs get in the way of their treatment and assessments.

IMHO, the information does not shed light into anything that we do no already know. WFH is a convenience that many wished their companies offered - at the expense of productivity ^((from the poll results, not my own statement))

But we would also note that there is a global inertia to go back to work and start the economy - it is not limited to just our nation. We all know this cannot go on forever or the whole fabric of global economy we have built over years will crumble.

You do not walk off the dinner at the mall and make impulse purchases-  mall sales dip. mall footfall dip... the tenants suffer and close... the malls sales suffer...and the chain continues....)*

*  Vaccine not gonna appear in the next 2 years
* Community spread is going to be a norm, not high, but normal

Benedict_Tan,1590087006,go2p94,8,0," 

TLDR. I am suggesting that we should go for herd immunity, with the circuit breaker being lifted today. What we should do going forward is to keep the more relaxed restrictions we have in March. That is, continue social distancing and washing our hand, but allow gathering to continue up to a limit of 10 (or maybe 50). Keep restaurants, schools, salons etc open. Enhance isolation of those people who are in nursing home (the most vulnerable population).

I am just a university student. I am not an expert in the field of infectious disease. Everything that I know, you could also know too from online sources. What I am saying here expresses only my opinion, and no one else. I am writing here to generate a discussion and gather more opinions. I am suggesting that we are likely to had went through our current enhanced lockdown for nothing. Continuing with all the restrictions we had in March was enough.

Globally, we have been misled to believe that the fatality rate is between 1% to 3%. But recent surveys suggested that the number is much closer to 0.2% to 0.6%. 0.5% is from a survey in New York, where the healthcare system was overwhelmed. This article from New York Times ([https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/nyregion/coronavirus-antibodies-test-ny.html)) suggested that. To quote the article “If the pattern holds, the results from random testing of 3,000 people raised the tantalizing prospect that many New Yorkers — as many as 2.7 million, the governor \[Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo\] said — who never knew they had been infected had already encountered the virus, and survived.” As a result, “the death rate in New York from Covid-19 would most likely be far lower than previously believed, possibly 0.5 percent of those infected.”. This article was from 23 April 2020.

Antibody test suggested that New York City already have 20% of people being infected. Stockholm another 20%, Heinsberg (Germany’s covid-19 epicentre) already have 14 percent. These are study done about a week ago, and people who are tested positive in these antibodies tests would have been infected weeks ago. Developing the required antibodies takes time. So, these are the total number of people who have been infected maybe two weeks back, so the number today would be higher. These results are suggesting a much higher infection rate for Covid-19 then we have been made to believe, perhaps being even more infectious than Influenze (H1N1, which is also known as Swine Flu, started in 2009 and infected about 1 billion people by 2010). Given that these areas already have so many people being infected, it is impossible to keep the number of cases down to zero. Right now, the number of cases for them is going down. But when they open up, the number of cases will only go up. They are much closer to herd immunity as compared to bringing the number down to zero. In fact, Sweden’s capital, Stockholm, is expected to achieve herd immunity (\~60% of people infected) by end of May. Chances are that US and EU have no choice but to go into herd immunity. What would Singapore do then?

The virus is going to hit us, whether or not we want it. Unless Singapore is ready to seal its border for the next 18 months. Optimistically, within 18 months, an effective drug/vaccine would have been found and ready for mass production. Historically, no vaccine had been ready for mass usage within a year. Unless we are ready to seal our border, majority of us will be infected before the vaccine arrive. Given that we will get the virus eventually, having a lockdown today is not going to help us, we are simply pushing the pain to the future.

I am suggesting for Singapore to aim for herd immunity through natural infection instead of suppressing the virus. How herd immunity work is that by having around 60 % of the population already infected by Covid-19 then recover, the virus would not be spreading through our country as fast even when we leave the restriction. It would not spread as fast because the number R0 (number of people each infected person infects) would be lower because out of 10 person that we could originally past to, 6 of them are already immune and only 4 of them could be infected. We do so by keeping all the restrictions we had in March, but add it on with compulsory mask in public transport and crowded places so that the number of cases would not increase too fast for our healthcare system. Let the virus spread through the population in a controlled manner such that the number of people infected stays at a sustainable level so that the healthcare would not be overwhelmed. A preliminary ball park figure would be 10,000 new infections everyday, but I need to do my study on this, if anyone have a research paper suggesting the right number, do let me know!

Of course, going back to the more relax measure that we had in March would increase the number of people who requires medical attention, potentially overwhelming Singapore’s medical system. But what we read about Singapore healthcare system being severely overwhelmed are being made by a wrong assumption – they severely overestimated the number of people who needs medical attention and ICU facility. I am suggesting that whoever is advising our government on their approach, have used a very wrong number that far exaggerated the real seriousness of the virus. Today (1st May 2020) we have about 15,000 migrant worker who are already infected, yet three is in ICU. On 17 April 2020, Straits time reported that by the time 20 thousand of our migrant workers get infected, we will need 200 ICU beds to treat them. Quoting from Straits Time “Prof Fisher \[senior infectious diseases expert at the National University Hospital\] said: ""If 20,000 get infected, they will need at least 200 ICU beds, and statistically there may be 40 deaths.” ([https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/surge-in-virus-infections-strains-healthcare-system](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/surge-in-virus-infections-strains-healthcare-system)). The 20,000 infections here refer to the migrant population. I don’t think it is a stretch to assume that Singapore’s government had been using this kind of prediction when suggesting that our healthcare system would be overwhelmed without the additional lockdown measures we had in April. I am comparing the measures between what we are doing now, versus what it was back in March. As a result, we might all be going to lockdown because the severity of this virus is being overestimated, by an order of 100x. Professor Fisher estimation suggest that at least 150 migrant workers would be in ICU because we have about 15,000 infections, but in reality, we are seeing single digit number of migrant worker in ICU right now. 150 vs single digit, that's a very big overestimation. Not to mention, given that we now know that in places like New York, California, Germany, Netherlands and Sweden, the number of people who have been infected is 10 times the number that is being confirmed by covid-19 test. Maybe the number of migrant populations being infected is not 15k. Maybe, it is half of 300k. Three ICU patients among 150 thousand infected migrant population. Let that sink.

We could also look at the number of ICU beds that Sweden needed through thisCovid-19 pandemic. If I understand this website ([https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/](https://www.icuregswe.org/en/data--results/covid-19-in-swedish-intensive-care/)) correctly, Sweden needed at most 558 ICU for covid-19 at any point of time, yet they are suspected to have infected about 1 million people by the beginning of May. Sweden has a population of 10 million, and Singapore has about 5.6 million people. Also, Singapore is capable of having 600 ICU beds for Covid-19 ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/coronavirus-22-patients-in-icu-hospitals-have-nearly-150-vacant-icu-beds-and-can-add](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/coronavirus-22-patients-in-icu-hospitals-have-nearly-150-vacant-icu-beds-and-can-add) ), which is higher than the 558 needed in Sweden for covid-19.

Another important thing to consider is how many could we save by pushing the virus back until a vaccine is found. Base on figures from Europe, most of the death are among those above 70 years old. In fact, in some countries, the median age of death is actually higher than the life expectancy. What's the proportion of those who died from covid-19 that would had died from other causes if they didn't get covid-19 within 1.5 years (the time it takes for a vaccine to be in mass usage in an optimistic scenario)? In some countries, about half the death from covid-19 are from nursing home, and in these nursing home, e.g. in Sweden, majority of them don't really have much longer than a year to live. In other words, about half the death from covid-19 are among people who would had died by 2022 without covid-19. What it means is that the extra health issue (mental and physical health impact of prolonged lock down) could actually outweigh the negative impact of achieving herd immunity through natural infection against covid-19. There is no actual number for this figure yet, and we could only really know it around 2023 by comparing with the excess mortality.

Another thing to mention is that even if a vaccine is found, it may not be 100% effective. Some of us could, especially the elderly, could still be vulnerable to covid-19 even if there is vaccine. Even the flu vaccine, after decades of research and development, only reduces the odds of getting the flu by 60%. Note that this flu vaccine has already taken into account that there are multiple strains of Influenza. Also, there is still no HIV vaccine, no effective dengue vaccine (there's one for those who had been infected at least once by dengue, but none for those who have yet to be exposed). There are some vaccine that even results in vaccine enhanced diseases, but we can't be sure that a vaccine won't result in that until we get to test the vaccine extensively. Vaccine takes about a decade to develop for good reason, to make sure that the vaccine is safe for everyone, especially the elderly and those with co-morbidity. But accelerating the vaccine development so quickly could also means we are removing some of these safety measure.

One major objection to the herd immunity approach is that immunity is not guaranteed. To such objection, I paraphrase Professor Johan Giesecke, the former State Epidemiologist for Sweden and current advisor to Sweden’s herd immunity strategy “Because it is a coronavirus, and we know about six other coronavirus and why would this be special”. Basically, we develop immunity for all other coronaviruses so far, so we will be developing an immunity for Covid-19. The only question is how long our immunity will last. Everyday of lockdown causes us hardship and even more death. Treatment for less serious illnesses will be pushed back as long as the virus is still within us. When these people do eventually get treated, their condition will get more serious because of delayed treatment. The longer we take to adopt the herd immunity strategy, the longer we had to push back treatments for less severe illnesses (heart issues, kidney issues, etc). Not to mention the devastating economic impacts it has on us. The general health of a population usually suffers during a financial crisis. Not only that, a reduction in tax revenue and increased in fiscal spending could also mean less resources for healthcare in the future, which could have a negative impact on future healthcare standard.

Lockdown is not harmless. Lockdown is playing dice with the devastating health and sociological impact that lockdown creates on us. Lockdown is not the prudent strategy of waiting until we know more about the virus then we go ahead. Maybe it was. But today, we already have enough data to suggest that we can go for herd immunity.

Singapore should lift the lockdown measure, while making sure to calibrate their strategy so that their ICU facility has at least a few % (maybe 1% to 2%, I don’t know the number, do let me know if you have any research on this number) of spare capacity at each point of time. We too should protect the most vulnerable from the infection, basically the nursing homes. Those in nursing home who are unable to care for themselves are far more at risk than the elderlies who can take public transport on their own. Singaporeans are not stupid. Singaporeans know what is good for themselves and for others. The government can trust us on that.

So basically spreading it = giving it more chance to mutate', '[deleted]', ""Oh, one point I just remember, it might be possible to reduce the spread to a manageable level by removing super spreader events and asking people with symptoms to stay at home, without all the other measures. Super spreader events doesn't just leave a lot of people infected, it also tend to leave people sicker due to the suspected initial higher viral load that people get in such event. Also current estimations is that about 45% of the transmission is from people with symptoms, about 10% are from environment, and the last 45% are from pre-symptomatic and asymptomatic transmission. With 45 % of the transmission being from people with symptoms, it may actually be sufficient to reduce the transmission by half just by asking those with even the mildest symptoms to isolate themselves at home. Of course in practice there could be many who flout the rules, perhaps incentive (e.g government subsidized paid sick leave sponsored) and punishment has to be in place."", ""I would think that one year is sufficient. I suspect that Singapore's healthcare system is able to handle about 10,000 to 20,000 new infection a day, but there is no such reliable estimations out there so it is hard to tell. Assuming that it is possible to make the virus spread much faster among those under 60 than those above 60, if we can assume that 0.5% of those under 60 years old needs ICU, and the median stay is 10 days, it is possible to handle 12,000 new infections every day with 600 ICU beds for covid-19. Of course, we have to take into account if there is sufficient non-icu capacity, and I don't have such data.   \n\n\nRegarding mutation, even if it mutates, good chance that there will be cross-immunity between the different strains of covid-19.

Alttyrt,1608026458,kdj0g3,24,1,"With the news of Singapore and other countries getting vaccines in the coming weeks, when do you guys expect the likely possibility of us returning to normal (i.e. pre-COVID days)?

I know I commented previously in the vaccines thread about the [authorities continuing to enforce safe distancing and mask-wearing even after the vaccines roll out](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kd986l/sporeans_still_need_to_wear_masks_practise/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3). I asked when can we expect to return back to the old normal when enough evidence emerges of the vaccine's true effectiveness for Singapore.

Now, I decide to ask this as the main question on this subreddit: **when can we expect a return to normal for Singapore, a day where we can finally remove our masks outside with no penalty?** Don't assume me to be an anti-masker or anything like that. But I just have a persistent hope or belief that the vaccines may certainly be the cure for the virus that ruined our year and lives. That there is light at the end of the tunnel after all. That this vaccine can return us back to normal.

However, there are many commentaries, warnings aren't out there saying that the vaccines isn't the magical wonder-drug to stop the pandemic, the silver bullet. Even though they do have a point, I fear that they are squashing any hope I have. I'm very concerned about the possibility of whether we have to face this pandemic for a very long time that mask-wearing is a permanent thing. And like all of us having the travel bug, I am yearning for the days where I can freely plan my vacation and go to the places I want to go. I want to be able to freely watch cinema without the possibility of the film getting pushed back. Being a spectacle-wearer due to very high astigmatism, the masks I wear everytime I go out just fogs up my glasses and makes my voice muffled.

I very much missed the pre-COVID days that I take for granted.

Looking at history itself, all pandemics do not last forever. They either stop entirely or it slows down to be less contagious.

But looking at COVID and the recent developments, when can we estimate a return back to normal or at the very least, stop wearing masks if given a chance? I'm just hoping luck will be on our side next year.

Again, don't judge me for being an anti-masker, being too impatient or anything like that. I'm not enforcing any agenda but I'm hoping for some consensus on this subreddit.

The population of Singapore is [approximately 5.9 million](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/singapore-population/) (which also includes foreign workers).

February: 288,000

April: 4,680,000

[Herd immunity according to WHO requires 95% of the population to be vaccinated](https://www.who.int/news-room/q-a-detail/herd-immunity-lockdowns-and-covid-19), so around 5,605,000 people would have to be vaccinated. If there are no more influx of imported cases and no new mutated strains in Singapore, it is only on May 13 where we would officially have “herd immunity”. 
 
TL:DR, if everyone continues to follow social distancing measures and everything, we would be fine about in 110 days.

Sufficient_Office_93,1611027323,l0b91r,10,1,"Hello, I've never been someone against vaccines as they do more good than bad for us (measles, polio, tubercolosis etc which killed a lot of people) but this recent covid vaccine has got me thinking and surprised that we would eventually be expected to all take it so we can go back to normal and before years of testing. I was always confident and comfortable in getting vaccines for myself and my loved ones because many generations before us have gone through that and live long happy and healthy life despite being obstinate. However we do not have that evidence in this case.

I am not too sure about the details as I haven't been keeping up with news as closely as I did back in my school days but I did see on the news that there were some bad and serious reactions to vaccine. What if there were more side effects and more dangerous ones than this in long term? Normally, vaccines would be tested for years before being released to the public however with covid, we haven't had time to do that yet. 

I understand that the economy and our well-being as well as mental health has suffered immensely due to covid and having a vaccine would definitely make life a whole lot easier and allow us to go out and carry on her normal activities. However, those who are pro covid vaccine, have you considered the long-term side effects of the vaccine that could or could not be life threatening? I can't help but wonder, what if covid doesn't kill us all eventually, what if the vaccine is the reason humans go extinct? I am not anti-vaccine and I do understand herd effect will make the vaccine most effective (means as many people as possible have to be vaccinated), just want to hear your thoughts and wonder if you've thought of this",askSingapore,34107,How safe is the covid vaccine?,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/l0b91r/how_safe_is_the_covid_vaccine/,1.0,"[""Yeah I thought of this too but since I am an existentialist, I don't care just take vaccine.

So what if we do a 50/50 split, but a few years later for example vaccine A causes people to go blind? So we have half the pop becoming blind or what. \n\n\nI don’t know too much about the science that goes on, as that’s not what I’ve ever studied before. I’ll still take the vaccine when it’s my turn for it. But the worry and doubt does exist in my head. I don’t have any doctor or science friends, so I can’t really ask anyone in the industry.', 'death enters the chat...', ""nobody know for now, but when you're surrounding by walkers, anything that has more than 1% in increasing your survival rates, you will take it.\n\nin any case, different people has different medicines/cures for even common sickness such as cough. what's work for some, doesn't work for others. some people swear the efficacy of Pi Pa Gao, some people drink bottles of them and still cough like no other tomorrows, but take medicine A, instant cure.\n\nyou get my gist."", 'Hi! I\'m a graduate student working on RNA, which is the molecule that the new COVID vaccine is made from. I totally understand your reservations about the vaccine, and your concerns are reasonable.\n\nTo understand the vaccine better, I\'d like to explain how this vaccine works compared to a traditional vaccine. In a ""traditional"" vaccine, we basically give your body a small amount of a ""dead"" virus which cannot cause any illness and which cannot spread. When we do this, the body\'s immune system learns to recognise the virus and defeat this dead virus. When our body next encounters the live virus, it will already have the capability to recognise and quickly kill the virus before it is able to cause disease.\n\nOne of the biggest challenges regading the traditional vaccine strategy is making a virus that is ""dead enough"" to not spread/cause illness, but ""live"" enough that your body wants to fight it off. Another concern is that since we are introducing a foreign particle into our body, our body may have an adverse reaction to the particle.\n\nIn the new COVID vaccines, they use a new strategy. In this strategy, they are injecting a small amount of RNA. RNA is the ""blueprint"" a cell uses to make protein. When this RNA enters your cells, your cells start to make a small part of the COVID virus, and our immune system learns to recognise and attack this small part of the virus.\n\nSince we are only making a small part of the virus, we are more certain that the virus is incapable of spreading or causing illness. Also, RNA is a regular molecule that our body makes (for creating our own body\'s proteins), so it\'s less likely for our cells to have an adverse reaction to the RNA vaccine. Finally, RNA does not last very long in the body. Typically, the body gets rid of RNAs within a few minutes to hours! Once it has done its job it\'s gone, so the odds of long term side effects are quite rare.\n\nIt is true that a small number of people had an allergic reaction to the vaccine. However, it was quite rare, the allergic reaction could be treated quickly, and the truth is that a small number of people are allergic to every vaccine (including the ones we take regularly, such as the chickenpox vaccine). There have not been, as far as I know, reports of any severe side effects unique to the COVID vaccine.\n\nAlthough the technology is quite new, the companies making this vaccine have [been testing RNA vaccines for years](https://www.modernatx.com/pipeline/therapeutic-areas/mrna-personalized-cancer-vaccines-and-immuno-oncology) against other conditions, so we do have some idea of its relative safety over a longer timecourse as well.\n\nThe reason why we got this vaccine so quickly, aside from the concerted global efforts in fighting this virus, is also because RNAs are easy to make compared to these ""dead"" viruses. So in the span of time it takes to make a ""dead"" virus, the scientists can design, make, and test several RNA vaccines. This is also why we\'re able to quickly make a massive global stock of this vaccine.\n\nI hope this answers some of your questions and puts you more at ease. Your concerns are valid and actually as a researcher I\'m glad that people are willing to make an effort to learn more about the science behind our medical choices. Let me know if you have any more questions and I\'ll try my best to answer them.\n\nEDIT: Wanted to add that the RNA vaccines are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and Moderna vaccines.  The Oxford-AstraZeneca and SinoVac vaccines rely on the ""dead virus"" traditional version of the vaccine, and they\'re still under trial to test their efficacy and side effects. I\'m not as qualified to comment on those, but from my basic understanding they\'ve been safe in clinical trials as well.', 'Such a comprehensive reply, thanks for the info!', 'Thank you this was very helpful and easy to understand and talked me into getting vaccinated lol. So in the future, are they planning to make and sell the ""dead virus"" version of the vaccine? Also, why don\'t we stick to the rna version for every type of disease if it is faster to make and safer?', 'I forgot to clarify this in my initial response. The RNA vaccines are the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines and Moderna vaccines. There actually are ""dead virus"" versions of the vaccine well underway and being trialled. For example, the Oxford-AstraZeneca and SinoVac vaccines are ""dead virus"" vaccines (the official term for these is inactivated virus vaccine). I don\'t feel as qualified to give an opinion on these vaccines, but my understanding for these vaccines (at least in Oxford-AstraZeneca\'s case) is that they were already working on an inactivated virus vaccine for the SARS outbreak in 2002, but as the SARS outbreak petered out, they paused development of those vaccines. When the Covid-19 outbreak happened, they found that the viruses were similar enough that they could use the vaccine candidates back from 2002 and start clinial trials, which is why they were able to make a vaccine so quickly. \n\nAs for why we don\'t already use RNA treatments, the honest reason is that it is still new technology. The Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines will be the first RNA vaccines approved for clinical use. One of the major breakthroughs in the past few decades is next generation sequencing, which is the ability to quickly and accurately figure out the DNA/RNA sequences that make up an organism. Up until that point we simply didn\'t have the information needed to make RNA vaccines (not just the sequence itself, but also information about how RNA behaves, how the cell uses RNA vs how a virus would use RNA, etc). Moving forward, I think we will start to see a lot more RNA therapeutics. \n\nAlthough there are more elegant ways of designing inactivated virus vaccines nowadays, you can honestly make an inactivated virus vaccine without knowing anything at all about the virus. For example, one of the polio vaccines was just the poliovirus treated with a chemical to kill it lol. So this is how the earliest versions of vaccines were made, when there was less information available about vaccines. Another benefit of inactivated viruses will be that they look a lot more like the real virus. There\'s a possibility that if you just infect a person with a small part of the virus, the immune system won\'t recognise the real virus as the same thing later on. Whereas an inactivated virus often retains a lot more of the same structures as the original virus. \n\nFinally, there\'s the issue of accessibility. RNA vaccines need to be stored at -80 degrees Celsius, which means they are difficult to transport and store, especially in less developed countries (and it\'s expensive!) \n\nI think we\'ll see both types of vaccines being developed side by side in the future, depending on which is more suitable (:', 'Thank you!

There's a lot of shaming and labelling of those who don't want to get vaccinated as ""anti-vax"".

No, I don't believe in 5G causing COVID, and I don't believe that the vaccines contain microchips.

However, is there a concern that perhaps the vaccines has been fast-tracked in light of the emergency situation of COVID19? Also, we are starting to learn that it has caused health problems in a very small number of cases.

In addition, there are cases of those who are vaccinated, double-dosed, still getting COVID.

So if vaccination doesn't give you immunity, but lessens the severity of the effects, then what if you are not in the ""at-risk"" group? In other words, what if you are perfectly healthy, no underlying illnesses, and under 30? What is the mortality rate for such a subset of the population? If it is miniscule, then should such a person need to take the vaccine? Aren't most of the people of died elderly, underlying health conditions, obese, etc.?

yeetawayRA,1623324173,nwl5uc,10,1,"Hello, I'm part of the age group that finally gets to register for vaccination tomorrow! Would just like to ask if anyone ~20-25/30 years old who were able to take the vaccine early could share their side effects (if any) after taking moderna?

Most likely I'll be taking moderna because it has a shorter waiting time and I wanna be vaccinated ASAP so that (while highly unlikely) in the event that Australia magically opens their border before semester 2, I'll be able to fly back. 

However, my parents have told me horror stories of people they know who have suffered severe side effects after taking moderna. I'm talking about HUGE rashes/bruises(?) and immense feelings of pain. Granted, they're older (50s-60s) so maybe their immunity not as high so the effects more severe? Idk.

NOTpartoftheproblem,1622948010,ntbxc0,5,1,"I tried posting this on r/Singapore but my post wasn't showing up. If this is the wrong subreddit, let me know, I will repost it at the appropriate subreddit.

Today, I got my 2nd dose Pfizer vaccine but there was no side effects, not even a sore arm. In contrast, when I had my 1st dose, I had a very bad sore arm for 1.5 weeks. I had expected my 2nd dose to have a larger side effect from the research I have done.

From the lanyards they were wearing, my 1st dose was done by a 'staff nurse' while the 2nd dose today was done by a 'vaccinator', which I assume to be a non-medical professional. Could this have contributed to the vaccination not being administered properly? And hence the lack of the side effects. 

Another detail that may be important is that the needle did not feel to go very deep and only reached the skin level. I could also feel some liquid leaking out to the surrounding skin after the 'vaccinator' removed the needle.

If it is possible to readminister my 2nd dose vaccine, is there a designated channel where I can contact MOH?

Thank you for reading my post. Any insights on the matter would be great!

It is still possible to get Covid-19, just that community spread will not be sustained (as Taelion posted below).\n\nI\'ll also take the opportunity to add to my earlier comment about vaccinated persons being less likely to have severe symptoms.  From the CDC report dated 7 May 2021 -\n\n""In a multistate network of U.S. hospitals during January-March 2021, receipt of Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna COVID-19 vaccines was 94% effective against COVID-19 hospitalization among fully vaccinated adults and 64% effective among partially vaccinated adults &gt;= 65 years.""', 'No, if enough people are vaccinated, the success rate of the vaccine in preventing infection is high enough that it will reduce the R0 of SARS-cov-2 to below 1.

So let's say vaccination cuts transmission only by half:\n\nWithout vaccine: 1 person infects 2 people, and they carry on to infect another 4.

- what about the lower income family? How can they survive without any income? 
 The government can give them more money per month base on their income/ children they are looking for. I’ve seen a few documentaries base on the poor families in Singapore and many of them cannot apply for ( i don’t know what’s the word but it’s a organisation to help out the needy ) as they don’t meet the criteria. For example, they can earn $1.2k per month but they have to look after 6 kids and to apply for that, you need to be earning less than $1k. 


- what about buying groceries / whatever you need? 
You’ll get them online. The person delivering them will all get tested before they are able to work. Everyone will only be able to get a certain amount of item unless they got special 
permission from the government or something. Before lockdown, families who have no access to the internet will go to the nearest community Center to get help and they will do a background check making sure no one is taking advantage it to abuse the system. Maybe the start of every month they can state how many of what they need and it will be delivered to them. ( this might not work as they will need to hire a lot of people. Well this can be fixed if we take turns to order? Like the east will order this month while the west will be next month ) 

While everyone is staying home, a test kit will be given out to see if they have covid cause I heard some ppl don’t have symptoms. Not sure if there’s a kit right now but I remember someone saying there is one but it’s not 100% accurate but hey it’s better than 0%? Imagine how many lives we can save

Yellow-Apple-Tree,1597052369,i71sf6,29,1,"Lately I’ve been seeing many questions regarding seeking help for mental health. As someone who has been diagnosed with major depressive disorder and taking daily doses of antidepressants and insomnia pills, I think I can give some insights to how the process and the costs would be like.

**Public Sector**

* Most polyclinics have a psychology department with some psychologists and psychiatrists (sometimes regular GPs are used) on staff.
* I was encouraged to see a GP first to book an appointment with a psychologist to be assessed and diagnosed for my condition. You can do this if seeing a psychologist straight away is too big a jump for you. Tell the GP about your symptoms or as much as you’re comfortable sharing. This will give the psychologist more information to start off with and your next session with them can progress faster. This first session won’t cost too much (regular GP consultation costs)
* When you see the psychologist, they’ll assess your situation and try to come up with a diagnosis. If you need medication, there are usually some available at the polyclinics already. If not, you may be referred to SGH or IMH to get your medication.
* On a regular basis, you’ll see a **psychiatrist and a psychologist.** Psychiatrists are the ones giving you prescriptions (they are medically trained) psychologists don’t give prescriptions but they are the ones handling your therapy (which you will be recommended to go for).
* **Psychiatrist consultations costs:** can be around SGD30+, not including prescription. The medication is rather affordable. I’m on 2 tablets of Sertraline a day and a 2.5 months’ supply of that is around SGD40.
* Finding medication may need some time because everyone’s bodies react differently to different medication. I had to switch from Mirtazapine to Sertraline because I got some side-effects that weren’t considered normal - fever. Sertraline gave me chills once in a while but other than that, I’m mostly content with taking it for now. Some people may have to keep trying different kinds of medication to see which ones are more suitable for your body. What works for me might not work for you.
* **Psychologist consultations cost:** therapy is about SGD87 per session. I’m not sure if there are different kinds of therapy that have different costs but this was what I always got. My first session was simply getting to know my situation. So don’t worry if it feels like a wasted appointment. First sessions are usually used to let the psychologist know what’s going on with you, how you want to be helped and planning the goals you want to achieve in therapy.
* **If you’re a student:** not sure about JC students, but I’m aware that some universities (like NUS and SUTD) have medical insurance that covers mental health treatments (both therapy and medication). Primary schools, Secondary schools and JCs have school counsellors. Some universities have counsellors too. They usually aren’t licensed therapists but they do listen to you and try to help albeit to a limited extent. If you would prefer to start small, or if you want to save money, school counselling is a decent start.
* **If you’re a working adult:** check with your company / employer for medical benefits. If you work in civil service, you’re likely covered. (Or so I’ve heard)
* **Personal information:** Don’t worry about your psychologist or psychiatrists contacting your parents or relatives about your situation unless you are showing obvious signs of getting yourself into danger like if you have clear plans on attempting suicide. They are professionals and mostly know how often dysfunctional families are contributors to mental illness.
* **Short-falls of public sector mental health treatment (appointment availability):** the psychologists and psychiatrists mostly work on weekdays and don’t extend to weekends. That means you will have to take time off your weekday schedules to attend your appointments. Appointments are also not easy to come by. After one session, your next appointment can be 2 months from then. You can always call in later to see if people cancel their appointments and free up space for you but public sector healthcare usually tends to a large number of the population so it might take some time before they get to you.

**Private Sector**

* I haven’t been through the private sector but based on what my psychologist has told me and based on personal research too, it’s considerably more expensive. (Nearly twice the price) 
* **Psychiatrist consultation cost:** I’m not sure about this one but I heard it can go up to SGD200 (before GST).
* **Psychologist consultation cost:** from SGD150 (before GST) per therapy session with a psychologist in a private clinic.
* **Upsides:** private clinics actually have weekend consultations. So you won’t have to miss school or work just to turn up for your appointment. More appointment slots are available and the waiting time for the next appointment (or even just waiting time outside the consultation room) is much shorter. Convenience and efficiency for your money.
* If anyone knows more about the private sector, please add on to this. It will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!

Lastly, IMH is open 24/7. If you feel that you are unsafe to be left alone with yourself, if you feel that your mental health state is not well for you to safely get through the next few hours, you may make your way down to IMH at any time of the day. You don’t even have to ring them up. Even if you do, they’ll ask you to head down to the institution anyway. Here’s the number just in case: 6389 2000

My mom is currently warded at IMH’s MDU(Mood Disorder Unit), she has been battling with minor to severe withdrawal symptoms from Benzo abuse for the past few months (even attempted suicide). It’s almost been a week since she was warded and there seem to be no or little improvement to her mood/condition. Me and my father have been visiting her on a daily basis.

I wished I could have stepped in or intervene earlier when I started noticing her taking doses of Benzos that was way above what she was pescribed by her doctor but I brushed it off, which may have led to her current condition. This was observed by me during the circuit breaker period.

Her list of withdrawal symptoms which I have recorded till date, most of the symptoms occur when she is having an “episode”.

Recurring:
1. Anxiety Attacks
2. Depression
3. Heartburn (Burning sensation in abdominal region)
4. Acid Reflux
5. Lost of interest/mood/appetite
6. Insomnia
7. Always in a daze
8. Difficulty in swallowing (Most recent)
9. Difficulty in urination

Previously/Uncommon:
1. Pins and needles in limbs
2. Cold Sweat
3. Dry Mouth
4. Hypersensitivity
5. Delirium

Her abuse was mainly on Apralozam(Xanax) and Zolpidem(Ambien). With Zolpidem being the main abuse.

Honestly I just hope someone that had similar experiences or someone that is in this field of expertise to share with me on how to cope this issue. Will my mom ever able to be rid of all these symptoms or will there be some permanent damage to her nervous system/cognitive ability. Is there other options or places to seek treatment that is focused on this (Benzodiazepines Withdrawal Syndrome)?.

What I am to say next is easier said than done, however, you must not feel entitled to being the solution to your mother's issue nor must you even try to seek being a part of it.

morimou,1614764104,lwpx8r,28,18,"Hi everyone, Singaporean male in my 30s here.I need help with dealing with my social anxiety, it's affecting my day to day living and it's been getting worse recently and partly due to my own fault because I did not continue seeking help over the years.

A little bit of background of my condition: I was diagnosed with social anxiety in my late 20s when I went to see a doctor at ktph and was prescribed some medication which I can't remember the name of it because it was almost 8 years ago. However I could not deal with the medicine side effect which left me super tired and 'stoned' and dull my senses like a zombie and I did not continue medication or follow up my appointments because it was the same usual drill of doctor prescribing medication and asking some follow up questions and also partly because I always gave myself excuses that I had  ""no time"" due to work and also I felt my condition was still manageable and had no 'symptoms' yet.

I always had this feeling of self consciousness that people are observing or judging me in public even though I know that no one really cares but my brain just can't help myself in thinking that way. As a result  my heart rate often goes up and I will blush and result in these 'symptoms''(only recently I had them, i didn't have them before) which is trembling or shiver(in my hands) and I will keep 'shaking' my head. Sometimes my mind will freeze up as while and I can't even answer or reply simple questions.

Even though my trembling and shivering are quite mild but my head 'shaking' is quite obvious and I often get embarrassed when people point it out to me.(my friends and colleagues have pointed out why I cant stop shaking my head).In order to suppress my head from ""shaking"" I would often clench my teeth and frown and tighten my neck muscles which makes me look angry or rude especially when I am talking to somebody which also makes it seem like I am staring at them. 

My daily life and social life has greatly been affected and I have been avoiding crowded places and even simple things like making a payment my hands and head can't stop shaking and my hands can't stop trembling when I am taking out my cash from my wallet. Sometimes even when people are asking me questions I can't reply because I will freeze up due to anxiousness. I might also unknowly offended some people because I always frown to suppress my shaking and make it seem like I am staring at them while talking to them. And it really affected me during job interviews sometimes when my head can't stop shaking because of my anxiety.

Does anyone suffer from the same symptoms/condition as me? Is there anyway or techniques to help myself reduce or stop my head shaking/shivering/trembling?

Also I was wondering if there's any affordable, preferably subsidized or free mental health help or support group in Singapore I can seek help from? My finances are abit strapped now as I am currently unemployed now.

This way, overtime you can lessen medication once your fundamental thinking has been corrected, ending the downward spiral and (potentially) ending medications. \n\nAlso, with mental health medication, often the cocktail of drugs required needs to be adjusted overtime, since everyone's brain reacts differently to them (brain is such a complex organ, as compared to heart medication where everyone's heart pumps pretty much the same). \n\nAs such, you'll need to give the psychiatrist a chance to adjust and improve your meds in case the side effects are pronounced for you (ie the stoned / zombie state you mentioned).

Physical-Being5281,1612057902,l91ln4,13,1,"Hi everyone, 

My son is 7 years old. He was supposed to have a tonsil tonsillectomy operation in December 2019. On the day prior to operation, my son was having a cough so he could not go for the operation (this is due to hospital’s requirement, no operation if the child has runny nose, cough, ). 

His operation was re-scheduled until March 2020. Unfortunately, due to Covid-19, the operation was cancelled until October 2020. He then didn’t receive any treatment from the hospital. His nose was blocked and he couldn’t breathe well, but due to Covid, we thought it is better postpone it.  

Before the operation’s day in October, we contacted the Insurance company, and they rejected to pay for the operation, explaining that it was over 180 days from the first day the symptoms started.  

When we look back the contract, there is a term saying that: 

***1) When the Insured falls under any of the following cases, the Company shall, in accordance with the provisions of this description and the General Conditions of insurance, pay amounts mentioned in (2) below to the Insured as insurance claims for sickness, on condition, however, that such expenses shall be those incurred unavoidably within one hundred and eighty (180) days including the date of commencement (\*I) of a medical practitioner's treatment:***

So now, the insurance company use that term to refuse paying for the operation.

And the  also comes with this (\*) 

***(\*l) In cases of complications and deuteropathy; the term means the date of having started the treatment of the sickness which was the cause of such symptoms.***

My son was not receiving any treatment when he first visited the doctor, only an operation to remove his adenoids and tonsils can help him. So from my opinion, the insurance company is supposed to pay for it. Everyday I saw him struggle to breathe and it broke my heart. He cannot breathe well, especially at night, it really affects his quality of life and makes him get irritated easily.  

If it’s not for Covid-19, we could fly back to our home country to get him a surgery at our own cost. In Singapore, it’s really expensive and we cannot afford it. (Sadly, I was working in tourism and it badly affected now, I was laid off and we’re struggling to stay in Singapore now).

Hey everyone,

Before you accuse me of trying to *chao keng,* please hear me out.

I'm basically the kind of person who isn't made for BMT. I'm a total introvert, and preachy as it sounds, I'm also a pacifist. Nonetheless, having told myself that it would be an inevitable part of my life, I kind of tried to make the best of it in my head. In the past few months, I've begun to physically train pretty hard, and even though I still wasn't able to pass my IPPT (mainly because I got stitches that day), I've actually improved my fitness by a lot in the meantime.

Also, I do have a history of medical issues. Vasovagal syncope, excess cartilage, flat-footedness - all of these don't sound like much, but added together they make me a little worried about stuff like Field Camp or Route March. Nonetheless, I was assigned PES B1 by CMPB a few months ago. While somewhat disappointed, I told myself that it would be okay and since there was nothing I could do, I should just look forward to it - or, at the very least, not dread it.

However, it's now about one month to my enlistment date (as I'm PTP batch). Recently, I've started to get anxiety attacks. I get severe heart palpitations, my appetite has kind of disappeared, I wake up multiple times every night, and - pathetic as this might sound - I kind of spontaneously break into tears whenever I think about my impending enlistment.

Now, I know at this point many people might be inclined to dismiss this as either a) chao keng or b) the typical fears that any pre-enlistee has approaching NS. This is what I tell myself too, as I desperately want to convince myself that I'm 'normal' just like other guys who have completed NS, and that I will be a stronger person if I can endure the experience too.

However, I'm genuinely worried because I kind of have a history of mental health problems. I didn't disclose them to CMPB at my checkup, because I thought I was over these (I was severely depressed to the point of suicidal in Upper Secondary, kind of got better in JC). Now, I'm really unsure of what to do. I know that one option is to just tell myself it'll be OK, and go ahead with BMT in one month's time. Frankly, this is what I think would be least troublesome. However, what really scares me is the possibility that my symptoms worsen when I'm in camp, and that if I'm unlucky enough to get poor MOs or Sergeants for example, that I will be unable to seek genuine help in camp. Hence, the other option is for me to seek help now.

But this is quite tricky too, as my family is already dealing with my sister's depression, and I don't want to have to burden my parents with the financial burden as well as the burden of thinking there is something wrong with both your children. Plus, I don't know if seeking help will actually do anything. Please, I hope someone can help. For instance, should I call the NS Hotline? Should I go to a polyclinic to seek referral? Should I go to IMH A&amp;E? Can I do these things without my parents' knowledge?? Thank you so much and I'm sorry if I come across as fake - I'm genuinely at a loss for what to do. Thank you!

Secondly, your feelings are valid and you shouldn’t feel ashamed for being judged for your anxiety or being marked as chao keng. \n\nAlthough I am not a male thus not subjected to compulsory conscription, I do know of a friend who was in a similar predicament who is also unathletic, suffered from depression, and gay. I do recall his social media posts being laced with negativity and dread as he spoke of his NS stories, but on the bright side, he got through it just fine and even bagged some good pals out of NS, to boot. \n\nOne thing that I do have to point out is that, while it may seem tempting to resort to declaring your mental health issues/sexual orientation in an attempt to “down PES”, you have to bear in mind that these are government records that will stay with you for life and resurface in future job applications and interestingly, when you purchase insurance policies for yourself down the road as an adult. Individuals who are noted to suffer from mental health conditions will be deemed uninsurable which may leave you with no options for coverage in the future. As bad as it sounds, I will suggest you to keep your condition under wraps if you do not want your decision to cause you regret in future. \n\nJust something to keep in mind, but I do wish you all the best!', ""I'd like to point out that if OP makes a declaration now to a government agency, his records will at most stay within government agencies. It will **not** affect his chances outside the civil service sector, nor will his future bosses/HR in non-government related companies have access to those records. Heck, even inter-ministry, a lot of records are kept private and confidential, and not shared unless it's OP needs some high level clearance.\n\nAs for insurance, his insurance agent/company will likewise have no access to his mental health records unless he declares them, or something happens and he makes a claim, from which his history is revealed. OP can still purchase insurance policies (there are now new policies with claims for outpatient mental health services and warding), so as mental health issues become mainstream, problems of insurance are less prevalent. At most, OP will be excluded from being able to claim for specific conditions, but hey that's the same for physical ailments too."", ""Hi OP, NS is a major stressor and I can empathize with your situation. I've worked with several NSFs as a mental health clinician over the course of my career, and more NSFs seek help that the public might be aware.

Based on the info, the company will then decide whether to accept the application or subject your application to exclusions/loading/rejection. This is because if an individual is deemed mentally unstable, they would also be deemed as not healthy, in insurance terms.\n\nHope this clarifies :) \n\nSource: Was an insurance agent.', 'Ok, thank you. I will try to call them tomorrow morning :)', ""This is actually something I'm super worried about, yeah. Between the guns and the grenades ..."", ""If you want to 'chao keng', easiest route would be to go to IMH and get a diagnosis.

It is understandable that you are worrying as you are entering the next chapter of your life which a large part of it is unknown, hence the fear. Actually the most important people in NS are not your sergeants or platoon commanders, but your fellow bunkmates who goes through shit with you. If you bond well with them, even punishments will be enjoyable.\n\nYou are certified B1 means that their assessment is you can do all trainings without much issues.

At the end of the day, you will want to be standing at your ORD date and looking back and seeing how much you have grown as a person during that 2 years, cause that's what NS is about. \n\nNS is only a small portion of your life, a small challenge where you just train, go through your day and sleep without any other worries. You will face many tougher challenges as you take on more responsibilities in your life in the future.

hi guys

i'm a 25 yo adult i just got checked for adhd n the govt doc went thru my sch reports n all but barely looked thru the lump of it thoroughly \[maybe 15mins\] to decide that i never had adhd n its my mood that caused me to be like this my whole life even after a whole consultation ab how i am n why i feel that i got adhd \[lack of concentration, distractedness, difficulty reading, forgetfulness etc\] lmao i got treated for anxiety w this doc for a few years n the medications helped but whenever it comes to topic ab adhd shes always been dismissive ab it when my mood is neutral in relative control w the help of the anti-depressant meds ive taken before.

rn im in uni n its really taking the piss out of me esp w writing essays, referencing n whatnot n it shows in my marks n its really something thats been bothering me all my life tbh \[work, school etc\] which is why im asking if its possible to get transferred or any other recommendations to actl get a concerned doc n actual treatment. ive tried psychotherapy w this doc n told her it didnt help n yet she wanted me to get back to it when all i got were studying notes \[lol imagine\]

when asked if there was anybody to speak with ab my early childhood days i gave 2 contact n one was my dad, the 2nd person didn't answer so i had to resort to callin my dad instead bc the doc was insistent that we did it on the spot even tho i said id rather prep him for what to expect bc he wouldn't know anything ab me or my issues, i was cautious ab it bc i know that my dad would simply deny it cus hes conservative + he was barely in my life during that stage and yet after speaking to him for like 5-10m maybe it seemed like my dads words had more merit than mine?

im just asking if its possible to get transferred or anybody has recommended psychs that would have had experience w similar cases so to have a more qualified assessment of my issue when mine has been so dismissive throughout n even raised her voice multiple times when i couldnt give a direct answer when we all know that w mental health nothing is black n white... its just been so debilitating n im supposed to do an essay rn but im just so affected by the entire experience just bc i cant concentrate, get distracted n other adhd symptoms n then it just reminds me of how my issue was dismissed when i tried to get help, highkey feeling gaslit tbh lmao. ive seen a couple of threads on here but theres been conflicting opinions ab public v private institutions so im not sure, especially when ive alr had a prior assesment n im not sure if that'll affect any future appts or assessments w other docs.

I\'ve just freshly graduated out of my counselling sessions for depression and now flying solo for couple months now. \nI feel much more empowered now than I did last year which is a huge personal achievement.\n\nThought to share my experience which was easy, inexpensive and effective. This was my journey using public healthcare:\n\n\nSTEP 1. ASSESSMENT AND TRIAGE. \n\nYouths aged 16-30 years can get a free mental health assessment from the Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) [CHAT](https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/mobile/). Based on the assessment, CHAT therapists can route you to suitable health services in the community (instead of navigating the system on your own).\n\nIt will be a 1-hour conversation with a therapist who will listen to your needs, background and key events. The session will be recorded and they will take written notes for referral later on. The therapist will not ""diagnose"" you, but they are trained to lay out options suitable for you. They will even help you to arrange for the referral and get someone to call you back for an appointment. I was given two options:\n\na. Institution based - If your condition is unstable OR if you feel you need medications, you can visit a psychiatrist at an institution closest to your home e.g. hospital, IMH. There may be a longer wait time for appointments for this track. \n\nb. Community based - If your condition is stable OR you don\'t prefer medications, you can visit a psychotherapist at a community counselling centre. The therapist will list a couple centres that are close to your home which you can choose. \n\nFor me, I picked community counselling because I felt I didn\'t need medications and didn\'t want to wait long for appointments. I chose one Clarity Counselling centre because it was easy to get to.\n\n\nSTEP 2. APPOINTMENT SCHEDULING. \n\nI was contacted on a later date to schedule an appointment to the selected Clarity centre. The centre assigned a therapist who will be taking my case throughout the next few sessions. \n\n\nSTEP 3. COUNSELLING. \n\nAt the Clarity centre, the receptionist took my details and asked me to fill a depression assessment questionnaire. They took me to a room with two chairs (they removed the sofas because of COVID) where my therapist came in shortly after. Each session is 1-hour and the 1st session continues from the CHAT conversation. Each session costs $40.\n\nMy therapist used cognitive behavioral therapy to teach skills and strategies to manage emotions and thoughts. Often times I was given ""assignments"" to practice what was taught, and the next session would be then to review if this was helpful for me. Each person would have unlimited number of sessions, depending on how ready you are to go solo. You will know when you don\'t need counselling anymore when you feel more in control. If you find that you can\'t vibe with that therapist, you can request to change therapists. \n\nSafe distancing wise, my therapist changed to a Zoom counselling mid-way through when COVID cases peaked mid-2020.\n\nNote on diagnosis: I don\'t know if I\'m officialy diagnosed, but my therapist did assess me for symptoms of depression. I suspect that official diagnosis of cases are left for institutional-based psychologist/psychiatrist for inidivuals who need prescriptions. For me, counselling sessions were adequate as I only needed to learn the cognitive strategies.  But if you require an official diagnosis for any reason, I would advice to check with the CHAT therapist earlier for appropriate referral.\n\n\nDATA PROTECTION:\n\nEach place will be taking written notes/recording and personal details. Please be rest assured that personal data protection is taken seriously in Singapore. It is also required by law and ethics that centers will need to state specifically how and who your data will be shared with (e.g. CHAT to share with the preferred centre).  Each place I visited took my written consent and assured that our conversations will be kept private and will never be released to any parties without consent. I would advice to read consent carefully to see what you\'re comfortable with. If you\'re concerned about employability, future employers cannot have access to medical info, but if they want to know, they will need to ask you personally on medical history to declare.\n\nI hope this will be helpful for your journey. If you need more details, I am always available for DM. Good luck and hope you feel better soon :)']"

many people have also advised going to private clinics as it is the best way to get an adhd diagnosis but private clinics are costly and i am unlikely to go to one as my parents do not really believe in mental illnesses.

can anyone share their experience at government hospitals/kk hospital in getting an adhd diagnosis or their experience in visiting a psychiatrist in general? is there a doctor that y’all recommend in kk hospital for adhd? any advice will be greatly appreciated~

In my experience working with psychiatrists with younger kids, they usually get the parents and teachers to do a questionnaire to see if the challenges in attention are observed in more than 1 setting. They may also recommend you to see a psychologist or occupational therapist to work on the anxiety. \n\nMost importantly, go with what you are comfortable with. If you are not keen to start on medication yet, voice it out. If you want to be assessed for ADHD, voice it out. It is important to advocate for yourself.\n\nDisclaimer: Occupational Therapist working in govt hospital', 'ooo my parents are coming with me but for the teachers part does that mean i have to bring the questionnaire to school for the teacher to do? thank you for your comment and yes i’ll be sure to voice out all of my concerns!!', 'ADHD is still not easily diagnosed for adults in Singapore. We are years behind in this field compared to other countries. It is true that private clinics tend to diagnose adult ADHD more, from what adult patients in SG experience. This person is simply trying to get other patients’ experiences, they’re not looking to trust the medical staff less, they are seeking information. \nAnd when you say they are unlikely to not be diagnosed with adult ADHD, if they have it, you might not be entirely right. A few reasons why adult ADHD is not diagnosed accurately in adults (17y old is considered adult phase for the condition):\n\n- ADHD professionals in SG are very much trained and experienced in diagnosing and treating children ADHD. There is very little Adult ADHD experts in the country. And those that do have solid experience, are in the private sector.\n- ADHD is still seen in SG as a children’s condition, and a male child condition at that. If a female adult patient presents ADD or ADHD symptoms, they will less likely be diagnosed than a male patient. I can get into more details here if you’re interested, has to do with how the symptoms present themselves in boys vs girls at a young age.\n- ADHD comes with a lot of co-morbidity conditions. Anxiety as mentioned by OP, is a very common one. Depression, bipolarity, and OCD are other common comorbidities. Because they are often seen as a more “adult” condition than ADHD, patient are more likely to be diagnosed with the comorbodity as the main condition, instead of ADHD. \n\nI hope this helps give maybe a different POV on the topic. I’m not a medical professional, I am an ADHD-er, with several members of my family also dealing with ADHD (there seems to be genetic characteristics passed down in families, and scientific data backing up transmission of ADHD from parents to their children). I have spent a lot of time researching ADHD adult treatments in SG, and have visited several hospitals and clinics in both the private and public sector. I felt reading OP’s message that their concerns were valid and reflected my own experience and understanding of the current state of diagnosis and medical care currently existing in the country for adult ADHD. I hope sharing my experience helps you see things with a different angle as I think you clearly care about OP getting the best support available.', 'Hey OP, I’ve been where you’re at, with the difference that I was older than you so not tied to my parents approval or finances. \nI recommend you go for a public hospital visit. Share your concerns, doctors are used to us ADHD-ers “discovering” our condition online :) \nAsk if you can take tests (they usually come in forms you have to fill, asserting various behavioural questions sometimes dating back to your childhood). I think the Psychiatrist should be ok with that, but if they are not, it’s on you to ask questions as to why they think ADHD isn’t in the picture. Not in a defensive way, but to see if maybe they have noticed something or have experience in similar cases. You could have ADHD, but you might also not. If you feel your symptoms are definitely unmistakable, feel confident asking for a proper test. Check out the ADHD sub on Reddit, there are real life experiences shared by people that should help you identify whether your case is somewhat related to the condition or completely 100% your life described by others. \n\nIf you’re diagnosed, great - but remember, SG doesn’t allow all existing ADHD medication. So if you’re prescribed medication, get ready for months and months of patient trial and error to find the right one for you at the right dosage. And do not ignore Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, at your age, if you commit to it, you’re almost guaranteed to ensure your 20s and more importantly your 30s and 40s are a much smoother ride than without it. \n\nIf you’re not diagnosed, try another public psychiatrist. If that’s not possible or doesn’t workout, perhaps there is financial support you can get to go to a private clinic? Check with your school or Uni to see if that’s the case maybe? \n\nIf you have indeed ADHD, the bad news is that it’s gonna take a while to wrap your head around it, get it somewhat under control and get the support you need and that works for you, in SG. The good news is, if you have ADHD, I almost guarantee you’re smart, resilient, resourceful and much stronger than your brain thinks. Don’t give up, chip at it one step at a time, and keep reading and educating yourself on the condition. There’s an overwhelming amount of resources out there that if you have ADHD, you will hyper focus on like crazy but it will over time help you better understand why your brain / you do things the way you do them (or don’t do them).\n\nDM me if you have questions or want to vent/rant or chat about things and don’t worry about the appointment: go in there being yourself, share your concerns, don’t hold anything back even if you sound scattered and feel nervous, the more you share with the doctors the more likely they are to be able to give you the help you need.

scuderia1234,1622543544,npqvqd,10,1,"Hi guys. So, I'd like to seek advice regarding an ailment I've been experiencing for at least 6 years already. 


Problem :
I am constantly feeling nauseous throughout the day. From when I wake to when I sleep. It has been like this for as long as I can remember, for at least 6 years already. Its just a minor nausea feeling, most of the time does not make me vomit. The discomfort is in the throat area, where I constantly feel something is stuck inside. On the very few times where I do vomit, it does not make the feeling go away 


Implications:

1) Because of this constant nausea, I can't tell if I am hungry or not, and have to roughly gauge on time since my last meal. Now the problem comes when it is time to eat. Usually eating will provide some temporary relief, with burping but the problem is eating itself. Its very hard to force food down when you're having nausea, but I have to somehow do so as I know it gets better afterward. 


2) Because of point 1 above, I can't really tell how full my stomach is. If my body were a car, then the fuel gauge is broken or malfunctioning. Which has made me resort to carrying a small tupperware around to hold food I can't finish unexpectedly. This has made me shun away from group eatings as its quite troublesome to explain to people why I always cannot finish my food. This has had mild implications to my already non-existant social life. Because of this malfunctioning fuel gauge, there are times when I feel hungry even after eating a meal as well... 


3) It impacts my daily life somewhat as if I tilt my head downwards even a little, the nausea feeling intensifies, making it hard to constantly do work as I have to keep my head 90 degrees to the ground to minimize the nausea. 


Doctors I've seen :


1) Colorectal Specialist

I saw a colorectal specialist quite long ago, maybe 4-5 years ago? He did a scope and found nothing abnormal. Then, 1-2 years ago, I happened to visit his clinic with a relative and told him I was still suffering from this ailment to which he recommended me to see an ENT (Ear Nose and Throat) specialist. 


2) ENT Specialist

I visited the ENT specialist shortly after my discussion with the Colorectal Specialist. I explained my symptoms to him, and he did a variety of tests. Firstly he poked a small little wire down my nose and into my throat or something to check for obstructions(?). Then he did an hearing test, the one where they ask you to tap the button if you heard something. In the end, he cleared me and declared he couldn't find anything, directing me to see a gastroenterologist. 


3) Regular Specialist

Ok so the nearest appointment date for the gastroenterologist was like 1 month plus, so while waiting for that, the nurse recommended me to see a regular specialist who tackles this kinds of problems first. So I went there and explained to him the situation, as well as share the scope report from 5-6 years ago with the colorectal specialist. He said nothing was wrong with the old report but gave me a medication called Omeprazole to try out. I knew this wouldn't work as I already took it long time ago, but decided to be hopeful and try it out. Long story short, it didn't work and at our subsequent appointment, he scheduled another scope, as well as started me on a new course of medication called Rabeprazole. 

On the day of the scope itself, I went through the procedure and at the end, he observed abit of acid reflux and diagnosed it as Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease(GERD), but nothing serious he said. He gave me more Rabeprazole to tide it out while waiting for my appointment with the gastroenterologist. 


4) Gastroenterologist

I finally managed to see this guy after waiting 1 and a half months. The nurse was confused why I was hopping doctors and I had to explain that it was hard to get ahold of this doctor. When I saw him and explained to him everything, he shared the same sentiments as the other specialists I seen before. He too was confused why I was doctor hopping lol. After hearing me out he gave me 3 options 

-Wear some tube for 24 hours while it measured the PH value of the stomach and throat or something. He said it was uncomfortable and expensive and he usually doesn't do it, but would like to let me know of such a procedure. 

-Write me a recommendation for a neurologist, saying it might be something wrong with the brain signals, but unlikely. This scared me a little tbh. 

-Try out a new medication for GERD called Vonoprazan. But it would not be cheap he said 

In the end, I settled for option 3, which was to try out Vonoprazan. And not cheap it was. I ended up paying a bomb. Luckily, insurance was covering all of these otherwise I wouldn't have pursued this issue so far. 

In the end, the expensive Vonoprazan did little to alleviate my symptoms. That was about a year ago and I still suffer to the symptoms to this day. In fact, as I am typing this I already have nausea. 

Closing Statements :
While not debilitating, this problem is causing me alot of discomfort. In the end after seeing so many specialists, none could pinpoint what the issue was, and eventually diagnosed it as stress. Which is weird cos I don't feel stressed at all and have nausea also. 

Has anyone successfully beaten this devil? Or any advice you can give?

He gave me more Rabeprazole to tide it out while waiting for my appointment with the gastroenterologist. 

4) Gastroenterologist
I finally managed to see this guy after waiting 1 and a half months. The nurse was confused why I was hopping doctors and I had to explain that it was hard to get ahold of this doctor. When I saw him and explained to him everything, he shared the same sentiments as the other specialists I seen before. He too was confused why I was doctor hopping lol. After hearing me out he gave me 3 options 

-Wear some tube for 24 hours while it measured the PH value of the stomach and throat or something. He said it was uncomfortable and expensive and he usually doesn't do it, but would like to let me know of such a procedure. 

-Write me a recommendation for a neurologist, saying it might be something wrong with the brain signals, but unlikely. This scared me a little tbh. 

-Try out a new medication for GERD called Vonoprazan. But it would not be cheap he said 

In the end, I settled for option 3, which was to try out Vonoprazan. And not cheap it was. I ended up paying a bomb. Luckily, insurance was covering all of these otherwise I wouldn't have pursued this issue so far. 

In the end, the expensive Vonoprazan did little to alleviate my symptoms. That was about a year ago and I still suffer to the symptoms to this day. In fact, as I am typing this I already have nausea. 

Closing Statements :
While not debilitating, this problem is causing me alot of discomfort. In the end after seeing so many specialists, none could pinpoint what the issue was, and eventually diagnosed it as stress. Which is weird cos I don't feel stressed at all and have nausea also. 

Has anyone successfully beaten this devil? Or any advice you can give? 
Thanks and sorry for the long post.

SpeedyFava56,1621423897,ng3bve,1,1,"I wanted to make a serious discussion post and I've included the contents here as I'm unable to post it on [r/singapore](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore) for some reason. I think this is pretty important to how the government has been handling the recent COVID situation so far.

Please let me know if I'm the only one that finds that this process does not make any sense. I feel there is a need for a major rethink of this process and a **greater emphasis on a testing structure**. If possible, we should increase access to regional test centres to more of the public and/or have mobile testing centres to enhance the contact tracing process. 

16/5 - Family member was informed (at night) that he/she was a close contact of a COVID-19 patient. Contact with the infected was on 10/5. This person had symptoms on the 12th and tested positive on the 15th. Advised by MOH not to leave the house (but no legal jurisdiction because quarantine order is not issued). Was informed that **within 3 days**, will be sent to a hotel for quarantine. 

17/5 - No news. 

18/5 - No news. 

19/5 - Update by MOH at 5pm - either whole family gets swabbed and issued quarantine order at our own house till 24/5 or the family member who was a close contact would have to be sent to the hotel alone till 24/5 while the rest of us are not restricted.  

Does anyone else see the flaw in this whole process? As a family, all of us would have the potential to get infected as we were in constant contact since 10/5. Yet, no testing, no quarantine order was issued to us. The first step, imo, is testing should be emphasized - first, to prevent unnecessary anxiety; second, to ensure that once a case is detected, **quarantine immediately**. 

Another issue is that if this affects a lower-income household, one PCR test costs &gt;$150 and since some people are asymptomatic, the cost is borne by the individual who may not be able to afford it. This gap should really be addressed and unfortunately, is probably a contributing factor to the recent growth in both linked and unlinked cases. I would understand if this is something new but we have been in this pandemic for 1+ years and a proper SOP should have been established. Just really disappointed in the whole handling of the situation and would like to know your thoughts.
