I am planning to take Mathematics as my primary major and also take one second major in Music programmes (maybe Performance or Composition, not sure yet).

According to the [YST website](https://www.ystmusic.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.-YST-SECOND-MAJORS-OUTLINES-Cohort-2019-and-After.pdf), one prerequisite for me to be eligible to take their second majors is to complete their Access to Major Study modules, i.e. MUA1168 and MUA1169. However, ***both*** of the modules can only be read during Sem. 1 of the coming AY21/22 but they alone have already occupied *8 MCs* for that semester. Since I still have other core modules to clear, I think I have to overload that semester.

According to [NUSMODS](https://nusmods.com/modules/MUA1168/foundational-area-study-1), the modules only have a workload of 2-hour tutorials (but weirdly enough, the two modules do not show up on the LumiNUS webpage). 

Hence, I'd like to ask the following:-
1. Can I overload Y1S1?
1. If I can, can I overload for 28 MCs with MUA1168 and MUA1169?
1. Will it be too overwhelming, or occupy lots of time?
1. Why aren't the two modules listed on the LumiNUS webpage?

As a Grabfood Rider, 8.45pm i received order to collect bubble tea from Blk 461 Yishun Ave 6, at that time, i was actually pretty far away near to Khatib MRT, was actually surprised ""wah! so far away get order there"", as soon as got closer, i noticed a whole stretch of vehicles and bicycles and PMDs and PABs. So there i was at Ground Zero.

> Firstly, It was the Liho Staff, They were overwhelmed with non-stop orders and no way to stop it from coming in.

(100+ riders confined to a pretty small space)
> 
> Secondly, GRAB itself (cannot speak for Deliveroo, but i heard Panda also has this same issue), they were uncontactable, the Liho staffs were trying to call in to GRAB hotline (majority of the riders there were grab riders) to tell them that they were truly overwhelmed and they couldn't get through to grab.

Is this normal procedure / an expected cost to pay for having been raped?***

I was raped (I’m not even going to say ‘assaulted’ anymore, because it was clearly rape) a little less than 2 weeks ago. I think this is day 12…? Anyway, my police case has been a mess of my IO taking half statements, giving contradictory advice, and closing my case prematurely without telling me, even though he had told me not to tell him certain things during my statement, as I would be able to tell them to the CID officer that would handle my case. 

My case was never referred, because somehow, me trying to push this guy that I’d just met (so it’s not like I was in a relationship with this dude for him to test the boundaries of my indent) away, crying, telling him he was hurting me, and him acknowledging that he was, his deliberate infliction of additional hurt unto me after him acknowledging it (with the intention to make me cry even harder — so he clearly did not stop when he realised I was crying, because he wanted me to), and the use of force to make me do things that I physically was in too much pain or too disoriented (from being choked) to do, didn’t raise any sexual assault alarm bells with the IO who took my statement. The police had closed my case on the day that I made my statement, even when I was advised to wait for a follow-up, because no offences were found from all of *that*. 

It’s been impossible to seek any medical help. The GP didn’t want to see me for my injuries. I went there first because I didn’t want to have to make a report. But because they were injuries from a sexual assault, the GP told me to go to KKH’s UOGC instead. That meant needing to make a report in order to be seen at the hospital for sexual assault. I asked the IO about what I should do for medical treatment at the UOGC, and he said to just give them my report number. I ended up being denied medical assistance completely at UOGC (couldn’t even be registered) because I didn’t have a pink police form — I wasn’t aware that I needed the form. The IO had to call UOGC and discuss something, because I’d been inconsolable over the phone over the fact that no medical staff was willing to see me for my injuries from the assault. I wasn’t even asking for an exam or anything, just someone to talk through and explain the pains I felt and the pain that I was still feeling even 8 days after. 

I don’t know what was discussed between the IO and UOGC. Honestly I was so distressed at the time that I remember my consult with the doctors just as faintly as I remember the rape. But they didn’t really end up consulting for what I wanted, and spent most of the time doing this “police pink form” exam on me, except without the form itself, checking for abrasions, tears and lacerations, putting different swabs in me. I had to get my blood drawn as well. And I ended up being hit with a $500+ worth of checking and testing fees because they did the exam without the form. 

Is this normal? To be given the “pink form” exam I wasn’t expecting, but without the form, and then be made to pay $500+ for a post-rape STI screening? Would it have been covered if the police had given me the form? Or would I still have had to pay this large amount? Does anyone know?

Unfortunately, the police aren’t giving me any answers about this. I’m not sure who I could raise my concerns about the bill with as well. I’m sure if I go to KKH, they’d say it was because I didn’t have the form, because the IO didn’t think I had experienced an assault. I’d try to claim it under my company’s medical insurance, but the diagnosis on my documents from the exam don’t state “sexual assault”, only “sti screen”, and routine screenings for STIs / STDs are exclusions, so I can’t do that either.

I work part-time, school part-time. I’m paying for my own medication and therapy for severe clinical depression and PTSD and ED, which chalks up to nearly $1k per month, nearly 80% of my take-home income. My family don’t know about the rape yet and I don’t think I’ll be telling them anytime soon, so I’m incurring these costs on my own. 

So I’m just wondering if there’ll be any way to recoup some of the $500+ lost to being a victim of rape. If anyone knows, or has any suggestions, hope you can help me out. 

TIA

I think in Singapore adoption is anonymous and it is not possible to request for adoption records.

Is there an online forum where I can post details to see if anyone gets in touch?

I just wanted to see how she is doing and hoping to get to know her, if she wants to. I am not trying to break up her current family. I also hope to share health history in the family as that’s often something adoptees don’t have info on that may be crucial to their health in future.

To preface, I'm not trying to compare anything to OP's experience being sexually assaulted. It just inspired me to share my story because of the overwhelming support I saw given there.

I'm a Singaporean Indian male. Parents and grandparents were both Singaporeans as well. Needless to say, as a Singaporean I should deserve to be treated as one and not unfairly right? As it says in our very pledge "" regardless of race, language or religion.""

I can't help but disagree. Throughout my entire life ( I was born in the 90s) I've been treated differently or patronisingly because of my race. It honestly feels like a crutch. Back when I was a kid, mother tongue was more of the norm so most of my friends were always speaking in broken English. It sucked because I can't speak Tamil and the Indian kids in my school bullied me badly and exiled me from their friendship. Needless to say the other races would call me ""apu neh neh"" or ""dirty/smelly"" and I literally got beat up bad on multiple occasions to which my mother would complain to the school and the principal gave 0 fucks. It was that bad.

I've been denied so many job applications because ""they prefer Chinese"" and I do understand the bigger crowd is the Chinese demographic here but that is part of the disadvantage for me. It sucks so bad that despite how talented I am I never got to try things because of my race. In secondary school I had a teacher use me as a example for so many stereotypes that didn't even apply to me. I had him straight up laugh in my face when I wanted to be a class representative (because I already struggled with believing I was worth anything so I wanted to prove to myself that I had what it takes). Not even a chance given. Immediately shut down. I cried and wanted to commit suicide on SO many occasions because of him.

I see other issues being taken so seriously in Singapore but then even til today there is RAMPANT racism. Seriously. I shit you not almost everywhere I go, no matter how nice the people are I'm bound to hear racist comments. I personally believe this stems from our parents generation. They push their beliefs onto their children and sometimes I can't really blame the Chinese people for saying the shit they say because it's so normalised. They don't even know it's wrong. It's not like they're bad people but they're just simply ignorant when it comes to this. It sounds very accusatory I know, but it's honestly an issue.

I remember there was a post about a foreign exchange student who did the ""chinese eyes"" and everyone was outraged saying Singapore absolutely does not welcome racists. In my heart I was honestly scoffing because a lot of these ""woke"" Gen Z people jump on the bandwagon to become a victim. Let's not sugar coat it, these days in spite of a lot of people suffering from mental health/assault etc. There is a HUGE fetishisation of being a victim. People just want in the sympathy for things they don't really suffer from or doesn't really affect them. Not saying it's right what the lady did, but how does that actually affect any of these people in Singapore. Majority of them here are still Chinese. Let's just put it into perspective for a bit:

Chinese people being racist towards Malays

Malays being racist towards Chinese.

at the end of the day, you have to understand Chinese people in Singapore are the majority. It's shitty to be racist on both ends but the one's actually taking the damage are the minorities.

In a class full of chinese and malay kids I was the only Indian in most cases. Same when I worked part time jobs, I'm always the only Indian. People being racist affects me the most because I bear the full load of it from multiple people who unforunately share the same mindset whether they're good people or not. A lot of it is deep rooted in ignorance and taught by ignorant older generation parents.

&#x200B;

Another shitty thing that these people do, they decide for you what's racist or isnt'. I remember getting upset as a teen at my friends because one of them said ""apu neh neh"" and I confronted him. Every one of his friends immediately got defensive/aggressive about it and said ""aiyah it's not even a bad word, is you dont know"". Like what the fuck? If I, an Indian, feel offended by a derogatory word directed towards people of my race, you have the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't be offended by it? This shit has happened on THOUSANDS of occasion I can't even keep count. How many times I got annoyed/upset by racist remarks and I had someone tell me I'm overreacting.

Controversial opinion: (Maybe I'm looking too much into this one)

Last year I told a malay friend of mine, if you look at ""Singapore ads"" as a foreigner, you'd think this was China. When I went to the cinema on multiple occasions there were 0 mainstream ads (at least from what I saw) that showed ""Singapore"" as a country with all the races. It's mostly chinese actors/actresses even if it was English speaking. But to my surprise, they had an ad about drugs and theft and it just so happened the thief was malay and the drug-addict was Indian. Like I said I might be reading too much into it but it feels like shit when you're already going through so much and so insecure and you see these things. They fuck with your mind.

&#x200B;

Everywhere I go it's so normal for me to hear at some point jokes like.

""Eh that Indian guy your father ah?""\*turns off the lights\* ""Eh OP where you go sia can only see your teeth?""

etc etc. It's not just ""a few people"" or ""the people I hang out with"". Recently after enlisting in NS I witnessed the same thing going down. How brazen some of these people are with their racism.

Don't even get me started with dating. I've had multiple girlfriends, all races. It doesn't matter to me. But whenever I was with a chinese girl I'd get the DIRTIEST stares I've ever seen in my life from other chinese guys or older generation uncles/aunties.

The worst one so far:At one point I had an aunty come up to my then-girlfriend and said in mandarin (yes i do speak a bit of mandarin):

Are you okay?

Are you sure you want to be with this guy?

You know if your baby come out ""hei hei"" not beautiful.

This bitch kept going and going. And my girlfriend didn't even say anything back to her I was just walking with my jaw on the floor and I absolutely couldn't believe this was happening to me.

&#x200B;

This fucking happened this year lol. In 2021. This is the reality sadly. I had a Korean girlfriend at one point, and one of my chinese male friends (Nice guy, just simply fucking ignorant) said to me after seeing her picture:

""Huh? When you met, she knows you're Indian anot?"" like it was some sort of disease lmao. What the fuck? How would I have been with her without her knowing my race. The concept of this relationship was so unreal to this guy. This is a perfect example of the ignorance most people have. They're not bad people they're just so ignorant.

I also had multiple people speak down to me as if I can't speak English. It was extremely condescending.

I had an autistic friend in school and whenever he heard Indian people speaking he'd just start laughing uncontrollably and not when other races spoke. How is it that an autistic person is wired to react this way? Basically our society's perspective on Indians here.

I worked on an occasion with an entirely chinese staff. And they had a secret dinner entirely without me. I found out by accident when I was looking for someone at work and I opened the door to their dinner and they all just looked so dumbstruck when they saw me.

From the constant bullying, denial of basic things and harassment. I just can't believe nothing's being done about this in 2021.

Something Indians do because of this that I can't stand:

Indian guys who develop a ""Chinese singlish accent"".

Singlish is Singlish. Chinese people sound chinese , Malays sound malay, Indians sound Indian when they speak it. You can tell easily right? There's a group of Indian guys out there who are so affected by this racism that they try to disassociate from being Indian. I guarantee you have that one Indian friend. I saw this Indian guy wearing a hypebeast looking outfit with the korean glasses and centre parting hair and his accent sounded so forced chinese I almost died from second hand embarassment. But this is the state of how things are based on how normalised racism is here. A lot of the Indians just accept it. They can't do anything about it either way right?

PS: There might be some hint of anger/hatred or insinuated accusations but I assure you I don't bear any hatred for my Chinese friends. In fact the ones I hang out with are actually amongst the kindest most sweet people I have ever met. It's just the reality of the struggle I face as an Indian in my own home. I deserve to feel like I'm entitled to the same thing every other Singaporean because I'm not just a colour. I'm a human being. I am absolutely not justifying the racism that chinese people face from Indians and Malays either.

&#x200B;

I just made this post to show you that from my days as a kid up til today I'm still heavily affected by racism and it's not just a few bad apples. It's a deep rooted in a lot of people and we really need to teach our kids in the future so they know better. I really hope this gets some traction so I can hear perspectives from others because I was hesitating posting this for the longest time out of fear but I have to get this off my chest.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I see a lot of people DMing me and asking stupid questions in the thread so I just wanted to point something out.  


Me saying I had a chinese/korean gf at one point was to show the racist reactions I got from my chinese peers indicating shock at an Indian being able to do such things. I don't understand how some people can look at it as a ""flex"" and the only way I imagine that happening is if they hold races above another which I DONT. That's why I don't see it as a flex. So those people who are making such accusations, stop projecting.   


Also, unrelated. I never had an indian gf because when I was younger the Indian girls treated me like shit and left me out of circles of friendships. As I grew older, indian girls were very scarce and I'm not seeking women by race. It just so happened that the girls I dated were chinese/malays etc. For you to come after me for ""not dating indian girls"" is bullshit gaslighting and you have no understanding of how things work. I have dated Indian girls in the past years fyi, it just didn't work out. Stop saying stupid things without knowing context.

18,nj3rfs,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,MaoAankh,False,public,,Just turned 21 recently and life got really hard,"If my life was a game, I think the difficulty scaling is broken.

Its been a few months since I turned 21 this year, and thought that things are finally going to change for the better. But suddenly a lot of things happened and it felt as if the whole world came down on me.

I have always been living with my father, the two of us were borrowing a room from our relatives. It was crammed but we lived there for about a good 10+ years, since I was in primary school.

My parents were divorced, I don't really keep in contact with my mom anymore. The reason me and my dad didn't apply for a rental flat was because my mom used my name to rent a flat and she stayed with her new boyfriend.

Life was pretty comfortable. Me and my father got so used to living in our relative's home. My PC setup was a small coffee table propped right in front of my mattress, as soon as I wake up I was already in gaming position. Anyway we just stayed there until when I was nearing the end of my poly years, that's when my relative told us we need to find a way to move out.

As every Singaporean would know, getting a property in Singapore is like a really huge milestone. I don't know how me and my father are going to pull it off, so we came up with a plan.

Instead of wasting 2 years in NS, I decided to sign on and landed my self a nice 2.9k vocation (Of cause I didn't make this decision lightly, I have weighted many factors in, including which vocation would suit me best). Now that I have stable income, we should be able to get a decent loan from HDB or bank. Together with my father's 80k in his CPF OA, we just might be able to get a BTO or SBF.

That's when I learnt that my father had deferred a HDB loan a long time ago, back in 1997. The interest has accumulated until a good 200k+. HDB was kind enough to waiver off half of this resale levy, but its still over 100k. Okay fine, how about public resale? We went back to crunching numbers and smashing calculators. My father has already applied for HLE twice so HDB loan is out of the question, we went down to DBS bank to ask for a loan, and after assessing me and my father's situation, we learnt that instead of the expected 170k we could loan for 25 year tenure, we could only get 100k+ due to my father's income and age.

Forget about getting resale, we couldn't even pay the upfront cost for the cheapest options out there, and we haven't even factor in the COV yet. I have only started working for a few months so I don't have much savings as well yet.

So we went back to try and apply for a rental flat, and HDB rejected us because our combined income exceeds 1.5k.

A few days ago my relative gave me and my father a deadline, we need to move out by the end of June 2021. I have already wrote a letter to MP to try and help us out with our situation, and am still currently waiting for reply.

I have also applied and got accepted for a part-time degree program. I am awaiting payment of school fees and have set aside 16k so that's even less savings for housing. I will be enrolled in July.

With increasing property price the trend, plus the recent Covid-19 situation, BTO delay, etc, I feel I got caught in a really bad timing. I admit some of the issues I'm facing is due to our poor decision making in the past, even way before I was born. There is still a lot of things I don't know about the world but with the decisions I need to make, I can't help but feel overwhelmed.

If HDB rejects us again, we may have to look for a private rental. But honestly the reality of working just to pay rent and continue cramming in a single room, and we don't even know what kind of restrictions the landlord might impose on us. Things seem to be turning for the worse, and if my salary goes to paying rent, how can we break out of the cycle?

EDIT 23/5/2021:I am thinking of asking my father to stop working so that our combined salary is just nice below 1.5k. We will have to wait until our next reporting of income tax statement. I don't know how well this plan might work or if it might backfire on us.

EDIT 24/5/2021:Currently looking out for private rentals while awaiting HDB response, I don't have any experience with this so I may contact an agent. If anybody has experience with this I would really appreciate it if you can share your knowledge. I heard there are some rental offers out there that are out to scam foreigners, there was a story about a flat that rented out to like 10+ people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nj3rfs/just_turned_21_recently_and_life_got_really_hard/,126,447,15,447,0.94,Sun May 23 16:55:11 2021,Discussion

Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was a 25 year old officer living in Singapore during World War II. His platoon of 42 soldiers were positioned on Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) when they spotted something unusual about some troops dressed as Punjabi soldiers from the British Army patrolling parts of the hill. They opened fire, and  true enough, those were Japanese  soldiers in disguise.

They held their position for a frustrating 2 days. The invading Japanese  battalion finally launched their all-out infamous Banzai attack up on Bukit Chandu. The platoon held out until their ammunition was spent. With no  ammunition and no hope of any support but refusing to give in, Lieutenant Adnan gave the order to make a last charge against the enemy  with bayonets and their fists.

The Japanese killed most of the platoon, and captured the rest. Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was executed by being strung up on a tree, then stabbed to death with bayonets for his resistance. The rest of his surviving platoon was given the option of surrendering and joining the Japanese effort against the British.

They chose to honour their vow of ""Taat Setia"" (Faithfulness and Loyalty) and were executed instead. Their motto was,*“Biar putih tulang, jangan putih mata.”*  (better to die in battle than live with tears of regret).

22,nnncy8,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,mangopangoh,False,public,,Secondary school dropout pondering what to do with my life,"I dropped out about 6 years ago when I was in Sec 3 because of 2 and a half years of bullying... perpetrated by my teachers of all people. I did go back to school for a while the year after but after the dams burst, they couldn’t be closed and the mental toll it took on me proved to be too much at that time (depression, anxiety, communication disorder).

From then until now, I’ve been mostly doing part time online work - doing write ups for some websites, helping out with brand promotion material, translating freelance etc. I had such a hard time coping with trusting adults/authority figures after I dropped out that I didn’t even consider any further education.

Recently though, since I’m about to become an adult myself (21F) I’ve been thinking about the future and whether I can actually earn a living for myself this way... I’m thinking of maybe starting to study for the O Levels privately (is there an age limit?) since I did pretty well in school before dropping out. I’m also considering going to a specialised language school since I’ve saved up quite a bit and afaik, being a translator doesn’t absolutely require a specialised degree beyond language certifications. (I’ve taken HSK6 and JLPT3 so it seems plausible to me... Might need time adjusting back to being in a school environment though.)

But to be honest, I don’t really have any passions or interests in life... I just want to be able to make a living and let my parents retire without needing to worry even more about their immature child (AKA me) :’) 

Anyone been in similar situations looking for your future? Or any advice would be appreciated as well.

23,mus1se,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,jabbadastripper,False,public,,Lost 9.5k to an insurance company...Big oof moment but nonetheless a valuable lesson on why we cannot trust Financial Advisors in Singapore to advise us on our finances,"2 years back when I have just graduated from university and started working, I wanted to take charge of my finances back then. For a lack of better judgement, I was acquainted with two agents from AIA to understand how I could outsource my wealth management and foolishly I signed a policy known as the AIA Wealth Pro Advantage which is touted to help save and invest money that you lock in. The terms were $5k per year for 25 years. At that point of time, with no interest in investing that seemed pretty good. Just park your money somewhere and not think about it and just wait till it magically grows.  


However, everything changed when Covid-19 happened. With so much free time at hand, I was checking out roboadvisors and index funds, and how historically they have pretty good performance. If you are familiar with such sites, they tend to provide a projection on the estimated returns based on your lump sum and monthly investments. Across the various sites, what struck me was that for the same length of time (25 years), they were on average returning around 3 times more than that of the AIA policy. Even the portfolios with half the expected rate of return performed almost equally compared to the AIA policy. In addition, the policy is an **obligation**. If for some reason you are unable to sustain it for 25 years (and many things can happen in 25 years), you will be hit with a huge penalty.  

  
I was flabbergasted by my findings and decided to drill my insurance agents on the huge gap between investing on my own and the policy. After much back and forth, they admitted that the policies from insurance policies tend to carry high costs. In fact, the compounded costs were about 30% of the value of premiums. On the other hand, a roboadvisor may only be charging around $25 per year for managing the same amount of money. At this point of time, I had $9.5k of premiums locked in. However, given the huge opportunity cost, I decided to bite the bullet and forfeited the $9.5k, as I figured they would be recouped when I start investing the future money that was freed from the policy.  

  
This was a costly lesson for me, but I am glad I managed to pull myself out of the rut before the sunk cost gets too overbearing (to put things in perspective, the opportunity cost of staying in the policy adds up to about $200k to $300k at the 25th year). 

  
My word of advice for those who are looking to secure your finances is to AVOID INSURANCE COMPANIES for investment purposes. There are better options out there, and you just need to have a teeny bit of interest. Do not be like me :’) The whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth, but I do hope I can save some other fellow workers from a similar fate. I have also attached my policy tables as well as similar projections from Roboadvisors such as Syfe and Endowus in the imgur link for your reference ([https://imgur.com/a/mCAL2I1](https://imgur.com/a/mCAL2I1)). I think the most important screenshot to share, is the one where the agent admits that the cost of endowment plans are literally the highest amongst all wealth management options.

  
Hope you find this helpful and avoid the pitfalls. If you were like me and inadvertently bought a similar plan, do the math. In most scenarios, it is worthwhile to terminate the plan to unlock the true potential of your future cash flows.

Edit: Wow I'm overwhelmed by how this post resonated with so many people. I do see many comments on insurance linked policies.

for starters, im going to be a y3 fass kid come next sem, and i can't help but feel overwhelmingly upset about how uni life has been for me.

covid came into the fray during y1s2 and the sem was abruptly disrupted halfway thru thanks to it. since then i have spent the past two and a half sems at home with e-learning with almost zero time spent in sch for lessons, save for some tutorials i had for a core mod.

i was originally hopeful that some semblance of normalcy could return next sem, but with the recent rise of covid again nus seems to have tightened its measures again and as it stands, every single mod i plan to take next sem will be e-learning, AGAIN.

i can't help but feel like the often advertised ""uni is one of the best years of your life"" is slowly being robbed and taken away from me. i know some would think or so that there's no ""streamlined"" metric to what can be defined as the ""best years of my life"", but with all that has happened and with SEP having been cancelled recently, i really can't help but feel like i have been wasting my time. 

im no extrovert but this extended period of e-learning has taken a huge toll on my mental health. i won't say that i have got a rough family or anything but i absolutely detest and abhor being at home because of how my parents can be so insensitive to my feelings and always seeing me as a problem child when all i literally do is stay home and am at the behest of my parents. school used to be one of my escapes from home but without it now, and probably for the next year or so, i feel at a complete loss.

everytime i share what im feeling to my friends, all i hear is ""bobian"" and whilst i genuinely do understand that given the realities of the world we live in rn, there has to be a new normal but i cannot stand it anymore. as much as i try to find the good in the bad i always come back to lamenting about uni life and how hopeless everything seems to be. there's nothing to look forward to.

im sorry for the rant, i don't expect anything and i think i may have raised some eyebrows too but i just felt like i needed a space to rant lest i plunge deeper into the self-created depths of my emotions and malaise. everything just feels so hopeless and idk what to do. i absolutely cannot survive another fucking semester of full, complete, e-learning.

26,njzzyz,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,Doinkmeisters,False,public,,[UNI] My experience as a first-year Accountancy undergraduate at SUSS (Singapore University of Social Sciences),"Hi everyone! I am currently in my last week of finals as a first-year and I thought it'd be a good opportunity to share with upcoming freshmen about how SUSS has been like for me. I will talk about my experience and thereafter, give tips to freshmen which I hope will help you all feel more situated. 

I also would like to put a disclaimer that I am NOT a dean's lister and my experience may be different from other students. But, I hope that my experience and tips can help someone who might encounter similar situations as I do. 

*Background*  
My route: ITE Higher Nitec in Accountancy (2 years) > SP Banking and Finance(3 years) > SUSS Accountancy (4 years Full-Time) 

*Experience (1st Semester)* 

Prior to the semester, I (and all other students) had to complete PCOQ or Pre-Course Quizzes. These are quizzes that must be passed with a 60% minimum in order to be enrolled in the classes. I had 5 modules that semester, each worth 5 CUs (Credit Units) which are heavy modules. Attempting these quizzes were tough because the quizzes tested all the units in the modules BEFORE even attending these classes. This made me so confused and rushed because I did not know this prior and spent a few days trying to cram. However, with the help of St\*\*\*cu (censored this although it is a well-known source for students) and resources from several Telegram groups which I had to painstakingly figure out on my own, I managed to complete the PCOQ and passed the 60% mark. 

The next step was to figure out Canvas. Having come from Blackboard, Canvas is easier to navigate however, SUSS has separated modules into two groups: LG (Lecture Group for all students in that module) and TG (Tutorial Group for all students in your class). For a few weeks, I had to get used to the two because I would get confused as to where my online classes were accessed and where the resources were. But after a while, I became familiar and things became much easier. 

During my first semester, I felt extremely bombarded by personal and group assignments also known as TMA (Tutor-Marked Assignment) and GBA (Group-Based Assignment). Even though I had viewed the course curriculum before the semester started, I still felt overwhelmed because I did not know what were the expectations of my professors/tutors for my assignments. When I summarised all the deadlines for my assignments, I realized that I had 10 or more deadlines to complete over 5 modules and it really made me feel pressured to complete all those and still have time to prepare for exams. For my TMA and GBA, I averaged around a C to B+ for each assignment. One positive thing I have loved since polytechnic and is still carried out in SUSS is that a lot of our GBA groups are pre-assigned. I feel that pre-assigned groups take the stress out of forming groups and the prevention of annoying people who only want to group with smart people. I personally like this because it forces students to actually learn how to deal with different skill sets and learning abilities which is useful in the workplace. 

In addition, participation score in SUSS is really important because professors/tutors really will observe and reflect it in your grades. As an introvert + still confused about the school curriculum, this affected me because I still had not digested the content. In addition, since the first lesson is partial briefing and partial diving into the introduction of the class, I became even more overwhelmed when my classmates were able to answer thus gaining participation points. Note that participation points also include having the RIGHT answers. For my participation score, I also ranged around C to B+. 

Lessons-wise, we only had 6 lessons with the professor/tutor and I really, really feel that it wasn't enough for me to digest the topic for that day. I regretted not asking questions even though we could email or talk to the prof/tutor after class. I felt that I was just too afraid of looking too dumb because it could come off as me not doing enough reading or understanding concepts much slower than others. 

As a result of my TMA and GBA deadlines being so close to one another and/or had heavy requirements, I felt that I did not prepare for my exams well and I basically did everything to the best of my ability. I did not actually do that well for my first semester and got below 3.0. Looking back, I felt that the first semester at SUSS was extremely rough and I don't really have many positive academic experiences from it. 

For our exams, it is mainly conducted online. They are known as Timed Online Assignments (TOA). Students will have to access the exam paper from Canvas at the start of the exam and then upload their TOA into Canvas again to have it vetted by Turnitin for plagiarism. For my first round of TOA, I really felt underprepared to say the least. I've never done online exams before and it really felt like everything was a time crunch. Sure, some might feel that because the exams are online, you don't have to worry about hand cramps or with Excel, calculations might be easier. However, I still feel the time crunch. In addition, having to worry and avoid plagiarism is extremely burdensome because having to refer from notes and then rewriting/rephrasing it is a skill that I have yet to master. Most importantly, past year papers are provided with NO answers. From my knowledge, professors can't discuss or publish past year answers (?) At the very most, exam reports are published which reports the performance of the students overall and for each question.  

Aside from school, I finally got to feel the lack of student life in SUSS. I can vouch there really is little to no student life in SUSS. I was prepared with this knowledge before joining SUSS as I knew that UniSIM actually catered towards working students. There are Interest Groups (IG) that you may join however, I did not join any. But one perk that I really enjoy about the lack of student life in SUSS is that I could work part-time. I worked 3 days a week (including weekends) and went to school for about 2-3 days. This allowed me to earn money on the side for my own personal expenses. 

Lastly, I really barely made any friends during that semester. I met some friendly individuals from my GBAs with whom I try to keep in contact. However, I feel that with majority of our lessons being virtual, it's hard to know people personally. 

*Experience (2nd semester)* 

During my second semester, I felt that everything from my first semester remained pretty much the same but I did notice some slight improvements. 

For my TMA, I had started researching about the topic before I started. This allowed me to just word-vomit all the sources I could find and give me a basic outline as to what I should write about. For my GBA, I always messaged my teammates on Canvas or using our school email and created the Whatsapp/Telegram groups. I feel that doing this made our group discussions start earlier which gave us more time to work on the assignment together. However, the complexity and expectations that our professors/tutors had for our assignments remained and I felt that I really still couldn't grasp what they wanted. Yes, there are rubrics but you have to know that these professors can come from academia previously or teach in other universities too. Therefore, the expectations might be higher and when they don't really communicate this with you, it's really hard. I just got back my TMA and GBA grades and the range remained between C and B+. 

In terms of participation, I tried to participate in class more even though I knew that my answers were inadequate. I didn't really know what I was hoping for but I tried to ask my professors and it made me feel less uncomfortable over time. My participation also remained C and B+. 

In terms of lessons, I still feel that 6 lessons for an entire module is really too little. Knowing that other universities have maybe 8 or more lessons for similar modules, I feel a bit cheated (?) because I am not given ample time to digest the content. Even if I did try to study on my time, I couldn't manage to catch up during class. So during the weeks leading up to my finals, I spent it teaching myself the entire module all over again. The good thing about this is that revision slides and lectures are uploaded which actually gave me an outline as to what I should study for. 

For my TOA, examining past year papers allowed me to see what the trend was for the questions although there were no answers given. Finally, St\*\*\*cu notes were helpful and I also purchased notes on the side. The good thing about TOA is that I am able to pre-type answers that I feel would come out in exam including in-text citation. I felt that this saved me time during the exams from worrying about plagiarism so that I can concentrate doing calculations or attempt heavier theory questions. 

Lastly, in terms of student life, nothing much has changed other than being added into Telegram groups for modules. I cannot stress this enough that these Telegram groups provide so much information about TMA, GBA and TOA and I can't believe that I wasn't added or couldn't find these groups in my first semester. Although the number of friends remain abysmal, I feel that these Telegram groups allow me to reach out to others for help much easier. I still work part-time too on some days and also, I have more rest days. 

*Overall Experience*

As a whole, I get why SUSS has been coined the acronym ""Singapore University of Self Study"". I basically taught myself a whole module, didn't make many friends so far whom I want to have at my wedding and I still don't really know what my professors/tutors want despite having rubrics. It has been really stressful getting myself situated because of the pressure to just pass (not even aiming A at this point) because I cannot seem to get information easily. Good resources like notes or past year papers are so hard to come by unless you have friends. This means that connections are everything in SUSS because students barely meet or talk to one another. Although there have been slight improvements in how I adjust to the university life here, I still feel like a freshman who is lost and confused. I know that with time, I will get used to it and know how to cope with the situations in my first year. 

*School Tips* 

1. Bring your charger to class so that your laptop doesn't run out of battery during the 3-hour lessons 
2. Find Telegram groups for the modules that you are taking and the course that you are in. For example, if you are taking Statistics this semester, try to find the Telegram group for Statistics this term. If you are in Accountancy course, try to find the Accountancy degree Telegram group. These Telegram groups provide helpful resources for TOA, TMA, GBA and other things that might be of interest. 
3. Have a format of the SUSS cover page ready for all your TMA and GBA. This will save you a lot of time formatting for every assignment. 
4. For exam revision, ALWAYS check your LG group in Canvas for revision slides and lectures. They will cover the basics of what you need to know and to be used as supplement for your finals revision. 
5. Compile all your class tutorials and activities on top of your revision slides and lectures. Read through everything! Be thorough! 
6. For TOA, pre-type all your answers into a Word document. Always include citation because the university does not condone plagiarism. The standard font and size is Times New Roman, 12, double-space (?) and the citation is APA 7. 
7. For citation, citethisforme isn't actually reliable. (If you have any suggestions, please comment because I want to know too) 
8. Name all your TOA BEFORE you start start your paper so that you can CTRL+S regularly. This is helpful when you're rushing to half-ass or complete the paper to the best of your ability. 
9. For TOA, cite only from the Study Guide or the textbook for the particular module. 
10. Having a mouse is very helpful for school work 
11. Use the online school library to find for reliable articles that you can cite in your assignments 
12. If possible, try to find friends who can help you check your work or share answers for tutorials. This would be helpful because you can at least check your understanding about the concepts before asking the professor/tutor 

TAKE NOTE THAT IF YOUR GPA IS <3.0, you can take MAXIMUM 32.5CU for that semester. For >3.01, you can take MAX 35CU that semester

*General Tips* 

1. Taking the bus from King Albert Park MRT is less crowded than taking the bus from Clementi MRT so if you want to avoid a large crowd, King Albert Park MRT is the way to go. 
2. Avoid taking a Grab if you're late and your route goes through Woodlands Road, Upper Bukit Timah Road and Clementi Road. Take the MRT to avoid jams. 
3. Food at SUSS building is not much so if possible, have your meals at SIM or somewhere else before arriving. 
4. There is not much power points at the first level of the SUSS Block B building near Subway or the food stalls. The power points are situated at the benches facing Starbucks and tables near the wall. 
5. Connect to the school wifi the first time you ever set foot in school.

I hope that this post is helpful for those that are going to be matriculating or are in the same boat as me. I also know this post isn't overly positive but it's my honest and true experience which I feel like I shouldn't sugarcoat. Please comment or PM for any questions and I'll do my best to answer you :)

27,n5b237,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,pprobablyneedtherapy,False,public,,"Trauma from sexual violence is being seen as a joke in our local community, and I hate that I can’t feel safe here.","As a survivor of sexual assault (even as a minor) + having been on the receiving end of constant sexual harassment (yes, also as a minor), it has been really really hard to see a future where I’ll ever feel safe in this world both physically and mentally. 

In singapore, I was assaulted as a lower secondary school student by an older man. Possibly on the receiving end of attempted grooming as young child too (it’s really vague). Older men have stared at my chest, my ass, my legs, my face, etc. nearly everyday for over a decade complete with a cheeky grin, have tried to ‘brush past’ me with their body (and then stare and smile at me from across the road before walking off), and have stalked and followed me outside of my workplace. They’ve tried to follow me home into the lift as a kindergartener. They’ve been cab drivers that are older than my father himself, asking me to join them for lunch, dinner, drinks, asking for my number or to add me on their Facebook. They’ve been a line manager at my internship workplace saying that me adjusting my dress turned them on, and that they’d be so happy if I did it outside of the office instead. They’ve been hiring managers trying to hire department staff based on their bikini photos. 

And despite all of these personal experiences (far beyond 100+ and counting) that I’ve already mentioned, I can’t even begin to cover exactly how horrible the sexual harassment and violence culture is in this country (but read on). 

I’m doing my best to deal with my own trauma from my experiences with sexual violence right now — I am in therapy with a mental health professional (don’t worry). That’s the work that I have to do, because I walk around everyday completely convinced that it’s just a matter of time before someone is going to forcibly rape me. I leave my house everyday, going to work and school, going to therapy, going to psychiatric appointments, and coming home, in a state of hypervigilance — I can *feel* people walking up from behind me, even if it’s just to walk past me (which is what people do, of course), and every time someone happens to be surprisingly close by, I get startled and dissociate. That’s what I’m left with, fear of the world around me. 

What makes it worse is the amount of victim shaming and jokes that a vast number of Singaporeans have made repeatedly across many instances of reported sexual harassment, assault, and rape, in the local news. I remember seeing an ST News post on Facebook reporting the molestation of a woman who let a male friend stay overnight after a party  — she slept in her room, and she offered him the couch for him to sleep off all of the drinks he’d had. He proceeded to crawl into her bed, whip out his hard dick, and ‘poke-poke’ her in between her butt cheeks. In her own bed, in her own house. 

And guess what the comments were? 
- “She shouldn’t have told him to stay over in the first place if she didn’t want this to happen”
- “If she knew he was drunk, she should have locked her bedroom door”
- “She didn’t lock herself in the bedroom, clearly she was asking for it”
- “Everyone knows that not locking your door is an open invitation that you want them to come in” 
- “Obviously she was leading him on since she didn’t lock her bedroom door. Now she’s acting like the victim? The real victim is the guy being reported.”
- “What did she think would happen by letting a guy stay in her house?”
- “It was an open invitation. She wanted it to happen the moment she let him stay over and didn’t lock the door.”
- “As a woman, I would’ve had the common sense to lock my bedroom door so that this wouldn’t happen to me.” 
- “When he did it to him, she didn’t say no and push him away what. It’s not considered assault if she didn’t fight him off”
- “I’m sure she wanted him to come in and join her. But then she got uncomfortable and changed her mind then reported him to the police for sexual assault. Why are all of you women like this? Why try to make life difficult for guys who did nothing wrong, by making false reports because you changed your mind?” (i acknowledge that false reports do exist, and i don’t condone it either, but this is irrelevant in the context of an actual assault and tbh... there’s a time and place where this will be a valid argument, but this isn’t it) 
- “Eh, next time when we stay over at other people’s house, must also find a girl to ‘poke-poke’ too hahahaha” **(what the actual fuck bro)**

This is what anyone in our country who is trying to heal from sexual trauma has to deal with. A community of people who believe that the onus is on the victim to have taken more precautions because predators exist, and disregard the fact that the responsibility lies on people who commit rape, assault and harassment to just... ***not rape, assault or harass***. A community that thinks, “well, some people are creeps so it’s bound to happen, are you that surprised?” — which by the way is not good enough of a reason to excuse this unsafe behaviour. A community that insists that if we’re assaulted then we probably asked for it, based on what we wore (even if we’re wearing the same exact thing as everyone else; even if i’m wearing a kindergarten school uniform), or based on the decisions that we made (oh well, i shouldn’t have left my house to get food because then nobody would feel the need to stare at my chest and make attempts to feel it). 

A community that I’m convinced will one day tell me that it’s my fault for getting raped by a stranger, because I wasn’t vigilant enough, or that I should’ve worn pants instead of a dress, overalls instead of a school uniform, or that it was because I wore make-up, or looked at the perpetrator a certain way and made him feel turned on. Or because I didn’t start fighting him off or running away — which by the way, as a 14yo, I didn’t do because I was completely frozen with fear of the grown man that was assaulting me at the void deck of my house; freezing and fawning are stress responses too, go read a research journal or two before insisting otherwise. A community that will make a joke about my assault, and say that they want to try it on other people too.

For a second, just think about how hopeless any of this feels, especially on top of all the guilt, shame, and self-blame and self-hate that comes with being assaulted? Even with therapy and trauma counselling. Even with the possibility of pressing charges on a perpetrator (if the justice system is even willing to do anything, but if the perpetrator was a promising local uni student...). To be surrounded by a community of people that would shame victims and make jokes about committing sexual assault / violence themselves? To be faced with the possibility that anyone that I and/or other survivors of sexual violence happen to cross paths with might be part of this community that trivialises the repercussions of sexual assault, simply because it’s been so rampant in the nature of how we exist as Singaporeans? 

Good people exist here and I appreciate all of them that are, but good god, can people of this country stop perpetuating a culture that encourages sexual violence? Is it that hard to stop being trolls about something that’s extremely traumatic and deeply damaging? What’s so funny about sexual violence, that some of you feel the need to joke about it and even think to try it out on someone else?

I can’t breathe here. I don’t feel safe, and it’s not like I’ll be able to do anything else (like leave the country). All I can do is stay here, and feel mortified everyday with a heavy weight on my chest that won’t go away, and cry about it, and deal with constant reminders that dying would feel better than this, and try to heal in an environment that has been making it impossibly hard to. 

This is an immensely painful and dark place to be in for myself, and any other person who feels stuck in the same place too. I’m sorry if anyone reading this is able to relate.

edit:
*got some comments saying that I need therapy, that nobody owes me anything to help me or other survivors of SA feel safe even after being traumatised, and that I shouldn’t be blaming it on everything else when it’s my anxiety making me scared of the world. so I’d just like to clarify a few things:*

*• I am in therapy and getting the professional help I need for my trauma. I am acknowledging that this is the work I need to do to resolve my fear of the world, so don’t worry about me being unaware about needing to get this done. I’ve been an advocate for mental health, and have been trying to heal from poor mental health, long enough to know the importance of holding myself accountable for my own mental well-being. I assure you, the inner work is underway, so thank you for expressing concern for it — much appreciated effort.*

*• I get that nobody owes me, or anyone, anything to help me/them feel safe. Like mentioned, all I’m saying is that there’s just as much of a need for people to not assault / harass / rape / perpetuate a culture that creates an environment that becomes unsafe. Why would anyone intentionally want to make another person feel unsafe? Does one person’s safety mean less than another person’s? This argument of “no-one owes you anything to help you feel safe” is exactly why I’m pointing out in this post that so little people take trauma seriously. You don’t have to carry this baggage for the rest of your life, but I do. People like me do. The least that people that don’t have this baggage can do is maybe just... not encourage it / do it? Unless you can share a reason about why you think it’s okay to encourage or participate in sexual harassment / assault / rape. Does a reasonable explanation honestly exist?*

*• Regarding blame, I’m not blaming it on everything else except myself. Like aforementioned in the above points, the work goes both ways. I have to work on myself to find personal safety again, and people just have to not do it or encourage it. Trauma from sexual assault involves a lot of self-blame (“I shouldn’t have been doing x”; “if I didn’t go to y, this wouldn’t have happened”). Simple analogy — if you were stabbed, how much of the blame falls on you for not being more aware of your surroundings, and how much of the blame falls on the assailant that decided to hurt you?*

*If these still don’t explain things well enough, then I’d appreciate it if you just not involve yourself in this thread.*

*To other survivors who have spoken up, and anyone who has shared their empathy, understanding and support, and anyone who didn’t really agree but was kind enough to discuss these points respectfully without any blame-placing, thank you! Y’all are reasons why the little voice in my head goes: “good people exist”, and I appreciate all of you. Sorry in advance if I don’t manage to reply to you, as it’s all really a bit overwhelming right now, but I’ll try!*",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/n5b237/trauma_from_sexual_violence_is_being_seen_as_a/,207,1479,66,1479,0.91,Wed May  5 16:30:14 2021,Serious Discussion
28,ncv0yu,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,Twrd4321,False,public,,First doses First. Now.,"The current uptick in cases highlights the urgency to vaccinate everyone.

Currently, Singapore uses two different vaccines that require 2 doses. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine is administered 3 weeks apart, and the Moderna vaccine is administered 4 weeks. This requires the health ministry to ensure there is adequate supply for the second dose before appointments can be opened up for the first dose. This greatly limits the number of people who are able to get the first dose.

The first dose is more important than the second dose because even with the first dose, it is able to reduce the number of cases significantly, as well as to reduce the severity of anyone infected with the virus. Reducing the number of cases, as well as preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed, is why more people should be offered the first dose now. To do that, the government must offer first doses to groups who have not been offered the vaccine now.

All high risk groups, such as the elderly, healthcare workers and airport staff have been fully vaccinated, which reduces the risk that comes with deviating from the recommended vaccine schedule. But more importantly, delaying the second dose is a strategy that is currently being used in the UK and Canada, with great results.

In British Columbia, Canada, there were several case hotspots that have led to an increase in cases. BC Health set up vaccination sites in these areas to accelerate vaccinations in these areas. Since Canada delays the second dose, everyone who is vaccinated only received the first dose. As seen from this chart, this has led to an accelerated decrease in cases, and now the area is down to single digit cases.

Delaying the second dose is used at a larger scale in the UK, with research papers being released validating the effectiveness. A Public Health England study showed a single dose of the COVID vaccine [halved transmission of virus](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/28/single-dose-of-covid-vaccine-can-nearly-halve-transmission-of-virus-study-finds). Researchers modelled delaying the second dose [reduced mortality rates](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1087) if the vaccines used have efficacy rates at or above 80%, which is the efficacy of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. More importantly, the UK has seen substantial decreases in the number of cases, as more than half of its population has received the first dose. This allowed the UK to roll back COVID restrictions, and achieve case rates lower than the US.

Supply of vaccines is limited and everyone will have to be creative in order to speed up vaccinations in the short term. Delaying the second dose is an approach that is effective, and one that the Singapore government should adopt immediately.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ncv0yu/first_doses_first_now/,119,209,1,209,0.86,Sat May 15 17:34:55 2021,Serious Discussion

Ever since coming to jc, I can't say that I'm having a horrible time tbh, but my thoughts have been keeping me on my toes a lot. I'm 100% aware that this is to be expected in jc, especially since I'm still trying to cope with the new environment/syllabus/pace etc, but I've been feeling quite off lately. (ngl I felt the same way in sec 1, but got over it rather quickly so I'm worried as to why I'm still feeling this)

I take H2 Bio, Math and Econs. So far there hasn't been any important tests since I'm only j1 lol, but I'm constantly feeling anxious to the point where I can’t relax, even during the weekends at home. I worry that I won't be able to keep up with my peers, or just with work in general. I've honestly never fallen behind any class in sec sch so this is scary for me haha. So far content that I've covered is still manageable, but I've been having trouble keeping up with lectures.

1. All lectures are cancelled in light of the virus situation, and all lectures are online. This is fine but the problems here are that lecture time in my timetable is all replaced by tutorials, so teachers each send like 4 30min lectures to you expecting you to finish them all in like 3 days. I’ve been falling behind because clearly I couldn’t finish them all. What can I do? :((
2. For seniors, how are your thoughts like (in terms of studying) during j1? Do you do some light study but only grind near tests/exams, or do you mug everyday? The full intensity of j1 haven’t even hit yet but this anxiety is killing me LMAO. I’m someone who works at random bursts of energy and completely rest at all other times, but I feel super guilty for not working to my fullest yet. This worked for me during Os but I’m sure it might not for As, yet I’m feeling quite exhausted already trying to catch up with everything. How was it like for you?
3. Is it possible for a jc student to be able to sleep by 12am every night? I always hear of students saying they sleep at 2—4am and I hope I can maintain my sleep throughout the two years while keeping up on work. Is weekends and holidays always all work no play? I’m just the kind of person that NEEDS at least a little play everyday or else I’ll go insane lol. I’m not looking to be a top scorer or anything, just good enough that I’m average or above.

I’ve been warned that jc will be the worst time of my life, but I was still holding on the the hope that I can have some fun and feel happy, but it seems to just be sucking the life out of me recently. I can find ways to destress, but it doesn’t last long enough before my heart starts beating again. There are good and bad days I guess, maybe it’s just negative thinking and pessimism. How did you all get over and above this? 

As of now whenever I get super anxious and my heart beats too hard, I’ll go rest and watch some YouTube or browse social media, but after that I’ll feel guilty and feel anxious again. Rinse and repeat. I’m stuck in a vicious cycle lol. Hoping to get some advice to feel better hahahaha :’)

I'm all for acknowledging the issue, and I've had fruitful discussions with redditors on it.

Consider [some of the articles](https://i.imgur.com/dhFoq57.png) published on ST this morning:

[We need to talk about race issues](https://i.imgur.com/ivsgAxx.png)

I don't know, but it's a little bit overwhelming for me. It is a problem to be addressed in Singapore, but is it ever appropriate to say that it might be too much of a good thing in this scenario? Yah articles on racial issues are not unexpected if one were to read ST, but at this point of time at least for me it becomes somewhat overbearing.

I'm sorry if this was offensive but I bear no malicious intentions in wanting to discuss if anybody feels that the messaging from our media might be excessive in this scenario.

36,oeuhlc,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,mochifluffstacks,False,public,,[A levels] Watching the days fly by,"TW: mental illness; self harm rant
TL; DR: a rant on mental illness and feeling indifferent to exams, deadlines etc

This is my second post; and as a short update from my previous post I’ve recovered from all the salt and shock from it all. I would also like to retract the especially emotionally charged statements. (P.S. I even received an appeal offer from dream JC but I had to turn it down but that’s okay :))

I feel more stable and content in my life, I hold portfolio-rich positions, have a stable friend group, and surprisingly enough, I enjoy the academic rigor. But despite all this, despite the fact that I seem like I’m “thriving”, deep down I feel numb, empty and meaningless. 

It wasn’t always like this; I don’t know how it got worse. Maybe it’s the pandemic, maybe it’s the responsibilities I have, maybe it’s the expectations I have/ have been projected unto me, but I feel numb. At the start of the June for two weeks I cried every day at least twice, fatigued from HBL and from the overwhelming stress of being at home with my family. Now it’s the start of July and I’ve stopped crying, but I’m slowly becoming numb again. I’ve experienced it before and I know it’s a downward spiral but I can’t stop. My oldest habits of non suicidal self harm come flooding back. I do see a counsellor, and I’ve promised to distract myself when I feel the urge to self harm, but I can’t stop. Whenever I’m frazzled or panicked, a voice just calls out to me, “you know what you have to do”- pick my skin till blood is drawn. 

I’m still functioning, I’m still breathing, I’m not suicidal (yet?) but the numbness is near crippling. In the back of my mind, I juggle some long term deadlines. But I’m just watching the days fly by. Strangely, no anxiety or urgency fills me. All these deadlines just feel like a routine, a mechanical responsibility. It’s only J1, so a dull panic fills me. But I don’t care that much anymore.


I wish I could properly articulate everything to the people who care about me, but I’m deeply ashamed of what I am and I feel guilty I’m not the ideal individual many perceive me as. I am supposed to be strong, iron-willed, bubbly, helpful…imagine if others saw me in this deranged state…I fear I may be traced down despite this being a throwaway account, but everything feels dull now, and I’d rather confide in the semblance of internet anonymity than risk my friends, my family etc knowing directly.

If my story resonates with you, I’m sorry. I hope you know you’re not alone and I hope some way or another things will get better for you. ❤️‍🩹

(using a throwaway acc bc my friends know about my main one)

I am in school right now, and I wish more than anything else to be home, to be in my bed, away from everyone and everything.

I was getting better. I’ve been getting better. So when and how did I end up like this? I’m so unimaginably tired. Like, my head is literally in constant pain and I can feel the fatigue weighing me down. 

For context, ever since I started JC last year, I’ve been struggling. I went from being a great student in secondary school to failing everything. In summary, I hit rock bottom last year- my depression and anxiety got so bad that my parents (despite me trying to hide it) realised how not okay I was and sent me to a doctor for treatment.

I advanced to J2, and slowly got better. My grades were improving, and for my recent tests, I passed Math and got a B for bio. Did okay for the other subjects too. (BCMe) 

However, about 3 weeks ago, I started to feel like I was burning out. I’ve been studying much more than I used to, so I expected that, and therefore I decided to take a short break. But right then I got into a huge fight with my best friend in school because she found out about my self harm habits during the holidays last year when I was still struggling (she saw the scars and i usually wear a jacket and i didnt that day). She was angry that I didn’t ask for help, and she told me that she couldn’t be friends with someone who didn’t want to help herself. So she ignored me in school for a while, and that exhausted me a lot because I’m an introvert so I don’t have many friends other than her to hang out with. (shes the only one i’m close to in our friend group) After a couple of days we talked it out and things were fine, but then more things started happening- another girl in my friend group started to break down in school non-stop, then our whole group got into a conflict, then my sister had to be admitted into the hospital, then I started fighting with my parents again...

Today I came to school and another friend of mine got pissed off at me because I was supposed to go eat lunch with her but I totally forgot because I’ve been so out of it lately, and I can’t make it because of another school commitment.

So now I’m in the toilet trying to not cry while I type this stupid rant.

There’s only so much I can take, I just feel so overwhelmed, and the past few weeks I’ve been feeling like I’m back at square one. They’ve been foggy and tainted with suicidal thoughts and just constant anxiety. I have no energy to study, no will to do anything. All my friends are leaving me. I’m a burden to my family. Nothing good ever happens in my life because I don’t deserve it. Last weekend I found the suicide note I wrote last year and had this thought that even though it felt like things were getting better, nothing has changed, and nothing will.

I haven’t been to therapy in a while because my parents had a falling out with the clinic. Of course they did. (they had some complaints idk tho didnt really talk about it to me and never asked me if i wanted to go to another clinic so) So I havent had professional help for months now. But i’m so close to breaking, I can feel it and i’m scared. 

Is it possible for me to see a doctor at a polyclinic for mental health issues? Without my parents knowing? They are under the impression that I’m okay now and it’s not worth the fight and emotional struggle to explain to them what’s going on. 

Thanks for reading this rant.

Also, apologies if this is in the wrong place but I felt that it is too long story for a daily thread and the story adds some context to the questions I have. 

Story time....a year and a half ago before this COVID mess met and fell madly in love with a lovely Singaporean girl. I was working in your beautiful city  at the time and we have been inseparable ever since. Last September I got the phone call that everyone dreads. My father unexpectedly and suddenly passed away. 

I flew back to Scotland and generally had a miserable time until this little ray of Singaporean sunshine called to say she had booked flights to come and see me and check up on her guy....half the world away. This blew me away. 

What happened next turned our worlds upside down again....she fell pregnant. This was amazing news, although we didnt directly plan it, this little surprise bump has brought meaning and after the misery of 2020 things are looking up. 

Late Feb 2021, after a full month in quarantine (2 weeks in Dubai then 2 weeks in Singapore). We were back in the Garden City when once again more bad news hit us. The job I had been promised was no longer an option and with that it's going to be doubtful that I will be allowed to stay in Singapore with my love and my kid thats on the way (g/f is currently 21 weeks along). 

I had always planned to marry this girl but now it looks like I am going to have to hurry this plan up if I want to be here to support my girlfriend, baby and actually be here for the birth. 

So, my questions are:
1. Where can I get a ring that wont cost me an arm and a leg? (I am on a super low budget, havent had a wage since October)
2. Where would you recommend for a romantic proposal? Again I am absolutely out of money but i want to make this special for this wonderful human. 
3. Do you guys have any other advice for a guy in my situation? 

Also, I'm trying to keep this a secret from her for obvious reasons and I know she doesnt have a Reddit account so ideally the discussion would stay here rather than making its way to Stomp etc. 

Thanks in advance Singapore. Your Friendly Neighbourhood Ang Moh.

*EDIT*
Guys, thank you so much for the great advice and the condolences and congratulations so far. I knew you good hearted Singaporeans would help out and I have been overwhelmed by the support and advice. Sincere thanks. 

I completely appreciate the advice about focusing on the Visa and job situation and trust me that is the main priority and we are working hard in that regard, it is most definately the primary focus but adding a little romance into the mix never hurt anyone! But i definately will be going for as cheap a ring as possible and pushing through the ROM asap. 

I am already working on a short term contract to fix one aircraft which will hopefully lead to something more concrete and longer term which will in turn support my Visa case. Even though I am almost jobless I have never been busier in preparation for the birth of this kid. I am also working on a side project upcycling old aircraft parts into furniture which although wont help the Visa situation it will hopefully bear fruit soon in a monetary sense.

Some background information on what happen in my Secondary school journey : 

In Sec 1, I had very bad results and didnt really care much about studying and hence failed quite a number of subjects. But despite having bad results, I was the chairperson of the class so all was good then apart from failing exams. 

In Sec 2, I joined student council and also another leadership group and started to put in more effort when it comes to studying. However, I had a really bad friendship issue with my friend(s) and well this resulted me to be extremely stress up in July due to the extra commitments, sudden motivation to study + the sudden lost of friends. I remembered at that particular period, I had insomnia and stress up till the extend of losing appetite for a few days. Well the good thing is after crying in school Infront of the class in the middle of recess my friend decided to you know be friends wit me again and all was good. My grades are improving and there isn't much friendship issues 

Well in Sec 3 it was like a disator. I had friendship issue with that particular friend again and after that we didnt talk to each other any more. And I had even more commitments, resulting in my having to stay back every single day rushing around the school, having to constantly try to catch up what I miss due to the clash of various events resulting to me being able to join only 1 event at a time. Apart from that, my results clearly improve and hence for all exam I will definitely be able to get top in the class for at least 1 subject or a paper and this actually ""attractied"" some people who just like to talk about other people behind their backs ... So I was like being ""mock"" by some people and people around me started to have highly expectations of me. And finally in the end of last year, I was too overwhelmed and hence release my stress in a not very pleasent manner. I did talk to my teacher about it but I really don't wanna disturb her anymore. (She needs her own time and needs to sleep too). 

And finally in Sec 4. After my parents know about my way of releasing stress, I stop. But on and off have the thought of doing it again . Well I step down from CCA and all the other commitments but I just have this weird feeling. I just felt like I didn't study enough and have this constant feeling that I will not do well in the next exam. Like no matter how good my results are, I just feel like I did badly . I know my parents and teachers didn't put any pressure on me but I just have this feeling that I have to do better. I am like honestly very lost right now and I don't know what to do.

46,mt88dz,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,dhduifcdkdid,False,public,,Tale of a foodpanda rider,"Hi guys, I am a foodpanda rider and I am here to share about the experience as a rider in foodpanda. I previously got my torchlight stolen and a lot of you reached out and even offered to help purchased a torchlight for me! I was really overwhelmed with the response and strength of the community.

DISCLAIMER: This is only my experience, it does not represent the experience of all foodpanda riders.

&#x200B;

The foodpanda support is really bad, I know. And so is the foodpanda RIDER support. They almost never resolve any issues.

&#x200B;

In foodpanda, there is a batch system, you are ranked 1 to 4, 1 being the highest, for your performance the previous week. A higher batch of course gives a higher pay. A batch  1 rider will have a pay of at least $7 per order, while a batch 4 rider will receive in the range of low $4. You are ranked based on 3 criterias. Special hours, actual vs planned work time and acceptance rate. Special hours are just peak hours that you are working. Actual vs planned work time is the percentage of time you worked to the hours you booked. So let's say you book a 1 hour shift, if you work only 59 minutes, your percentage will be 0.98333. Lastly, acceptance rate, whether you accepted the order given. Means you can't decline any orders. Well, the fucked up part about this system is, in order to get to batch 1 and 2, you need to have at least 100% in both actual vs planned, and acceptance rate. Means for the hours you worked, you can't take a ""break"".

&#x200B;

Here is the main part of my experience. I got thrown off the week before by ""App issues"". I was all 100%, and projected to be in batch 2 - you can see the live scores on the app. I was cycling back to the mall, and when I reached the mall, I realised I was put on a ""system break"", a forced break by the system because you probably did something wrong. I contacted the support and was told in my 5 mins travel time, I missed 3 orders? For my entire week and hours of working I did not miss any orders, and now, the support tells me I missed 3 orders and was put on a forced break for 5 mins. Then I looked at my batch score, from 2, I was put in the last batch. It was already Saturday. There was no way I could even make it to batch 3. I submitted a ticket for my problem, and because apparently many other riders also faced this issue, it was just brushed off. But I needed to let this go as, maybe really I did miss the super noisy alarm when you receive an order. 3 times.

&#x200B;

Coming next week, as usual worked my ass off the entire week, Tuesday to Sunday. On Sunday, as usual, things happened. I received a subway order at 12pm, an order of 6 subway meals. If you did not know, Subway is the most painful order a rider could receive. Because the ordered sandwiches will not be prioritized. A long ass receipt will be printed with all the order information. Vegetables, onions, pickles, yada yada. Its too long for any person to want to take a look at it. Customers on the ground queueing will be served first. I waited for about 30 minutes at the Subway restaurant. I could see it was really busy and the staff had not started to prepare it yet. Suddenly, I received a message from the customer: ""I want to cancel the order, can you please help to cancel?"". As a rider, I cannot cancel any orders, the SOP would be to contact foodpanda support. So I contacted them, and they called the customer. I then told Subway to stop producing the orders. I mean, don't make sense to make 6 customized sandwiches just to be thrown right? The support usually takes awhile and the subway restaurant I was sent to, was in quite a ulu place, wasn't a mall. So I rode back to the mall. About 10 minutes later, I was told by the support that the customer did not want to cancel anymore?? In other words, I had to go back to Subway, tell them to make the order again and wait for another 30 minutes?? I had no choice but to redispatch the order - another rider will come and take the order. Yup, and redispatching the order put my on a 5 minute ""system break"" and my acceptance rate dropped. This time I was projected to be in batch 1, and when I checked again, batch 3. Booom, my pay for the next week decreased by 30 percent, just like this. I submitted a ticket, asking for help. Again, no avail. ""I am sorry to hear that. I will bring this up to the relevant department. In the meantime, this ticket will be marked as resolved"". But I guess I need to let this go. Maybe it was my fault for assuming the customer will not change his mind. Maybe I do not belong in batch 1 since I can't even wait for 1hour for a 5$ pay order - Grab reimburses for time waited.

&#x200B;

And fast forward next week, the same App Issue happened, I clearly missed out the annoying alarm, and my batch score was back to 4 again... Well this post has been long enough. You guys already know what will happen next.

&#x200B;

Yup I know! Recently, there have been a lot of memes about foodpanda support. It's not only foodpanda support, its also foodpanda RIDER support! I really think the problem underlies in having an offshore support team. If you don't already know, most of the live chat support that you contact that from overseas. And I guess because things are a little different there, there may be some miscommunications.

&#x200B;

Oh, and pandamart, expired food? I don't know. Oh, by the way, you can order alcoholic drinks after 10.30pm if you purchase from the pandamart! Please keep it a secret.

tldr: foodpanda is really bad, does anyone have a night shift job :\\

At this point I'm more stressed about my school environment than my academics, because my academics are fine. Not doing exactly well, but at my own pace.

I had a group of friends in class for the past few months when JC starts. However, last week they just decided to ditch me completely and created a new group chat without me. I don't even know what did I do wrong. Was it because I have difficulties communicating with other people, making me essentially an outcast? Was it because I am being myself? at this point I'm so done. 

I started to get stressed over my project work, because the person who ditched me is in that group and I don't know what I should do about it. Other subjects have group work too, and I just am too anxious for that. 

I don't know whether I should consider transferring out next year to another JC in Year 2, or transferring out to another class, or just sucking things up as they are now.

51,nm49el,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,Otherwise-Fox7612,False,public,,[A Levels] Take Two - A passion project dedicated to those retaking A’s (and how you can help !),"Hello! 

This is likely to be a lengthy post, but it’s for an important cause and a cause close to our hearts so do spare a few minutes if you’re able to :-) 

We are a group of students who have retaken the A-Level exams as private candidates and are now waiting for university to commence. We would like to do our little part to help others who might be considering retaking/are in the midst of retaking.

Introducing … Take Two! 

**About Take Two :** 

While Reddit is a useful source for many to find out more about retaking and gain insight from others, we realised that there is largely still a lot of confusion about retaking and little information regarding what retaking truly entails. The lack of a one-stop platform dedicated to providing resources and information about retaking & the retaking journey was a problem we wanted to solve. 

Hence, we decided to create Take Two - a website committed to being a one-stop platform students could go to, to find out all they need to know about retaking!

**The website will entail the following pages :** 

\- **Taking the First Step :** 

This page seeks to provide practical information regarding how to make the decision to retake and factors to consider 

\- **Taking Charge :** 

This page would provide students with resources (like study notes, guides etc.) and tips on how to plan & take charge of their learning (given most students have to study independently)

**- Taking Heart :** 

The retaking journey is emotionally challenging and mentally exhausting. Taking Heart seeks to provide insights on how students can manage their mental and emotional health & resources they could rely on.

**- Taking Inspiration :** 

Taking Inspiration serves to be a blog where ex-retakers can share their own stories about retaking and what they have learnt along their own journeys. The objective is to inspire others and provide various perspectives about retaking :-) 

The website is in its final stages of development and here is where we need your help! To make the website truly resourceful for retakers, we would love to have you contribute your stories/resources! 

**Here’s how you can help :** 

**Contribute to our blog !**

If you previously retook the A levels, do consider sharing your story! It could be about what you learnt from retaking/your success story/ what you wish someone would have told you while you were retaking. As long as you believe you have something meaningful to share, we’re more than happy to share it with others :-) 

(p.s your identity can be kept anonymous should you not want to disclose your name)

**Do email your stories to** [**reachtotaketwo@gmail.com**](mailto:reachtotaketwo@gmail.com) **by 10th June** 

**For everyone else :** 

**Sharing Resources**  

Under the taking charge section, we are planning to create a repository of notes for various subjects that retakers can refer to! We understand that some of you may not be willing to share notes for the fear that they might be circulated. To prevent this we have come up with the following measures 

**1) Only those retaking can access the notes :** Notes will be in a google drive folder with restricted access. We would require students to send in proof of them being private candidates/retaking A’s as a J3 student (eg: photos of their entry proof with their personal particulars blurred) before allowing them to access the notes. 

**2) Notes cannot be downloaded. Only viewed.**

**If you would like to share your personal notes/study guides do email them to** [**reachtotaketwo@gmail.com**](mailto:reachtotaketwo@gmail.com) **by 10th June**

If you are uncomfortable sharing your notes but have tips on how to do well for a certain subject, do still consider sharing your strategies! Also, if you have contacts of tutors who you would recommend to others/personally offer tuition services, do share the contacts with us so that we can feature them on our website :-) 

We’re looking to launch the website in the coming weeks (ideally in 4-5 weeks) so that it can still be useful to those currently retaking! Hence, if you would like to share something (your story/resources) do look to do so within the deadline stated, just so we can ensure there is a substantial amount of content on the website when it launches.

If you have any more questions, feel free to email us or send questions at Reachtotaketwo’s Tellonym and follow taketwo\_sg’s Instagram! we’ll be happy to respond to you :)

Thank you for your time ! We’re trying to do our little part to help make the retaking journey slightly less overwhelming & confusing for others and we hope we could get your support :-)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nm49el/a_levels_take_two_a_passion_project_dedicated_to/,13,176,2,176,0.99,Thu May 27 18:16:50 2021,A Levels :snoo:

I am a student working a part time job on the weekends but stopping when it's exam season (to study)
My tuition is 2hours a week,80 dollars for 2 hours. 1 hour for Sciences (physics or chemistry) and the other hour for math.
To get to the point,its financially very draining and tiring to cough out 80$,sometimes during exam season when I need more tuition I would have to borrow money from my sister or family members because I cant support myself. 
I have been working at a fast food restaurant since I was sec 1,and I also had tuition since I was sec 1.
My goal when working is to make money to support my own tuition and reduce the financial burden of my parents.
My tuition has always been 80 dollars for 4 years. The same tuition teachers has been teaching me for 4 years but just something bad about her is that she is always late by like 10 mins and she always uses her phone(idk if that's normal for private tuition)

So anyways,that is the background info.
Main thing is that currently I'm struggling,alot.
I'm a sec 4 NA student taking Geography, social studies,math,physics,chemistry,DNT and EXPRESS English (I'm a sbb student)
The mid years just ended and I'm preparing for my prelims in july/Aug.
I did very badly,my goal is to go PFP and idk if I can make it.
My current mid years results EMB3 roughly 18-20
English (express convert na) 2
Math (6)(I failed)
SS (6) (I failed)
Geography (I'm not so sure I haven't gotten back my results for this but I think is a meh pass or fail)
DNT(failed )
Chemistry and physics (I got a 3)
Even tho the results is bad (18-20),my weighted exams was even worse it was like, 20++.I worked really hard for my midyear and it did improve by quite abit but not enough.
My goal for prelims is to get 13-15 and by nlvls get 9.
It seems impossible,u can slap me for having that much of a 'dream'

*I took CLB so I won't mention that la*

Is there anyone or any seniors that can help me? Any tuition centres or any free help or anything.
I currently have tuition for Math and physics/chem
Mostly I need tuition for Geography but any other subjects is fine .
I'm so sorry to bother the sgexams reddit
 community and all help is appreciated

I take: emaths, emaths, pure physics & chem, comb. hist/ss, eng! We don't need to have the same subjects but if we do, then maybe we can help one another HAHA. 

If possible we can discord call? I wanna finish at least most of my work this week 😭😭 it's so overwhelming .. we can call any time from 6am-3pm :)) its okies if it doesn't work out dw bc i have never done this before. Keep in mind i complain a lot about having to do work .. aaa

I often find myself sleeping at the most nocturnal times possible (now it's looking to more of 5.00/6.00 in the morning) on days such as now as I enter the holidays. To be honest, I never found sleeping early to be pleasant, as I always ended up with vivid dreams that always were kinda to very nightmarish. I also found that the day lasts too short, and would try to extend it by burning into the wee hours, until I hide the fact that I am sleeping so late from my parents who get up around then. I also found that I would just black out after sleeping late, and wake up with no recollection of any dream.

Should I seek help or something? Recently I think I am getting hallucinations or something, like out of the corner of my eye I see small dots or something not there, and even experience microsleeps. For some reason I can force myself to sleep during exam periods, and during school terms I am so overwhelmed with studies that I just dream about the shit I am studying, but once that is over my sleep schedule is gone.

P.S. By the way, I delayed the start of my driving lessons because I think I might run over someone, even on the circuit. Or who knows, some crazy instructor might make me drive on the road from the start. I don't know why am I including this, but I guess I would like to talk to someone about this.

I reasoned with myself that since I was going to be spending two years in JC, I might as well make this my number one priority and see how well I could do.

Furthermore, there was the added incentive of being able to apply for medicine if I was outstanding enough - I would be able to *impact people on a grander scale than ever before* through healthcare which is a dream come true!

Unfortunately, I did not take much time to consider how I would want to approach this goal. I *plunged headfirst* to this commitment without any concrete plans, made many mistakes, and did not address them until A levels were over.

Today, I want to share **3 key mistakes** I made in JC and the lessons I learned from them. My hope is that you would not repeat what I did and, if you find yourself in a similar situation, to inspire you to start doing something about it today.

&#x200B;

# Mistake 1: Developing unhealthy habits/coping mechanisms

As a perfectionist, I wanted to have perfect clarity of what I was learning and *would often stay up till 1-2 AM* just trying to complete additional practice questions. Hence, it was common for me to get only around 4-5 hours of sleep a night. To compensate, I would usually nap for 1-2 hours the following afternoon. This poor sleep schedule inevitably resulted in low concentration levels and fruitless study sessions. Thus, I had to spend a longer period of time studying, resulting in even lesser sleep the next day.

As a result of putting an unreasonable amount of stress and workload on myself throughout the weekdays, I would typically crash during the weekends, spending the majority of my time either *napping (for 3 hours at a time) or watching movies on Netflix* to escape the reality of schoolwork and commitments I had in the week ahead.

While I did fit in schoolwork throughout the weekends, it was very haphazard work as I could only think of relaxing. I would then ""chiong"" the remaining work on Sunday nights and thereafter will *still insist* on squeezing a movie in (probably as a form of denial), only sleeping at around 3 AM, beginning the entire self-destructive vicious cycle again.

Lessons:

1. Consistency > Intensity

While my intentions were good, I was setting myself up for failure by working too hard on some days and then doing close to nothing on other days. It is **much more sustainable to do a little each day** instead. There will be future opportunities (tests, tutorials, consultations) to solidify what you have just learned.

2. Facing reality can be really painful and difficult.

However, running away from it only delays the inevitable. Instead of trying to figure out everything at once, **slowly implement systems that will make your lifestyle more ""livable""**. This can be done so by devising healthier habits to deal with stress and allocating time for work, play/relaxation, and sleep. Through experimentation, decide on the best study method for individual subjects and stick with it. Lastly, naps are great but it is no substitute for a good's night sleep!

# Mistake 2: Sacrificing the more important things in life (relationships and health) way too often

I recognise that sacrifice is needed, perhaps even necessary, as we pursue goals - be they academic, physical, or aesthetic - that mean a lot to us. However, in my pursuit for straight A's, I sacrificed spending time with my family and friends way too often *without valid justification*.

Whenever my family went out, be it visiting our grandparents or going somewhere new, I always argued that I ""*did not have the time*"" as I had to study and I wanted to just recuperate at home. This response slowly morphed into a habit and my relationship with my family members stagnated and subsequently declined since I was *not willing* to put in the time and effort to maintain our ties. As we are all older now and are in vastly different life stages with unique responsibilities, there are even fewer opportunities for us than before to physically meet together and strengthen our bonds. Hence, this is definitely one of my prime regrets.

I *neglected many friendships*, both old and new, throughout the 2 years in JC. I got easily carried away by the hustle and bustle of daily life and so connecting with many of my old friends wasn't even on my list of priorities. As for new friends in JC, I failed to realise that the people around me were pillars of support and encouragement and instead tried too hard solely relying on myself to get through school. I guess a large part of me was too arrogant and close-minded in the sense that I thought I didn't need new friends to grow up together with.

I *also* *placed much strain on both my physical and mental health*. I was constantly stressed, thinking of how to make every moment productive and what next to improve on. Physically, I hardly exercised and drank monster energy drinks frequently to stay awake.

Lessons:

3. The longest study - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI) \- on happiness concluded that **a good life is built with good relationships** (family, friends, and community). With this, **prioritise family time** and **make a deliberate effort to stay connected to the friends that matter**.

Even if you operate best alone, **build healthy and positive connections with the people that surround you daily** as it can make the journey a lot more constructive, sustainable and memorable.

Having time for something/someone is simply a matter of priorities. The next instance you think you have ""no time"" for someone, understand that you actually mean that they are ""not a priority"" at that particular moment and then decide if that is indeed the case or not.

4. Health is wealth. **Exercise regularly, get your required nutrition and water intake, and sleep sufficiently!** Without good health, we are far from our optimal state to maximise our day.

&#x200B;

# Mistake 3: Letting schooling interfere with education

Other than progressing in my studies, I *barely worked* on the other domains of my life during my JC days. While I did participate in numerous enrichment activities and organised a few others, the truth was that my heart was hardly involved in these projects as I was more concerned with how it would ""*beautify*"" my portfolio. I didn't train myself to become more resilient to failure - I forgo opportunities unless I was very certain of ""success"" - and there were close to 0 attempts at achieving balance in my life so I couldn't learn much about how I could handle stressful periods of time properly. I also slashed away the time spent on my hobbies and passions, failing to gain valuable experience and potential friendships.

Lesson:

5. To the vast majority of people, if chasing titles (""Top student award"") and excellence means you have to solely focus on academics and events that will boost your portfolio, I will say that it is **not worth it**. Whether it is learning sewing or trying out freestyle rapping, **make time to grow and learn in ways that are beyond the syllabus**. Do things that genuinely interest you and not just because it is a means to an end. Also, **don't give up** just because you think you might not succeed in the endeavour you're about to undertake. The great thing about being young is having the time to try out a variety of things, where failure is unlikely to be catastrophic!

\-

At this point, you may be wondering **how I eventually did for my A levels**. Without disclosing my actual score, I will say that I performed decently. I understand that this post could come across as *unnecessary and arrogant* because despite the mistakes I've made and the disappointment I feel, I did achieve a satisfactory RP (Rank point) and so there isn't much point lamenting about my shortcomings and should instead just be grateful of what I have accomplished. Additionally, some may also feel that I am being *inconsiderate of the feelings of others* who also walked a similar path but did not attain the results they desired.

I sincerely acknowledge your emotions and I believe that they are valid. Nevertheless, I believe that it is also important to recognise that unless you have perfect information about somebody else's situation, it is *futile* to dictate exactly how they should feel. Furthermore, there is little benefit of comparing RP because that isn't the main point of this post anyways. Instead, I hope that this post motivates you to **reflect** **on how you were throughout JC**. If you do so, I am almost 100% sure that there will be invaluable, unique and life-changing lessons from your journey that you can apply to your life to make your future experiences more fruitful.

I have to admit that many parts of this post are pretty cliche. However, I can guarantee that this is a genuine reflection of my JC days. I guess this only goes to show that the things people repeatedly tell you - Exams are just a milestone; results are not everything; your health and relationships should be your top priority - do contain **an element of truth** and it would be wise to keep these in mind.

Although some people will remark that ""A levels is *just* another pit stop in life"", I wouldn't say the same because I know exactly how vital it is to many JC kids out there, myself included. It is also extremely easy to feel overwhelmed throughout this journey, because even attaining some semblance of ""work-life harmony"" can seem like such an impossible task. Even so, approach JC the same way as you would with a math problem: **one step at a time**.

If anything, being in JC is a fantastic opportunity for you to not only realise that **progress is not linear**, but also to figure out **how you want to achieve balance in life** and what sacrifices you are willing to make to achieve your goals as this is a skill you are definitely going to use even after A levels.

Of course, what I wrote may not necessarily be 100% applicable to your situation so do only take what's useful and modify them if you have to.

Lastly, take care of your **relationships and health** as these remain essential, long after you forget what your rank points were!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/me5bcf/a_levels_mistakes_i_made_chasing_success_in_jc/,36,444,15,444,0.99,Sat Mar 27 11:06:33 2021,Junior Colleges :karma:

Because her mother is reallly toxic -_- , her mother scolded her JUST because she dropped the piece of egg on the floor and ""made a mess"". Later A sent a chain of messages ranting about her feelings (how she felt horrible about her mother scolding her), then left the group chat and blocked me, my other best friend B, and my other friend C who was in the group chat with us, on Whatsapp. A blocking us is not really questionable behaviour, because I know from past experiences that its her way to cope with things and let herself get some space whenever shes overwhelmed by a situation, like her family or smth. Its sort of a coping mechanism for her to get a breather, then unblock us and rejoin the grp so i completely understand her blocking us. 
The thing that really got to me is that she posted on her instagram close friends list, ranting about how her mother is toxic and ruined mother's day. She posted it on her close friends list, but she wouldnt even talk about it with us, her best friends? Idk maybe im overthinking. Another thing that got to me is that us three (me, B, C), messaged her on Instagram the next morning to ask whether she was okay, and she just left us on read. I then asked her again at night whether she was feeling better, and she left me on read again. Usually, she'll come back after only a few hours, but its been like 2 days? and shes still ignoring us, and havent unblocked us. Another thing is that she seems completely fine on Instagram, posting stories about the neighbourhood cat and her pet birds.

Is it really that difficult to get myself to just study? I'm not even diagnosed with ADHD or anything else, but yet I find it so difficult to start on homework of any kind. I'm sure that I don't have ADHD too because once I actually start on the task, I can focus quite easily. 

So now I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of procrastinating because of my fear of failure, inevitably being disappointed in myself when my results come out and repeat. And due to my stupid decisions, I'm going to fail my test tomorrow because math is my worst subject and I still have 5 more topics to study (which I probably won't complete because it takes me hours to understand the simplest of concepts).

I am a 20 M living with depression and years of it has seriously taken a toll on my emotional state. I have lost all interest in every single thing that I used to do and it has been getting steadily worse since the outbreak in jan 2020. I just cant seem to find a purpose in everything and when I do start doing something I usually just give up after a short while. My social life is also very  small and I don't share this to my friends because I feel that they aren't rlly understanding so I keep this to myself. I would spend most of my days just mindlessly scrolling social media on my phone and laptop without any reason. Literally most times when I am using my laptop I would just stare blankly at the screen and not have a clue what to do on the screen and just switch between tabs and play with google interface. It really sucks to be in such a mental state and I really want to get out of this but I really have no energy or mood. I am literally living on autopilot and watching my whole life fall between my eyes. 

i also suffer from low self-esteem issues and extreme anxiety to the point that it is crippling me to start doing anything that I might actually like. Anytime I am contemplating to start doing something new, i would question my ability to do the task and visualize the amount of work and time to be able to get good at it and knowing the amount of work needed to start overwhelms me and I just give up.

I keep struggling daily with anxiety and panic attacks since sec sch and O's and I easily get them when I am stressed. Life in secondary and JC was quite stressful which triggered the onset of panic disorder and numerous panic attacks that lead me to hyperventilate and cry and think I am dying and all. And in the Uni setting,it is hard to struggle with a panic attack without scaring your peers and like freak people out or draw unwanted attention to yourself!!I am already on medication and even had increased both the dosage and types of medication taken but the anxiety is still there and the panic attacks happen without reason and sometimes out of the blue.

I cried on the MRT from panic attacks on several occasions, with people looking at me strangely. I was all teary and my face was red and sweating and I was shaking all over. I have mentioned this to the student support managers in my faculty and the faculty is well aware of my conditions. The Deanery and UHC counsellors and psychiatrists as well as the Pitstop counsellors are helping me with weekly counselling sessions and I am trying my best to manage:(

Throughout sec sch to JC, alot has happened with sec sch experiencing bullying issues that made the anxiety worse and JC was very academically stressful and repeating a year in JC1 meant that I had to face the label of being a JC1 retainee by the new J1s and also a lot of rumour spreading and mean comments about me,both online on my JC's confession page and offline (in person)

Either way, I'll try to cut through the irrelevant facts to present you the meat of it. Also posting this from a throwaway because I don't really want people who know me to find this. 

I enlisted into PTP BMT at the start of February. Having a history of eczema since childhood, I had submitted a private specialist letter back in 2019 during my medical checkup only for it to be abruptly rejected due to it being from a private clinic. Either way, I went in being quite physically unfit but convinced myself that with hard work and determination I would improve. 

Unfortunately, I soon found myself overwhelmed by the PT sessions. I struggled physically (especially during runs, where I found difficulty sustaining a steady pace and not going out of breath), and constantly felt like I was the only one in my section who was hilariously failing at everything. Predictably, a month in, I failed my first IPPT terribly, which made me feel emotionally worse. 

However, it was 2 weeks after the first IPPT when things started to go haywire for me. After one night of Guard Duty where I spent the whole night in boots, I found an odd ""skin crack"" on one of my toes which soon caused difficulty while walking. I visited a GP over the weekend who claimed it was a fungal infection and gave me a 7 day excuse from RMJ and covered shoes. Booking back into Tekong, I visited PTMC and had the MO confirm that it was a fungal infection before arranging for a CGH appointment the week after. 

By the time I visited CGH I had already stopped training for 2 whole weeks. At CGH I was instead told that my toe injury could either be a fungal infection or an extension of my eczema, and skin samples were taken for testing. I was also given creams for eczema which had started flaring up on my body after wearing Long 4 for GD, as well as an additional 2 weeks excuse from covered shoes. 

As BMT began I found myself instructed to wear Long 4 with sandals for TH tests ans BTP practices, which was not only rather uncomfortable but also further triggered my eczema on my arms and neck. After a horrific case of miscommunication, I was told that at the last minute that I would be participating in an activity while wearing Long 4 (while I was still wearing admin), causing me to rush to try and change and grab the necessary items. In my fit of panic I forgot to take a mask, and when I realised I immediately ran back upstairs with my rifle, only for the worst case scenario to happen - I suffered a full blown anxiety attack upstairs and nearly collapsed from an inability to breathe. (This was not my first anxiety attack, I had previously suffered one in January for unrelated reasons.) 

The following day, I officially got OOT for missing more than a month of training as well as a pending IMH appointment for my anxiety issues. Yet during my next CGH appointment I was suddenly told that I had also developed warts on my foot, which I had to undergo cryotherapy (spraying -200°C liquid nitrogen to freeze off the warts) fortnightly. Needless to say it was exceedingly painful and left me with large blisters, making walking agony until the Tekong medics were able to drain some of the blood from the blister. 

As much as I dreaded BMT, I tried my damn best to go in with an open mind and push myself to improve and endure. But at this point I've suffered so much pain, exhaustion and stress that I feel that I'm reaching my breaking point soon. I don't want to recourse and repeat 4 months of PTP BMT where my skin is likely to act up again and my anxiety attacks may flare up again. Being confined for field camp week and being told that my posting may still take a while to process is gradually driving me mad.

Also listed on the NASDAQ, Interactive Brokers(IBKR) is a multinational brokerage firm that many are familiar with. IBKR is highly recognized and renowned for their long standing history, highly positive reviews and a massive global presence across 135 markets worldwide 
IBKR currently provides access to: Stocks, ETFs, Options, Futures, Currencies, Bonds and US and Canadian Warrants.

**Saxo Markets**

Unlike the 2 brokerages discussed above, Saxo is a privately traded company that nonetheless holds a strong presence in Singapore. Although Saxo grants access to various financial trading instruments, they have a strong reputation as a forex broker. 
Saxo Markets currently provides access to:  Stocks, ETFs, Forex Currencies, Bonds, Futures, Options, Forex Options

**Commission & Fees**

One area that IBKR and Tiger Brokers shine at are their highly competitive commission structures even on an international comparison spectrum. We compared their commission rates across the board and compared them side by side along with IBKR and Saxo markets and placed them on a chart [click here for the full chart](https://optionliteracy.com/?p=2952)

As from the chart, IBKR ranks the highest in terms of low and flexible option commissions at $0.65 USD per US option contract (base tier) while TIGR takes second place at $0.95 USD followed by Saxo Markets. From a competitive standpoint, with brokerage firms slashing trading commissions and fees in the last decade, Saxo’s option commission structure (base tier) of $3 USD per stock option and a whopping $6 USD per cash index option (e.g SPX) means that they stand substantially higher in the spectrum of commission charges (All numbers stated above are solely commission charges while extra regulatory fees still apply). Keep in mind that due to the fact that trading options generally require a higher frequency of management and the use of strategies that employ the use of multiple option contracts, investors and traders looking to trade options should pay even more attention to commission and fees. 

**Option strategy compatibility**

As most option strategies are simply a combination of opening multiple option contracts, as long as buying and shorting of options are permitted by a broker, almost any strategy can be executed by any option supporting brokerage. However clarity and strategy compatibility is important to keeping a trader’s portfolio organized should they choose to trade options. For that reason, certain brokerages may be better than others in terms of how they display a trader’s option positions. For example, the buying and selling of 2 call option contracts one of a later expiration cycle and one of an earlier expiration cycle of the same strike price is known a diagonal spread or a calendar spread. 

Some platforms may recognize this as a diagonal spread and allow you to manage the position as one while others will only recognize 2 different option contacts requiring you to individually manage both options. Net Greeks that show you your overall positional exposure to the Greeks such as net delta and net theta may also need to be manually computed together if that brokerage has poorer option strategy compatibility. 

One relevant example of the importance of strategy compatibility is the recent issue with Tiger Brokers not supporting covered calls, an option strategy that is used to frequently lower a stock positions cost basis and generate premium. Many traders found themselves in a situation where they had to either forgo using the strategy or find a different supporting platform. (A few of our [discord](https://discord.gg/mNet58BjaD ) members reached out to Tiger to raise the issue but there were no guarantees of an imminent fix). With that being said, as options trading continues to grow in popularity, greater option compatibility is likely to be added sooner or later. For now however, IBKR holds to be the better broker in this area of comparison.

**User interface and customer service support**

From The majority of responses that were gathered online, Tiger Brokers takes the cake for having the most user friendly interface due to their easy-to-navigate menus and a rather simplistic trade execution page. Saxo takes slot number 2 for this comparison while IBKR ranks at number 3 for their slightly more advanced platform interface.

In terms of customer service support all 3 brokerages have local telephone lines that can be reached. As we look to put service support on a scale of comparison, do note that customer service support may ultimately boil down to personal experience so do take this bit with a pinch of salt. From the emails that we sent, IBKR has been most spontaneous and prompt to our test email queries.

IBKR 2.7/5 rating on Trustpilot

Saxo 2.2/5 rating on Trustpilot

77,lzh0zs,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,sleepingdonotdisturb,False,public,,[JC] You should be so proud of yourself for making it this far.,"JC isn’t easy. 

Actually, that’s an understatement. JC is fucking tough, especially if you’re not one of the few who actually don’t mind/ like sitting down and studying for hours, or if you’re a genius lol.

I’m tired too. I’m so tired, that literally the first thing I think of in the morning when my eyes open is going back to bed that night. I’ll tell myself that soon I’d be done with school/studying, soon the sun will set and I’ll finally be allowed to go back to bed, back to sleep, back to peace. Even if it’s only for a few hours, even if i’ll have to wake up again, even if this peace is very much short-lived. 

I feel so suffocated too. Not only because JC leaves little to no space in your life for enjoyment, but also because I feel like I don’t have the right to complain. I chose to walk this path, so I should tolerate the consequences, right? It seems only logical for it to be this way, right? 

I know how it feels. 
I know how it feels to want to give up, or to want everything to stop. 
I know what it feels like to not understand what in the actual hecking hell you’re reading, or to not want to try at all. 
I know what it feels like to be so fucking overwhelmed because your CCA ends at 8.30 pm and the rate at which your workload is increasing never slows down. 
I know what it feels like when you were on the verge of finally asking for help, but you realise that you aren’t the only one suffering so you start to feel guilty for even considering that option. 
I know what it feels like to stare out the windows of buses and trains on the way home, while wondering when all of this will end, and to wonder if you’ll even finish this stupid A-level race at all. 
I know what it feels like to cry in bed at night because you just don’t know what to do anymore. 
I know what it feels like to be an outsider in your own school, to feel like it has no vacancy for you because you’ve never done this badly academically before. 
I know what it feels like when you see people- your friends and your classmates- studying so hard, and feeling guilty for feeling too drained to do the same. 
I know what it feels like to consider sleeping, for the rest of time.
I know what it feels like to be in JC.

But I’m still here. I’m still trying even though what I’m doing is nothing compared to what I should be doing. But what matters is that I’m still trying. And I cannot stress this enough- progress is of secondary importance. What’s most important is that you TRY. 

And I know trying is scary. Why? Because you’re afraid that when you try and you still don’t see progress, you’d be directly confronted by the limit of your competency, the limit of your intelligence. But I’ve come to realise that this isn’t true at all. You of all people know how vigorous, how rigid, how unbending education here is. And you’re letting it decide how smart you are? How worthy you are?

You are so important. You are so strong. You’ve made it this far. I’m so proud of you. Please don’t give up. I know the choice of walking down this path was yours, and that it was purely voluntary, but you’re allowed to feel tired, you’re allowed to feel lonely, and you’re allowed to ask for help. But if you really feel that this path was a mistake and that it really isn’t meant for you, you can always turn around and take a different one. Just please, don’t aimlessly stray too far away from it, no matter how sick of it you are, for you’ll get lost. Take control of your own life. You can always talk to me, or to your friends, or to your parents, or to your siblings, or to your teachers, or to your school counsellor. Everyone is here for you.

Ok being fully honest here, I am extremely privileged so I know my route isn't available to most but... if it helps even a single person, I'm happy!! 

Long story short, my life goal was to get into med (haha whats new for asians right lolol 🤓). I was lucky enough that my parents were open to overseas uni if my grades weren't good enough, but even then you still need AAA or whatever. I was in a certain top school so the expectation was that I won't have trouble getting those grades, but err i ended up without a single H2 A 🥲🥲🥲. 

So what did I do? I went home and cried LOL 🤩

After I was done crying, I signed up to be a private candidate cos I STILL WANNA DO MED. 😃🔫 Ok here's where i screwed up. The reason why I didn't do well in the first place was because I was in such a bad place mentally. I was burnt out, distressed, felt useless, and super anxious (all the aunties and uncles asking for my grades didnt help either 😡). So what happened when I retook my A Levels????? 

Haha I still didnt get any H2 As LOLOLOL 🤡

Ok at this point i rly was damn sad but someone told me to go take the UK A Levels so I hid this fact from literally everyone and did the british A Levels. Lemme tell you they have it so easy idek why our A Levels are so bloody hard. 😡😡😡 And essentially I did rly rly rly well and got into a certain university overseas to do med!! (Very privileged i know and fully acknowledge it)

People always talk about those who get 90rp and you might feel damn alone when you don't get the grades you want, but just wanna reassure you that YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!! many people are in the same boat and struggling, pls ask for help and support if you need it!!! 🥺🥺

AND ALL YOU 90RP PEOPLE 
💫Sweety i am so proud of you and your achievements 💫but pls dont rub it into people's face and dont go around asking people how they scored cos i was this close to tears whenever people asked me how i scored ok sorry im truly proud of u and your achievements but people are suffering here too!!

okay serious part here: 
1. The system screws a lot of us over. Just because you didn't do well in your A Levels doesn't mean you are stupid. I genuinely felt very stupid in JC. But you are not. Don't let this system pull you down because you are gonna go out there and do well in whatever field you enter. When i got my UK results, the first thing i told my mum was ""im not actually stupid"" AND BLOODY HELL NONE OF YOU ARE!! YOU ARE ALL CAPABLE HUMANS AND I WILL FIGHT ANYONE WHO DOESNT AGREE ❤❤💥💥💢💢
2. YOUR IGP DOESNT DEFINE YOU!!!!! IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING JUST TRY!!!! the 10% IGP for NUS/NTU or whatever is NOT the lower score they are taking so there is a chance that you can get in (speaking from experience here cos i applied to non-med courses in sg unis too and got in despite my IGP not hitting the 10%) 😛
3. It is ok to retake a levels.💓💓💓 Ok no one will give a fk that you retook years down the line. I prepared excuses that I used (and still use now) to avoid telling people i retook: 
- ""I took a gap year"" then they will ask ""oh cool what did you do"" standard answer tell them you worked, travel a bit (covid big sad no more excuse), spend time with family etc 
- ""i was frustrated by the rat race so i took time off to let my burn out get better"" this one i use more nowadays, cos no one questions mental health these days and it was true for me :) 
- ""i needed time to figure out what I was interested in"" perfectly valid lah tbh 
4. Pls pls pls take your mental health srsly T.T i cant stress this enough 🙏🙏🙏🙏

Ok if anyone read until here ya you gonna be ok! If anyone is in a similarly privileged situation and wanna study overseas too, I am happy to answer any specific qns!

Edit: thanks guys for the overwhelming response to my post 💓 

as a general note, please understand that i am not in a position to give you professional advice regarding mental health, so please do not ask me to counsel you because I am not trained to do so. Instead, do seek medical help if you are in significant distress.

91,lnk4fo,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,dak3ene,False,public,,"[Rant]: Accusations of ""Smurfing"" in JC","I'm extremely fed up with being accused of ""smurfing"" in JC, here's why:

During the weeks prior to and during O levels, I went through alot of mental stress and was very tense for most of the time, common for people with low-to-no self-esteem(much like how most students have it normally), but this overwhelmed me to such a great extent that I would just sit and cry, or just rage  over small issues. This period of time was so stressful and it was a breath of fresh air after O's, being able to calm down and de-stress properly.

Received O level results in January, was relatively surprised by how well I did (L1R5=7-4). After much consideration, I chose not to go for the ""Institutions"" and went for _________ Junior College. My reasoning was that I felt the environment would be more beneficial to me such that I could better cope academically and mentally, given how mentally-destroyed I was during O's, I wanted to be in a less stressful but still competitive learning environment. Now here's where the problem starts:

Nosy, irritating distant relatives/former schoolmates(NIDR/FS):
Hahaha LOL you didn't go to ___/__, what did you score? Confirm damn trash one.
Me:
Yeah I didn't go ___/__. But I did get 7-4.
(NIDR/FS): look at this guy so zai (good) yet choose to go to ________ JC, smurf sia.

To be honest, I don't fault their thinking. Growing up most of us were told to go to the best possible learning environments, in most cases, the prestigious schools. 

However, it's always good to remember that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" institute of higher learning. You could be more suited to JCs, Polytechnics, or ITE, depending on what kind of person you are. This brings me to my point, which is that not everyone who goes to a ""lesser"" school when they could have gone elsewhere is smurfing. 

Knowing the lack of mental health I was dealing with during O's, going to an 'elite' JC, where everyone is fighting to be the best is the worst possible destination for me. But those who parry these accusations don't see the struggle, the nights of pure agony, the last-minute dash to the toilet during papers (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). They just assume: Hey you're so smart stop depriving other people of the opportunity to go to ABCDEFG JC!

I personally feel that the point of going to school is for the passion of learning and improving myself, not just being a mindless body who memorizes content for the sake of a degree, diploma or A. I just can't stand it anymore when people just hurl such accusations at me and just spread it around, and I'm sure that some of your reading this post agree with how I feel and have similar experiences.

It would be absolutely phenomenal if everyone could just respect each other's decisions, and stopped jumping to conclusions based on their assumptions. But this is real life, so that's obviously not happening. But you, reading this post, can make a difference. Be more respectful and understanding of problems other people face and the decisions they make, and don't judge a book by it's cover.

Tldr: don't accuse someone of smurfing based on silly assumptions, be more respectful of other's decisions. Makes a world of difference",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lnk4fo/rant_accusations_of_smurfing_in_jc/,29,105,2,105,0.96,Sat Feb 20 00:35:45 2021,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:

Now seeing many threads about results day. Really brings back memories and regrets.

My advice to juniors feeling overwhelmed by such issues is to ask yourself two questions:

1. What do you want to spend your life doing (in terms of career)?
2. How much will this issue matter 5 or 10 years later (especially with regards to Q1)?

In JC, I worried too much about what other people think about me and looked down on myself for being from a mediocre JC. As a result, I tried too hard (and unsuccessfully) to be popular and got into lots of toxic social drama. That, combined with family and health problems that I handled poorly, affected my performance in the A Levels (as it had for the O Levels).

As a working young adult, I have five friends from secondary school, JC and NS combined whom I still keep in touch regularly. These are the people who truly matter. Not those whom I was trying to impress. Not the fake friends. Not the popular kids and certainly not the mean ones.

Another mistake I made was thoughtlessly choosing a pure arts subject combination. Turns out that my subject combination made me ineligible for the university course leading to my dream career. I also chose a CCA just because my ""friends"" (which turned out to be fake friends) were there but ended up achieving nothing in it.

In NS, I met guys with severe medical conditions who gave their best every day (one got accepted into NUS Medicine but could not defer because cannot be MO) and others who faked mental health problems to get PES E then took as many MCs as they could. My unit had ITE graduates who went to poly then got accepted into NUS and some from top JCs who completely screwed up their A Levels. There was a guy running a profitable small business outside and another who dropped out of school, mixed with bad company and went to DB for drugs.

Seeing them made me wake up my idea and after ORD, I got a very basic job in my dream industry, then self-studied for and earned some entry-level industry certifications. Now I am self-studying for private A-Levels (including H2 Physics, which I did not take back then), having realised that provided I manage my family and health problems well (which I currently am), I can do well.

All the best to those collecting their results on Friday. Success is not final, failure is not fatal. If you do very well, congrats! That gives you the flexibility to choose a course that you have the passion and aptitude for. Do not choose courses simply for the prestige, only to end up miserable in the resulting careers. If you do badly, you may need to take a different or longer path to get to your desired destination, but do learn from your mistakes and do not give up!

To those still in secondary or JC, focus on working towards your career goals (which should guide your choice of subjects and CCAs) and the people who truly matter (heck care those who do not). Not yet figured out what you want to do? Spend more time figuring it out. Feeling discouraged because you are from a neighbourhood secondary school or JC? Then study harder (of course, not until you drop) and smarter. When I was reading through the Ashlee saga, I was thinking: ""Ashlee, you should be more worried about your A Level grades and how you will survive NS (assuming you need to serve since still legally male)."" To those about to enlist or just enlisted, you may not have a choice about serving, but you can choose how you spend your two years.",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ll39ql/jc_rant_please_do_not_make_the_same_mistakes_that/,18,336,8,336,0.98,Tue Feb 16 20:58:14 2021,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:
93,myands,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,FlatZombie3707,False,public,,[JC] tips / advices on how to survive JC??,"i'm currently a j1 in a middle-tier jc, which i got in through DSA. i took combined sciences in secondary sch and tbh my o level results weren't that satisfactory (my l1r5 is pretty far from my jc's COP too). i take h2 chem and bio now & honestly i find everything super overwhelming and hard to catch up. this lecture - tutorials system is new but it's already been 3 months and my other classmates are adapting to it rly well, except me. i can sit in lectures and pay attention but half the time my brain can't process the information well bc the lecturers just goes on without stopping much. i've been failing every lecture/topical test & although my tutors constantly say it's alright to fail in j1 etc, i don't think it really is... im afraid all of these will snowball up and i might end up flunking promos (which i don't want to \*cries\*)

im not officially diagnosed, but i suspect that i may have adhd/add. i've been struggling for the longest time trying to focus on doing my work bc i get distracted super super easily (im supposed to be doing my chem tutorial but here i am typing this lol). my attention span is terrible thus i find it really hard to stay 100% focused dur sch (i can hyper focus at times though). i was able to control these in primary and secondary sch, altho it was only in sec sch when i realise i could not really handle all the weight anymore. now that im in jc, it's near impossible bc i can't always be distracted since there not much time to complete the never ending list of assignments (but i still do and i js can't stop it). i wish i could get checked, but i have rly stereotypical parents who think ""people with mental illnesses are crazy"" & strongly believes im perfectly fine. so i doubt ill receive professional help so soon.

anyways, back to my point of this post,, i find it hard to catch up, but i NEED to esp before it's too late. i wanna know what are some tips prev j1s did that allowed them to stay ""afloat"" in jc or how to better cope with the rigour. & no i do not regret going to jc, i really enjoy the environment there (not much toxicity or dramas) and i doubt i can survive poly haha. my friends are really encouraging & supportive too. i just feel that i would be a burden if i tell them abt how im coping since they're also trying their best... i don't open up easily either so im not yet comfortable with telling my tutors ://",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/myands/jc_tips_advices_on_how_to_survive_jc/,9,13,0,13,1.0,Sun Apr 25 23:33:09 2021,Junior Colleges :karma:
94,mc4q1t,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,studymatcha,False,public,,[o levels] how to be more disciplined to study?,"hi im taking Os this year and im feeling a bit hopeless. My classmates seem to be so on top of everything, always finishing homework early and getting so much revision done while i struggle to even complete the homework on time. When im in school i make these grand plans about going home and finishing assignments and making notes and doing extra revision etc, but in reality when i get home and see the huge list of things to do, i feel overwhelmed and im already quite tired and i end up doing almost nothing. Even if i plan less tasks, i get complacent and go like ""oh i have plenty of time to do it"" and end up not starting anything until around 10.30pm. I know it sounds pathetic but i dont know how to stop this. Also, i am quite addicted to my phone but unfortunately i need my phone to do a lot of my homework because my teachers use things like google classroom and padlet etc, so hiding my phone is not an option. I do use the Forest app, but i end up just mindlessly waiting for the timer to end so that i can use my phone again. I tried deleting distracting apps, but sooner or later i cave and download them again. 
Many people in my school are doing really well in their studies, but i didnt score very well for my WA1 and its only a few topics compared to MYE/Prelims/Os which is 2 to 4 years of content. I feel like i should make a study plan, but then again im not good at following the plans i make 😅
I think i really need better self discipline, but i dont know how to do it. Any tips?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mc4q1t/o_levels_how_to_be_more_disciplined_to_study/,13,19,0,19,1.0,Wed Mar 24 20:41:34 2021,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:
95,lzuhc8,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,aowchie,False,public,,[A Levels] how i studied for As,"helloooo its me again this is my second post on reddit HAHAHAHA so heres a few general studying tips that i employed in my studying for As hope it helps!! 
i took BCMx (all H2) for some context! 
if this post has good reviews i may make another post for the separate subjects hehe

1. keep all distractions away when studying (duh). cant emphasise this enough tho its really impt to not put ur electronic devices anywhere in sight. personally i place my phone inside the drawer behind me so its not that easy to reach it, and when i study sometimes i forget where i put my phone LOL

2. BEFORE STUDY BREAK, there are 3 things i mainly do: one, clarify all misconceptions, or work on weak topics. two, review all past internal examinations that you sat for, compare your original ans to the actual answer, write it down in another colour and understand where you went wrong. redo the questions if you have to until you get it right. three, read up on subject content, cuz u wont have much time for that during study break. 

3. slowly start doing ur tys at around june. i wouldnt advise starting in the beginning of the year, because yall would still be learning content and tys is mainly for timed practice and simulating the actual As. before that, just do ur tutorials and whatever papers your teachers ask yall to do. 

4. STUDY BREAK: PLAN. if you fail to plan you plan to fail simple as that. for me i allocate a day to one subject. weekends are for weaker subjects / things i fail to complete within the week, and friday is usually my rest day. plan whatever u wanna do the night before the day u carry out ur tasks. i always place whatever i have to complete in a pile on my table before going to bed so when i wake up i feel motivated to clear up the pile. 

5. if you love love food, like me, you would tend to get food coma right? HAHAHA i have found a way to prevent myself from dozing off in the afternoon at around 3-4pm :) i make myself a cup of hot tea everyday and place it on a coaster in my room, and have it while i study. i mean yall could get coffee or like bbt or whatever drinks yall wish but for me tea works the best (and also cuz at that time the teabags were expiring soon) 

6. STUDY BREAK: im not sure if this works for everyone, but i always track how long i have spent productively studying per day. i just click on some 10 hour long music tracks on youtube and play the video while studying. i dont listen to the music though, because it can get really distracting for me, until i end up jamming to the songs instead of focusing. i set a personal aim for 8 hours per day, but my studying time during that period ranged from 3 hours to 10 hours. dont force yourself to study so much though, so aim what you think you can manage per day and dont forget to give yourself some brain break :)

7. which comes to the next tip, which is always give yourself a break when needed. study break is the worst time to get a panic attack or to experience a burn out, so stop studying if you feel overwhelmed. for me i study in blocks of 1.5 hours, with a 15 minute toilet + brain break in between. if you feel tired, sleep early (i highly advise against taking power naps in the afternoon unless you can wake up easily). even if you feel unmotivated to study, dont study lol. dont force yourself to do what you dont feel like doing, but since you’re tight for time, do something that will make you motivated (for me, its getting new stationery).

8. STUDY BREAK: note down the papers that you’ve fully completed (attempting the paper + reviewed) on a piece of paper or post it and paste it somewhere where you can see it. it really does give me a sense of fulfilment whenever i see how much i have done and i feel even more determined to study more to be better prepared. be true to yourself though, dont keh keh write down more than you actually did it defeats the purpose of this. 

9. by the time As end, you should be done with the tys, or at least half of it, and should have at least done 1-2 prelim papers for each subject. very important. as much as reading up on content is important, practice makes perfect as there are many answering methods to different types of questions. 

10. also not sure if this works for everyone but i wake up at 4.30am on the day of a morning paper to cram in the content, of course i sleep slightly earlier. this is to refresh my memory for the subject and restart the ebbinghaus forgetting curve lol. for afternoon papers i wake up at 9.

96,m5munj,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,asdfghjklmood,False,public,,[JC] been seeing alot of j1 burnout/stressed posts so hopefully this helps,"hi j1s, i know that jc is definitely tough, even from the start. while its important to acknowledge the tough battle that you are just started on, its also important to not be overwhelmed. ur feelings are def valid, and its quite a known fact that jc is a huge jump from sec sch, but dont give up! 

here's some tips on coping w school (im a sci student btw) and just surviving in general

1. find an optimal study method for urself. its rly rly crucial for one to study smart instead of study hard esp bc jc content load is insane (at least for the subj i take lol) so efficient studying is a must!! can try diff study methods to see which works for u, rather than doing that right before exams lol
2. take things one step at a time. jc is definitely overwhelming, esp bc theres like endless things to do. a sense of urgency is def good, but not to the extent that youre stressed out before u even begin doing anyth (from personal experience this is the worst feeling ever 0/10 recommend). so just make sure you achieve your tasks one at a time, and not breakdown bc everything is coming to u at once (if this happens, its ok too but just try to settle ur emotions or else u cant do work properly)
3. find a good balance. this is esp applicable for the ambitious ones out there, be it with sl proj, ccas, extra curriculars or whatever you have. remember that one can only have so much on their plate at all times, so its vvvv important to manage ur commitments and pls pls pls learn to say no if u rly cant commit. ive seen many of my friends overcommit and end up gg to sch everyday just to sleep in their lessons and walk ard like a zombie so ya uh its a no go
4. sleep. pls heed my advice ik u have one billion things to do but no sleep -> no energy at sch -> no learning -> extra backlog. also, a word of caution/advice: if u start drinking caffeinated drinks, dont drink them everyday (but rather only when u rly need it), bc from personal exp i ended up sleeping 5 min aft drinking coffee when i just drank coffee like every single day. so ya lol its not fun when coffee doesnt work anym then u need rly strong coffee
5. dont compare urself too much to others. context: im from an ""elite"" jc and ya uh its def vvvvvv easy to feel demoralised when u compare urself to the top achievers in ur cohort. just focus on ur own learning and dont be overly critical on urself. also, im not saying completely heck care abt the pace of the cohort/class (falling behind class is not fun or beneficial, so try ur best to be on task) but ya just avoid unhealthy comparison. its not helping u so avoid that.

thats all i can think of for now. jc is undeniably tough as shit but take care of urself, alongside ur acads/extra stuff. this journey is definitely not smooth sailing lol and sometimes sch sucks super bad, but keep going (i dont mean at the expense of ur mental health) and youll be okay!!! take heart and take care people! all the best",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/m5munj/jc_been_seeing_alot_of_j1_burnoutstressed_posts/,8,119,5,119,0.98,Mon Mar 15 23:13:58 2021,Junior Colleges :karma:

It first started when I breezed through promos without much intense revision, since I had plenty of time in J1 (especially with the CB) to slowly understand concepts. Did pretty decently, now everyone expects me to score for every single test. I personally don’t bother about comparing marks, but it sucks when people flock to you to ask for your marks and get disappointed when I don’t get an A

Now, along with leadership positions and intense CCA due to competition, plus the fact that I live at the opposite end of the country, I feel completely overwhelmed with work. I can reach home really late at night to the point it’s almost midnight if i shower and have a snack. 

And recently, I lost my best friend who has helped keep me sane throughout my school life. She just decided to block me out of her life (yes, she blocked me on social media) suddenly without much explanation. I’m so worried about what could’ve led her to do this. Is is because of her personal issues? Or perhaps she just thinks i’m annoying? 

I can’t sleep at night because I’m constantly worrying about these, or most of the time I cry myself to sleep and it’s deprived me of so much nap hours. I don’t know who to turn to because she has been my pillar of support for years. To lose someone important to me at this crucial year of A levels where I’m already facing tons of stress from school feels like crap.

102,lxc7i2,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,unicorn36000,False,public,,[Uni] Tips on retaking A levels,"As a private candidate who retook As in 2020, I know how scary and uncertain the road ahead can be, but it's definitely possible to take this path and ace the As. This is just to share the things I did when I decided to retake As and revision tips during As exam season. I took BCME in JC and BCE/m when I retook As.

**Compile and Plan**

This is very important! In JC, I didn't organise my revision materials and plan my time and before I knew it, half a year had flew past.

Compile a list of study materials by topic(e.g. tutorials, topical revision worksheets) from your JC so that you know what you have and what you may need to buy to give yourself extra practice! Download all soft copy materials from your school portal, **especially if they include science practicals/practical notes** if you still have access to it, you never know if they might turn out to be useful. Ask friends from other school if they are willing to give you their notes and tutorials with answer keys as well so that you can have more practice.

Check the syllabus for your examination year against the previous year including all of the fine print, and I did this for all my subjects just to make sure that I don't learn content that won't be tested/missed out content that will be tested in the A levels.

I also did a week by week plan for every subject that I was taking, where I had to complete a topic for every subject each week(including summary notes, tutorials, marking of tutorials etc). This really helped with the uncertainty and anxiety I was feeling as this gave me a plan till June/July and I had somewhere to start. I listed down all the topics that was in each subject and started with the topic that I was weakest in in JC.  From June/July onwards, revision includes TYS, practice papers and I didn't really have a plan for that as by then I already had my momentum and my foundation was already there from all the tutorials that I had done and I just did a practice paper per week for each subject for revision. However, from July onwards, I counted down the number of weeks to my first A level paper so I roughly know how long I have before I have to be fully prepared for As.

**Study Techniques**

1. Pomodoro technique really helped me to focus, as well as youtube study with me videos!(didnt feel so lonely mugging after watching those)
2. It's not the quantity of hours studied, but rather the quality! I studied 6 days a week, giving myself one day off to do whatever I want which can range from shopping to Netflix. From Feb-July, I studied only about 4 hours per day, but I made sure that during the 4 hours, I completely understand the material and content taught and could do the tutorials without having to refer to the lecture notes for specific concepts. Took lots of naps between my study sessions!
3. **Summary notes!** I felt that my summary notes were the ones that helped me to really master the topics, rather than tutorials. Tutorials simply helped me to have greater exposure to higher order questions. Because of the fact that I had already taken a few exams in JC, I knew which parts of the topic were more important and frequently tested so I focused my attention on those concepts and made notes on those instead of simply copying out the entire set of notes without learning anything. My summary notes also included mistakes that I made in my tutorials/hard tutorial questions, so when I revised I could see where I went wrong.
4. Practicals. I was in science stream and as a private candidate, I didn't have access to labs and wasn't willing to pay exorbitant fees to practice at labs run by tuition centres, which was also a reason why I only started revising for my science practicals in August, and really made me panic. I was uncertain on how should I go about studying for my practicals. What I did was read through my school practical revision notes(thankfully I had a thick stack of those from my JC with extra practicals that was undone as those were given right before As when I was in JC and of course I didnt have time to look through them) as well as practicals that I had did in JC and try to visualise doing the practicals.
5. **Ask for help!** Just gotta remember that even though you are a private candidate studying at home, you are not alone in this fight! Don't be afraid to ask for help from juniors in JC, they would know the latest syllabus/have the latest notes if you are not sure! For e.g. in my year there was Common last topics removed, and I checked with juniors in JC just to make sure that I wasn't studying the wrong things!
6. Focus on the present, just do it! Don't let thoughts of uncertainty about the future overwhelm you, focus on completing your daily tasks. Learn to celebrate small successes everyday. An extreme measure, but I deleted my IG so that I wouldn't be comparing how my friends are all having fun and learning new things in uni while im retaking As.

**Timeline**

Feb-June/July: Completing my topical revision! I felt that this was a really important part for me as I had a solid foundation by the time I did revision and doing the TYS felt like a piece of cake, giving my the confidence to tackle the A levels. Don't cut corners, make sure you cover all the topics and completed the tutorials!(I probably did about 3-4 schools worth of tutorials for each topic for all of my H2 subjects, but I was able to complete those tutorials really quickly because I understood the concepts well, thanks to my summary notes)

July-September: Probably did one revision paper for each topic per week/topical revision and grinding practicals because by now I haven't touch practicals for about half a year so I really recommend starting earlier! I would study for about 6-8 hours per day by now as practicals take me a really long time, as I wanted to familiarise and understand the different techniques for both of my biology and chemistry practicals! And if you analyse enough practical papers, you will realise that for bio and Chem, the questions for practicals are pretty standard and it is possible to compile a list of standard questions and keywords used to answer those questions! For revision papers, quality over quantity and as I didnt have a benchmark(e.g. school exams), I was pretty strict with myself when marking those papers and I made sure to compile the keywords that I was missing out and the topics that I made mistakes in and to revise the topics again.

October onwards: start of A level season! By this time, my foundation was already pretty strong and im quite confident going into the exam hall, so I did papers if I have the time, on other days I revise using my summary notes to make sure that I go though my concepts once more.

&#x200B;

So basically i was posted to unit and lets just say im no longer feeling like myself. Like idk i am having soo much stress and its overwhelming. Sometimes i just get anxious and worried for no reason and when i do i just stop whatever im doing and stone there for no reason (which honestly idk why). I also sometimes break down for no reason. I have family issues and financial issues and with NS, im honestly overwhelmed by the amount of stress. 

I get anxious easily so whenever I am stressed or shouted at my hands wills start shivering and shaking and my mind goes into a blank. In some instances i even feel sleepy and might toh. (One time during force prep). 

Honestly everyday im just a walking body, no soul. I didnt had a good past and I am doubtful that I will have a better future. Sometimes i just think that its better for me to end myself so that maybe some other useful person can just take over my place. I'm honestly mentally tired and if I feel like if im shouted at again i might lose it. Im on the brink of breaking and i really dont know where to go from here. Im so lost.

I really want to be a good soldier. I do. But sometimes my circumstances dont allow and sometimes I just blame myself for being so useless. (Like ""ehh wtf people can do why you cannot do""). Im worried what might happen next. I want my 2 years of NS to be fulfilling, but i am not sure whether I am even able to do it.

Im sorry if this post sounds incoherent because im writing this while there are a lot of things going through my mind so I cannot focus.

I wasted my j1 sleeping through lectures, stoning in lessons and copying tutorials. I just managed to promote and I barely studied in the nov/Dec holidays. In the beginning of March of j2 I realised how bad my predicament was and started studying and I got BDEDE for MCTs and A for PW. This is way off what I desire and aim for myself to achieve. Now it’s end of April and I am trying to put my best foot forward but I’m unsure of what is “correct” and effective when studying. Like for bio, there’s content and application. My approach is to read and understand the notes followed by actively recalling information. After understanding, I practice qns. However, it is overwhelming because I slacked off in j1.

**#4 STUDY TIPS**     

During the workshop, our guest speakers - Alex and Justtin, shared some useful studying tips:   

1. **Listen during lessons and do your homework on time**! Though  simple it is  important because it ensures you keep up and avoid homework snowballing. Just Listening and understanding during lessons is a step up from trying to understand it by yourself in your own time.    
2. If you find your mind wandering/difficulty concentrating, **do something mindless** while studying, eg. walking around/listening to Lo-fi.     
3. **Set a time limit** and keep to it, so that you don’t end up procrastinating (eg. set a timer for 2h to finish an essay instead of giving yourself ‘as much time as needed’.  
4. Take **regular study breaks!** Especially if you are memorizing and it feels overwhelming, take a few minutes to refresh your mind!    
5. Find out the **best studying conditions** for yourself. What is the environment in which you can focus best? Who are the hard-working study buddies who will motivate you to study?    
6. **Ask questions beyond curriculum** \- This can broaden your understanding and fill in the little links you’re currently missing. Questioning what you’re studying rather than passively accepting it is also far better for memory retention and general understanding.     
7. Remember to **practice**! Practice makes perfect, building your proficiency in the subject.  

**#5 Q&A Time!**    

In response to our participants’ questions, here’s what our speakers had to say:     

1. ***Any tips on note taking skills under time constraints?***    

* Be selective! You just need to take down the key points the teacher/lecturer is saying.  
* Ask other friends for notes    
* Practice! If you use handwritten notes, practice writing faster or use a lighter pen. If you’re in a school where you’re allowed to use a laptop, use it, and practice typing fast.      

1. ***How can I juggle between CCA and studies/How do I apply spaced repetition to my busy schedule?***    

* Props to you! It’s very difficult to juggle between these two heavy commitments, and many people have had difficulties doing so.  
* Try using digital flashcards. The biggest benefit that digital has over physical is accessibility: we can take it wherever we go and we can revise on the fly e.g. on the bus to school/meetings, during short breaks.    

1. ***How to procrastinate less?/How can I motivate myself to continuously be productive in studying?***    

* **Start slow.** Take note of how much time you currently spend studying, and gradually work your way up from there, peaking when you’re near major exams.    
* **Take breaks often.** Try not to overload yourself by regularly spending 8-9 hours studying non-stop. You should break up your time into blocks with breaks in between (using Pomodoro technique, or variants of it) to keep yourself focused.    
* Even then, try to be **consistent** in studying so that you won’t have to wind up in such scenarios in the first place. Instead of mugging in the few days before the exam, space out your revision such that you start earlier, but do fewer hours each day.

hello! im a j1 student who just had their first day at school today and honestly it could have went better than it did. people were really super friendly (some were so extroverted hahah) which was nice! but after a while, being an introvert like i am, i couldnt keep up with their energy, especially when my social battery started rapidly depleting. it got quite tough because i was overwhelmed by the sheer number of students (i also felt intimidated by the huge number of ip students), and was super anxious and awkward. the ip students were rly rly nice & they weren’t exclusive at all, but i couldnt help but feel a gap since they are already so bonded & close. despite their friendly efforts to engage with me, i still felt rly distant & disoriented & struggled to keep the conversation going. there were also times when i was so confused during ori & didnt rlly know what was going on; i really just wanted to curl up in a hole & die LOL. 

i keep telling myself that orientation will get better with time as i slowly integrate into the school, but right now it’s a little hard to think positively. tbh it was extremely draining & overwhelming for me :(( i know im likely not to be the only one who feels this way tho; first days are usually tough for a lot of people. so, if there’s anyone who feels the same as i do, could we just talk it out and encourage each other? im trying to muster the strength to face monday with more confidence. & anyone with advise would be welcome and much appreciated too :’)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/l7or62/jc_rant_rough_first_day/,31,134,1,134,0.98,Fri Jan 29 17:53:23 2021,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:

backstory, i'm currently in my first year of poly (turning 17). i'm a foreigner, have been studying in sg since i was 3. not pr, applied but didn't get. some personal things came up and long story short, there's no guarantee my parents will still be employed next year onwards (old age, covid, foreigners) and so they'll be forced to go back if that happens, and subsequently i will be forced to leave the country as well

i've done some research on the future possibilities, and i'm focusing on studying and working in canada. here's the problem... if we leave next year, the only qualifications i have are my o level grades and like.. one year of diploma. but most (if not all) universities in canada, or for that matter in the uk, australia, america, etc) require a few A level subjects... i'm planning to take psych (specifically bsc) but i just passed c in chem and failed d in bio LOL but the rest of my subjects are pretty good A1 A2 B3

what do i do? :/ i know there are foundation programs but i'm really struggling to find more information about it (i've found some, but can't see any admission requirements so i'm not sure if i'll be able to go there)

my thoughts are.. maybe i can take SATs while i'm in poly now? i really don't know what to do. i feel like i'm running out of time as well. i've been trying to contain my anxiety but it really seems like it's starting to get out of hand. i'm definitely going to try and at least complete the 3 years of poly here, maybe it will serve as a replacement for a levels/sat/act/etc... but i'm scared if the situation goes on to the worse side, where we're forced to leave next year and i genuinely will be stuck because i don't know what to do

i know it might be a little too early but i'm a normally anxious person when it comes to my future and the fact that all this is happening right now is quite overwhelming so i'd really appreciate as much views and thoughts on this as possible

i feel so guilty because i could've just left the country before enrolling into poly and now i've wasted my parents money all for it to go to waste if we end up leaving next year :/ i've been constantly looking at canadian universities (bc canada is my priority but i will look at the uk later on maybe) the past week almost? and i've just been having constant breakdowns every single night bc i feel so stressed over this. i feel like i have no time and time is just constantly going faster and faster.. i want to stop thinking about it and let my brain rest but if i stop researching about the possibilities then i get too anxious again...:/",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nh1pvb/rant_advice_or_opinions_please_unpredictable/,1,16,0,16,0.91,Thu May 20 22:29:49 2021,Rant :snoo_feelsbadman:
109,lnog28,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,jichuchutram,False,public,,[A LEVELS] What should I do with my rank points?,"Got back results today, 66.25rp.

Read online that universities take into account MTL grades so after factoring that in, my rank points are now 68.6 rp. I took H2 Physics, Chem and Math with H1 Econs. (CDD/C with gp B)

&#x200B;

I was thinking if I should **retake as a private candidate**?

However, my tutor told me that I need to think this course of action carefully as we somewhat benefitted from the CLTs last year, but because of the CLTs, we didn't learn those topics and all these topics are tested this year. Which means I need to master these topics completely on my own. Also cost wise, it'd add up to about $700 or more in total. (That's kinda pricey ngl.)

&#x200B;

Also considered **retaking in school as J2 repeat**.

My school is reviewing all applications on a case by case basis, and application closes on 2 March. My civics tutor was not very supportive of me choosing this option when I brought it up earlier as he saw me through the worst state of my mental health in J2 when I was leaving class and hiding in the toilet crying, absenting myself from school to hide from socialising and even just zoning out in class when my mind is fuzzy. (Will explain why this happened later.) He felt that repeating J2 wouldn't be beneficial for my mental wellbeing, and that I still have other options available, hence this should not be my first course of action.

However, I can't get anywhere near what I want with my kind of grades.

&#x200B;

Here are some courses I was looking at ***prior to A Levels back in 2020***:

1. NUS Medicine (via ABAS)
2. NUS Science (Physics) + NIE Postgraduate Diploma in Education (JC)

***As of now with my current grades***, some paths I am considering:

1. NTU Physics (68.75RP)
2. NUS Biomedical Engineering (75RP)
3. NTU Bioengineering (71.25RP)
4. NTU Engineering (63.75RP)
5. SMU Science in Economics (70RP)

Can someone give me an idea of whether I should try for this courses?

Would personally prefer NUS due to location and costs.

&#x200B;

**Just some personal backstory, skip it if you're not interested:** I was doing very well academically back in J1 and I was my tutors' prospective straight As student despite having oversleeping habits so I was often late for school like at least once a week? Yes I went on to do well for my promos and I did OGL for orientation as well (first bad choice I made). I was pulled into Openhouse committee head duties as a result of my past experience and with the team I had, I ended up tanking most of the work and my studies were compromised alongside the overwhelming house dance practices for Orientation. When orientation finally ended, I thought I could settle down and study but then COVID came and I missed my block tests because I was placed on LOA. I only had 2 days of school before circuit breaker kicked in and then I was at home all day. It was during this period of time where I thought I could finally study and catch up when my dad was retrenched and his inferiority complex worked up that he had to exert his dominance at home. He was taking it out on me everyday, blaming me for my existence, disrupting my HBL by barging into my room and yelling at me, locking me out of the house at 9pm during circuit breaker, banning me from cooking my meals etc. It was alot of yelling and alot of blaming that at some point, I didn't know who I was. It felt like everything's that went wrong in his life was really my fault and I wanted to disappear. I wanted to take my own life and end my misery. I was crying everyday because I want to study but I couldn't find the energy to get out of bed. Instead of focusing on studying, I was more focused on staying out of my dad's way at home so I don't get scolded again. I was tired of being constantly called a redundant kid, the one he didn't want, useless and all. When school resumed, the drama at home went on, and I found it even harder to wake up and go to school and see my peers doing just fine while I was struggling emotionally and mentally.

Maybe it was also some form of existential crisis, because suddenly, I just didn't know who I was and what I needed to do. I couldn't sit still in class, I was finding excuses to go out and just walk or sit at some place spacing out at the greenery. Was it depression? I don't know. But then one of my tutor finally noticed something was off about me being frequently absent from school and being late that he confronted me about it, which led to my civics tutor finally talking to me about it as he just thought I was late more often due to exam stress. I cried telling him what happened and I admitted that I wanted to die at that point in time because my parents didn't want me anymore and they're blaming me for my existence. Ever since then, he kind of became my adult who checks in on me on a weekly basis, talking to me about future goals, my current feelings etc. He tries to give me something to look forward to, and he was there to celebrate every single one of my small wins with me, e.g. coming to school on time, being present for a week, not missing any lessons; but he was also there to encourage me through the lows, e.g. going over my mycts and prelims papers to see what went wrong and how to improve, constant validation of my hardwork and changes.

When I was at the verge of giving up on A Levels, my civics tutor and my other subject tutor were there to support me to push through. They taught me to see the light at the end of the tunnel even when it all looks bleak. I guess because of them, I'm still alive today, and that I can now safely say that I made it through A Levels. Honestly felt like I wasted their time from back then today, because I still did badly and didn't meet their expectations but it was really my best at that point in time.

&#x200B;

While my results are quite disappointing nonetheless (I went from As and Bs to the kind of grades I have right now), I too want all of you fellow graduates out there to know **that** ***there are far greater battles to fight in life, and A Levels is just one small fight.*** ***There'll always be a way out of whatever situation we're in***, depending on our rank points. ***Don't give up, keep looking, keep asking, keep exploring. Someone, something, somewhere, will show you the path that you can take.***

113,l9vcki,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,mochifluffstacks,False,public,,[A levels] Ambition Is Secondary To Merit,"
This is pretty much a salty, bitter rant about how I feel post-JAE. 

I’m posting on a throwaway account as I don’t wish for my identity to be compromised. For context, I scored 15 raw 13 nett for Os, which seemed pretty fair given the amount of effort I put in. It was enough for me to meet the COP of my dream JC that offered a subject combination that would closely relate to my intended major in uni. 

Unfortunately, I got posted to xJC, which my parents forced me to put as my third choice. I had absolutely no motivation to go to xJC at all and I started spiralling really badly. I lean towards humanities heavily, scoring distinctions in English, Elit and combined Humanities. 

I know exactly what I want in life, where I want to end up, and I’ve always leaned towards arts even as a child. At first I was blaming myself, couldn’t I just score one point less to be safe? 

I appealed to my dream JC (as I met COP), and I appealed to zJC. zJC offered me a place right after the interview, whilst dream JC has not responded at all. 

I know I messed up my JAE when I decided to listen to my parents, I know how stuck I am and being lost in my own overwhelming emotions is far from ideal. Most of all, I feel bitter. I want to study English language and Literature in Oxford, and I had mapped out how I would end up there. Sure, this JC thing is just a little deviation from the main plan because it’s JC nonetheless, but I never expected it to be so hard-hitting. 

Additionally, I volunteer somewhere with people from high-profile backgrounds and elite JCs, with my dream JC perceived as being the lower tier JCs already, so a self-created inferiority complex comes into play.

Most of all, I am bitter that merit outweighs ambition by a long shot, especially since I excel in the areas I’m ambitious about. I have no other choice than to make do with what I have, of course, but I feel devastated. 

I’m going down to zJC today to stamp my form A, (sealing my fate haha) wherein I will be unable to accept dream JC’s offer should they choose to accept me. (I have a pretty strong portfolio, but I don’t want to take the gamble anymore.) 

I’m trying to keep my head up and let this setback fuel my desire to do even better for A’s, but for now it’s hard and I just want to wallow in misery and be pathetic. 

With all my points being said, I wonder if anyone has felt the same? Thanks for reading this long rant! :,)

Im honestly still undecided on whether to stay in jc or to transfer. Posting here to ask for advice from seniors who are studying in biomed sci now. Here are some of my questions & concerns :)

1. How does the content taught in BMS compare to that in H2 bio ? I’ve taken a look at the modules but still not sure if there are similarities ? Does it also focuses more on the molecular side of biology?

2. I’ve heard that bms is quite a competitive course and workload is quite heavy also. Is this true ? Is it hard to maintain a high GPA ?

121,jkz2fx,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,SaltyShellback,False,public,,"On staying sane and doing ""better""","Hihi, uncle coming to nag again, if I sound deluded and this post is unhelpful to you, I apologize in advance. 

Been coming across plenty of posts exclaiming despair and sorrow at how fucked up the world is, or why xxx did xxx today and why xxx should go to hell and die. 

Yesterday, a young passenger took a ride from me (grab driver) and asked me with a touch of sadness. He asked, given the state things are today, isn't life meaningless and hopeless? Something must be terribly wrong, that our younger brothers and sisters are feeling hopeless despite the comfort and peace we enjoy in Singapore! 

The world isn't fucked up. The world have always been the way it is. In the short history of humanity, we have had countless wars and epidemics. Covid 19 is nothing compared to WW2 or the black death. It's just something that have happened during our short lifetime and that we are too young and too fortunate to have experienced anything truly ""fucked up"". 

Now R/SG community is largely wholesome and kind. That's why we are happy to see wholesome posts on random act of kindness and feel compassion for victims of crime and injustice. 

In order to help make the world ""better"", we must first find our own inner peace. While compassion is beautiful, we can't make meaningful contributions when we are consumed by rage and despair. We have to be the stable lighthouses for the people around us caught in the storm. 

It's easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. What can I, a measly single person, do to make things better? 

ONE single act of kindness and compassion is enough to change EVERYTHING! When you do something to make someone's day a little better, you improve the odds of them behaving in a more positive way to others around them. And the others around them do the same again, you see where its going? Your single action improves the countless lives around you! A simple smile, a moment of active listening with the intent to understand, that's all it takes. Best of all, it's free! Free! 

Similarly when you are overwhelmed with rage and anger, you turn your beautiful compassion into this web of negativity that sticks on to people around you, people that you love. (just by being mindful of that, when someone is horrid to you, know that you can end this cycle right there) 

We don't need to see a damsel in distress before jumping in with our glistening white armor. We can start small, even on Reddit itself. After reading an article or comment and before hitting the reply button, take a mindful moment or two. Recognize that what you think, will translate to what you say and do, and how it will impact those who will be reading your comments. 

Hope this bout of nagging brings you a small moment of peace and joy, wishing you a great weekend ahead :)

123,j61wvu,r/askSingapore,t5_363n6,44592,toystorycat,False,public,,Not your typical Singaporean family,"It's really hard for me to say this or share with anyone .. 
But I honestly feel trapped....

You see, I was raised in a lower income family (but it didn't used to be that way). Before I was born, my dad made $5-6k/month back in 1980s which was considered a lot and my mom was making decent as well. They both only have secondary school qualifications. I have 2 older brothers and I'm the youngest. My family lived in a maisonnette but shortly after I was born in 90s, my dad declared bankruptcy and had to mortgage the house and downgrade to a 5room flat (with outstanding housing loan to pay as well). My dad was gambling a lot and generating credit card debts. My mom would shop to de-stress and ended up with credit card debts as well. With financial problems comes frequent arguments in the house. 

Growing up, I never really saw my parents. My dad was always out and my mom was out working 3 jobs. Still, we had days where there were no electricity and water for days. It happened quite frequently when I was in primary school....

When I got to secondary level, I mixed with the wrong company. I was never at home cause I didn't want to (my house was a mess and I didn't wanna be around the constant drama). My first bro is 12 years older than me and he got diagnosed with schizophrenia and was hospitalised at IMH before. He has been paranoid and kept accusing us as spy from the govt. He would beat people up and he would say things that don't make sense but annoys you. As for my 2nd bro, he's into gambling online. He started since he was in sec school and he bet on soccer online. Obviously, he asked for money from my mom to gamble.... Both of my bros are drop outs from poly. They spent all my parents' CPF on their unfinished education. 

I was also working part time jobs earning from $5-8/hr on weekends and holidays when I was just sec 2. Eventually I got to a point in my life where I figured I needed to study hard so I could make money and get myself out of the situation.. so by sec 3, I turned around and concentrated on studies. I managed to do alright on my O levels and ended up in a science course at a polytechnic. I bought my first laptop with my own hard earned money. I studied hard while still working part time and was aiming to get myself accepted into a local university and I did. But the next thing was, how am I gonna pay for it? 

The best thing that happened was I applied for a scholarship and I actually got it. I never thought I would make the cut but I glad I got the chance to go for the interview and was actually offered. I traveled overseas for school and I couldn't be happier for the next 3.5years of my life. I was away from the drama and I had the freedom to do what I want to do.

Now that I'm back, I'm serving the bond. It just feel like I'm trapped all over again. I just finished paying a $1.3k/month housing loan for my parents 5rm HDB for 2 years. My dad passed away from bile duct cancer just a year after I got back. I had to arrange the entire funeral by myself , my 1st bro didn't even attend the funeral at all. My 2nd bro is arrested and jailed for online scams. Idk what to say.... I can't move out because my mom is old and she needs someone but at the same time it's toxic living with them. I don't wanna move out cause I wanna save money for my own future too. I am just not happy living. It's just a cycle I can't get out of. 

If you made it this far, hopefully I made you feel a bit better about your own situation....

Disclaimer: idk why so many people assume I'm a guy, but I'm actually a girl.

Update (09/10): Just want to say, I'm overwhelmed by the number of people who responded to my life story with so much encouragement and positivity. 

Trust me, there are days where I felt alone and that no one could ever understand how I feel and I never understood why it is happening to me. It's not like I could just tell my friends about it without knowing whether they'll be judgemental or not.. I did share with my closest friends but sometimes I just feel that I'm bringing my own negativity into their lives. So I just kept it to myself.. besides there's nothing much they could do to help me. 

But being on here, posting to a community of people who actually offered so much support through your kind words, I can't express how deeply grateful I am.

125,ic2gn6,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,Bryanlegend,False,public,,An unsavoury allegation of another nature against DK,"Taken from Facebook:

When I learned about this news yesterday, I was shocked and disgusted. Then, I felt bad. Because Dee Kosh had harassed me too a few years ago. And when I had the means and ability to act against him, I chose to walk away and not engage. Predators are emboldened when victims don't stand up to them. I felt bad because I couldn't help wonder that if I had stood up to this disgusting person then, would he have thought twice about victimising other people?

My brush with this disgusting person (who is so repugnant to me I can't bring myself to type his name again) first came in 2018. He harassed me and an author published by my company. TO BE CLEAR, what he did to us is NOT THE SAME as what he is accused of doing to those boys. Whether the accusations are true, only time will tell. All I can say now is that there is a clear pattern of his predatory behaviour towards young girls and boys.

I had actually never heard of him before (I'm old and don't follow social media influencers) and only came to know about him when he started harassing Nicole Choo, who was published by my company, Bubbly Books. The whole horrible saga started with him posting a YouTube video reading out her work and mocking her looks, her work, degrading her as a person. Nicole was only 19 then. He was 30. To this day, I don't know why he, together with another grown man called Hirzi, would dress up as women and mock a teenage girl, using sexual slurs, just for having the audacity to launch a book.

Their video was released shortly after Nicole announced that her book, Nineteen, had hit the Straits Times Bestselling List. I can only guess that they were triggered by the fact that Nicole had achieved some level of success which they felt was not deserved. I mean, how dare a pretty instagrammer be a writer too? (Actually, I later learned that he had been obsessively mocking her since she was 15.)

The verbal abuse and sexist nature of their comments - and they way they incited hatred towards her - was truly horrible and I felt so bad for Nicole. Because I was the one who had encouraged Nicole to publish her book of poems. It felt like I was the one who was responsible for getting her into this situation.

As a mother, I felt like I had failed her and failed my own daughter, Gabby. I got to know Nicole because she was Gabby’s classmate. When they were young, I used to take them to watch movies, to the beach, and because the two of them love to read, to bookstores and to events like the Harry Potter exhibition at the Art Science Museum. She was my daughter’s friend, and it was my fault she was being attacked.

At that time, that disgusting person who shall not be named, was a very influential celebrity and DJ for Power 98. So what he said, had weight. When he led the charge to cancel Nicole and dismiss her as unworthy of a book deal, everyone jumped on the bandwagon. It was my first foray into the horrors of cancel culture. I read with increasing dismay at all the verbal abuse and sexually-explicit attacks aimed at Nicole. 

Many of them amounted to violent threats - ""kill that slut"", many commented. All the while this was happening, this disgusting person cheered them on and gloated. Every attack that was aimed at Nicole, felt like they were aimed at me too. I was so distressed. Doubly distressed for Nicole who just endured the attacks. I don't think I would ever have the strength and mental resilience she has. She quietly left Singapore because it came to a point where she was physically afraid. The threats did not stop. So, she went overseas for a few months to stay with a friend. 

I am so sorry, Nicole. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that by encouraging you to write a book, that this would happen. For those wondering why I wanted to publish Nicole, it is because she is smart, strong, opinionated, articulate, hardworking and most importantly, has an interesting point of view. She is a good writer.

Unused to the ugliness of social media, I asked Nicole if she wanted me to file a police report. She said no. But the attacks were so horrible. I transcribed the video and picked out the defamatory parts. Apart from degrading Nicole in sexual terms, many parts of their video were extremely racist against Malays and Indians. Unused to this level of vitriol, I was outraged. I compiled an entire folder of evidence, ready to file a police report if Nicole gave the word. I consulted a few laywers too. One of them, a copyright lawyer, pointed out to me that they had infringed on our copyright by broadcasting her pages and reading them.

Okay, great. So there is something I could do! I reported the copyright infringement to YouTube and the video - thankfully - got removed. 

Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the story. Disgusting person and Hirzi launched a new video. A fake apology that was not remorseful or apologetic, featuring the two of them again dressed as women and inciting hatred towards Nicole, and now, my company Bubbly Books. On Twitter, disgusting person posted my company profile and encouraged people to come get me. 

Later on that year, sore that I had gotten his YouTube video removed (he didn’t get to keep the profits from the video either), he posted a top 10 idiots of the year video, naming me directly and broadcasting my name, my personal bio, my company details and my personal email (only partially blocked out). He told viewers to ""Go Google her"" - encouraging them to find me and harass me.

Could I have filed a police report for harassment and doxxing then? Yes, I could have. Thinking back, I should have. But I didn't. And that - together with all the other times when victims didn't speak out – surely emboldened him to bully even more. 

My laywer friends told me that I should 1. make a police report 2. sue for defamation 3. sue for damages for losses 4. sue for statutory damages. 5. issue cease and desist to prevent him from further harassing us. By this time, because of the attacks he led, Nicole's book went from being a bestselling title, to not selling at all. I compiled my losses - amounting to $40,000 in lost sales - ready to pass on to the lawyers. 

Damages and statutory damages could have amounted to quite a large sum. But right at the last minute, I decided not to go ahead. Why? Because I did not want to ruin him, heinous as he was. Also because I hate confrontation. I hated the idea of engaging with someone like him. So I thought about it. I thought about it some more. Then I dragged the decision so long that my anger got tucked away, forgotten. I never did anything further.

I forgot all about him until I saw yesterday's news. Then my disgust for him came rushing back. Then, my sympathy for all the young men he allegedly propositioned, coerced and sexually victimised. And I couldn't help wonder - if I had stood up to him back then, would it have done anything? If I had filed a police report, would it have at least prevented him from being so brazen in approaching young men? I will never know. 

I feel angry that he (allegedly) victimised so many. When a person is a celebrity, he is in a position to coerce sexual favours and make disgusting demands. Because victims are overwhelmed by his fame, or attracted to the idea of working in this company, they give in. This is no better than what Harvey Weinstein did. Sexual predators all use the same tactics.

To any one who has been a victim: Don't blame yourself for what happened. It is not your fault. Tell yourself that over and over again. It is not your fault. You were manipulated. Do not be afraid. You are not powerless. File a police report. Tell your friends – they will support you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ic2gn6/an_unsavoury_allegation_of_another_nature_against/,172,800,0,800,0.95,Tue Aug 18 22:52:58 2020,Unverified

So hi. And disclaimer, I feel like this might not be complete, especially this was from what I know SO FAR.

* Before taking the O level results,

Look up on your desired courses. Find out more abiut them. Do considered the other choices too like JC, MI, Poly and other forms of institution, especially in the case of ""if you cannot get your desired course of study"". Do also try to look up on which UNI course for those planning on univserity studies as : 

1. Some uni courses allow all diplomas but it can be HARDER for certain diplomas depending on the ""eligibility""(I put in quotes). 

E.g.(DISCLAIMER: might not be a good e.g. because I am not from poly so for those poly students, PLS CORRECT ME) Let's say I take Nanotechnology and Material Sci from NYP NMS with reference to http://nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/polytechnic-diploma-from-singapore/subject-pre-requisites/for-nanyang-polytechnic-diploma-holders and http://nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp) . 

Can he take NUS business administration or law? High chance (if he scores 3.73 for Business admin and 3.86 for Law and Business and Law is under ""All diplomas"" category, meaning all diplomas can enter.) 

Can he take Electrical Eng? High chance (if he scored 3.68 and according to the NMS category, electrical eng will most likely accept the diploma.)

Can he take NUS Medicine or Food Science as a degree? Low chances (even if he scored 4.0 for his gpa, it is not a diploma in either ""All diplomas"" or ""NMS"" category. Even till today I dont even know whether the Aptitude Based Admission will work cus I mostly heard it is for those who scored a little bit below the 10th percentile so far. Poly students pls correct me thanks.)

For diploma to NTU courses: https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/adm_appl.relevant_diploma

2. This is the same for the JC students as well. Although yes, art combi can give you a myriad of options like Business, Real Estate Humanities, NTU Sport Science and Law, an art combi may not be possible for Science, Medicine or Engineering(well depends). (Disclaimer: I am not saying art combi is horrible. Pls dont kill me) But if plan on taking a humans subject at H2, do consider Hybrid combi as well. And for those interested in business,finance,economics and accountancy, MI is a possible option even though it takes 3 years for A level degree, they are the only ones offering H2 POA and H2 Management of Business. And for those who are not aware yet, Medicine accept students with H2 Chem and H2 Phy/H2 Bio aka PC×× or BC××.

Do also consider other options if you cannot meet the desired course. E.g. Let's say you want to go to NP's Film, Sound & Video diploma with ELR2B2-D which is 8 rank points. In the case you overshot, maybe you can look at other diplomas(e.g. Infocomm and Media Eng from NYP ELR2B2-C of 24 rank points, Media Production and Design diploma or Art and Theatre Management diploma from RP of ELR2B2-A of 20 rank points or even Broadcast and Media Technology from ITE Central of ELR2B2-C of 34(aka if legit your ELR2B2 exceeds 28 pts with reference to JAE booklet not ITE intake booklet)) or JC if possible e.g. YIJC-19/20 , TMJC-13 (P.S. TMJC has H2 Theatre Studies and Drama) and MI. Do consider art institutions like NAFA and LaSalle.

And for JC students, please for the love of god choose your subjects wisely. Some subjects cannot be put tgt in certain or all JCs. Trust me when I say this because they think just because YIJC does not offer something, means all JCs don't offer. E.g. Just because YIJC does not offer a subject combi H2 FM, Computing and H2 Math tgt does NOT mean ALL JCs dont offer.(Look at JPJC). So do look out for other JCs and esp they range of subjects. Even if the JC offers this subject, pls dont choose it because its popular or is more useful ""in general but not you"" E.g. People chose PCMe even though they would rather do business/arts and not the STEM sector (Not saying it is not possible but trust me when I say H2 Chem is hard, esp organic chem well unless you are hinting at NTU Eng and Business double major).

And lastly, if you legit don't know what to do till now but feel like JC sucks and should rot in hell, some poly offer ""Common XXXX programmes"" e.g. RP Common Science Programme, all Poly Common ICT/Engineering/Business Programme which allow you take common core subjects first and then in year 2, you can choose what diploma specialisation you want to take(though not all would offer all diploma specialisations.) 

Reason I say to plan is because you are given 12 options of school/course so choose wisely and find out what sparks your passion/career.

Oh and btw, you can still go to uni with a poly diploma and some degrees do allow all diplomas. Do take note of CCA options and distance to school too.

* When you take O level results,

1. Take note of Open houses in poly/JC. Plan out how to celebrate/destress after receiving results. Trust me, your friends are the best supporters and this is a once in a lifetime chance(maybe) to see them again. Go hang out w friends by going to lunch, playing sports, chilling out, etc.

2. Prepare a set of tissues. No really. Prepare them even at home or at school with Covid. I am not saying you should cry but tbh in all O level and A level experiences, there will always be joys and tears of sorrow. So do offer anyone a pat in the back, some tissues and encouragement to those who did not make it.

3. As nervous as you are, do listen out any ""before hand"" assemblies which talks about the JAE procedure. And do take note that yes, in your JAE booklet and you flip to the last few pages, you will see scholarships like ECDA, SG:D and HomeTeam scholarships for poly diploma. (This is for those complaining about poly school fees.) 

4. If need to, do find a career counsellor if you are still lost in finding a path you want to go to. Esp those who did not make it to the dream courses. And if still dont know, just go to open houses. 

5. If your grades are private to you, it is ok to not show them. Yes, even those which are damn good one. Trust me, if you are legit not comfortable to show them and they keep pestering you, give them a middle finger.

6. Before leaving the house, be mentally prepared and make a plan B of school choices. For those who did not make it, use plan B. If plan B fails, continue searching, especially ITE diplomas, private diplomas or retaking O levels. For those who suffer from stress or mental illnesses, go and see a psychiatrist and/or call any hotlines for mental health. For those whose parents will get mad and angry and do stuff, I cannot help you but do consider your friends. Go and sleepover with them if need to and seek for help. I cant advise on this one but figure out your next plan of action.

* After receiving O level results 

1. ""Idk what CCA to choose""

There are CCA fairs and school websites do talk about ccas. And also do talk to your seniors/OGLs(Orientation grp leaders) for cca/academic advice on some ccas for more info.

2. ""I feel like I cannot make friends.""

Well honestly, it depends but the chances of you having friends will be higher if you try talking to them and hanging out with them. Do try and make peers with positive peer influence and if your attitude needs to be changed(e.g. throwing insults or being too extrovertedly scary/overwhelming), do change it accordingly. And even if you cannot make friends, friends arent really a priority conpared to academics but do make friends for the right reasons such as having someone to talk to and make life easier.

3. ""I am from JC and I want to drop to poly and vice versa""

Ok this one I legit dont know but maybe moe hotline centre can help. Someone pls do advice about this in the comments.

4. ""I regret this course. So hard....:(""

There are two options. Adjust your study schedule accordingly or drop to another course. I would not recommend dropping out but rather adjusting your study methods and holding on to the stress. As much as mental health is important, pls dont give up, especially if you are interested in this sector. For poly students, do drop out of cca if need to and for jc students, try to limit yourself to 1 CCA unless you can handle more. Eat healthily and don't sleep late. And for my JC students, do start revising early, eventually it will take shape.

Anyways, I hope this is helpful and for any mistakes, pls comment down. And I wish you best of luck for O levels and your future.

132,hmn6qy,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,chaotarroo,False,public,,PAP's greatest fear and why you should vote for opposition(even if the ones in your area are hopeless),"I was planning to keep mum during this election period but the amount of shit show that transpired over the past 2 weeks had made it really difficult. I feel that the majority of Singaporeans don’t understand how the PAP thinks and operates. They are completely missing the big picture of why you should be voting against them if you want a better Singapore for Singaporeans.

Like a broken looping cassette, opposition parties have been using the soundbite of “checks and balances” as the primary reason for why should vote for them; to get them into parliament. They’re not wrong. Having opposition MPs ask hard questions in parliament is one of many ways to hold the PAP accountable for their decisions. But in my opinion, that isn’t very effective. After all, as long as the PAP has the supermajority in the parliament, they can still defer all opposition concerns and bulldoze any bills they want to or change the constitution as they wish. And let’s not kid ourselves, PAP will in all likelihood have an overwhelming majority in the parliament again. It is actually the side effect of voting for opposition that truly keeps the PAP in check, which is making them feel like they could lose support and power anytime.

Let me explain my rationale. 

The PAP has always been a center right pro capitalism party that frowns upon the notion of a welfare state. From early 2000s to 2011, Singapore was full on chasing for GDP growth. Property prices spiralling out of control, influx of foreign workforce was at its highest and PRs/Citizenships were being given out like freebies. But after Singaporeans expressed their unhappiness at the polls of GE2011, giving them only 60% of popular votes, things changed rapidly.

In the next 5 years, these policies were rolled out

- Property cooling measures were introduced less than half a year after GE 2011. This prevented investors from speculating the market, housing prices were immediately controlled at the expense of our GDP.
- Annual budget allocated for social transfers it's biggest jump from 2011 to 2015. For comparison, from 2008 to 2011, budget for social transfers to individuals increased about 45%(from 1.1 to 1.6billion). From 2011 to 2015, it increased by about 210%(1.6 to 3.3billion). In terms of progressive increment, that’s a 450% difference between these two periods.
- Pioneer generation package was launched in 2014, this eased up medical bills for the elderlies.
- Silver support scheme was announced in 2014 and eventually enacted in 2015. This is essentially a quarterly pension scheme for elderlies living in poverty, something which was frowned on by the PAP in the past.
- A sharp decline in foreign work force intake. It declined from 77k to 26k per annum between 2011-2015. Remember how we were constantly told to ‘bite the bullet’ for economic growth regarding foreigners in the late 2010s?
- Decline in total PRs granted. From 2008 to 2011 we granted an average of 50k PR year after year. From 2011 onwards, it's about 30k

During these 5 years, the PAP introduced more social policies aimed at helping Singaporeans than in any other period. I cannot help but to make a connection between PAP’s fear of losing power and the introduction of these policies to appease Singaporeans. 

Now, imagine a world where PAP had 80% of the mandate in GE2011. Meaning there're no feedbacks on the terrible job they're doing and no fear of losing power. Today, every other HDB resale transaction would be a million dollars, our population would be more than 6 million with 50% foreigners and even more elderlies would be on the streets scrapping for cardboards. These are all very real possibilities in that world.

It’s also interesting to see how GE2011 is the only time the government publicly admitted their mistakes and apologised for it. ""If we didn't get it right, I'm sorry. But we will try better the next time”, these words by LHL were printed in 4 languages across all forms of state media just 3 days before polling day in GE2011. Why did he say it? Because he genuinely felt so? Probably not. Those words were not said out of concern but out of fear. The fear of losing power. So if you want to see more instances of PAP eating their humble pie, vote for opposition. 

If you're keen on alleviating elderly poverty, improving social mobility, maintaining our current population size and having more policies aimed at helping average Singaporeans, voting for opposition parties is also a great way to do it. Opposition parties don’t even have to get into parliament for these things to happen. As long as the PAP is in constant fear of losing power, every decision they make in the next 5 years will be like walking on egg shells. That way, they'll automatically start caring more about the people. Conversely, if PAP is given too much power, they will start introducing policies that are hard to swallow and tell Singaporeans to ‘bite the bullet’ again.

Similarly, on the topic of power, ask yourself, why did the PAP call for an election during the COVID-19 pandemic when they know that campaigning will no doubt increase the likelihood of community spread? Is this the right thing to do for a government that cares about its people? Or was it a politically motivated move right after giving out 90 billion dollars in packages from our reserves and seeing it as an opportune moment to make use of the fear of COVID-19 to garner votes. Ask yourself, what made the government issue out 17 POFMA notices to political opponents in the past 5 days. Are all those notices truly in the interest of Singapore or was it just an election manoeuvre to discredit political opponents? Ask yourself, was the amendment of the constitution just before PE2017 a move to benefit Singapore, or was it just to elect someone within the party so they could entrench themselves with even more power? 

The PAP is a reasonably competent government and I dare say 70% of their members(definitely not all) wants the best for Singapore. Opposition is currently not ready to form the government and PAP should continue to be so. Having said that, after being in power for more than 50 years, it’s inevitable for them to lose focus and sway their interest from servicing Singaporeans to keeping their inner circle of friends and families(I don’t even want to go into how bad cronyism is in our GLCs and Stat boards) powerful in perpetuity. If you want them to keep their focus on the former and not the latter, it’s VERY important that we DO NOT give them the overwhelming mandate that they are looking for this coming Friday. If their popular vote exceeds 75% this GE, you’ll can surely expect more arrogance from them for the next 5 years.

Please vote wisely.

If you found this compelling, please considering sharing it with any of your friends and family that might be swing voters. The ground is very very very sweet for PAP now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they manage to secure all 93 seats with more than 75% of popular votes come Friday. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr: Want the government to be more accountable for their actions and decisions? Don’t give them the overwhelming mandate they are looking for. Make them fear that they could lose power anytime. That’s the only way to guarantee they will work harder and do better for Singapore and Singaporeans.

Edit 1. Please stop gilding me! Donate to your favourite opposition party instead if you want them to grow stronger the next GE!

I personally like WP. [Link to their donation page](https://www.wp.sg/donate/).

Edit 2. I may have been overly critical about PAP in my post. So here’s a more balanced view. I don’t think that the PAP did badly in the past 5 years. They did introduce some more left leaning policies during this period as well despite having 70% of the vote in 2015. On top of my mind

- Merdeka generation package
- Chas card
- Increase in compare assistance 
- Reform to education. No streaming, banded subjects(I love this!)

However these screw ups alone is enough to make me vote for opposition

- Failing to control COVID-19 and being completely unapologetic about it
- Calling for election when we're still in the midst of a pandemic before it's favours for them(this one super WTF)
- PE2017
- Abusing POFMA
- Gutter politics leading up to and during GE

On top of the screw up list, I also stand by my point about PAP having a slew of unpopular policies that they are just waiting to roll out whenever they feel ground sentiment is favourable. 

I think that as voters we should vote alone pragmatic lines and not idealistic ones. Overall, I actually like PAP as a party. If not for their obsession with power at all cost, I will probably vote for them every GE(unless WP contest at my area, I think they are the reasoned opposition voice that SG needs. I read their manifesto several times and liked many things in it. I will love to seem them form a coalition with PAP in the next 20~30yrs). 

But this trend of passing bills that essentially make ministers the arbiters of truth and changing of the constitution to entrench themselves with more power is just worrying to me. In the long term run, I feel this is detrimental for Singapore’s political and social growth. For these reasons alone, I cannot vote for them in good faith. I feel like I am just giving them more power that they absolutely do not need if I do so.

If PAP truly believes in the quality of their candidates they should considering levelling the playing field(no GRC, set election date and set voting district at least 1yr ahead of election), be more gracious with their brand of politics(less mudslinging) and be willing to stand up to fair competition. I strongly feel that they will be able to win more votes from the swing voters if they do so. It's only normal to like the underdog and hate the bully.

Edit 3 - I was wrong about the opposition wipeout! But I'm very happy to be wrong. Thank you for voting. See you 5 years later!",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hmn6qy/paps_greatest_fear_and_why_you_should_vote_for/,466,2131,13,2131,0.89,Tue Jul  7 11:50:33 2020,Political - Opinion

134,hrorgl,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,momochan14,False,public,,[Trigger Warning] Singaporeans who fell through the cracks of society... How are you now?,"**Economic downturn is here and more Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. I hope we can share our experiences with each other.**

**Here goes my story...**

Ever since early 2000s, my family struggled financially after my father was retrenched, due to the economic downturn. No companies wanted to hire him, despite his experience and capabilities, because he was deemed too old (in his 50s) and over-qualified for junior roles, couldn't even get past the recruiters.

After my father's start-up attempt failed, he took up any jobs possible that barely keep us afloat (Warehouse Executive in the day, Cook at fast food restaurant at night), because if he didn't, we would not be able to cover HDB loan, bills, debts and other expenses. He put up with the bullying from his boss (heavy workload, deducting his pay whenever something goes wrong) because he really needed the job. When he went to Social Services for financial help during the most desperate times, he recounted that the process was very demeaning and felt like a beggar. We got some financial aid, but it was far from enough.

Prior to that, I was blessed to have had resources (for enrichment classes, tuition etc..) for development, went to good schools and received good grades. As a result, my parents pinned high hopes on me that I would be the one to ""rescue"" the family, that kept them going during the difficult times. During the worst period, we nearly lost our home and had no money for our meals.

During my JC years, I was giving tuition to earn my pocket money. My parents didn't know I was struggling inside, I couldn't tell them, they had already crumbled under the immense pressure. They were miserable and started buying 4D, because they thought they could buy ""a hope"", they were happy only when they strike. I was crumbling under their heavy expectations, stress of going hungry, sense of shame from not having enough money to eat, maintaining my grades in a top JC. I was exhausted and had no one to confide in, even though I had people to hang out with.

I was falling into depression and couldn't absorb what I was studying. As expected, I didn't do well for the A levels, that sense of failure spiraled me further into depression. (I internalised the stigma of seeking therapy, because I thought the record would become an obstacle in my future, and if I hang in there, it would go away) My parents told me it was ok, but I know it's not from the way they behaved.

I refused to go down like that, I started working while my friends enter Uni. I thought I can save enough and pay for my own education (no one could be my guarantor for school loan), I was very clear about what my strengths are and what to study. I survived on less than $5 a day and enrolled in part-time degree after work. My mother would ask me for money for family expenses from time to time, I would give it to her to see her worry less. I was pushing myself very hard, lack of sleep and irregular meal times, my physical and mental health deteriorated. I went to Feiyue for free counselling service, the counsellor was kind but the only thing he could advice me, was to leave my family. It's impossible because I couldn't afford anymore financial burden to myself (rent. get my own household items etc..).

One day, my mother told me my father was going to get into big trouble, if I didn't help him pay off his debt. I didn't have the heart to let more misfortune befall him. I was totally crushed, that was my last straw. Even when I worked so hard to save, I couldn't study as I wanted, all my savings gone, just like that. I was very dejected and lived like a zombie, my parents said I should pull myself together and pressured me to do something productive.

>!I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just too overwhelming. I was standing by the window, almost ready to take a dive. My sibling pulled me off the window, we hugged and cried. I know I need professional help immediately (because if I don't, there is no future to talk about).!<

I went to the polyclinic and got a referral to see a psychiatrist at KTP Hospital, diagnosed with depression and given medication. Experience with my doctor was poor, he was uncaring and insensitive, but I carried on, took my medication because it worked for me. I asked if there was any support group I could join, he said ""nope"" and that was it.

I returned to work after I felt ready again. I had a hard time looking for a job, the recruiters questioning about the gaps in my resume, the tone as though there I did something wrong. I was especially afraid of a section on the form that required me to declare whether I have any mental illness. (thankfully this section is no longer around) When I finally found one, I cherished it and did my best, got praises and then the bullying from co-workers started. I hanged on and stood my ground, but gradually it took a toll on me, and my depression relapsed. I told myself that I have to fight the right battles in life, and I quit my job.

This break is the turning point in my life, as I started going for psychotherapy and working out issues that I had. **I strongly recommend anyone who is suffering from any trauma to seek therapy ASAP, don't bottle it up until it becomes debilitating, because the body keeps score and it will always win.**

I'm in recovery and felt better than before I had depression, with a newfound understanding of myself. I convinced my parents to seek help for gambling addiction, and the financial situation improved. I am very proud of them for doing that.

However, I'm struggling with fears of being asked about the gaps in my resume when I apply for jobs, how people feel about working with someone with mental illness. Now in my early 30s, my struggle is far from over, I have problem finding a sustainable job without degree, and now I also have to worry about my parents' medical bills. I want to love and marry someone, have my own family, but I don't think I can afford to do so (My bf of many years broke up with me because he saw no hope in my situation).

A very big part of my life revolved around my personal battles that I cannot put onto my resume to add value, and too afraid to tell others because I don't want to be labelled as a failure by societal standards, or that I'm trying to get sympathy. Life is about spending time with your loved ones, having enough food to eat, a place to stay, doing meaningful work. I still want to work towards it.

I don't know how the future will turn out for me, I'm lost now. I was unemployed before Covid-19 hit, and did part-time job on and off, now my source of part-time jobs is gone too. I don't dare to sign up for jobs that has a lot human contact, because I'm afraid of passing the virus to my 2 elderly parents. I am trying to self-learn digital design (through free courses), and now I heard market is bad.

My story has come a full circle, from one economic downturn to this one. Thank you for reading all the way here. It's going to be tough but I hope by sharing my story, you know you are not alone.

**UPDATE AND FOLLOW-UP PORTION**

Firstly, would like to thank all who commented. It gave me some much needed perspective which did help myself calm down. I haven’t made any concrete decisions but I have recollected my thoughts and started to evaluate my options. Some updates on things I brought up.

Anxiety - Some commenters got it spot on that my anxiety stems from the deployment role. It was scary as I’ve never had anxiety to that extent. Sure, after going through 3 years of weekly presentations in poly, I’ve certainly experienced nervousness before, but this was different. I almost felt like I was paralysed. Since then, I took some of your advice and found a way to decline the role. That certainly eased some of my worries

Long work hours - While the anxiety is a huge factor in my wanting to quit, it certainly isn’t the only one. I’ve felt it for a while but the 12-hour shifts is taking its toll on my mind and body. Insufficient sleep and time to exercise saw an increase in weight, which has never been an issue growing up, and recently, increase in blood pressure too. And due to the nature of the work, the long hours is also starting to affect my neck and back, which is worrying considering my age.

Bond - Ok I guess I failed to clarify that the bond is apparently just a year (I’m a little over two years now). They split the bond money into one big amount upon joining + smaller payouts that spread over three years. I would only need to pay anything back if I resigned before one year. The downside to quitting now is just missing out on the remaining smaller payouts. So I guess that’s another worry gone, not requiring to pay off the bond.

Uncertainty after quitting - I think at this point it’s a matter of when not if, whether I’m quitting or not. However, I want to plan ahead so as to not stagnate in unemployment, which has happened before. But I’m not really sure what I want to do or pursue, so it’s kinda overwhelming.

**UNEMPLOYMENT AND JOB HUNTING PORTION**

I guess to the main point of this post. For the first time, I’m (about to be) unemployed with no real clue or confidence in where I’m going. I know it’s not uncommon to be job hunting but I’ve always followed people around since entering the workforce. After NS, I followed a cousin into the government sector. When I resigned from that, I followed a friend into the security sector. This time, I want to go into something on my own. But I don’t feel well-informed or well-equipped. I know there are resources but I’d just like to get some opinions from here. I have entertained some ideas but I’d love to get some advice or feedback.

Data Entry/Admin - This is honestly most likely a short-term thing. I just want a job with minimal interaction. I know this could be a pretty broad jobscope, some may involve a lot of interactions but I’m only looking for entry-level for this one. Just to get myself accustomed to office hours and office life. And also to still keep earning income.

Taking up courses/classes for design - I was made aware of MySkillsFuture and found some classes on softwares such as Photoshop, Illustrator etc. I am considering taking these and possibly try for a graphic design job. I have a diploma from a design course but am way out of touch with the industry. I certainly understand I’d have to start from zero but if there’s anyone who’s familiar with the job, what are some classes I could take to pursue this line ?

Model-making ? - Again, if anyone reading this is in the design industry or familiar with it, are there jobs specifically to make models, as in for buildings or interiors. Model-making was something I enjoyed and was generally good at in Poly but I never even thought if there was an actual job for it. I was also a social hermit back then so I never really keep in contact with anyone who could possibly be in the industry now to help.

IT/Programming - This is actually something that came up when talking with my friends. With the world now so reliant on gadgets, computers, internet etc., it would be good to be proficient in IT. But I’m totally clueless about this tbh and I’d probably need to go back to school to get a good grip on it. Which I’m not against if I was financially comfortable. So maybe in the future.

CareerTrial - I’ve also been made aware of this but have not much info about it. Anyone know how exactly is the process or how effective it is ? I even saw some graphic designer positions, but do they really take in totally untrained and inexperienced people ?

Enjoy/Relax ? - Or maybe take a month or two just enjoying not having to go to work or having commitments. This would clear up so much time for me to start getting active again. Also, I would like to watch my shows/ playing games without the dread of going to work the next day. But I am aware that I’m prone to prolonging this period of unemployment. Not to mention, with no income, I probably have to dip into my personal savings, which does slightly irk me.

If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening (or reading). This month has been so exhausting and stressful to me, which is worrying cos nothing particularly life-changing or terrible happened. The previous post that I mentioned, helped a lot in that the comments gave me perspective and a degree of assurance in my anxious times.

I truly appreciate any feedback or advice but like before, I am fully aware in the end, I need to make my own decisions.

It's really very discouraging as that was the module I really put in my all to understand. IT is my passion and I really hope I would take com sci as my degree.

Since my A level friends were applying to uni I decided to take a look as well. Most of them has received offers from NTU and even NUS. I really feel so worthless when I look at them, we're the same age and their futures seem so much better than mine. I can only blame myself for not working enough to get a good GPA. 

At this point I'm left with fyp and intern to try pull my grades up, since I'm remodding my fyp group is changed so it would be quite hard to work with people I just met. At best I score 4.0 for my next two sems, my CGPA would not go above 3.3. Should I still try and aim for a com sci course in uni? Or should I just start working after I graduate?

Is there any company that would be willing to take me even?

as the beginning of a levels draws nearer, and the anxiousness is setting in, ive decided to write this post to comfort myself, and to comfort those who need it. 

(insert your name), you have worked hard the past two years. the knowledge you have acquired through the sleepless nights, the early mornings, the consultations. the struggles you’ve had, getting extremely frustrated when you repeatedly just can’t seem to solve a question of a certain type, but was able to solve it after wrestling it and not caving in to the anger. you have indeed journeyed so far. 

(insert your name), you may feel like you have yet to cover all the content of the subject, yet may feel like you know nothing about the exam you are getting ready to take. but i wish to tell you that that is not true. everything you need is already inside of you. i repeat, everything you need is already inside of you! you just have to search a little in your brain which is overly cluttered with emotions now. a little digging, a little comforting, and the you will start to recall the information. but even if you do not/ can’t find it, don’t fret, move on buddy. 

(insert your name), for the next month to come, you will be engulfed with a tumultuous wave of emotions, feelings, unexplainable crying. but i want to tell you that it is ok. let it come, cry if you have to, be angry if you want to. release those emotions in you to relax your body. it is not healthy keeping it in. studied for 6 hrs straight but still feeling uncertain/ have yet to accomplish what you want to? brain clogged? GET UP! go for a walk. go for a run. go watch a funny video. go eat your favourite hawker dish. GET UP! stop worrying about your unfinished work. GET UP/ taking a break is not seen as being lazy, but an extremely important way to recalibrate your brain. you may be overwhelmed with guilt “oh i havent finish item 2,5,7,9 on my to-do list, i cant take a break yet!!!” but remember, our brain is a well-oiled machine, it needs to take regular breaks from overheating/ overwork. maintenance through self-care would allow this extremely beautiful machine to be sustained for a longer duration in the future. we are aiming for sustainability & consistency, not quantity. 

(insert your name), so my friend, you are ready. as much as you feel that you are not, trick yourself into thinking you are. the 50% of content you think you have, supplement it with 50% of confidence/ reassurance/ trust in your self. if you were to supplement the other 50% of fear/ lack of content/ have yet to finish studied all these topics/ self-doubt, you are going for war without your armour but only with the skills you have learnt during your training. so, arm your alter ego with confidence AND the skills you’ve acquired at your training. go in confident. do not show your enemy (the exam paper/ the examiner) your weakness, but the other 50% of strength you possess. 

all the best my brave warriors fighting this month long battle. you have worked hard, and you will be fine.✊🏻",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jl930i/a_levels_the_time_has_come/,19,447,10,447,0.99,Sat Oct 31 08:50:54 2020,A Levels :snoo:

141,jugpfb,r/nus,t5_2rfcw,21194,jojoyo1999,False,public,,"College is hard, and these are my struggles in NUS","I am going to say it. College sucks. The reason? My deteriorating mental health. In my freshmen year, I was consistently stressed out and overwhelmed by the academic pressure. My anxiety and distress were perpetuated by a highly competitive school environment. My only haven on campus was my dorm room, where I could cry freely away from prying eyes. I would experience multiple mental breakdowns within a week and my only source of comfort was advice from online threads. I did share my struggles with family and friends. However, they could not empathize with me because they were in different phases of life. Having almost no friends in college made it difficult to share my struggles openly as well.

&#x200B;

(I originally posted this article on my website, but I thought I would share it here. I want to reach out to fellow students who may feel the same way as I do, but do not have people that empathize with them.)

&#x200B;

Over the year, I realized that my emotions are valid. I cannot discount them just because the people around me do not understand how I feel. It was the lack of support in my freshmen year that empowered me to start my website. I wanted to create a space for struggling students like myself and reassure them that they are not alone.  We all doubt ourselves privately but believe that we are alone in thinking this way. It is because no one else really voiced their doubts. This article is meant to detail my struggles and how these struggles defined my college life.

&#x200B;

## Suffering from Imposter Syndrome (Believing I Did Not Deserve A Place in College)

Do you feel that you are not smart enough to be in college? Do you consistently compare yourself with the people around you? Do you feel like the only person who does not have their shit together? I admit that I am very guilty of all the above. Enrolling into NUS was a game-changer as I grew up attending neighborhood schools. Here, I am competing with students from better ranking schools and are from the cream of the crop. They were better prepared at managing the academic rigor of higher education. They too were more resourceful and adjusted faster to university. Despite coming from the same education system as them, I felt intimidated and under-equipped to manage this tricky situation.

&#x200B;

My self-esteem plummeted throughout my freshman year. I was consistently comparing myself to my peers. Many students were on gifted or scholarship programs, excelling in professional networking, participating in academic competitions, or holding a high committee position. Meanwhile, I had no other achievements that could supplement my portfolio. The demanding curriculum made it difficult to take on extra commitments because I needed time to study. My lack of time caused me to question my intelligence. Was it because I am not smart enough to comprehend concepts quickly? Was it because I am not good enough to in NUS? Maybe I should just accept the fact that I am a failure compared to my classmates. With each passing day, my mind would continue to spiral with these negative thoughts.

&#x200B;

Upon enrollment, I realized I was younger than most of my peers. Many people within the cohort were older due to various reasons. To add to my anxiety, my frantic mind assumed that my young age was a disadvantage. I started to nitpick on my mistakes. After all, experience in life comes with age. If I made a wrong decision, was it because of my lack of maturity? If I said or did the wrong things, was it because I am ignorant? This mindset affected my ability to perform in school. It was difficult to voice my ideas and opinions in group projects because I believed that I lacked wisdom and judgment. I had concluded that perhaps I should not even be in college.

&#x200B;

Every day, I felt that I did not deserve my place in NUS. It seemed like there are way more qualified individuals than myself, and I was accepted because I was lucky. Even if I performed well on a task in school, I would attribute it to hard work instead of my intelligence. There was a nagging doubt that I did not earn my accomplishments using my intellect. Self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy would continue to plague me for the majority of my freshmen year.

&#x200B;

In hindsight, I was likely suffering from imposter syndrome. It is said to occur among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success. This experience is common among individuals who are starting a new and challenging position. Imposter phenomenon is not a mental disorder. Instead, it is a reaction to external stimuli or events. Imposter syndrome is having the feeling of phoniness and believing that you will be found as a fraud. Instead of acknowledging my abilities, I often attributed my successes to external forces. When I am around schoolmates, I often fear that they would uncover my lack of abilities and expose my incompetence. Despite obtaining decent grades in school, I continued to doubt my capabilities. It seemed as though no threshold would put these feelings to rest.

&#x200B;

## How Did I Manage Imposter Syndrome?

Now, I believe that the first step to solving any problem is recognizing that there is a problem. It was in semester 2 of my freshman year when I started to recognize my unhealthy thought patterns. I had placed a large emphasis on success and achievements and was constantly under tremendous pressure to perform. After all, I wanted to make up for the perceived lack of capability between me and my peers. Constant comparison between myself and them, me nitpicking my failures and my feelings of inadequacy perpetuated the problem. How did I recognize that I was suffering from imposter syndrome? My father reminded me that the pressure I was under was created by only myself. It then dawned on me that perhaps, I was being too hard on myself. Then, I still could not name what I was feeling. The term imposter syndrome was introduced when I was in Year 2.

&#x200B;

Acknowledging the limitations of my competence and capabilities improved my mental health significantly. Previously, I was caught up in chasing the goals and expectations others had set for themselves. Whenever I fell short of those expectations, I was reminded of my ineptness. Coming to terms with the fact that I am just not as intelligent, talented, or capable as others have relieved the pressure to perform on the same level. Why was I stuck in the cycle of chasing expectations that were determined by other people? Should not I be comparing my achievements to my expectations? This realization broke the chains of despair that had been holding me back for the entire academic year. My academic progress was on track with the goals I had set, and I did not fall short of my expectations. I had been so caught up in the rat race that I forgot to ask myself why I was in it.

Do gauge where you stand in the cohort within the first few weeks of school. From there, decide whether you want to join the crazy study grind or take things easy. Reaching this decision early can help you to deal with the overwhelming stress and competition in college better. In NUS, there are also counseling services at the university counseling center. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the academic pressure, talking to a counselor or therapist may help you to cope better. Do note that there is a long wait time (about one month) for services at the counseling center.

&#x200B;

Remember that you are not to be defined by any assignment, exam, or GPA. You are bigger than that. We want the effort we put into studying to be validated, but this validation does not have to come from grades. It hurts when we do not get what we work hard for, but it does not mean that we will not be successful in the future.

&#x200B;

## Feeling Lonely in University

If asked to describe college, the word lonely is an unlikely adjective. After all, college is meant to be fun and exhilarating and the media reinforces this concept continuously. Like everyone else, I was excited to enroll in college and have the best time of my life. I was ready to drink, party, and make lifelong friends. I am young, in my prime, and ready to have fun. What could go wrong?

&#x200B;

I joined several freshmen orientation camps and met numerous people. My contact list grew longer and my followers on Instagram increased significantly. As the academic year started, I was kept busy for the first few weeks as I attended school fairs and welcome events. Eager to partake in the robust co-curricular activities my school had to offer, I joined several clubs. Yet, the enthusiasm and keenness started faded away fairly quickly before recess week.

Although I enjoyed myself during orientation, I never saw some of my orientation mates again. I also stopped talking to the friends I made because they already had friend groups from high school. I did not move away from home to attend college and many students in my college were the same. Yet, none of my friends were in the same college as me so I was alone.

&#x200B;

Moreover, I felt that the friends I made in college did not put in the same effort as I did to maintain the friendship. I presume that it is because they already have friends from high school. Friends in college seem to just hang out to have fun and they have no interest to get to know one another better. Friendships formed from project groups feel transactional as well. It feels like the friendship purely serves to facilitate good teamwork.

&#x200B;

It is depressing and demoralizing to witness so many people having their closest friends with them. Together, they can create memories while they experience the ups and downs of college. I cannot help but feel alienated from the very community I am in. It is the feeling that nobody is there for me when I want to socialize or hang out with someone. I have friends outside of school but the situation I am in perpetuates the feeling of loneliness. Moreover, freshmen year can be a breeding ground for Instagram posts. I would open my app and see uploads of people having fun and enjoying themselves. Although the posts may not reflect the emotions others feel all the time, it is still difficult to dissociate the feeling that others are having fun, but I am not.

&#x200B;

## How do I Cope with Loneliness?

I am learning to be comfortable alone and it is difficult. However, I do realize the slew of benefits that comes with being alone and I am trying my best to focus on the good. FOMO is real but I do not have to let it control my life. Being alone has nothing to do with my personality, my ability to make friends, or loving myself.

&#x200B;

I used to consume mindless entertainment or spend my time with fair-weathered friends whenever I felt lonely. These temporary comforts brought nothing but emotional unfulfillment. In hindsight, I deprived myself of precious self-reflection time. Clear answers and true internal reflection can only happen during a period of solitude with no distractions. Being alone gives me the time to better understand my thought process, understand myself, and regulate my emotions. Meanwhile, I now have the opportunity to create meaningful work and it has injected purpose into my life. I can see my loneliness for what it is instead; that I simply have time for myself to do or create what I want.

&#x200B;

There may be an expectation to meet your best friends at orientation and start school with a large group of friends. It is highly unrealistic, and it is perfectly okay if you did not find people you would vibe with. Real friends are hard to come by. That is why when we meet people we click with; we recognize that it is special and will sincerely work on the relationship.

&#x200B;

## Conclusion:

Although I cannot banish these feelings completely, I believe that we can have open conversations about the challenges students face in college. With increasing awareness of how common these experiences are, perhaps we can feel freer to be frank about our feelings and build confidence in simple truths. I am capable, I deserve to be in college, and it is okay to be alone.

Therefore I am offering my service as an experienced swimming coach for free for 8 adults (two teams of 4 to meet the COVID 19 requirements), who never learned to swim and now keen on learning. 

If you insist on paying, then I will donate the amount to a organisation of my choice. In my home country of Denmark, we are raised to contribute and volunteer in local community sports clubs; this is my little part in giving back to Singapore, my home for the past 6 years and counting. 


Only requirements:
-adult
-can’t swim, but want to learn 
-bringing own goggles, kick board and float “noddle”. 
-keen and dedicated 
-training twice per week for 30 min to one hour per session and willing to train at home if needed 
-sessions are evening and located in Novena (days to be determined)
-focus points: safety, water adjustment, floating to basic movement and balance 

About me:
Teacher at an international school in PE, mother tongue literature and social studies. 
Experienced coach - from baby swimmers to competition teams 
Currently head coach of school swim team 
Key philosophy; patience and trust

Update:
I am overwhelmed by the number of people reaching out. Learning to swim as an adult can be hard and I can not promise miracles, but I will do my very best.

Here are the days I suggest starting next week:
Tuesdays 
Team 1: 5 pm - 6 pm 
Team 2: 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm

Thursdays 
Team 1: 5 pm - 6 pm
Team 2: 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm

Since we are not allowed to post personal information, please contact me directly and state which day you want to join and briefly describe your confidence and experience with swimming. If you are among the first to sign up, you will be notified by me with more information. I am sorry if you do not hear from me - we are only allowed a small number and for safety reasons, I can only handle a small group at the time.

Update no 2
I am literally speechless. So many kind words and awards. I will reach out to all the ones who wrote me directly and try to accommodate. There seems to be a need for teams where adults can learn to swim without feeling stigmatised or being ashamed. I hope this can encourage more to seek out other coaches with adult classes.

Hi reddit,

Thank you for the amazing support this community has shown to me and my family. Since our last post, this story has gone on to Mothership, MustShareNews, Lianhe Wanbao, Shin Min, Channel 8 Digital News etc. and has reached more people than I even expected.

Although I have not managed to locate my aunt, I'd like to perhaps update you all on some information I've gained.

1. A member of the public has told me that during their stay in Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Oct 12 2019, they met an older Chinese lady who was in a bed next to theirs. They began chatting and this member of the public learnt that this older lady was also abandoned at the CHIJMES convent, and had a similar story with a possible age match. The older lady speaks very fluent English and from their guess, she might have been English educated (may not even know how to speak Chinese). Although the memories are a bit hazy, the older lady mentioned that she works in a church in Toa Payoh. Could I check with everyone here if anyone happens to also work in any church in Toa Payoh who might know someone that fits such a description? An auntie that was born in 1957, was in Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Oct 12 2019 for some heart issues? Unfortunately we do not know which church she is from.

2. I have tried to contact the Infant Jesus Home & Children's Centre, as well as a Sister Maria Lau (whom I was told to contact by a member of the public on Facebook). However, despite multiple emails, none have gotten back to me. Does anyone happen to have any contacts that they can provide? Thank you.

Thank you so much, the kindness and helpfulness I've received has been overwhelming.

- zero chance to learn hard skills on the job because actual job doesn’t require them unlike initial JD

What i want to do is to find the time and space to pivot into a new role, so i can avoid repeating above-mentioned problems. 

Coming from a humanities background and high workload/zero mind-share, signing up for courses seems impossible at the moment.

I am also working on managing myself and work expectations because such problems will follow me in the next job. But at the same time, i am looking to find a chance to get out of this skills-job gridlock. 

I have enough savings and minimal financial commitments to go income-less for 1 year. But i worry about a blank period on resume. If i do quit, i plan to busy myself with training courses. For last few months, i feel overwhelmed with the information and courses on job portals, skillsfuture and sgtraineeship.

We started off as friends then we upgraded our status to boyfriend and girlfriend. We were happy at first, we hangout once a week, holidays probably twice a week, texted everyday(Though i was dam tired to text everyday rather write letters lol kidding) We were happy honestly. The problems started to surface when we were dating for about 2 months. We were 'discovered' by our church members. And once we were 'discovered' rumours started to spread that we were together(yes we were). Both of us wanted to hide our status(including parents) and we agreed on lying to them(church members) when they asked about it. We were stressed and overwhelmed by it. Our agreement to lie about status fell. H decided to tell the truth and I decided to tell the lie. Yes, it was mess. Everything just fell apart from there. Whether it was lie or truth, rumours spins up like a crazy tornado into the sky in church. Everyone now knew something about it. Everytime, when i went to church i would always felt very jittery, scared for being judge and scared of people gossiping. I was just freaking out and nervous. No one cared about how i felt. I thought church is a safe place. I thought they would journey with me. H and I started to quarrel more often and often. I felt betrayed too because she always tell everything i say to her like my thoughts and stuff to her Best Friend(D). Why do u need tell D? Why?Why cant you keep to yourself? I was also stressed out by her too. She would example why u always sleep so early, why cannot sleep late and chat with me? ranting to me about her family members and friends example, you know that xxx so annoying sia even that ggg also dont like her. I need space to tell you about my life too! Unexpectedly O lvl was the least concern. Then we went for a 'break' then i thought it was a break up leh I thought break is like a easier way to say break up, D told me break and break up different, break is still together but not talking and break up means not together and not talking. idk ape ini honestly. Then, after a few days we began talking again and what we were back? But then, we started quarreling haiyo and going out and have fun yay again. The turning point was when i went to church just like any other day and suddenly like a few leaders decided to invite me for dinner. During the dinner, one of them was threatening me to remove (H) from leadership because of the rumours about (H) and I, he was basically telling us to break up. I was angry and confused. How could they do this to her? What am i going to do? I dont want (H) to lose like this leadership thingy in church and i still want the relationship. How? I couldnt turn to anyone for help. I discussed it with (H) about what we should do about it. She just replied IDK. I cant believe it man! And i told her my suggestion that we break up for a while and date next year? I mean love is more than just the status. Love is through actions. She said Okay. A few days later, oh wow I got this revelation from God that this relationship couldnt go on anymore and dont wait for me. I am like what?!! I was mad! I got blamed for breaking up by her friends and my close friends in church didnt support me too. My school friends dont know about it because i didnt tell them. But i still put on that freaking mask to school and church everytime, always happy go lucky, I didnt want anyone to know about it. I asked myself why me? why did such things happen to me? I come from a broken family too, only my mother and I, i just cant bring myself to telling her about it. I was all alone.

151,gabwp0,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,heartbrokenh95,False,public,,Abortion in Singapore - 2020,"Hi everyone, title says it all. I recently went through an abortion and I thought I'd write this down to pen down my thoughts and what I went through, and also to share this with women (and men even) who might be terrified and going through the same situation. **I'd like to clarify though, that I do not encourage abortion.** I'm just here to share the details on the whole procedure, should you have no other choice but to go for one. 

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was scared and confused. I immediately turned to online to seek for advice and to read up on stories and experiences of women who have went through abortion in Singapore. However abortion remains a taboo subject in Singapore and I couldn't find much information about the details of the procedure. I found some old stories on Reddit however, but most of these abortion posts are from years ago, and it made me wonder if the procedure is still the same now. I went ahead to the clinic not knowing what to expect. I was terrified. So here is my attempt at sharing my experience since this just happened today, and hopefully it'll benefit someone who has to go through this. 

I 99% confirmed my pregnancy on 18th April through a pregnancy test kit. My period has always been regular so when it was late for 4 days, I knew something was not right. I went down to the nearest 7-11 and bought a pregnancy kit (Predictor brand) and the result was a very very faint second line. It was so faint that I couldnt decide if it was just my imagination, or if it was really there. I prayed that it was just my imagination and went to sleep, hoping that I would wake up to my period. That did not happen, and I went down the next day to buy the Clearblue Digital Kit, which would tell me straight up if I was pregnant or not pregnant (so get this kit even tho it's slightlyyy more costly) No doubt, I was pregnant.

A long discussion happened between me and my partner. It was a very very painful and heartbreaking decision and for many nights I cried myself to sleep. 

During my first appointment, my gynae did an ultrasound and confirmed my pregnancy. Seeing that tiny dot on the screen broke my heart. I couldn't bear to look at the screen for more than a few seconds :( This circuit breaker also made everything tougher than it already was. My partner was not allowed into the clinic with me. I had to go through all of this alone but I guess in a way, it spared him some pain / heartbreak since he didn't get to see the ultrasound. The first appointment was a breeze. I was in the clinic for around 20 mins only. See the doctor, get an ultrasound, ask him any questions you have about the procedure, make payment and schedule my procedure. There was also some paperwork involved, I had to write down 3 lines: ""I wish to terminate this pregnancy. I do not want this pregnancy. I am aware of the risks involved."" Yikes.. :'( 

After payment, the nurse prescribed Misoprostol, a medication used to soften your cervix. I was told to take this 2 hours before my procedure so that my cervix would be ready for the surgery. (Side note: yes there are 2 types of abortion in Singapore, namely medical and surgical abortion. Medical abortion is where you rely on just pills to ""induce"" a miscarriage, but I've heard that it might be extremely painful, you will bleed alot, you might vomit and get chills, and since I stay with my family I didnt want to take this risk. There is also a risk that your uterus doesnt completely empty itself and you may then have to go back for surgical abortion again to vacumn everything out. Surgical abortion is done under sedation, and a vacumn is used to suck out the pregnancy sac. This would be way faster, and painless as well.) My procedure was scheduled for 2 days later at 930am. I was told to start fasting by 530am, and take misoprostol at 730am.

2 days later, (i.e this morning), I woke up at 7am and got ready. The pills were to be taken orally, placed under the tongue, and then i was to wait for it to be dissolved. It was tasteless, just very powdery and chalky. 30 mins after, I started developing a fever. I could feel my body burning up and I started trembling like maaaad. There were however no cramps and I was not bleeding as well. I got to the clinic at 9am and got my temperature taken. True enough I had a fever of 38.1 but they told me it was one of the side effects so it was ok. We made payment first before I was led to a room to put on a gown. This room had 3 beds in it and I believe it is for patients to rest in after the procedure. After changing into the gown, that was only when i felt the first gush of blood. 

I was then instructed to lie down on a bed while the nurse took my blood pressure and also monitored my heart rate through this clip on my finger. I could hear the machine beeping very fast because I was panicking so so bad, haha. I was also struggling to not cry and she must have sensed it because she was so reassuring. She then proceeded to prepare to inject the medicine into me through a butterfly needle to put me to sleep. Afterwards, I had zero recollection of what happened. It was around 940am when she injected the sedation meds into me, and when i woke up at 10am, i was already back in the resting room, lying on the bed with my belongings. No idea how i got back to the room, because while i was resting, i saw another girl being helped over by a nurse. I dont even remember walking back. Did they carry me?! No clue, but only 20 minutes had passed. I was a little groggy so i closed my eyes for another 5 mins before i got up to change and leave.

Reached the clinic at 9, left the clinic at 1015am, got home by 11am. Cramps were very very mild (I hope I dont jinx this), but I started bleeding. The bleeding however is very similar to period bleeding. I was also told to go back for a post-review 10 days later to make sure that my uterus is completely cleaned and there is no more pregnancy.

I paid $2,210 for everything and used $900 from medisave. 

I am still feeling very heartbroken and empty and I cant stand looking at myself in the mirror because i feel horrible. Sometimes I feel fine and try to understand why I made this decision, but sometimes I can't help to wonder about the what could have beens.

I hope this post helps anyone who has to go through an abortion. This has been the most traumatic experience in my life (emotionally) and I will remember it forever.

TL;DR - sharing my surgical abortion experience in Singapore.


EDIT: to clarify, we used contraception but there is no contraception that is 100% effective. my gynae has spoken to me more on the different types of contraceptives and their effectiveness, and I may consider an alternative method which is way more effective, but that will have to wait until I am fully recovered from the surgery. the most common contraceptive option used is still the male condom, but if you ever use it incorrectly, chances of the woman getting pregnant increases drastically. my gynae has recommended longer term options, such as a contraceptive implant, which is inserted under the arm to prevent ovulation. this lasts for 3 years. another alternative would be the IUD which is inserted into the uterus, this can last up till 5 years. 

**thank you everyone for reading and for your kind comments, and for standing up for me. I shared this in fear of attracting negative feedback but the support I've been receiving through both the comments & DMs have been overwhelming. thank you to all who have chosen to be kind in this trying period. i do not consider myself to be a heroine, just to clarify. going through an abortion is nothing to be proud of. the emotional torture that one has to go through - i wouldnt even wish this upon my worst enemy. this post is again, to give details on my abortion experience for anyone who may be online looking for help, advice or support, and to also remind all of us that there is no method of contraception that is 100% effective. low chance doesn't mean no chance, and especially if it's for a risk you're not prepared for, it's not worth taking.**

some people have also dm-ed me personally to share their stories and support and i appreciate that very much. please feel free to dm me if you need to talk, I'm all ears.


stay healthy always everyone. Just to reiterate - I do not encourage abortion. I just hope that if you're reading this and you are considering an abortion, please make sure you've given proper thought over it. At the end of the day, i just hope that you make a decision that you can live with.

152,kcti0x,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,sgtransitevolution,False,public,,[Poly] [JC] Poly to JC AMA + Survival Guide,"TLDR: If you miss mugging and hate projects, go JC.

[Each year, 400 to 500 students make the switch from JC to poly, while merely 50 to 60 students do the reverse.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/switching-from-jc-to-polytechnic) Hence, those who may want to transfer from poly to JC may lack information on how to do so given how rare it is. Therefore, I'm starting an AMA for poly students who want to find out more about transferring to JC through the JAE. I will be replying to this thread until it eventually gets archived, and you can DM me your queries as well. But first, a few FAQs that I often received in my DMs, based on my experience. Do note that your transferring experience may differ from mine.

**How do you transfer from poly to JC?**

To start, let's split this process into two parts. Firstly, gaining admission to JC via JAE. Secondly, withdrawing from poly. Ideally, I recommend you to do it in order so that you won't be stuck in a place where you have no school to go to. You can also choose to forgo the second part and stay in JC and poly at the same time, but beyond a few weeks, attendance will tank, and you won't do well, of course.

Firstly, gaining admission to JC via JAE. Read page (iv) of the 2021 [JAE booklet](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/uploads/2021-JAE-Information-Booklet.pdf) for details on what exactly you should do, since your circumstances may be different from mine. For me, I took a few O-Level subjects as a private candidate, so I used my JAE PIN to log in. If you didn't take any subjects as a private candidate, you can still log in to the JAE system through SingPass, and apply using your previous year's O-Level subjects. If you are not applying through SingPass or didn't take O-Levels, the process is more tricky and beyond my scope of knowledge, so refer to the flowchart in the booklet above for more information. As for the JAE portal where you apply for your 12 choices, [this is likely how the portal will look.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAUla41WVfcxOrNl1HTNMPCYoM7tDIfA/view?usp=sharing) Choose your schools pragmatically and realistically based on past-year JC cutoff points. I have been posted to poly in some previous year, so I cannot select any poly courses and can only choose between JC and ITE options.

Secondly, withdrawing from poly. Consult your poly mentor about it, as I believe the withdrawal process may be different depending on the school you are in. There will likely be a withdrawal form which you should fill in advance, and it probably requires your parents' signature. I recommend arranging your withdrawal meetup with your course mentor a few days after the start of orientation, once you are comfortable with your new environment. For me, the withdrawal process was quick and finished in only 20 minutes, where my mentor helped to complete some course counselling form to ensure that I am dropping out for the right reasons. I just had to submit the withdrawal form, a printed screenshot of the JAE posting SMS, and my poly access card and was gone for good. However, the process may be different depending on whichever faculty or polytechnic you are in, and your parents may need to come down, though my parents did not come to the school for my case.

**Is it worth it to transfer from poly to JC?**

Well, that depends on your situation. For me, I had no regrets, and it was worth it. There are a few reasons why you should, and the same goes to why you shouldn't.

**Projects**

Sure, H1 Project Work is still a compulsory subject in JC. However, there are way fewer projects to handle than in poly. The project hell season can get debilitating to cope with at times as you rush stuff before the deadlines. Much of the grade is not only determined by how hard you work but the groupmates you choose or are assigned to. If you are drained out about trying to carry groupmates, and prefer to get assessed the more meritocratic way, where your work and yours alone determine your grades, JC is undoubtedly a better way to go.

**Academics**

By transferring to JC, you will likely be widening the possible options for your university education. Your grades are decided once and for all by a high stakes examination, rather than your cumulative regular performances. If you are aiming for a competitive university course, this could be a less stressful way of handling things, as you know that typical screw-ups during your time in JC do not count in your final grade like in poly. You have that room for improvement and screwing up. Subject contents are taught in a more rigorous manner, which means that while you have to apply what you learn to a higher level in JC, you also get to be more familiar with such concepts. Since there is a strictly defined syllabus that is publicly available of [SEAB website](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level/a-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2021) for you to look at, there may be fewer things to learn; you don't have to worry about learning beyond the syllabus since it will not be tested. From my experience in poly, some higher-level contents are often taught without understanding the fundamentals, making things overwhelming. This may mean that when you go to JC, some content may feel familiar, and some parts of a subject may, surprisingly, be easy for you.

**Money**

For me, the transfer was worth it because it saved my parents money, and it saved me time. Unless you as a poly student are aiming for RI, HCI, ACSI, or SJI, in which case school fees would be more expensive, the transfer from poly to JC would mean a much lower school fee, from [$250 a month](https://www.np.edu.sg/admissions/Pages/coursefees.aspx) to [$33 a month](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-university). That's a lot of money saved, and during this pandemic-induced financial crisis, it could lift a huge burden off your parent's shoulders if you are not on a bursary. If you are on a bursary, well, you likely wouldn't have to pay it back, fortunately.

**Time**

As for time saved, going to JC means that you will graduate from this education level about 4 months before your poly friends do. For boys, your NS deferment ends 4 months earlier (from April to December the previous year). Of course, they have a certificate that makes them employable, while you only have one for university, but if the goal is to get to university, it can be worth it. Naysayers will nag over the wasted $3000 you spent in poly, and that you took 1 additional year to finish JC education, but compared to your current situation, you might still be better off. If you have traditional Asian parents, well that may potentially be that one thing that they could brag about at the next reunion dinner.

**Environment**

It is worth acknowledging that, given the lower school fees, the JC environment will not be as excellent as what poly has to offer. There should be air-conditioning in your classrooms, so that is going to be a step up from secondary school, but your canteens will not have air-conditioning, which may be a factor which you should take note of since polytechnic food courts have such air-conditioning. For my JC, the library is much smaller than the one from my poly. It is probably unable to handle the large populations of students, and worse still, is currently closed off as a makeshift staff room for teachers, so there isn't a conducive, air-conditioned space to study.

**Commitment**

Of course, do not go into JC with the thinking that it is easier than in poly and you can slack off. I mean, teachers do chase after students for homework in JC, unlike in poly where you get worse grades. However, much of the non-tutorial work comes in optional revision sets. It is in your best interest to do them if you want to maintain a consistent, exemplary performance so that you will not struggle later on in your JC life, or risk being in the 5% of the cohort who retains, since you would've already ""retained"" once. Assuming you make full use of the JC experience, the mix of CCAs and other non-academic stuff like internships will keep you occupied during the much-shorter school holidays. Hence, there's a lot less time for you to pursue leisure during the holidays as compared to in poly, where you can easily find time to work and let your brain rot. 

**Readiness**

Finally, it would be best if you read through the syllabi of the subject combination you intend to take beforehand, to make sure you will enjoy what you will be studying so that you will not suffer in JC. Maybe leverage off the content you learn in poly, and take some subjects that have the content overlap, so that you have a more comfortable life coping with the JC curriculum. You should also ask yourself if you enjoy the JC kind of mugging and writing, and have the motivation to do consistently throughout these two years so that you will be better off than staying in poly. Otherwise, this transfer from poly to JC will probably not be worth it.

**I've spent one year in poly and forgot all my O-Levels stuff already. Can I still do well in JC?**

Yes, you can still do well in JC. For me, I've done pretty well in all my subjects for promotional examinations, with around half my subjects scoring As, and half my subjects scoring Bs – good enough for me to qualify for an H3 subject. Of course, I wouldn't know for sure until I get my A-Levels results, so I got to stay consistent with my studies. Anyways, even if you haven't touched your O-Levels fundamentals for a year, with enough effort, a consistent motivation to study, and a thoughtful selection of subject combinations, you can do well in JC. Just make sure you understand whatever that is taught by the time your tutorials finished so that you will not suffer later on as the content builds upon what was taught previously.

SINGAPORE: Unhappy at his son-in-law for cheating on his daughter and forcing him out of the company, a man took a knife to meet the younger man and stabbed him in broad daylight at a coffee shop, later telling passers-by not to help him but let him die.

Tan Nam Seng, now 72, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Aug 20) to one count of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by stabbing 38-year-old Spencer Tuppani at 121 Telok Ayer Street in July 2017.

Tan was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time, ruminating overwhelmingly about the well-being of his daughter and having his mental responsibility for the killing significantly impaired, the prosecution said.

The court heard that Tan was semi-retired at the time of the offence. He had founded a port management services company TNS Shipping in 1974 and expanded it over the years in a family-run business that saw his three daughters working for him.

After Mr Tuppani married Tan's eldest daughter in 2005, he began working for Tan as well in one of the companies. 

The company did not perform well for four years from 2012, and when business improved in 2016, Mr Tuppani suggested selling it to a bigger corporation. Tan left the sale to his son-in-law as he was contemplating retirement.

Leading up to the sale, Mr Tuppani persuaded some of the shareholders including his wife and the accused to assign their shares to him to boost his stake in the company, so the buyer of the company would not have control of it.

They agreed and the sale went through, with Mr Tuppani appointed CEO of the firm in December 2016. However, Tan was unhappy as he received only about S$450,000 from the sale of his shares.

**VICTIM HAD AFFAIR WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, HAD TWO KIDS WITH HER**

In early 2017, his daughter found out that Mr Tuppani had been having an affair with another woman and had two children from the affair. Mr Tuppani had three other kids with Tan's daughter.

They agreed to get a divorce, but still lived together in the same household as Tan, frequently quarrelling over issues linked to the split.

Subsequent events led Tan to believe that Mr Tuppani was planning to cheat him of his business, by divorcing his daughter after taking control of all the shares.

He began feeling miserable, ruminating excessively about his son-in-law's actions and was unable to sleep at night, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Jian Yi.

At around lunchtime on Jul 10, 2017, Tan went to the company's office at Cecil Court, and saw Mr Tuppani having a meal at a coffee shop at 121 Telok Ayer Street as he was driving past.

Angry that his son-in-law had been ignoring and avoiding his attempts to discuss business matters, which he considered disrespectful, Tan decided to confront the younger man.

He was shown in closed-circuit television footage, played in court on Thursday, entering the office and rummaging around in the pantry before retrieving a knife which he kept in his sling bag.

**THE STABBING**

He went to the coffee shop, where his son-in-law was having lunch with three friends. After Mr Tuppani greeted him, Tan confronted the younger man and said in Hokkien: ""You are too much.""

Tan swiftly took out the 22cm-long knife from his bag and stabbed Mr Tuppani three times in quick succession, as seen in clips played in court. His daughter was in the public gallery, dressed in black.

Mr Tuppani ran towards Boon Tat Street while pursued by his father-in-law. He was shown stumbling and getting up along a shop before collapsing.   


Tan appeared soon after and stood over him. He stopped employees of the restaurant where his son-in-law had collapsed in front of, from helping the victim.

He pushed them away, saying: ""This is my son-in-law, don't help him, let him die.""

The passers-by were shown walking away, and when other passers-by tried to help, Tan told them to ""stay away"", saying: ""He has come here to die"" and ""I wish to kill him"".

Tan was shown kicking his son-in-law's face twice as Mr Tuppani lay on the floor, before waiting for the police to arrive.

While waiting, he called his daughter and told her he had stabbed the younger man thrice.

He said: ""I can't sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don't cry. I am old already. I am not scared (of) going to jail.""

His daughter cried over the phone and told her father not to do anything, but Tan replied: ""What's done cannot be undone.""

**ACCUSED WAS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER** 

The police arrived shortly after the stabbing and found Tan sitting calmly on a chair outside the restaurant with a blood-stained knife on a tray nearby and the victim lying motionless on the floor.

Tan told the police where the knife was and pointed to the victim, and said he had used the weapon on his son-in-law.

The victim was taken to hospital and pronounced dead soon after. Tan told the police in the car that he was unhappy with how the victim had mistreated his daughter, and added that he had tried approaching the victim a few times to sort things out, but things had not changed.

An autopsy found three stab wounds on the victim's shoulder and chest, with the cause of death certified as a perforating stab wound.

Tan was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and found to be suffering from major depressive disorder. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a major depressive episode.

""The accused’s pervasive dysphoric state, diminished ability to concentrate, negative cognition of helplessness, as well as overwhelming ruminations and worries about the well-being of his daughters would have adversely affected his impulse control and judgment at the time of the alleged offence, and significantly impaired his mental responsibility for the alleged murder,"" said the IMH report.

Tan, who had lost a lot of weight since his charge for the original offence of murder three years ago, is represented by lawyer Wee Pan Lee.

The prosecution asked for an adjournment to prepare more submissions for sentencing, and was granted one.

Both sides will return at a later date for sentencing.

For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Tan could be jailed for life. He cannot be caned as he is above 50.

I did not expect this to get so popular but this only makes me more certain that there is a need for more discussion knowledge with regards to jobs related topics! I'll be penning down more random thoughts of mine jobs wise in near future! 

Hello my fellow redditors (again!) I've noticed that there has been many posts on career advices, career paths, career interests, specialisations so far but there has not been as many discussion/posts with regards to job interviews.

***Imagine this.*** You've studied hard, studied smart, burnt all that midnight oil, squeezed every bit of brain juice out of you to achieve your final grades and graduate. And then what? You start looking for jobs and you realise that it is not straight forward as you imagine it to be. That there are no model answers for you to refer to when it comes to your job interview.

The question then is how do you sell yourself to a potential employer and make them really see what you are worth? Imagine that you are a good plate of Nasi Lemak. You know you are really delicious and yummy and people would love you. BUT people are not flocking to eat you not because you taste awful, but because you've not packaged yourself to the best of your true potential. With the right packaging, you could be a $15 restaurant quality Nasi Lemak and stand out from the rest of your Nasi Lemak peers who are averaging $3-$5.

That is what I'm trying to raise awareness about with my series of random jobs related post. And today I'm sharing something basic that most of you would have heard/know of but often forget to apply in job interviews.

When applying for jobs, you **NEED** to give examples if you can; it's one thing saying ""I would do ..."" but it's much more impactful to say ""I did ..."". (**think about it: would you prefer to board the plane being helmed by someone who would fly it vs someone who did fly it before?**)

Using this simple technique, your job interview hit rates have just been given a boost (Hooray?)

I'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help if you've been finding that you haven't been having much success so far.

A simple template to use could be **C.A.R (CONTEXT-  ACTION - RESULT)** or **S.T.A.R (SITUATION - TASK - ACTION - RESULT)**

Now let's see an example.

>Question: ""What is your approach to dealing with conflict resolution?""  
>  
>Answer:  
>  
>**Context**: ""Working as a  student receptionist at my school's office after classes, I recall a time where a student came in really aggressive and angry because his school fees was not processed on time.""  
>  
>**Action**: ""I looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so.""  
>  
>**Result**: ""The student left happy, came back with the right documents and was happy knowing his payment would be processed correctly this time."".

This works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.

Follow the advice above - figure out what skills and life experiences you have that would make you an excellent engineer/analyst/graphics designer/writer/doctor/teacher/any role you are applying for really.

Also, do a search on the common interview questions for said position - after looking at a few lists, you should get a pretty general sense of what you might be asked. They might also ask you to tell them about yourself, or what are your greatest strengths / weaknesses or other universal questions.

Write out the answers

***Memorize, memorize, memorize and/or practice, practice, practice***

With maybe 10-15 good ""answers"" ingrained in you, you should be in pretty good shape to answer most things that get thrown at you. If the question doesn't quite match your answer, then rephrase it and answer your question accordingly. Adaptation is the key here.

Figure out several good questions to ask the interviewer and memorize those too, and you should be good to go. (This is another post for another day!)

Don't forget to know at least a little bit about what the company does, and what sorts of things you might be expected to do and who would you be interacting with on a daily basis.

Also, treat it like a first date - you are clean, well groomed, wearing appropriate clothing (dress up a notch if in doubt), be polite and on your best behavior. Relate, if possible, to the interviewer.

Otherwise, it is usually just a conversation - they ask questions, you answer, then you will get a chance to ask a few questions too.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional career coach nor do I make money from this. A lot of this is from my personal experience/observations so far in my career that I have found incredibly helpful for me. Coming as an average student (barely average admittedly), I had to find ways to market myself better than the others and get the attention of employers.

162,j7uyz0,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,p0lymerasechainrxn,False,public,,[Rant] Withdrawing from JC might be my biggest regret,"
This is going to be all over the place because, well, I am all over the place as well ha so I apologise for any brain cells that you may lose after reading my rant. 

Basically, I withdrew from jc just weeks in, without giving myself time to adjust and let fear drive me away. I’m in poly now, just floating in a sea inferiority. 

Poly life for me is like drinking lukewarm water. The difficult and stressful times are then like eating something so spicy you don’t taste anything anymore. All you feel is your tongue burning, no flavor, nothing, just a one dimensional feeling. That’s it. That’s all I’ve been feeling for the past three semesters and there’s no in between.

I’ve come to realise that in poly I haven’t gotten the chance to actually fully spread my wings and take that leap of faith to try and fly, and to be very honest, I don’t think I ever will. Sure, if I can’t try to fly then I probably won’t ever fall and land on my face but is that really what I want? Do I really just want to stay stagnant and not grow from failure? (Sounds ironic because I guess you could say this whole rant describes my one big failure.) My journey in poly is half over and yet I still feel unfulfilled academically and holistically. I can’t seem to find any opportunities to grow and develop myself into a better me or push me to be the best version of myself which was readily available in the jc I was in. In addition, despite paying 1.5k a semester, I also feel like the resources we get are lacking more often than not. I feel so insecure even when poly is supposed to be more specialised in the sense that you learn stuff about the field you’ve chosen a lot more in depth than you could’ve in jc. But nope. I feel like everything single thing I learn is so haphazard and incomplete. It’s like yeah we may know a lot but it’s all surface knowledge and definitely not enough to fully grasp or internalise the concepts. 

I always tell myself that hey you left jc to pursue something you wanted.(In hindsight, something I thought I wanted.) But, as explained above, yeah that’s just to make myself feel better. I honestly do not know if what I’ve learnt and will be learning in poly is worth missing out on all the other stuff I would’ve learnt if I stayed in jc. I also know deep down that the real reason I left was because I was terrified. I was a wuss who ran away the first chance I got. 

Also, no, I am in no way looking down on my fellow poly kids. Y’all are like amazing having to go through tons of submissions every semester no matter which school and course you’re in and especially last semester given HBL. Not to mention that whole cumulative gpa shit. One mishap and were basically dead. Screw anyone who tries to belittle you when you talk about how stressed you are and some elitist jc imbecile goes oh you haven’t experienced real stress because you aren’t taking A levels. 

I’m feeling all this just because I happened to see all my jc friends celebrating their grad day today. It’s like a reminder: hey this is what you could’ve experienced, what you would’ve experienced if you stood your ground, bit the bullet and stayed in jc. This was the community you could’ve been part of. This was the experience you deprived yourself of by running away. I wouldn’t say it’s fomo but fomo amplified exponentially. Every story I see of my jc friends is a constant reminder of everything I’ve missed out on just because I was scared in the beginning. All these experiences I’ve witnessed, both the good and the bad, I’ve never and probably will never experience where I am now and that sucks. Sure I have friends and I am so grateful for them. But they’re neither the kind of friends I had back in secondary school nor the type of friends I made in jc or those my friends have made. Seeing them sticking it out through thick and thin together makes me so glad that my friends are lucky enough to have such a strong support system that A levels have nothing on but also it makes me feel so regretful that that was the kind of community I gave up when I left my jc because no such system exists where I am now. The journey I’m going through in poly feels like a very lonely battle that I have to fight on my own without anyone to back me up or anyone to rely on. It gets kinda lonely. With all that, sometimes I just go: damn I really missed out on a lot huh. Of course, the grass is always greener on the other side but I really can’t help but feel this way. 

It probably sounds like I’m being a little bitch and complaining like a child. I can see that yes I understand so I’m not usually like this. It’s been months which is why I’d like to think I’ve gotten over everything and am only looking forward. It rarely rains I guess. I really kinda do feel dead inside. However, when it does rain, it pours. 

I know there’s no one else to blame but myself. I know that it’s no one else’s fault but my own. And I also know no one is harder on me about all this than myself which sucks. It really does suck that I beat myself up over and over again about the same thing even when it’s been months. I, more than anyone else, would like to just put everything that’s happened in the past but I can’t seem to. I try my very best to shove all these feelings down my throat and swallow it but ever so often I just throw it all back up, making a huge mess that I have to clean up. It’s one endless vicious cycle that I can’t escape. 

One good thing that came out from all of this is that when I realised I may have made a mistake, I tried to rectify it. Although that mistake wasn’t actually rectified, I take comfort in the fact that I already did try my best so no regrets about that. When I tell myself that however, it eventually leads to my brain saying well if you think about it you wouldn’t have had to rectify your mistake if you didn’t make the mistake in the first place. And we’re back to square one. 

As of now, I’d say withdrawing from jc might be my biggest regret. It has created such an overwhelming sense of inferiority in me that will probably follow me for the rest of my life. Praying and hoping that one day I get over it. 

So yeah that’s about it.

166,i2u9n3,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,tofucatmeow,False,public,,Help with mum's hoarding problem,"Hi, my first time posting in this reddit so please delete if this isn't allowed. I did a search, and 4 years ago someone posted about [her mum's hoarding problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/) and it sounds vaguely similar to my situation now. To give some background, my father and brother both passed away one after another within a span of a few years some years back. Since then, it's only left with my mother and I. Suddenly I was forced to become the breadwinner of the family and I was still barely a teen. After graduating from uni, I left to work overseas for a couple of years. But due to this pandemic, I decided to quit my job and now I'm finally back in Singapore. I had only came back to visit my mum once for a short period of time during those couple of years working abroad.

It has been 3 years since I last visited. Now that I am back, I am in shock of how much junk has piled up in the house. Before my father's and brother's death, she already had the tendency to cling onto stuff (e.g. keeping ""nice-looking"" boxes or bottles). But I think bereavement has triggered her hoarding tendencies to go into full force... She has kept a portion of my brother's belongings (e.g. bike, toys, cpu chassis), tables that my father used to use... and also stuff from my childhood (collections of all sorts like erasers, lettersets, notepads that I no longer want or need)... She also has a tons of clothes and other junk like empty boxes just piling up in the bedroom. She barely cooks and eats poorly, and doesn't do basic cleaning of the house (you can see dust on surfaces, hair on the floor etc)...

I am desperate to get rid of all these things and other furniture lying around that we no longer need/use (e.g. old piano). I don't mind just throwing them away but that isn't feasible since they are bulky items. I looked online and it costs quite a bit of money to get bulky items disposed of. I also can't do it alone and have no other friends or anyone to help me with the disposal and moving of heavy items. The house also isn't in good shape (e.g. she has to put plastic tape over the electrical switch so you won't get electrocuted when you touch it, the bedroom wall where the air con is supposed to be fitted is falling apart so rain seeps in, the kitchen cabinets are all yellowed and falling apart too..).

We are in a pretty bad shape financially since she has been unemployed and doesn't seem fit to work as she has underlying health conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure - taking medication for both)... Since I just returned to Singapore, I have not started looking for a job either. Part of why I worked abroad was I couldn't find a suitable job in Singapore. Before I left I had only worked for short periods of time, mostly as a part-timer.

I feel so overwhelmed right now. I am overwhelmed with guilt mostly because I neglected my mum for so long.. but I simply couldn't deal with living here after 2 close family members' deaths. I was close to her, but something in me snapped and I could not bring myself to communicate with my mum much anymore ever since. I just got back home yesterday and today I started cleaning this room but I cannot do it alone. I want to give us both a chance to start afresh but it is hard if our living condition is so horrible.

I guess my question is, are there any organisations or places I can reach to for help with my mum's hoarding problem? Do you know of any junk disposal service for hoarders or any cheap bulk item disposal service? Also, does anyone know who should I contact to repair that leaking wall in the bedroom? :( Please I need some support, tips, advice, etc!

167,k9n4zo,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,BunnanasS,False,public,,[Poly] Which diploma is best suited for anatomical sciences?,"Hi everyone! I really want to pursue a career in forensics or anatomy in the future and I’ve been quite overwhelmed with all the different applied science courses in poly.

To pursue a career in anatomical pathology in sg, I’m pretty sure we need to do a medical degree or a life sciences degree and then a vocational course by the various hospitals. But I was wondering if biomedical science is best suited for that path?

I understand that from biomed it is possible to study medicine in sg although I’m not really keen on studying medicine. If I wanted to pursue a career in pathology, would applied chemistry or pharmaceutical science be better since it is more specific in terms of immunology for pharm sci or would biomed be better since it’s more general? 

I’m already planning to put SP Biomed as my first choice but idk what to put for the others. I’m a bit unsure about NP Biomed since it’s more about bioinformatics and genetics while TP is Med Biotech. 

Seniors who are in Biomed/Pharm Sci/Applied Chem diplomas, could you share the job prospects and different paths for university education?

168,jucy1e,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,Bedok_Viewian,False,public,,[n level] [o level] how we approach elective geog,"What if I said, ""ei yo, screw making notes for geog, it's not an effective studying technique""

No, I am not insane/drunk/a psychopath. Hear me out

Disclaimer, the statement I claim is my view. With that said... 

Let me first ask, do you make notes by copy pasting the textbook content? Or do you make notes based on your understanding of the textbook?

If you're those who merely copy the textbook, then what is the difference between note and textbook? You might as well say that you copied the textbook, leaving out those pictures and questions in the textbook

Elective geog isn't simply memory work. Once you understand your content, all you need to do is to write out your answer based on what you understand, not memorised(except examples)

You're probably correct if your answer addresses the question. You might have heard of the term ""smoking"" and you can smoke for geog! As long your answer makes sense and addresses the question, there is nothing wrong with it 

Now, with that said, notes are useful **when** you're going to recap some topics that you might have forgotten

But hey, let's not forgot that geog isn't all about content, there's data analysis. Knowing what to write when describing/comparing data is important

Oh before I end off, don't be scared to include examples or points not in the textbook in your essay. Geography isn't like maths or science where you get penalised because ""it ain't in syllabus"", in fact the paper explicitly stated in the cover page that candidates should use relevant examples. 
No, you're not going to be penalised if you write about Copenhagen conference or Paris accord instead of the usual kyoto protocol. No you're not going to be penalised if you used Split, Croatia as an example for how local communities feeling overwhelmed due to surge of tourism(game of thrones was filmed at Split). No you're not going to be penalised for using an old ass example like the year without a summer in 1816 where Mount tambora erupted and caused a volcanic winter(A decrease in global temperature by 0.5 to 0.7°C)",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jucy1e/n_level_o_level_how_we_approach_elective_geog/,10,16,0,16,0.9,Sun Nov 15 08:53:37 2020,O Levels :snoo_simple_smile:
169,jk9l3t,r/nus,t5_2rfcw,21194,ihopethisisrational,False,public,,Petition : Cheat or Be Cheated -- Gradeless Option for NUS,"Hi everyone!

We're trying to get a petition for SUs this semester (or the academic year if online exams keep up) here  ([http://chng.it/dvv8dxbXxn](http://chng.it/dvv8dxbXxn)) because cheating is a real thing with e-exams.

We've copied-pasted the petition text below, please help support!

&#x200B;

COVID-19 has imposed extreme difficulties on learning and assessments for virtually every single course at all universities.

Internationals take exams at 3 in the morning. Labs and facilities are barred to cross-zone students. Cheating and ""in-class"" discussion are rampant in every exam. Both professors and students feel little to no learning is taking place.

The disease has eliminated almost every link between grades and actual effort or merit this semester. Scoring in exams has become a contest of who has the best cheating network rather than who has best learned the material. Students who try to play by the rules face ridiculous odds and disadvantages: Last year's top scores under proper exam conditions are below average today. If you don't cheat, the others will.

For any student who cares about their grades, the incentive to cheat is almost overwhelming. It follows insisting on strict letter grades this semester is an insult to learning and meritocratic principles.

Other universities know this. From Stanford University to Hong Kong University, colleges in both the East and West have concluded it's necessary to allow non-letter grading this semester and even for the full academic year. The incentives and disadvantages with strict online exams are just too strong to overcome.

Because of this, it's only fair to the students trying to be honest, and the professors trying to grade by effort and learning, to remove or provide the option to remove letter grades this semester or academic year. The alternative is we encourage students to cheat and professors to be indifferent to such dishonesty.

\[EDIT (to petition text)\]: To clarify, we mean no disrespect to the institution. We appreciate its efforts to convert courses to online and hybrid formats, and we recognise the university could not have anticipated all the problems in the current semester (we certainly didn't). We're open to alternatives should the university suggest them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/jk9l3t/petition_cheat_or_be_cheated_gradeless_option_for/,19,73,0,73,0.84,Thu Oct 29 21:01:25 2020,
170,jzjodv,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,snowtrumpet,False,public,,[Junior College] Temasek JC and my experience,"so I am quite new to this sub, but I was scrolling thru and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jypcbo/junior_college_tjc_temasek_jc/) by u/cheapfoolscap on TJC so I thought maybe I can also share my experience in TJC, both the bad and the good. Feel free to ask anything by replying, or u can dm me.

this post is quite long but i did some signposting so hopefully its better

I'm a J1 (2020) student in TJC, taking PCME. I came from IP so this is from 5 yrs of experience haha

**My personal thoughts (differs for everyone but heres mine):**

The best part about TJC is probably the people. Everyone is in general nice and approachable. Absolutely no bullying or discrimination/xenophobia. Most of the teachers are also helpful and try their best to help. You'll usually do well or ok in TJC as long as u put in enough work. But the students call it TJail for a reason. you'll hear a lot of complaining from the people here. In short the school and some departments makes terrible decisions that no one likes, and stresses us out. some parts of tjc look so worn down like it has not been fixed since 1977. a lot of good teachers are also leaving the school. for legal reasons i cant list specifics but yeah.

**Here's a more unbiased overview of everything:**

**TJC facilities**, also adding on to the post from cheapfoolscap:

1. **In general**, tjc hasnt rlly changed facility wise for 5 years, save for that one basketball court they built, ^(sometimes i wonder where the school budget is going). some of the rooms, esp the classrooms, container classes and theaterette will look a bit... worn down. you'll see a bit of vandalism here n there, broken chair broken table, dirty floor. you can see cockroaches, lizards, millipedes here but it's not a common occurence. can't rlly blame them for not fixing all the stuff cuz tj is rebuilding in 2022, but it might be surprising to u because frm outside the school rlly doesn't look that bad.
2. **Canteen:** canteen food is... depends on ur preference lah, but u can get tired of it. we have a western stall, fruit juice stall, drinks + snack stall, japanese stall, korean stall, malay stall, cai fan stall. the korean stall sells very nice mushrooms
3. **Cafe:** the cafe is probably one of the nicer looking locations in tjc.  the food in my honest opinion is meh, and their food quality went down slightly over the years. also the food costs more
4. **Aircon:** air con is... not a guarantee. originally, the rule was that the air con will only be turned on at 9.30am/10.30am for regular classes. but recently with covid and everything we are technically not supposed to turn it on for a full class.
5. **Physical activities:** if u like physical activities then tj has quite a bit of facilities. we have very big rock wall, adventure tower, zipline, bball court, tennis court, volleyball court. sadly u may not get to touch the rock wall n adventure tower n zipline in j1.
6. **Printing shop:** the school has a printing shop called ZAP. it can print a3, color, b&w, photocopy n pretty much anything. it used to be run by a very nice elderly couple (^(which the school sadly replaced :()), but is now run by a few aunties. however the printing service is not very reliable, smtimes the printers break down n the queues are smtimes vv long (esp when 1 whole cohort is printing the same assignment last minute).
7. **Bookshop:** the school has like a mini popular. they accept popular card. sells stationery, school uni and stuff.
8. **Counselling:** the school also has some counselling service, like career guidance (ECG), normal counselling. never visited either, but i heard mixed reviews about both.

**TJC culture**

1. **Fitting in:** In TJC, as long as youre nice, youre good. generally no bullying happens here, the people are all very nice (really) n chill, so as long as youre helpful, do ur part in grp work, nice, u shld find ur place here. dw about making friends also, its honestly quite easy here.
2. **IP vs JAE, elitism and favoritism:** Among students, no one really cares if ur from IP or JAE, or care abt ur L1R5. IP kids wont go n make distinctions between jae and ip, after all we're all from the same school now. while the IP kids will usually already have their set friend groups and people they hang out with, alot of us are still very open to making new friends, knowing new people etc. A very small number of teachers will show favoritism to IP kids though, some are more blatant abt it than others. Academically, there will not be much disparity between JAE and IP. In general both cohorts have the same ability to do extremely well or fail everything, it really depends on how hard u work. so dont stress that youll be ""dumber"" than ur ip counterparts.
3. **Competitiveness:** Not competitive except for a small portion. 90% of the school focus on doing well themselves, rather than comparing too much to other people n trying to be ""the best"". there are competitive people who are aiming for top scorer n stuff, but in general tjc is one of the less competitive jcs out there. we are less competitive than vjc if that matters
4. **Mass dance and cheering:** Mass dance n cheering are a major part of TJ culture. some people find it annoying, some don't, but basically for every school event you'll have to do them.
5. **Social Hierachy:** Doesn't exist here.
6. **Rules:** School has rules ofc. The normal ones like neat uniform, no piercing other than ear, neat hair n stuff. TJC has a system of demerit points, u start at 100 every year, and they cut away at ur points as u break sch rules (latecoming etc), and u will have to go for detention. Since there's covid and theres no morning assembly, theres no more uniform check n so enforcement of rules is a bit less strict now. however, some teachers are more anal abt the rules and will give u demerit points for everything.
7. **Relationships/Sexual Orientation:** TJC people r generally vry open minded,  so if u r scared that u will get judged or discriminated against for being lgbtq+, dw abt it cuz u won't. relationships are not uncommon, though try not to flaunt it too much bc some people from school administration (Principal) strongly discourage BGR n might intervene.
8. **TJC teachers:** They are generally very helpful and genuinely want to help u do well. Some are more likeable than others. Some have different teaching styles that may or may not work for u. Some are however, really not good and very unlikeable, and will make your experience very unpleasant. You may want to check with ur seniors or ip friends on which ones to avoid.
9. **TJC administrative body:** Honestly, they are very out of touch with the student body. sometimes makes dumb decisions that no one asked for.

**Studying @ TJC:**

1. **Workload:** Differs per subject, but if youre taking 4H2 expect quite a bit. Usually u r given 2 day deadlines (chemistry tutorial, math tutorial), or a week (econs essays, csq). it can get overwhelming, cuz some subjects will introduce new concepts and be more confusing (esp physics and chem). u will definitely need to take special care of ur mental health and work very hard.
2. **Facilities:** There's the library n cafe, or under lecture theatre. Plenty of spots to sit and study.
3. **Opportunities:** TJC does have programs that you can sign up for, as well as H3 subject options in JC 2. however, unless ur doing reasonably well in school, u wont get in. the school quite frankly doesnt offer u any external learning opportunities if u do badly academically.
4. **Promotion criteria and retaining**: In general, it is quite hard to get retained in TJC. you'll have to do very, very badly, like straight Us and Ss. to promote ull need 2H2 and 1H1 subject passes (E grade).

In conclusion, i wouldnt go as far as to say ""avoid tj"", but youll have to weigh the pros and cons if ur planning to come here. i personally made a lot of good friends and learnt new stuff, even though my experience at tjc isnt perfect. if u want a less competitive environment with nice people that can still help u get good results, then tjc might be the school for you.

I don't want this post to be too long so i'll stop here, but if u wanna ask any specific questions then feel free

I agree with some criticisms but feel others are barking up the wrong tree, so I would like to offer mine.

Disclaimer: This is based on my experiences in primary, secondary and JC, so it may be outdated (I am in my twenties) and if things have improved, I would love to know!

1. Emotional resilience: Our education system is obviously very stressful, but the real problem is that it fails to teach youths how to handle the stress. If well managed, stress can be good and motivate one to be the very best, like no one ever was. Studying and social interaction may feel overwhelming, but consider how our grandparents struggled to put food on the table and had to endure the Japanese Occupation.
2. Digital literacy: The numerous questions here about buying laptops for polytechnic or university illustrate my point. Few schools offer Computing as a subject when it should be compulsory in this digital age.
3. Financial planning: Before entering JC, I thought Economics would teach some of this, but it does not. Many young adults enter the working world with little understanding of CPF and insurance (much less financial investments).
4. Cultural understanding: There are repeated reminders about the importance of racial harmony and globalisation, but little imparting of fundamental knowledge about the various cultures in Singapore or relevant skills.

172,ip9j4d,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,icyii,False,public,,Hunting for HDB resale - any tips?,"My bf (30) and I (29) started our HDB resale house hunt. I've been doing a lot of research but the information is overwhelming, so thought I would reach out to redditors here and see if y'all had any tips for us.

**What about BTO?**

My bf keeps pushing for BTO but I really don't want to wait 6-7 years to move out of my family home. My parents are really loud and argue a lot so it's not the best for my mental health. My bf doesn't understand because he likes living with his family. I don't want to move in with him either, I don't like the home, location, and living with the in-laws.

**What we've been looking for**

My bf wants to live in Serangoon because it's close to his workplace (Clarke Quay) and his family (so we get grants). The flats are larger because they're older, however the downside is the hdb flats are considerably older.

I prefer the east side because I've lived here all my life and I like the beach vibes. I also work from home so it doesn't matter where I live, though of course I would prefer a place near the MRT. I fell in love with a newly MOP Tampines DBSS 5-room for 700k but he didn't even want to consider it because it was in Tampines. 

I'm mostly fine with Serangoon hdb flats except their windows are really small, the remaining lease is shorter, and lots of renovation work will have to be done.

Do you have any advice or tips for us? What were your experiences buying resale? Did you end up waiting a few years for BTO?

A period of constant paranoia that was fueled by the immense helplessness. For a prolonged period, I would click on my Gmail icon every morning, hoping to receive a response to my university applications. To no avail, my inbox was always empty though there were times when junk mails or Zalora would get my hopes up until I saw the sender. At this stage, there were moments when I felt angry at the admissions for giving me such a torturous suspension. The waiting period was unbearable, it was like an unreachable itch at the back of my mind and it would creep up on me whenever I was isolated or not doing anything. At that time, I just wanted everything to have a result, I just wish they would end my misery by cutting me loss. Thoughts like “just reject me already please” ran through my mind all the time,  I felt like a war warrior who just wanted to quickly get shot at the battlefield to ease the suspension.

Little did I know that suspension was way better than the reality, there was hope, at least. On the 14th of May 2020, 10 days before the first acceptance window deadline, I learnt that many of my friends had gotten their offers at the top three universities. And that skyrocketed my hope because I thought I might have a chance since I scored similar rank points as them. That night, I turned on my laptop and went on to the official student portal excitedly, hoping that I could share a similar fate as my friends. However, the results were not in my favour. I was bluntly rejected by NUS, SIT and SUTD, all the universities that I had applied to basically. That was when I started to appreciate the torturous suspension I had a few seconds ago and I realised my preparation for this undesirable outcome was merely a paper-thin bulletproof vest that could not defend the nuclear-like reality. The reality was much harsher than I expected. Looking at the glowing “Rejected” my mind went blank, my vision blurred, darkened and I spaced out.

Shock, sadness, disappointment, helplessness and shame, all of them colluded, turned into an iron fist and punched me hard right at my windpipe. To be honest, never have I ever imagined that was how breathtaking feels like. Not only was I unable to inhale at the point, but I was also overwhelmed by the immense sensation of pain. It was not a quick stab kind of a pain but rather a slow burn. It felt like a skilled butcher with a blunt blade, aimed at my chest, penetrated through my skin, my flesh, my bones and added a twist when it reached my heart.

A friend of mine asked if I was ok, I replied yes. “Yes”, just seemed to be the best candidate to describe this emotional turmoil. God knows how long had I spent looking at my ceiling before falling asleep but what else could I have done? Crying? Screaming? Leaping off a bridge? Nah. It was a moment of chaotic nothingness, I did not know what to do or where to go. My mind was just blank, blank, blank.

177,jitejs,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,ain20,False,public,,[rant] o level as a private candidate,"i’m not sure how this works as this is my first time doing this and i’m still new to this. before anyone come at me trying to say “i’m attention seeking” or “i deserved it” please please please try to understand my position. i have nowhere else to rant except here. 

so i am halfway thru Os but i still have pure hist, elect geog, elect bio and sci mcq to go thru. i just did chem but i know for sure i completely failed. i blanked out, left blanks which i never do before and couldnt do most questions. i feel like i’ve lost it all and hit the rock bottom. the worse thing is that i know the paper is easy but i could do it, bcs i didn’t had the ans to the questions. all my efforts went into the drain just like that. i feel like giving up in life bcs i screwed up my 2nd chance at Os. 

i was depending on chem to pull up my sci (my bio is weak), but now it’s fked and so my l1r5 is meaningless. 

i was an express student but failed Os in 2019 and am studying in ite rn. at the same time i am doing o levels once again as a private candidate retaking 5 subjects this year. my fam was totally against the idea, saying i won’t be able to cope. in the end i had to use my money (which is a lot to me and luckily i had my salary that i saved up) to retake Os once again. 

my ultimate goal is JC ever since the beginning. i know some people will say “why don’t u just continue with ite and go to a good course in poly since it’s obvious that ure incapable of going there in the first place” i thought that was starting to be true at first, but coming to ite has made me realised that i’m not a computer person but am more to books side. so i’m thankful that i retook Os in the first place so that if i do well, i can leave ite and go to a jc. 

the reason why i chose to go ite and retake is bcs in the beginning, i wasn’t sure if pure hist is offered (they won’t offer a subject if there’s less than 20 candidates sitting) i needed it if i want to go jc to help my l1r5 (i cant retake art again and i have mt w me) but i would only know in june once the entry proof is out, which means by then if i were in ite i would b halfway thru sch. but if im not, then it’ll be a year wasted for me. 

throughout my years in secondary school, i did not study at all. my results were average and i only went with the flow. it was only when i failed my Os in 2019 suddenly hits me to do better and work harder. i didn’t prioritise my education, and allow rs to get in the way which affected my studies. there were no restrictions set or anybody to push me or scold me to do better. all the decisions in my life are up to me to decide. i’m free to do whatever i want ever since my dad passed on. 

i wish i had somebody to push me for my future sake u know? i realised its important now and its starting to kill me deep down. i regret taking things for granted and going with the flow. 

going to ite has made me realised an effective studying method that works for me which i have been using since august till now to study for Os.

only until the recent weeks where i started to feel more stressed and blanked out more easily. there were so many things to cope, idk where i stood, and i was all alone. it’s so scary retaking Os as a private candidate. and at the same time it sucks big time seeing ur friends happy with their choices in poly ite or jc. 

on top of that, i have financial expenses to worry about. i’m sick of my fam always bringing up about financial issues like topping up ez link card or buying food to eat (if i were to ask for $$) if i were to go ite and then to poly, i would have to spend so much which i really don’t want to. the only money i’m left with is my father’s wealth that he left behind. and as u know time goes, it’s only decreasing. yes, whenever i go out to school or purchase anything, i only depend on that and have stopped asking my mother for $$ majority of the times. it has been 4 years and i’m rly stressed thinking abt it once it runs out. 

i really don’t know what to do now. i’m really lost at this point and the fact that my geog paper is in about 2hrs+ really scares me. i feel alone and like a complete failure and a loser. i thought i could actually turn things around and prove people wrong by going to a jc next year, but regardless of whatever i do i feel like it’s never enough. 

i missed 1 week (to study n focus on Os) and applied 2 weeks of leave from ite bcs of Os which means i missed out so much. my attendance and studies r gg to b affected, and it’ll affect my gpa if i’m still in the sch next year. it’s really embarrassing if i were to stay in school next year aft everything. 

shld i leave ite next year and retake Os once again? i’m really desperate to get straight As on the slip. idk why. i just want to achieve that. 

besides dealing with the label of being a failure bcs i failed Os, i have to deal with worries like $$ and my future. i have to make decisions on my own. my father isn’t here to support me just like how he provided for my siblings. it’s different for me. i’m all alone. i have to decide and do things alone and honestly it’s been so tough. it’s been so hard ever since he left bcs there’s nobody to provide for me like how he did for my siblings when they were my age. it rly sucks having to live a diff life from ur siblings when they were ur age.

i really don’t know what to do at this point. i’m so confused and lost and i don’t know what is happening. i’ve never thought of sui**** but honestly it seems like a good option too. my fam would have one less mouth to feed anyways.

Since some of you were very interested in my results and since I can't share them in the post anymore, I will either put them here in this post or write a private message to the people who have expressed interest. I owe this to you and I will definitely do that as soon as it is time. The advertised vouchers will be raffled off in about 2 to 3 weeks :)

180,i9cu1q,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,xkristenn,False,public,,[A Levels] Note to J2s,"Have been a silent reader for quite a while now (even during my own A’s journey) but I can safely say that this subreddit was honestly a whole ‘escape’ & community that I was super grateful for during my J2 year. As cliche as it sounds scrolling through this page and refreshing every day after school just reading everyone’s questions, rants, thoughts & little interactions made me feel that I’m not in this alone, and this is just one of the things I’ve learnt from A levels.

tldr; seeing a few negative posts here and thought I’d pay it forward and offer you some of my personal take from the A Levels journey (hopefully it helps you feel a lil’ better)

Things I’ve learnt from A levels:

*1) You’re not in this alone* 
The A levels journey is not one you have to venture on alone. Yes, going into the exam hall where you can’t bring anyone or even those trusty notes you’ve made in will be daunting, but always remember the times you’ve revised with friends, had consults with teachers, late nights in school studying, Zoom study sessions, random texts in the group chat to seek help for a question or even that post you wrote on this reddit, a comment you left or even being a part of and reading this message now. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Many seniors have walked this path, many seniors are here to help, support and respond to queries you may have, your teachers all are rooting for you deep down and your peers, friends and this entire cohort will be going into this TOGETHER. So if you ever feel alone in this journey please do reach out we’re here as a community and as fellow students we understand that this may not be easy but I hope you find some comfort in knowing that we’re all in this together and you’re not alone on this journey

*2) One step at a time*
It’s a simple mantra that I stood by during revision. Often times, I felt that I was lagging behind, always chapters behind, many gaps in my revision, so lost in classes I couldn’t even finish a practise paper. This made me question ‘Why was I even revising?’ ‘How was I going to practice questions if I can’t even do a single question?’ ‘I don’t even know what I don’t know?’ Sounds familiar yet? Well, once you encounter an unknown concept it’s easy to be trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and you’ll quickly become overwhelmed - these are all normal feelings and everyone would’ve felt it before! (Myself included) One day, feeling all dejected and panicking about A’s on a walk home a friend told me “Just take it one step at a time, if it means doing part A of a test paper then just do that, heck if it means just doing 1 page then just do that, better still if it means doing 1 or 2 questions today then just do that! As long as you’re doing something it’s better than nothing!” In hindsight, that was probably the best advice I’ve gotten for A’s. Whenever I felt overwhelmed with the sheer amount of content I had to go through or even begin to organise I’d tell myself ok today I’ll finish 1 page of this paper, focus on JUST THAT and try to break out of the negative thought cycle loop. REMEMBER: going one step at a time is personal and varies from person to person as long as you did something, it’s an improvement from where you were before doing that - so give yourself that small win and just continue taking small steps every day!

*3) Negative thoughts are OK*
Negative emotions and thoughts are all part and parcel of being human. We all have good days and bad days, there will be periods we feel down, sad, dejected, hopeless, lose faith in ourselves but all these are necessary for you to understand what happiness, hope, relief, calmness and faith even feel like. Sometimes we find ourselves at rock bottom, then falling even lower (like whatt hasn’t the world already thrown enough at me?!) but this too is part and parcel of growth. I used to constantly crave happiness and a stress free life, but I believe as you mature and have a look at real life, you’d begin to understand that the negatives are just as important in this pursuit for happiness, acknowledging that these negative emotions are necessary and NORMAL is important. Don’t beat yourself up over feeling sad because you can’t understand an easy concept, don’t tell yourself you shouldn’t feel stressed out, don’t tell yourself you can’t be dejected - these are all part of the journey, accept these emotions, feel them, and acknowledge them as part of your personal growth journey. Months later you’ll look back and realise ah yes THAT made me a stronger person today. A’s definitely till this day remains one of the lowest points in my life, I dreaded walking into school everyday, endlessly wished it all be gone and admittedly before this post have completely buried this part in a deep corner of my memory hoping to not relive it. BUT, time and time again I always find myself comparing my workload and stresses back to the days where I was sitting in your position and I tell myself ‘I’ve been through the rigour of A’s this is really nothing compared to those days’ These negative emotions you feel today are part and parcel of your growth, so embrace it, own it and chart the way forward! Recall 1)You’re not in this alone & 2)Take things one step at a time

*4) Every day is a fresh start*
Treat every day like a mini reset button. Get a good nights rest every night, wake up fresh and conquer the day on a clean slate. If you previously had a terrible study session, leave it behind. TODAY is a new day and it’s a new start for you, a clean slate for you to begin whatever you have planned for yourself. In the midst of all the rigour, intensity and stress that fuels this journey always always remember to take care of your health! Find a way to unwind and click that reset button so you can begin the next day FRESH. If you’re an early bird, set a schedule so you sleep early and wake up early to maximise your productive hours. If you’re a night owl, set a schedule so you can study into the night and still get enough rest to reset for the next day again. It’s personal, everyone has their own optimal methods and you know yourself best! Personally, I’m not a great runner but I picked up running during the intensive study period right before A’s where we didn’t have to go to school. Every morning (give or take the days days I need that extra snooze), I’d wake up go for a quick run (15min, 20min whatever suits you) and come back to start my revision - could be the endorphins but it personally helped me feel better about the day and start it on a nicer note (OH yea, nikerunclub has some awesome guided runs that really picked me up during this period too - if this might work for you then check it out!) Regardless, find a hobby, find an avenue for yourself to unwind at the end of the day or between revisions, give yourself that break and NEVER feel guilty for taking a break. Make your health and well-being a priority. 

*5) This too shall pass*
Like many things in life, A’s will be another milestone you pass in life. As someone who has been in your shoes, I can confidently tell you that a few months down the road, no matter the results, completing the last paper will usher in a sense of well-deserved satisfaction. You’ve made it through this journey, no matter the outcome, the strength and tenacity will train you up for far greater feats in life. During my A’s I picked up running (which I mentioned previously), I’ve grown as a student and more importantly as a person. I think it has allowed me to mature and regardless how you do - it’s not the end of the world. I’ve had peers who did really well, others who didn’t fare as well as they expected, some who even transferred to poly because A’s wasn’t the route for them but a few years later when you look at where we all are now, A’s was really just another step in this long journey of life, each of us have found our own successes and are still continuing the journey to adulthood. Maybe some of us might not end up taking a conventional route but who knows THAT may just be the opportunity for you to reevaluate your goals and find something you may end up enjoying even more. In the grand scheme of things, adding a few more years to take a detour ain’t gonna matter, we still have many years ahead of us and there’s so much more to say about the life after A’s but I’ll keep it brief for now - this too shall pass!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i9cu1q/a_levels_note_to_j2s/,15,215,0,215,1.0,Fri Aug 14 09:34:26 2020,A Levels :snoo:
181,jp2jsc,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,mitochondria_phd,False,public,,[RANT] hell week and a levels,"Hell week has finished yayyy 

In my opinion it was definitely a shitshow, will not recommend again, want to go to JC1 when PW was all I had to worry about, where promos diD not determIne my university and life was more certain. Funtimes, enjoy ur time jc1s.

I don't even want to talk about what happened this week, with waking up at 6:00 am everyday, staring into the abyss that my life has become and packing my entry proof to go to school and sit for 2-3 hours.  

During the 2-3 hours, I spend my time wisely- planning, then replanning, and then telling myself I don't know for a million times, realising noones gonna save me, rereading the question out loud like my teacher does, imitating my teachers style of teaching and eventually write the answer (works when I am less tired) and when they say pens down, regret every decision I made.

Then, I immediately come out of the exam hall, walk away from every SINGLE person, open reddit to comfort myself a bit until I don't, and take the train away from my house in an active attempt to runway from home because of how much of a disappointment I am to my family.

Eventually, I come back home to study for the next paper and sleep for 10 min which becomes the next day and the cycle continued. I am throughly exhausted and on top of this I screwed up my exams, disappointed everyone around me, and of course cambRiDge. 

But at the end of this week, I didn't cry at all, I did horrendously for my papers, but after ever exam, I came out I felt so empty inside and just wanted to study for the next one rather then dwelling on whatever happened in that paper. 

Now, I know everyone must be thinking, this is long, imma go back to studying bio/econs, but oh well ur still here, hi, the significance of not crying is the fact that I feel complete apathy, I want to feel the pain after the exam, it means that I care enough to do well, but I think I became so overwhelmed with the pressure of A levels to the point of apathy and I can't feel it anymore. I feel I'm on autopilot and honestly I'm avoiding this situation: I'm avoiding ppl, my family, lashing out at everyone, running away from my house and just avoiding everything as much as possible. I have become a monster. And  the thing is everyone is NICE TO ME, like my parents, my TeAchers, thE scHoOl. I feel so guilty and awful but oh well, I can't feel it cause I AVOID IT and idk how to face it. I feel so numb, and delusional, and honestly running away from my problems. It's not like I'm doing it deliberately, its just a habit.

Oh well, idk guys, I don't know anymore, found out the world is a evil place and life is pain and suffering, and bad ppl get away with things (thanks gp politics for teaching me AND CAMBRIDGE does not care about the environment) so yea, heres the end of my rant.

Fun seeing my life falling apart and burning into pieces and at the end who caused this: me.

""Dear Students,

Starting a new semester can be exciting as we reconnect with our community, but it can get overwhelming at times.

Recently, NUS launched the **#AreuOK** campaign aimed at driving mental resource awareness and setting a positive tone of psychological safety, empathy, and inclusivity on campus. Over the next few months, the University will be sharing a series of programmes, activities and resources to promote positive wellbeing and perception of mental wellness. You may find more information about the campaign and mental wellness resources at this [website](http://blog.nus.edu.sg/areuok).

As part of the campaign initiatives, the University would like to have a better understanding and uncover deep-seated views on mental health conditions by the NUS community. I would like to encourage you to participate in the **5-minute anonymous survey** **(link** [**HERE**](https://nus.syd1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_9StC60nJmCudBI1)**),** which closes on Fri, 19 Feb 2021. Your views will help the University to explore what more can be done to better address mental health perceptions at NUS and provide the necessary support to our students. Do note that while certain demographic information will be asked from the survey, rest assured that submission is anonymous and individual responses cannot be traced.

Thank you and stay safe and healthy.

183,jgmvr9,r/NTU,t5_2spfa,13588,ZeroPauper,True,public,,Do lecture recordings impede or facilitate learning?,"Edit: The question is not whether you prefer online or physical classes, but whether you think lecture recordings (that are supplementary to physical lectures) will impede or facilitate your learning.

A [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/jgipqz/profs_english/g9qy23o?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a HASS student got me thinking about how students from the various faculties view lecture recordings. In that comment, the student who has been in HASS for 3 years has never had a lecture recorded.

I split the poll into the groups due to reddit poll limitations, but feel free to elaborate what course you are from and your thoughts.

**My opinion**

I am from SBS (COS) and all of our lectures are recorded. Although I had posted about the [lacking quality of some of our lecturers](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/adfygy/ntu_doesnt_provide_quality_education_and_heres_why/) in the past, I have to admit that we are lucky in the sense that our lectures are recorded. One of our associate-chair was shocked to hear that other faculties do not record their lectures, given that NTU has had the recording capability and capacity for years now.

Lecture recordings can benefit students by:

* Giving them the autonomy to decide on how to spend their time. They can either choose to travel for hours to attend a live lecture, or use that valuable time to do other things.
* Students can review lectures that sport unintelligible professors as many times as they want to aid their learning
* Professors who can't make it to lecture at the last minute can upload a recording of the previous year's lecture (If the content is still the same) instead of postponing or cancelling the topic

Negative points of lecture recordings **(If you voted for impede, please share your thoughts! I am very interested to understand)**:

* Professors don't get a fully filled lecture hall
* Privacy issues? When discussions happen during lectures, students may feel uncomfortable if they get recorded? Professors are shy to be on camera?
* Makes students lazy - But I would argue that this is a matter of individual discipline and motivation. Lazy students will also be lazy in physical lectures, there's no stopping them from being lazy. This isn't kindergarten where the school should instill discipline and coddle students to achieve a certain trait, we are adults and we should be left to our own devices.

**Predicting the poll results**

I believe that most students would see the benefits of lecture recordings, especially in this and the coming semesters where COVID is around. It gives us the autonomy to take charge of our learning and not miss out if we fall sick, and would deter sick students from attending physical lectures.

My question to the students of faculties who do not record lectures (NBS/HASS): Has anyone feedback to your schools about the issue of not recording lectures?

If my guess is right, an overwhelming proportion of students should be in favor of lecture recordings.

184,jxuf8o,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,HardPieceofRock,False,public,,"[Rant] Dreams, nightmares, and migraines: my mental/psychological state against As","Background: J2, middle of As, but while most of my kakis are like done with As/only have MCQ or H3 left, I still have a good number of written papers left.


I'd not been getting migraines for a while. I'd stopped getting those dreams with all those vivid and nightmarish/phantasmagoric scenarios. I'd not had a non-existent sleep schedule for months.


But then A Level season kicked in and all hell broke loose.


Is it just me, or is there a general correlation between exam seasons and the need for painkillers? Because all of a sudden, I needed paracetamol like everyday just to bear with my migraines and not have them overwhelm me while doing papers or revision. After more than 2 years since my last extended migraine period, and more than 4 months since my previous headache, suddenly, my migraines are kicking in just about every single day. It's so messed up, the pain simply immobilises me cause it hits not just my head, but my eyes also. I've more or less controlled them so it doesn't affect me as much as they used to initially, but it still gets quite bad on worse days.


That being said, I've also been getting really... interesting dreams. I've dreamed of being on crazy long train-themed escape rooms which ended in me unintentionally kicking the back of a random boy's head and yeeting him off a playground resulting in his parents contemplating suing me. I've dreamt of chasing down ambulances into shopping malls which ended in me entering some random food court. I've even dreamt of getting back together with my cheating and manipulative ex. Yesterday, I even dreamt that I was giving a whole stand-up routine to my old secondary school class, of course, I don't recall a single joke I said. Funny enough, I actually didn't have such descriptive and imagerous dreams across this many days in a row for a very long time now, more than 5 years at least, and it's kinda scary how they all pop up like this now.


It's not just about what happens during sleep too, what happens before seems to be affected as well. I actually haven't had a sleep schedule (not that my original sleep schedule was that good either) in a while, especially due to really nasty timetabling for my papers. I wind up sleeping between 2 to 4 for most days, waking up between 10 and 12 as a result (especially for days without papers). Even so, it's been taking a lot longer to fall asleep as well, from my usual 10-15 mins or so to a good rolling in bed for 20-30 mins. It's almost as though my body doesn't want to fall asleep.


Maybe it's stress? I suspect that this (mainly) psychological situation seems to be a manifestation of my underlying mental state of stress as a result of my high expectations towards As and worry over results/upcoming papers in general. But then again, this doesn't help in alleviating my stress much; like when I get migraines, it just makes? me? more? stressed out? since I can't spend the time I'm forced to lie down? studying more?


At this point, I'm just hoping that things can pass smoothly and that the rest of my papers can go without a hitch. A lot of my subjects have been wild rides without much of a good end forseeable, and I hope that this onset of strange sleeping and migraine occurences won't afffect me any more than it should.

Unpopular or not? Depends on how you see it.

Yes I get it, cooping ourselves up at home is depressing, suffocating and boring. A small minority of us face legitimate issues such as domestic abuse & mental issues, but for the overwhelming majority the choice between death and boredom should be a simple one (For those who want to argue that it's an exaggeration, please educate yourself with how other badly hit countries are faring). I would say that a majority of us are doing our part by staying at home but it's not enough, everyone has to play a part.

We have to face the facts, COVID-19 isn't going to magically disappear unless we take drastic measures. The only effective way to combat COVID-19 in its accelerating phase is to isolate everyone from each other, it has been proven in Italy and China where their curve is slowly flattening.

This is a extremely unpopular opinion in this sub, but I will still say it: The only reasons you should leave your house are: You're working an essential job, you need groceries/food, you need medical help. The crowding at wet markets and supermarkets is understandable, given that we all need food to sustain ourselves. Some measures that we can take to reduce congestion at markets:

* Boosting grocery delivering services (or making it free altogether)
* Mindset shift of people who cook to shift towards simple foods that can last long (E.g. frozen meat & veg, pasta, canned food, pasteurized eggs)
* Doing an Italy and limiting grocery runs per household
* Helping wet markets set up delivery orders

&#x200B;

If it's still not clear after reading the above, maybe we should take a look at some case studies.

Many took the opportunity to go out ""one last time"" to meet their friends. The effects of such actions will be clearer in the coming weeks.

# Abusing loopholes

I wish I could give everyone the benefit of doubt and say they're just trying to find workarounds to make their lives more ""normal"" (but there's nothing normal about a pandemic right?) and they're not actively looking for loopholes. But the evidence against that is overwhelming. People are finding every single excuse to leave their houses.

* [People still cycling in large groups](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fyc1r4/social_distancing/)

Allowing people to exercise has resulted in the opposite effect from preventing people from gathering. Suddenly everyone is a marathon runner and heading to parks to run. Regular joggers have mentioned that they've seen a sharp increase in unfamiliar faces in parks, also families with kids and elderly strolling around.

# Children [no longer allowed](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/covid-19-children-should-not-be-shuttled-grandparents-home-daily-basis-during-circuit?fbclid=IwAR0VjrJLCz_PfcKC7gUXOpRdNBMp0A-gemLyuFgnfkecc6QVbMArkGco6-w) to be dropped off daily at grandparents’ home

The official reason was to ""protect the elderly"", but I'm sure it's pretty obvious what caused the crackdown on this. Non-essential workers who can't handle their own kids (i'm not saying it's easy to handle kids while working but there are parents who can handle it well) that abused the system, now essential workers with kids have to suffer at the hands of irresponsible non-essential workers.

While not the original reason I made the post, it's important to realise why others may not feel the same way as you. There is only one word to sum it up. **Expectations**. Everybody will have different expectations on what kind of grades they will get. Some people can get a L1R5 of 20+ and still be overjoyed because it was an improvement, some will be utterly disappointed.

Thus, it's all relative to the actual person. **Are you happy with your prelim results?** Will it get you into your choice school/ course? If you are still unsure, look at your JAE booklet for the cut off points for the courses or schools you are interested in.

If you are happy, then maintain your score! Don't be complacent, continue to do your TYS and practice papers.

If you aren't happy with your results, then you need to work harder! You can ask this sub, the Discord or Telegram group chats (you can find the links in the sidebar) about how to improve for a certain subject.

Which brings me to my main point, **search the sub first for previous posts that others may have made**. Many times, these posts are still relevant and can help you! Duplicate posts simply make the job of the mods more difficult and clogs up the sub.

We can all work together to keep the posts on this sub of a decent quality.

They like to say Singapore has nothing to do, there are no interesting people and there are no interesting places to go to. 

Not being overly sentimental, but I think Singapore is fine the way it is. In fact, I love it. There are beautiful sights to catch - sunsets, skylines, nature parks etc. Have you ever tried taking a stroll in the CBD at night? It’s a very surreal experience to wander on empty streets surrounded by towering frames of glass and steel that are gently illuminated by the orange neon. I don’t think anyone can get that experience in other countries without being overwhelmed by crowded tourist traps or bright piercing lights that are a real cacophony.

And who says there aren’t interesting places to go? If one is adventurous enough to explore the more rural roads, you can find those small nuggets that are the SAF’s bases, like school of ammo in Rifle Range or ST Kinetics building in the middle of the jungle right outside the central catchment area. Gombak used to have a trekking path that cuts into MINDEF’s small hill (but sadly it closed cuz of erosion).

Also, the geography of the island. Ohhh the geography. The diamond shape is such beautiful geography. One moment you are in bukit batok, the next you are in Clementi after walking about 45 minutes. Walk further and you reach the sea. Walk along the coast and you reach Downtown. It’s homely with all the neighbourhoods nicely and conveniently situated next to each other. In any other country, there would be no limits to the urban area and sometimes, there is just a town sitting in the middle of vast hinterlands. Singapore is just like a video game map, something out of GTA.

In Junior college

* Learn how to be confident of myself and succeed in scholarship interview. I did well for A level but that’s because I invested so much time in my studies. The funny part about 2 years of hardcore mugging? It is not about the struggle with exam stress and syllabus. It’s the struggle with choosing my major and being calm for my scholarship interview (prepared super hard but failed)

In university

* Learn how to manage my finances: It’s really cool to start working after O levels and earned some pocket money. This is the moment where I splurged and didn’t save much. As a student, we don’t really spend much time managing our expenses because we are so occupied with studies. So I only learn how to be more savvy with my money AFTER university.

It’s 3am right now. I had my H2 bio and math promo papers yesterday (idk who the hell thought it was a good idea to put those together, i was SO tired). I came home, ate and passed out on the floor and foung myself panicking when I woke up at 2.13am. I completely messed up my math paper. I didnt do most of the questions. For bio, I studied for it throughout the weekend because I was doing better in bio anyways so I thought it was more worth the last-minute mugging. In 6 hours, I will be doing my H2 chem paper and I’m so ineffably unprepared.

This year in 2 words- shit. show.

I came into JC feeling anticipation. Little did I know that JC was just the beginning of the downfall of my entire life. I never was a consistent worker, but my results all throughout secondary school were excellent. Last minute cramming was sufficient to get by back then. That was the studying method I used all through sec school and for my O levels. I did well and got into the JC I was aiming for. Now, the overwhelming content and the depth of the concepts taught in JC has made it IMPOSSIBLE for me to keep up with, especially since I don’t have the habit of studying consistently. I’ve been failing most of my tests and I’m now at a point where failing doesn’t bother me anymore. (I take BCMe btw)

I know I had an entire year to adapt to the JC lifestyle. But why couldn’t I? Well, alongside the fact that I absolutely cannot cope with change, I fell deep into depression. It was hard- to accept that I’m no longer the ‘perfect’ student I used to be. JC has made me question my intelligence, my grit, and even my self-worth. 

Depression stole a large fraction of time from me. For months on end I couldn’t bring myself to do anything, my sleep and eating schedules were bizarre. Furthermore, while living with such erratic habits, going to school and seeing people study all the damn time made me feel so fucking guilty. But even with that guilt, albeit intense, I wasn’t motivated to do anything. Slowly my mom realised that my life was literally falling apart, and she forced me to see a doctor to get help.

So for a while, my life was dozing off in school, therapy, seeing the counsellor, crying, and feeling numb and worthless. Until a week before promos when my friends started to push me more, because they didn’t want me to retain. I tried. 10 minutes of studying per day... 20 minutes... an hour... 2 hours. I was making progress. But time wasn’t on my side. Now I’m hours away from taking a paper I’m likely to fail. 

I feel demoralised. I can’t believe that merely promoting is a struggle for me. I still remember when I started JC aiming for all As and Bs. What a bloody joke.

198,hpcttz,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,sharingan87,False,public,,GE2020: The Roar of the Swing Voter,"Hi everyone, this is my first ever post here.

I run a little website called The Thought Experiment where I talk about various issues, some of them Singapore related. And one of my main interests is Singaporean politics. With the GE2020 election results, I thought I should pen down my take on what us as the electorate were trying to say.

If you like what I wrote, I also wrote another article on the state of play for GE2020 during the campaigning period, as well as 2 other articles related to GE2015 back when it was taking place.

If you don't like what I wrote, that's ok! I think the beauty of freedom of expression is that everyone is entitled to their opinion. I'm always happy to get feedback, because I do think that more public discourse about our local politics helps us to be more politically aware as a whole.

Just thought I'll share my article here to see what you guys make of it :D

Article Starts Here:

During the campaigning period, both sides sought to portray an extreme scenario of what would happen if voters did not vote for them. The Peoples’ Action Party (PAP) warned that Singaporeans that their political opponents [“might eventually replace the government after July 10”](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-pap-chan-chun-sing-scrutinises-opposition-manifestos-parties-could-be-coalition-government). Meanwhile, the Worker’s Party (WP) stated that [“there was a real risk of a wipeout of elected opposition MPs at the July 10 polls”](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-wp-launches-manifesto-and-election-slogan-make-your-vote-count).

Today is July 11th. As we all know, neither of these scenarios came to pass. The PAP comfortably retained its super-majority in Parliament, winning 83 out of 93 elected MP seats. But just as in GE2011, another Group Representation Constituency (GRC) has fallen to the WP. In addition, the PAP saw its vote share drop drastically, down almost 9% to 61.2% from 69.9% in GE2015.

Singapore’s electorate is unique in that a significant proportion is comprised of swing voters: Voters who don’t hold any blind allegiance to any political party, but vote based on a variety of factors both micro and macro. The above extreme scenarios were clearly targeted at these swing voters. Well, the swing voters have made their choice, their roar sending 4 more elected opposition MPs into Parliament. This article aims to unpack that roar and what it means for the state of Singaporean politics going forward.

**1. The PAP is still the preferred party to form Singapore’s Government**

Yes, this may come across as blindingly obvious, but it still needs to be said. The swing voter is by its very definition, liable to changes of opinion. **And a large factor that determines how a swing voter votes is their perception of how their fellow swing voters are voting.** If swing voters perceive that most swing voters are leaning towards voting for the opposition, they might feel compelled to vote for the incumbent. And if the reverse is true, swing voters might feel the need to shore up opposition support.

Why is this so? This is because the swing voter is trying to push the vote result into a sweet spot – one that lies between the two extreme scenarios espoused by either side. They don’t want the PAP to sweep all 93 seats in a ‘white tsunami’. Neither do they want the opposition to claim so much territory that the PAP is too weak to form the Government on its own. But because each swing voter only has a binary choice: either they vote for one side or the other (I’m ignoring the third option where they simply spoil their vote), they can’t very well say “I want to vote 0.6 for the PAP and 0.4 for the Opposition with my vote”. And so we can expect the swing voter bloc to continue being a source of uncertainty for both sides in future elections, as long as swing voters are still convinced that the PAP should be the Government.

**2. Voters no longer believe that the PAP needs a ‘strong mandate’ to govern. They also don’t buy into the NCMP scheme.**

Throughout the campaign period, the PAP repeatedly exhorted voters to vote for them alone. Granted, they couldn’t very well give any ground to the opposition without a fight. And therefore there was an attempt to equate voting for the PAP as voting for Singapore’s best interests. However, the main message that voters got was this: PAP will only be able to steer Singapore out of the Covid-19 pandemic if it has a strong mandate from the people.

What is a strong mandate, you may ask? While no PAP candidate publicly confirmed it, [their incessant harping on the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-pap-will-not-have-blank-cheque-because-of-ncmp-scheme-say-chun-sing-and) as the PAP’s win-win solution for having the PAP in power and a largely de-fanged opposition presence in parliament shows that the PAP truly wanted a parliament where it held every single seat.

Clearly, the electorate has different ideas, handing Sengkang GRC to the WP and slashing the PAP’s margins in previous strongholds such as West Coast, Choa Chu Kang and Tanjong Pagar by double digit percentages. There is no doubt from the results that swing voters are convinced that a PAP supermajority is not good for Singapore. They are no longer convinced that to vote for the opposition is a vote against Singapore. They have realized, as members of a maturing democracy surely must, that one can vote for the opposition, yet still be pro-Singapore.

**3. Social Media and the Internet are rewriting the electorate’s perception.**

In the past, there was no way to have an easily accessible record of historical events. With the only information source available being biased mainstream media, Singaporeans could only rely on that to fill in the gaps in their memories. Therefore, [Operation Coldstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Coldstore) became a myth of the past, and [Chee Soon Juan became a crackpot in the eyes of the people](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/singapore-defamation-suits-threaten-chee-soon-juan-and-erode-freedom-expression), someone who should never be allowed into Parliament.

Fast forward to today. Chee won 45.2% of the votes in Bukit Batok’s Single Member Constituency (SMC). His party-mate, Dr. Paul Tambyah did even better, winning 46.26% of the votes in Bukit Panjang SMC. For someone previously seen as unfit for public office, this is an extremely good result.

Chee has been running for elections in Singapore for a long time, and only now is there a significant change in the way he is perceived (and supported) by the electorate. Why? Because of social media and the internet, two things which the PAP does not have absolute control over. With the ability to [conduct interviews with social media personalities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OISj2rQSx64) as well as [upload party videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPLikoXzEjs), he has been able to display a side of himself to people that the PAP did not want them to see: someone who is merely human just like them, but who is standing up for what he believes in.

**4. Reserved Election Shenanigans and Tan Cheng Block: The electorate has not forgotten.**

Tan Cheng Bock almost became our President in 2011. There are many who say that if Tan Kin Lian and Tan Jee Say had not run, Tony Tan would not have been elected. In March 2016, Tan Cheng Bock publicly declared his interest to run for the next Presidential Election that would be held in 2017. The close result of 2011 and Tan Cheng Bock’s imminent candidacy made the upcoming Presidential Election one that was eagerly anticipated.

That is, until the PAP shut down his bid for the presidency just a few months later in September 2016, using its supermajority in Parliament to pass a “reserved election” in which only members of a particular race could take part. Under the new rules that they had drawn up for themselves, it was decreed that only Malays could take part. And not just any Malay. The candidate had to either be a senior executive managing a firm that had S$500 million in shareholders’ equity, or be the Speaker of Parliament or a similarly high post in the public sector (the exact criteria are a bit more in-depth than this, but this is the gist of it. You can find the full criteria [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore#Qualifications)). And who was the Speaker of Parliament at the time? Mdm Halimah, who was conveniently of the right race (Although there was some hooha about her actually being Indian). With the extremely strict private sector criteria and the PAP being able to effectively control who the public sector candidate was, it came as no surprise that Mdm Halimah was declared the only eligible candidate on Nomination Day. A day later, she was Singapore’s President. And all without a single vote cast by any Singaporean.

Of course, the PAP denied that this was a move specifically aimed at blocking Tan Cheng Bock’s bid for the presidency. Chan Chun Sing, Singapore’s current Minister of Trade and Industry, stated in 2017 that the [Government was prepared to pay the political price](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/govt-prepared-to-pay-political-price-over-changes-to-elected-9199326) over making these changes to the Constitution.

We can clearly see from the GE2020 results that a price was indeed paid. A loss of almost 9% of vote share is very significant, although a combination of the [first-past-the-post rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) and the GRC system ensured that the PAP still won 89.2% of the seats in Parliament despite only garnering 61.2% of the votes. On the whole, it’s naught but a scratch to the PAP’s overwhelming dominance in Parliament. The PAP still retains its supermajority and can make changes to the Constitution anytime that it likes. But the swing voters have sent a clear signal that they have not been persuaded by the PAP’s rationale.

**5. Swing Voters do not want Racial Politics.**

In 2019, Heng Swee Keat, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and the man who is next in line to be Prime Minister (PM) commented that [Singapore was not ready to have a non-Chinese PM](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/older-generation-singaporeans-not-ready-non-chinese-pm-heng-swee-keat). He further added that race is an issue that always arises at election-time in Singapore.

Let us now consider the GE2015 results. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore’s Senior Minister and someone whom many have expressed keenness to be Singapore’s next PM, obtained 79.28% of the vote share in Jurong GRC. This was above even the current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who scored 78.63% in Ang Mo Kio GRC. Tharman’s score was the highest in the entire election.

And now let us consider the GE2020 results. Tharman scored 74.62% in Jurong, again the highest scorer of the entire election, while Hsien Loong scored 71.91%. So Tharman beat the current PM again, and by an even bigger margin than the last time. Furthermore, Swee Keat, who made the infamous comments above, scored just 53.41% in East Coast.

Yes, I know I’m ignoring a lot of other factors that influenced these results. But don’t these results show conclusively that Heng’s comments were wrong? We have an Indian leading both the current and future PM in both elections, but yet PAP still feels the need to say that Singapore “hasn’t arrived” at a stage where we can vote without race in mind. In fact, this was the same rationale that supposedly led to the reserved presidency as mentioned in my earlier point.

The swing voters have spoken, and it is exceedingly clear to me that the electorate does not care what our highest office-holders are in terms of race, whether it be the PM or the President. Our Singapore pledge firmly states “regardless of race”, and I think the results have shown that we as a people have taken it to heart. But has the PAP?

**6. Voters will not be so easily manipulated.**

On one hand, Singaporeans were exhorted to stay home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Contact tracing became mandatory, and groups of more than 5 are prohibited.

But on the other hand, we are also told that it’s absolutely necessary to hold an election during this same period, for Singaporeans to [wait in long lines](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-polling-day-long-queues-voting-polling-station-eld-12920390) and in close proximity to each other as we congregate to cast our vote, all because the PAP needs a strong mandate.

On one hand, Heng Swee Keat lambasted the Worker’s Party, claiming that it was [“playing games with voters”](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-ncmp-scheme-heng-swee-keat-pap-wp-12903332) over their refusal to confirm if they would accept NCMP seats.

But on the other hand, Heng Swee Keat was moved to the East Coast GRC at the eleventh hour in a surprise move to secure the constituency. (As mentioned above, he was aptly rewarded for this with a razor-thin margin of just 53.41% of the votes.)

On one hand, Masagos Zulkifli, PAP Vice-Chairman stated that [“candidates should not be defined by a single moment in time or in their career, but judged instead by their growth throughout their life”](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-masagos-responds-to-criticism-of-ivan-lim-says-candidates-will-have-to). He said this in defense of Ivan Lim, who appears to be the very first candidate in Singaporean politics to have been pushed into retracting his candidacy by the power of non-mainstream media.

But on the other hand, the PAP called on the WP to make clear its stand on Raeesah Khan, a WP candidate who ran (and won) in Sengkang GRC for this election, stating that the Police investigation into Raeesah’s comments made on social media was [“a serious matter which goes to the fundamental principles on which our country has been built”](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-wp-should-state-stand-on-raeesah-khans-posts-not-ask-voters-to-write-it-a).

On one hand, Chan Chun Sing stated in 2015, referring to SingFirst’s policies about giving allowances to the young and the elderly, [“Some of them promised you $300 per month. I say, please don’t insult my residents. You think…. they are here to be bribed?”](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/vote-for-party-deserving-of-peoples-trust-chun-sing)

On the other hand, the PAP Government has just given out several handouts under its many budgets to help Singaporeans cope with the Covid-19 situation. \[To be clear, I totally approve of these handouts. What I don’t approve is that the PAP felt the need to lambast similar policies as bribery in the past. Comparing a policy with a crime is a political low blow in my book.\]

I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. And so did the electorate in this election, putting their vote where it counted to show their disdain for the heavy-handedness and double standards that the PAP has displayed for this election.

**Conclusion**

I don’t say the above to put down the PAP. The PAP would have you believe that to not support them is equivalent to not wanting what’s best for Singapore. This is a false dichotomy that must be stamped out, and I am glad to see our swing voters taking a real stand with this election.

No, I say the above as a harsh but ultimately supportive letter to the PAP. As everyone can see from the results, we all still firmly believe that the PAP should be the Government. We still have faith that PAP has the leadership to take us forward and out of the Covid-19 crisis.

But we also want to send the PAP a strong signal with this vote, to bring them down from their ivory towers and down to the ground. Enough with the double standards. Enough with the heavy-handedness. Singaporeans have clearly stated their desire for a more mature democracy, and that means more alternative voices in Parliament. The PAP needs to stop acting as the father who knows it all, and to start acting as the bigger brother who can work hand in hand with his alternative younger brother towards what’s best for the entire family: Singapore.

There is a real chance that the PAP will not listen, though. As Lee Hsien Loong [admitted in a rally in 2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1WhJKsYb50), “if there are 10, 20… opposition members in Parliament… I have to spent my time thinking what is the right way to fix them”.

Now, the PAP has POFMA at its disposal. It still has the supermajority in Parliament, making them able to change any law in Singapore, even the Constitution at will. We have already seen them put these tools to use for its own benefit. Let us see if the PAP will continue as it has always done, or will it take this opportunity to change itself for the better. Whatever the case, we will be watching, and we will be waiting to make our roar heard once again five years down the road.

Majulah Singapura!

201,f8jg59,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,chocolateandmatcha,False,public,,Singapore's safety,"A few days ago I saw a thread about why foreigners chose to move to Singapore and an overwhelming majority mentioned safety. I just never realised how safety can be such a huge pro until I remembered this incident that happened to me when I was 11 (I'm 23 now). 

Back then, I was still living in Queenstown but my parents had alr bought a house in Boon Lay and had decided to send me to tuition in Boon Lay so that it won't be a hassle choosing a tuition centre when we eventually moved there. During the first weeks, my parent still sent me there. They accompanied me there a few times so I could get used to the route but on the first week I went back on my own, I got quite lost. I think I took the wrong bus and by the time I realised it, the bus was at a really ulu part of SG. So, I decided to get off to try and get a sense of my surroundings. It looked like it was going to rain and there really wasn't anyone else on the bus stop that I could ask about directions. 

Then this guy stopped his lorry just in front of the bus stop and I think he was throwing some covers on the stuff on his lorry bcos it had started drizzling by then. I decided to ask him about directions and he told me that the next bus is only gonna come in 45 mins (big yikes). He asked me which direction I was heading and when I told him, he said he could give me a lift to the nearest mrt bcos he was heading in that direction. So he very kindly dropped me off at Clementi MRT and I managed to get home in one piece. 

This incident didn't really mean much to me other than a guy being kind enough to send a dumb 11-year-old girl home. But now I realised that had it happened in any other country, the outcome would've likely been very very different. So, for that, I'm super grateful for how safe Singapore is and it really makes me appreciate why my parents chose to move here in the first place.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f8jg59/singapores_safety/,141,677,0,677,0.96,Mon Feb 24 09:23:44 2020,Discussion

203,ffr8z6,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,Rubriclee,False,public,,Please be a bit more concerned about Covid19,"Singapore has been faring quite well thanks to the quick and hard work of our government and healthcare officials. However, we are to expect worse days ahead and even deaths to be reported. Yet I see long queues for food at many places, and also comments like ""It's just the flu"" which are meant to assure people and reduce panic.

While I do not agree with supermarket runs and other selfish behaviour, I think we do need to at least a little bit more concerned about Covid19. Here's why:

* It's not just the elderly and those with existing medical conditions who will be critically ill. Even the young and healthy (except perhaps little children) can have their immune systems go into overdrive and attack their organs.  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/).

* Dr Richard Hatchett--Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations--wiho has 20 years of experience dealing with infectious diseases considers Covid19 to be more frightening than Ebola, MERS and Sars due to its infectiousness and much higher fatality rate than flu (compared to what was initially predicted). [https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs](https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs) 

* Even if local healthcare is capable of handling Covid19, it will not be able to do so if hospitals are overwhelmed by huge numbers of cases. This is what happened in Wuhan and is happening in Italy.  I find this report by a surgeon in Italy to be extremely compelling and moving: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony\_of\_a\_surgeon\_working\_in\_bergamo\_in\_the/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

So can we all be at least a bit more concerned and continue to play our part in fighting this virus? We will not win the war by panicking and stockpiling; by blaming governments and countries, people of various races, etc. This is a global war! Be vigilant but stay calm. Stay home if you have even just some respiratory symptoms (and isolate from family members if need be) and see a doctor immediately if it worsens. Cover your mouth with tissue when you cough or sneeze. Be nice to one another, and remember to take care of both your physical and mental health.  That's all I have to share for now.

204,j953es,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,tinkingthings,False,public,,[A levels] advice on how to study with negative mental health,"I’m a J2 student and it’s only a month away from A levels for me. I’m the kind of person that tends to be very critical to myself, low self-esteem and basically downplay a lot of things I experience, which is not great. So I end up feeling emotionally numb, melancholic, or both, quite regularly. Occasionally, I panic / get anxious very suddenly and intensively for like a few hours. These emotional occurrences have been cultivated and intensified in me through many factors in my house. It probably started way back in primary school but worsened every year due to increasing stress & workload. I don’t have a terrible relationship with my parents but they perpetuate a lot of the negative things I end up feeling towards myself. I don’t like staying at home because I never really feel at ease with myself or feel comfortable with sharing about myself.  So my whole mental health state really took a huge plunge because of the whole circuit breaker + final year in JC / preparation for A’s. 

I’ve started thinking of going to a therapist on my own after A’s, without letting my parents know, like a few months back. And I thought I could wait till then too but I think the emotional spirals are becoming more frequent and uncontrollable. Like I tend to feel overwhelming emotional numbness & melancholy on weekends, almost every week. Even on weekdays sometimes I get stuck in a loop of emotions. Usually when I spiral down / get stuck, it could take me like from a few hours to a whole day to “get over it” and function or do things I want to do. My friend recommended me to check out CHAT, which I did, but they didn’t have any available slots for Oct & Nov so I don’t know how soon I can check in with them. I was looking for CHAT as my source of temporary relief before A’s but now I’m not sure if that would be possible. Besides that, my emotional support in the family would be “missing” really soon because my older sibling is gonna be enlisting. 

I guess I just want to say that I’m just really worried that my emotions will intensify with me having no one to depend on. And if that happens before A’s I fear I’ll do poorly / fail because these emotions, which I had for years (but only worsened this year), always stops me from studying because I feel too much. I genuinely worry that if I do fail A’s, I might end up sinking too deep into my negative emotions and not be able to come out of it, which is already an issue I struggle with periodically this year. Any advice on what I should do to keep my mental health at bay but not put additional stress on myself? And also how I could bring myself to study with my current mental health state? I appreciate anything concrete at this point, I just want to study and do decent:/ And I’m so sorry if this whole situation sounds so confusing, I’m trying to understand myself as well:”",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j953es/a_levels_advice_on_how_to_study_with_negative/,8,29,0,29,1.0,Sun Oct 11 21:06:42 2020,A Levels :snoo:
205,hsl0gz,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,1imp3h,False,public,,[Dr Catherine Lim] The Surprising GE2020 Election Results: What Could Have Happened?,"Source: [EDMW](https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bdr-catherine-lim%5D-surprising-ge2020-election-results-what-could-have-happened-6338213.html)

In deciding on the date for the GE 2020 polling day, the Prime Minister had clearly been guided by a widely claimed truth, that is, in times of crisis, people take a ‘flight to safety’ by giving overwhelming support to the incumbent leadership, rather than by casting their lot with an as yet untried and untested opposition. Hence the PM did not hesitate to set Polling Day right in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic. He assured all voters that the government would take every precaution to make sure that voting would be totally safe. He was clearly confident of a resounding mandate for the PAP’s return to power.

But when the election results came in, he and his colleagues had a shock. There had been a marked swing towards the Opposition. Although the PAP kept its majority and would continue to dominate in parliament, it was clear that the Opposition had made deep inroads into that majority.

Suddenly the ground that had felt secure under the PAP feet since 1968, was beginning to shake, with forebodings of a seismic eruption if the voting trend continued. In his post-election TV appearance, the Prime Minister looked sombre and worried, gamely admitting that he had been hoping for much better results.

What had caused Singaporean voters to actually buck a universally acknowledged trend in voting behaviour? Why hadn’t they given their full support to their leaders during a crisis serious enough to put world leaders on a wartime footing?

An honest answer would expose the complex, perturbing nature of the relationship between Singaporeans and the PAP leaders. It is a relationship that has always been marked by ambiguity and contradiction,by a curious mixture of two opposing states of mind and feeling, namely , respect and resentment. The respect is for an efficient leadership that has given Singaporeans a good life, with all the material comforts which people in other societies can only yearn for. The resentment is against a self-serving leadership that ultimately cares only about maintaining power, best achieved by creating a contented, compliant electorate. Part of this maintenance of power is intolerance of dissenting voices which are immediately slapped down. No sustained effort has ever been made by the leaders to bridge this gap between themselves and those they lead. It is noteworthy that the leaders have never been described in the epithets of emotive nurturing and human connection, such as ‘warm’,’affable’ ‘approachable’,’highly regarded’, ‘popular’, ‘likeable’, etc. Instead, the praise has always been limited to the detached language used for high intellectuality,proven efficiency and moral stringency.

So will post GE2020 Singapore with the PAP being still the predominant power,be just a continuation of the status quo? Has anything changed? Yes, something has changed, and in a radical way. It is the upsetting, for the first time, of a stance which Singaporeans had developed towards their leaders, whether consciously or unconsciously, over five long decades and which they have learnt to live comfortably with. It is that curious respect-resentment ambiguity, just described, which , though far from ideal, has the comforting feel of habit and familiarity. Now suddenly that ambiguity is being replaced by the fear of change. For the close numbers and margins in the GE2020 results point to the possibility, once unthinkable, of the PAP losing its majority and Singapore emerging as a two-party or multiple-party state, with all that implies of an overhaul of existing state structures, institutions, age-old traditions and expectations, indeed of the entire ethos itself. It would be change on an unprecedented scale. Moreover, it could happen in the foreseeable future, creating an unrecognisable Singapore. It is a most alarming prospect for Singaporeans who have long been habituated to a one-party government and the stability and predictability of its rule. Even when these Singaporeans express a desire for change, they could never imagine such a scenario. Their alarm highlights the special nature of their attitude towards the PAP. It can best be expressed by an array of pronouncements which appear contradictory - ‘We don’t like you but we want you to be around’, ‘We appreciate your efficiency but you’re unlikeable because of your arrogance and aloofness ’, ‘You are too elitist and can’t ever connect with the ground, but you’re okay as long as you make Singapore safe and the environment clean,’ etc. In short, there is a split between head and heart in the Singaporean as he evaluates PAP leadership. While the head acknowledges the good work of the PAP, the heart is repelled by the cold, ruthless efficiency that marks its demeanour. While the head wants the PAP to continue as the ruling party, the heart wants to see a little humbling take place now and then.

I believe that it is this ambivalence of Singaporean voters today, especially of the increasingly large bloc of young voters , that will stand in the way of a resounding win for the PAP in future elections, where it is not likely to improve much on the unimpressive performance of GE2020. Indeed, if no lesson is learnt from this election debacle, the party may very well lose its predominant position in the next GE in four or five years’ time, a period long enough for the Opposition to turn itself into a formidable force, and for the young voters to become even bolder in their push for major political reforms. They have become a force to reckon with, and can only grow in strength and influence in the coming years.

One problem of Singapore’s leaders is that they have always been guided by an entrenched conservatism, showing great cautiousness about any change that even remotely suggests the need of an overhaul, preferring the small, incremental changes of evolution to the tumultuous swings of revolution. But in a world of dizzying transformations, they may have no choice but to join hands with their younger counterparts who are ready to face challenges, take risks, even embrace dangers, rather than be left behind in an increasingly demanding world",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsl0gz/dr_catherine_lim_the_surprising_ge2020_election/,37,57,0,57,0.76,Fri Jul 17 07:37:48 2020,Unverified

&#x200B;

\- my net L1R5 is 14, i was planning to go to yijc arts but my parents convinced me to join a sci stream instead, so i joined millennia institute's sci scream. so basically i have three years of science stuff ahead of me.

\- at first i thought, oh this is fine, i bet with hard work i can make it through, but im really suffering. i take h2 math, h2 chem, h2 eng lit and h1 bio. and honestly the only thing i truly enjoy is h2 lit, its the only thing keeping me sane.

\- ik i sound pathetic but every time i do my chem/math homework, i honestly feel so hopeless and overwhelmed. im in constant fear of my future, im not sure i can do well with this stream. 

\- so i was considering switching to yijc arts stream next year, which is essentially like wasting a whole year, but if im going to spend another two years in millennia science i might as well switch to yijc arts, where i know i can perform much better. i want to do something english lit based in uni as well so...

&#x200B;

**thats my situtation. here are the things holding me back**.

&#x200B;

\- my parents. theyre kind of desp for me to stay in mi science and as much as i feel bad for disappointing them im not sure if i can keep this up much longer. i feel suffocated everytime i think about it. i feel like if i miraculously made it to year three, and sat for my alevels my rank points will be below average

\-what if i dont do well in an arts stream either? this is what my parents asked me. they said arts subjects are no joke, and im completely aware of that. i just feel like id be more inclined to study arts than sci, that id be more interested. i think if i switched to an yijc arts stream id take h2 lit, h2 hist h2 econs and h1 math. h2 hist is no joke right? but i think id rather study that than math or chem at this point.

\- all the money spent on mi this year... i know this isnt an issue in the long run but i still feel some sort of guilt... haha

\- will i even be accepted into yijc arts if join next year? i took my olevels in 2019 so if i do switch to yijc id be 18 while the others would be 17...  that is possible right?

There have been many comments pointing out that the subreddit is overwhelmingly pro opposition. But is this true? When I sort by new I see a somewhat mixed bag of threads which may be for either side. But sort by hot, and you get 100 percent “pappy is evil, oppy must win” posts. 

I thought it could simply be oppy supporters being more hardworking with upvotes. I posted a true nonpartisan story of my encounters with both psp and pap which did not provide a conclusion to vote opposition. Despite good comments from fellow redditors, the mods removed the post without reason. I wonder how many similar posts that are nonpartisan in nature have been removed. 

Now this has raised my suspicions. Are the mods removing content that does not fit their desired narratives? We have a lot of calls for transparency from the pappies. Do not treat us like children. 

Mods, if you’re truly nonpartisan, you should be providing full transparency on the posts you are deleting and provide reasons. Let the people decide what they wish to see. Do not be a nanny state like the pappies. If this post is deleted we will know for sure that you guys are partisan.

Edit: I have received DMs from fellow redditors who have gotten BANNED for their “alternative opinions”. They are in support of my question to the mod team. I know not what these “alternative opinions” are but I suggest full transparency. Do you hear the people sing? singing the song of angry men? This is the music of a people who will not be slaves again?

Edit 2: I was informed that the reason for the post removal is due to the use of the acronym for “fornication under the consent of the king”.

I will post my thoughts about the issue and the actions I have taken to push for improvement in the comments.

~~Two days~~ Weeks ago, I posted a [thread inviting tertiary students of Singapore to share how their school life has changed due to COVID-1](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iebqzr/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_is_school/)[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iebqzr/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_is_school/). It turns out that students of NTU are facing a very unique situation because of the preventive measures put in place by people in the upper echelons.

If you haven't been catching up, here's a short summary of what we are facing:

>Most lectures are online while tutorials and labs are physical lessons. Lecturers have the final decision on whether to keep their lectures online or bring it back to physical classes if their classes are <50 students.  
>  
>Most students have both online and physical lessons in a single day with little breaks in-between, so students are forced to come to campus for their online lessons because their travel time > break time.  
>  
>Because of this, our campus is flooded with students. We have no means of safe distancing, especially during peak hours in food establishments or bus stops.

To NTU students affected by these measures or for those who know someone else who is affected, it is time to make yourself heard. **All it takes is 2 minutes of your time to send an email & share this movement with other NTU undergraduates.**

It’s been 3 weeks and we still can’t find any legitimate sources. We’ve used up the 4 pieces that the government gave out long ago, and if this situation goes on, my father will have no masks to protect him from viruses. It’s not a 100% protection, but at least we feel safer when he wears them when he’s out.

My sibling went out to source and ended up getting scammed with fake 2 ply masks at exorbitant prices, I tried searching at every thrift store and drugstore that I pass by, but it was either no masks or shady looking ones. In fact, an acquaintance gave my father some “medical grade” masks which turned out to be non-3 ply ones which we could see through easily.

Right now, we don’t know what are the proper channels to go through. We understand that hospitals and clinics are having a tough time as well. Anyone knows what can cancer patients like my father do?

TLDR version: 
- father has cancer
- doc advises to wear a mask whenever he heads out
- got scammed a few times with fake masks
- can’t find legitimate sources
- still no news from the g to help immunocompromised patients

219,e1b4pa,r/singapore,t5_2qh8c,378517,queenjoyuri,False,public,,Just wanted to get it off my chest,"I feel so overwhelmed. Today, I finished my A Level exams. The paper was 3 hours long and unreasonably hard, but I went home hoping to hear a word of congratulations and affirmation from family. It really sucks because that giddiness of relief and happiness from finishing this journey of my teenage years just shattered two minutes into stepping into my home because of a mother figure who is so riddled in insecurity that she treats every single thing uttered as if the other party had plotted with evil intentions to insult and ridicule her, and projects her insecurity of being insulted onto others by being consistently toxic, narcissistic, and lacking in empathy. The paternal figure is confrontational with absolutely no ability to hold a conversation without roaring three sentences in, nor does he use any form of communication skills to, actually, communicate. No amount of reasoning helps when they simply don't listen. And I'm just typing away here going deaf from music at the highest volume so I can drown out the jabs they keep taking at each other. After so many years of this it never really gets easier to tolerate but today of all days it just feels so utterly depressing

Edit: I posted this 4 hours ago not thinking that this would even get remotely 5 replies so thank you to everyone for the genuine kindness shown to me. What made me feel down today wasn't so much the fact that they didn't throw a big fuss or reward me for completing my As (because I don't expect that LOL it's just exams) but rather the lack of warmth between family members, and its absence was especially glaring today, because I think I might have appreciated it.

220,gnbx3k,r/askSingapore,t5_363n6,44592,spookitkat,False,public,,"haven't worked in 4 years, need advice","My story is simple. I’m 23 y.o. and  haven't worked in about 4 years. This hasn't been due to laziness, but due to depression, coupled with issues that I haven't been able to overcome. 

My confidence issues regarding working and functioning are a result of a father who was overly-critical and perfectionistic. He works at the SAF and brought that same sort of mentality home. He would shout, berate and shame me if things weren't done his way. Everything had to be done perfectly. His words would drip with condescension when he spoke to me. Even something as simple as washing the dishes could get him riled up. 

As a result, I developed a huge fear of failure and a fear of making mistakes. I believe that I'm stupid, unworthy and just not good enough. I have no faith in my abilities, even simple abilities like being able to understand concepts is problematic for me. These seem like basic fears that most people struggle with to some degree, but unfortunately for me, they have become debilitating and have affected every part of my life. 

I survived in school as far as grades were concerned, but only because I could go home and study on my own. I had a difficult time with anything that required me to use my hands, like science experiments. Or my brain, like being tested on the spot. I still remember how we had to do practicals every Thursdays in JC. I would lie in bed awake the night before, unable to sleep, and sick with worry. During the experiments, I would be so nervous that my hands would be trembling throughout the lesson. 

This extended to the non-academic side of things as well. I vividly remember an instance where my teacher asked me to count some money, I was so flustered, my heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I did not even trust myself to do something as simple as count money! 

I spent all my schooling years severely depressed. I had grown up in a messed up family with a lot of other childhood trauma. It was an unstable environment, which eventually led to my own unstable mental state. 

I continued with school for as long as I could, but about 4 years ago, I dropped out of JC without completing my A levels. I couldn't do it anymore. I was suicidal, depressed, and couldn't focus in the slightest. Since then, I haven't worked either. I'm basically a NEET. I have tried going back to jc twice since then but dropped out after a short period each time. 

I had one job once as an insurance telemarketer. I spent hours and hours rehearsing the script before the first day only for them to give me a completely different script , which completely threw me off. I was really bad at it too. After the first day, I never went back. I refused the money that they offered me for the 4 hours I worked on the first day because I had done a horrible job, and I didn't feel like I deserved the money. That’s the other problem I guess. I have always believed that I’m so unworthy and bad that I don’t deserve to be paid. It’s a terrible mentality.  

 I very clearly have issues and am in therapy trying to work through them. 

Every Chinese new year, I get the same questions and same looks  from relatives when they realise I'm not working or studying. I know that people view our worth based on how productive we are. But all that does is fill us with shame and perpetuate that inner narrative that we are useless. As someone who was raised to be ultra productive all the time, when I first dropped out school, I would starve myself because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I felt like I didn't even deserve to live because I was no longer a productive member of society.

Someone in my life made a comment recently that I am depressed because of unemployment and that basically I wouldn’t be depressed if I had a job. It made me feel terribly invalidated.

Sometimes I wish I could explain to people the helplessness I feel when they ask me why I've been unable to work so far. I wish I could explain that I can’t just pull myself up by my bootstraps, and the conventional advice of staying busy, exercising and eating healthy, though useful, doesn’t have a significant effect on depression that’s caused by deep rooted issues. It can help, but not to the extent that one might believe. It’s why I was depressed even while I was in school and busy. It’s why even though I still exercise, try to meet friends when I can muster the strength, eat well, take omega 3 acids, get plenty of sunlight, I still remain depressed. 

Having said that, there was some truth to that person’s comments. In my case, although staying busy has never helped with my depression, it does affect my anxiety levels. The busier I am, the less prone I am to angst. Working may not make me mentally well, but it’s a start. At the very least, it can give me a sense of purpose. Also, I can’t hide forever. I don’t want to hide forever. 

So that leads me to the purpose of my post. I find myself stuck in a rut, wanting to work but somehow paralysed by fear. I realise that exposure therapy of just getting out and doing it might help, yet the fear continues to overwhelm me. Therapy and medication have unfortunately not helped me. 

Something that did help, though, was reading your stories. 2 days ago, I submitted this post here but deleted it, together with that acc, within 10 minutes of posting because I was terrified. There were a few who read that first post before I deleted it and messaged me with stories of their own. Reading those stories was very encouraging. This has been a lonely experience, and more than anything, I need to know that there are others who’ve been through it and managed to find their way out of the rut. I’m posting here again because I really need some help. 

If you’ve been through something similar, even if just for a short period, please share. If you have advice for me, even if you’ve never been a neet, please share. I really need the advice.

with school—i can barely keep up with the content being taught, i dont have proper understanding or a good foundation because everything is constantly being rushed so that we can start on tutorials and practice questions, and additionally, nowadays i can barely do my work without referring to my lecture notes. even with the first few topics of the year like carbohydrates and lipids, everytime i try to go back to these topics to revise i just find that the teachers are moving on to a new topic and that i have to start rushing work again...its just an endless cycle of me completing my mountain of homework just so that i can hand them in. many times when i do these worksheets i dont understand whats going on at all, and it doesnt help that quite a few of my subject teachers are the type of teachers that would ask you to “google something” when you come to them with a question. this makes me so infuriated sometimes and just causes me to lose interest in my favourite subjects like biology and math... i dont really have the motivation to revise my work anymore. additionally with our school having extremely stressful mugger culture, i feel stressed every single day because my friends are coping so well with homework and revision. of course, this might be a facade but it doesnt get rid of the fact that i feel constantly overwhelmed and stressed with schoolwork. i understand that being overwhelmed in jc is pretty inevitable but its to the point where im up every night worrying about my content revision on top of the deadlines etc.

plus: my social life in school has been pretty hard, with my closest group of friends being extremely toxic and forming group chats without me speculating my each and every move. i’ve tried to take this with a pinch of salt but its really difficult when people in the school feed on any drama they hear about and especially there are rumours going on about me. ngl i chose this jc because it was a mugger school and i didnt expect much drama because this kind of stuff really takes a toll on my mental health and i find it so hard to avoid being caught up in gossip and toxicity in general, but look what happened on the end HAHA

i think what adds on to all of this is my class being extremely clique-y and that i don’t really fit in anywhere, i pretty much feel really lonely in school with no support system and a few toxic friends oops

so yeah, i’ve been talking to my parents and close friends about it but i’m planning to approach my teachers and ecg counsellor soon about this. i know most people would advise me to bite the bullet and pull through the remaining time in jc, but i’m really conflicted and on the fence about my decision right now :’)

don’t really have a solid plan on what i’m going to do if i ever drop out but i’ll probably be relying on tuition, lecture notes and also practice papers, plus working a part-time job to cover the tuition fees. i’ve seen quite a few success stories of private A level candidates on reddit but please educate me more on the pros and cons of this!!!

any advice would be greatly appreciated <3

I read earlier this year also there was a bangladeshi contract worker  diagnosed with covid 19 that ""accidentally fell by himself to their death"".

Now this one also, but with a  video of him  stating that with covid 19 he was going to die and did not wish to live anymore, and fishy defending that the nurses alr told him it was curable, saying he was making good progress.

For a man to make a video to say that he wants to die because he thought covid 19 was a death sentence. Do we just blatantly accept  he was ""too dumb"" to understand his own language of being told its curable?

Or of course one can be influenced by depression and stress supporting a family overseas, and the key issue being he is scared to not be able to continue working to earn money. Why wasnt that point emphasized?

I honestly find it appalling how much defending of asses is going on here instead of actually going to figure out why he killed himself like it was a murder case.










EDIT: thanks for the responses and upvotes and I added some comments before editing, please read in full. 


From rereading, with the information provided, I want to point the target on Dr. Goh, I have a huge disdain for how he defended himself and others over “why there were no reason for him to kill himself”. 


 He said that there was no way they could predict his death and gave the reasons why. But I disagree. 


Hypothesis 1: I have a theory The nurse didn't actually tell the Bangladeshi man (that committed suicide) or wasn't explained clearly to that it was curable. 


“Dr Goh said the pandemic was still evolving in April and patient numbers had become overwhelming. We did the best we could 


By this sentence, there is a reasonable  possibility that from own doctors and nurse stress, there wasn't explicit explanation to the “overwhelming foreign workers coming in” that it was curable to individual persons. The slew of infected workers coming into the hospital was not just in April, but following months also there has been pouring of foreign workers that has been infected with Covid-19 from the dorm. At least a Hundred plus a day. And with Dr. Goh defence, 


"" Dr Goh said many migrant workers with Covid-19 had a ""conceptual difficulty” in understanding why they were in hospital, even after the diagnosis was explained to them in a language they could understand.” 


 Is there a possibility that Dr. Goh and other staff members didn't actually explain it so that it is comprehensible to them? 


 I could google translate English to Hindu doesn't mean I know how to speak it. 


But the more likely hypothesis 2: considering that it was understandable and the man did understand the infection was curable. What a gross saying from Dr. Goh that the man did not understand it was curable and that's why he killed himself. 


Because in the man suicide note video, it's becoming more clear when I'm not clouded by Dr. Gohs gross misinterpretation 


. “ In one, he said in Tamil: “The doctors are saying that I have coronavirus. Therefore, I do not wish to stay alive. I am ready to lose my life. Nobody or nothing has anything to do with this. I have recorded this with a sober mind.”


And supported by following quotes from the article. 


“The head and senior consultant of psychological medicine said: “He mentioned some worries about his financial future as well as worrying about his kids in India...


“Those were common concerns by patients in similar situations.”


Dr Goh said Mr Alagu would have been told, as with other patients, that he could recover from the disease. ""

 


He never said he was going to die and not recover from Covid-19, it's highly likely that he committed suicide because of job insecurity accompanied by the financial bills of hospital stay.  A visit to the hospital is a serious issue that is associated with heavy payment. He does not wish to pay, and there is job insecurity and risk for being deported back therefore he rather dies.


https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/what-will-i-need-to-pay-for-covid-19 



But I have to point the man explicitly said he had no salary issues with his boss and this was his decision and his decision alone to do it.  However, necessary investigation should ensue to not take his word at face value and check the payment records first and treatment at work. Or just what miscommunication or misconception or actual legitimate reason occurred to make it so that because of being infected with Covid-19 his future looked so bleak he'd rather be dead. I don't believe after 10 years of being the sole supporter of his family  he would just randomly kill himself. Remember the key defining reason he wants to die is because he is infected by Covid-19. . 


Aside from the gross misconduct of the doctor, and

This fluff piece. “And while the hospital has always made sure that patients can stay in touch with friends by sourcing phone chargers and top-up cards for them, its staff now make it a point to better connect with them, such as writing their names on their PPE.” 


Which I understand why they did it, but it only begs me to speculate more why he killed himself. 



There could be some issues with paying the agency ? After 10 years even after paying off the original debt of coming here they still take a percentage. But then again up to investigation. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/izga5u/infected_worker_found_dead_in_ktph_thoughts/,8,22,0,22,0.91,Fri Sep 25 17:10:39 2020,

224,hrup6c,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,jkaess,False,public,,[POLY] MY JOURNEY THROUGH NA > ITE > POLY & TIPS,"Hi guys! Don’t really know if this will be helpful to anyone but i just wanted to share my journey and some tips that may help whoever find this helpful!

**\*disclaimer**, i’m listing things that have helped me and have found it helpful throughout this journey especially it’s such an unconventional route. so to whoever needs this, feel free to read on and AMA!

some background info: I’m actually a Normal Acad student (12 point) who decided to pursue a route to ITE through the direct poly programme offered by ITE (2 years of higher nitec and if you manage to obtain a cgpa of 3, you will sort of be guaranteed a spot in your mapped course/course related to your higher nitec course)

**ITE:**

As a direct poly programme(DPP) student, you are required to start school a few months earlier than the O’Level intake. Take these classes as foundation classes for students to catch up to their O’Level peers (especially since the difference between N’level standards and O’s is quite a jump). There aren’t any exams or tests, just suck it up and go through it (and make some friends along the way!)

For my course, all the dpp students were put together in a class. So we were quite lucky that the friends we made earlier on were going to be with us for the remaining 2 years.

**TIPS:**

* **Find out your study method!** do you score better in a supervised setting or are you more of a hands-on learner? If you’re the latter, the DPP route is certainly a better choice! (after all ITE is a technical education type of setting)
* **Know what you want to do!** don’t take up a dpp course just because you want to get out of your secondary school or skip sec 5. if you’re unsure whether the course is suitable for you, ask around for guidance (trusted secondary school teachers, your peers, your parents). Use elimination method if required: e.g I don’t see myself doing this, this, this, therefore i’m only left with this choices.
* **Know who to mix with!** there will be bad influences but honestly most of the closest friends I have now are my friends I gained through ITE.
* **You can still change your course when applying for poly!** however, make sure you have a portfolio available for your change and ensure that you are prepared for their questions during the interview (e.g why are you making this change etc.)
* **Your first sem grades are important!!!!** try your best to score. with only 4 semesters, it’s going to be difficult to pull your grades up subsequently if your first sem grades are bad.

**POLY:**

I managed to get into Leisure and Events Management(LEM) in TP (now known as HTM) with a 3.2 C.GPA upon my graduation from ITE. I struggled initially, adapting to how different ITE was from Poly and that we no longer had lecturers who were there to provide us with constant feedback on our work. Despite this, I still manage to perform better on certain modules as I had already studied the basics in ITE. In addition, the projects that I managed in ITE made projects in poly feel like a norm and easier for me to regurgitate the information required.

Overtime, it became a lot easier for me to adapt to my surroundings as I realised that the key to managing my school life was really time management. I wouldn't say its' impossible to have social life, sleep and still score well as I have many friends who manage to have all of it. However, if you can't that's okay too. Know your limits and know what is important to you. As I have a part-time job, I did not join any cca and prioritised my school work. I also gain CCA points through volunteering and other positions that did not require me to make any major long term commitment.

**TIPS:**

* **Start to understand yourself.** As I start to shift into adulthood, I start to realise that the events life may not be what I am looking for. As much as I love creating and executing them, doing it as a job may not be what I would want to pursue as a career. It was demoralising as I've been studying it for 5 years. But that's okay. Find other alternatives and know what you can build through this skill you have learnt. Read up, look at some soft skills that you have learn during your time in the course and what interest you. For myself, I found out that I have a keen interest in facilities management and find passion in arts related facilities and therefore, steering towards that direction for further education.
* **Back to basics!** Similar to ITE, your first sem grades are important! Try to focus on getting your basics right as most year 1 subjects are foundational. Also, keep these notes as you'll tend to refer to them for more information time to time. Even during my time in year 3, I still refer to my year 1 notes and projects for references as many key information are present.
* **Prioritise!!!!** Know what is important to you. Don't push yourself if you know you're at your limit and don't compare yourself with others. Its' normal to take a break sometimes. The number of times I've broken down because I felt so incompetent really took a toll on my mental health. But always, talk to someone. Its' okay to put yourself before your studies sometimes.
* **CCA.** As mentioned, I did not have any CCA but took up various positions and volunteering work that provided me with CCA points. For TP, taking up the class representative position and attending events offer students SEAL/CCA points. Don't give opportunities like this up. It may come in handy whether you are looking for friends or just aiming to get the points. These points are honestly, a booster, when it comes to university applications as it really helps in showing that you're an all rounded student (especially when they ask you to talk about how you contribute back to the community and demonstrate some of your leadership qualities).
* **Use internship as a trial**. Whether it is to try something new or work in an industry you're interested in, use your time as an intern to find out about the real world. Find out from your supervisor and colleagues. Observe what they do and how they tackle these situations. Use this time to find out if you can see yourself in this industry and if not, what are your alternatives. If required, you can always use the elimination method (what are your choices > removing your dislikes > your final choice)
* **Consult your lecturers.** When in doubt, always ask! Many lecturers are really keen on helping students. I often seek guidance from lecturers as they have insights and knowledge on the industry which can be really helpful in mapping what I would like to do in future. If you have doubts on which intern company would be suitable etc, you can always check with the lecturers for more information on the company.

&#x200B;

**Other tips:**

* **Your friends may not be the best group mates.** And that's okay. Different people have different working styles and sometimes, your working styles may clash and arguments may arise. However, try to work things out and not to ruin any friendship because of projects. Ensure both parties understand that the argument you guys had is based on the project and no hard feeling should be involved.
* **GO TO SCHOOL!** I know its' tempting to sleep in a few more hours and to skip classes but TRY to attend and go for every lecture and tutorials. Sometimes, its' better and easier to absorb information if you're listening to it first hand as compared to copying your friend's lecture notes.
* **Find out what kind of learner you are.** I personally am an audio learner when it comes to receiving information. However, I memorise better when my notes are hand written by myself. Find out what style suits you best and the best way for you to retain information as all these come in handy when memorising for close book exams.
* **Study ahead of time.** I really can't stress this enough but as tempting as it is to procrastinate, studying ahead of time really can help you prevent information from leaking especially when there are tests packed back to back.
* **Planner**. If you don't like to use a planner, your phone's calendar will do fine. Take down important dates (submissions, tests, exams) With a planner, you get to see a clear view of what is due and what is coming up in the month so to prepare yourself mentally and give yourself that sense of urgency that you probably need if you have been procrastinating.
* **Mental health.** Always take a break. Go out with your friends! Take a walk! Talk to your loved ones. School can be tiring and draining. But always remember there are people who are around you supporting you. Its' helpful to rant to someone especially when things can get a little too overwhelming.

&#x200B;

And I think that's about it! I graduated TP with an above 3.5 c.gpa and an 'excellent' record on my CCA points (about 60 points for TP standard). Will be attending NUS PFM this coming semester (nervous but excited). Its' been a long journey for me and hope this post will be helpful to anyone who needs it!!!

225,fwgh1m,r/askSingapore,t5_363n6,44592,cpjx9,False,public,,IUD Singapore: 6 April 2020," I have been researching on more permanent birth control methods for a while now, and have been reading Reddit to learn more on Singaporean women’s experiences. I thought I will share my experiences and contribute for others to learn more too. 

I did my research, I wanted to do a copper IUD because: 

1. It is effective immediately and there is little/no maintenance to it. 

2. Once removed, there is no “downtime” in fertility. 

Which is helpful because I am going to be 30 this year, and I don’t want kids for the next 2-3 years. But when I want kids, then will need to have it soon cos fertility and health of kids reduces after 35. For hormonal birth control methods, such as pills, implants, IUD, the fertility may take a while to return (around 6 months to one year) after birth control is stopped. 

3. I am always protected – don’t need to refrain from sex because we don’t have a condom. 

4. It is an appropriate form of emergency contraceptive for 5 days after the incident. 

5. Since it does not contain hormones, there will not be any hormonal side effects. 

6. Although I am in a committed relationship, I do not want me becoming accidently pregnant to be the cause of getting married. I want to get married at my own time. 

7. I think sex puts women at a disadvantage because even though the man will take responsibility, the woman will need to make hard decisions (keep the baby? Abort? Get married?) even with condoms as protection, there may be a risk of pregnancy if it is used incorrectly.

8. Once pregnancy happens, your lives will be forever changed. 

9. Since Singapore is still a very conservative society, having a shortgun marriage may still be frown upon. 

I saw Queenstown polyclinic nurse previously, and she shared it will be around $70 – including consultation, the device and the procedure. It will need to be done during my period, and usually, the procedure can be done only 2 times a week. You can call on the day of your period to book an appointment. I felt the polyclinic nurse asked uncomfortable questions, such as if I am married. She also explored alternative forms of birth control, such as pills and patches – all which are hormonal birth control, which I was not interested in. She did try to push her agenda, to schedule me to do a PAP smear. The nurse also tried to dissuade from exploring an IUD because I have not had children yet. I ended up asking her if it was illegal to get an IUD before getting married or having children. 

I felt I had to be assertive to tell the nurse what I wanted, and my reasons behind my choice. Although it was not a very pleasant experience interacting with her, I felt she was only doing her job and following the nation’s narrative. 

Having your period during the insertion is recommended because your cervix will be opened wider during that time, which allows for easier insertion. 

Back to what happened yesterday: 

I was considering to get an IUD this month anyway, during my period which will be happening around 20+ April. But… stuff happened and passion overwhelmed last weekend HAHAH and we didn’t use protection. 

So I decided to get the IUD earlier. 

I called the polyclinic and they suggested me to go to KKH emergency department, as I am not having my period now. The KKH Dr will be able to insert the IUD even when I am not having my period. 

I called a private obgyn clinic, IUD insertion, including dr appt, insertion, will be $1.8k. No thanks. 

I went to the KKH emergency department around 2pm. I ended around 4pm. 

The breakdown of the bill on 6 April 2020 is: 

\- Urgent care consultation: $128 

\- Urine HCG (pregnancy test): $22

\- Uterus contraception intrauterine contraceptive device insertion: $106

\- Multi-Safe Copper 375 IUD (5 years): $40.66 after GST

I am not allowed to use Medisave for the procedure. 

I felt the procedure was rather positive, I did not sense judgement from the Dr, and he asked me why I chose copper IUD instead of other birth control/emergency contraception methods. 

The procedure was uncomfortable. It just felt like cramps and there was tugging, tapping and generally not very pleasant. I am still having abit of cramps even today, around 24 hours after the procedure. 

I will experience some spotting the first few days and I will get heavier periods. I will need to watch out for allergy reactions as well. After every period, I will need to make sure the strings are still present. 

I will need to go for another followup in 6 weeks, then 6 months. 

Yes, the procedure at KKH is a lot more expensive than the polyclinic, but I felt it brought me a peace of mind and I am satisfied with my decision :)

My whole experience to have an IUD is empowering and liberating since I don’t need to worry about the accidental pregnancy for the next few years. 

Although I rave over the IUD and felt it is the right choice for me, please do your own research and don’t just refer to my post to decide to get the IUD.",https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/fwgh1m/iud_singapore_6_april_2020/,44,97,0,97,0.99,Tue Apr  7 15:53:20 2020,

227,g9kuv9,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,specornot210,False,public,,[Uni] [Poly] [A levels] I am a Poly Grad who took Private A levels in NS AMA,"Hey all, 

Since I saw two posts so far about Poly to JC  stories, I thought I'll share my story too. At the same time, I hope to be able to both encourage people and answer any questions people might have on taking A levels as a private candidate (As there does not seem to be much info available online). 

Background:

I enrolled in a business course in poly because I had no idea what I wanted to do, I thought maybe I could grow to like business as I studied it. I was wrong, I hated studying business, I discovered that I was more inclined towards the humanities and social sciences. By the time I discovered this I already finished my first year with a miserable GPA of 2.2. However, I played around in poly too much and by the time I tried pulling my GPA up, I could only graduate with a trash GPA of 2.78.  I was blindly hoping that by some miracle I could get accepted into NTU or NUS because I wanted to do a solid humanities degree. Driven by passion, I applied to NTU 3 times. Naturally, I got rejected 3 times, not only from NTU but from every single local university I applied to. It was something that I should have expected, but still, I remember being overwhelmingly disappointed. I hated myself for being unfocused and immature in my earlier poly days. I saw all my peers entering universities of their choices and I saw myself lagging behind not being able to do anything about it. Regret hit me really hard.

The A levels: 

When I was in NS, near the start of my first year, I started researching private universities and overseas universities. I mean this was the only way forward right? I couldn't make it to my dream universities so I should settle for what I deserve, come to terms with what options I had.  (Note: I am not intentionally trying to put down private u students, but I believe given the choice wouldn't anyone trade for a better opportunity?) As I browsed through entry requirements for Aussie unis or private degrees, it sort of hit me, why don't I try taking the A levels as a private candidate? It was an immensely terrifying thought, JC students who take the A levels full time complain about the rigour and difficulty of A level subjects, what chance does a half-assed Poly grad have? As I researched more and more into taking A levels privately it seemed that many people shared the same sentiment. The success rate of private As (or retaking As) is miserably low. Additionally, when I reached out to my friends who did the A levels, they advised me not to do it, it is difficult enough in JC what about part-time without guidance? I was just setting myself up for failure. Compounding this, I was planning to study for the A levels while serving my National Service full time. How in the world am I even hoping for success against such odds? 

To be frank, I was quite depressed. The ticket out of the mess I created seemed impossible to get. Yet somehow, I sucked it up and applied as a private candidate to take the As in 2019. What followed was roughly 2 years of hell. I focused on studying as my main priority, everything else took a backseat. With this, I actually lost friends because I didn't socialise anymore. The single-minded determination that took over me was something even now I can't seem to muster up. Every bit of free time was dedicated to studying, lunch was constantly skipped to study, I cancelled plans, paid for duties just to have free time. It was exhausting. In the day I was dealing with very difficult regulars and NSFs who were very snake-ish (Clerks yall would know) in the night I was spending 3-4 hours trying to focus. Additionally, the entire time I worked towards my goal, I was plagued by constant uncertainty, I think anyone taking a major exam like the As would understand that uncertainty. But man to put up with that and the shit NS throws at you daily for 2 years makes for really unpleasant memories. 

The Results:

Come Feb 2020, I had ORD-ed and sat for the As the previous year. Results day was the deciding moment whether the past 2 years were worth it or a complete waste of money and time. I was trying to expect the worst possible outcome and it was really freaking me out. But when I opened up the results I scored a BBB/DA. Rebased from /80 to /90 I scored 77.5Rp (68.75/80 x 90) (The reason I rebased my score to 77.5Rp is because I managed to get into NUS FASS through ABA, based on past posts on r/SGexams it seems that people who got ABA scored between 77-79RP). 

I couldn't believe it, I actually did decently for once. My dreams and hopes, they could finally be real, the work and sacrifices put in weren't for nothing. I applied to both NTU and NUS. I am proud to say that I got offered admission into both courses! 

Takeaway: 

This entire journey was one hell of a ride. I think it changed me to become a more mature and disciplined individual and it taught me that even if some challenge seems insurmountable, you just might have what it takes to overcome it! The key is to believe in yourself despite the odds and work hard to your goal! I'm also damned grateful for this subreddit, the number of times I scroll here asking questions and looking for answers is uncountable. So Thank You  r/SGExams 

In any case, thanks for reading my story! I would be happy to answer any questions! especially from people who are thinking about taking the A levels privately!

I will be starting uni soon (SIT@TP), and I live in Jurong. I am used to long commutes since secondary school and poly as my schools were at Bishan-YCK area. 

However, this one is by far the longest commute and I feel abit overwhelmed 😅 If you commute from the west to east (vice versa), I would like to know how it’s like adjusting yourselves going back and forth from both ends of Singapore everyday hahah

233,i7mc14,r/singaporefi,t5_36z35,19136,caesady,False,public,,Advice for a Uni Student: AIA Pro Achiever? RSPs?,"Hello, I'm a beginner who's just begun looking into ways to invest. Just some BGI: Since I'm not working, I'm looking to invest about 2/3 of what I have, which is about 10k total. 
Recently been approached by a friend who's selling AIA's Pro Achiever and I'm currently trying to decide if I should commit to the 13 years. 
For those who don't know, this is what I've managed to find out:

- 2.5% charge p.a (so about 0.21%, assuming I invest monthly with them.

- 13 years total, with a surrender fee of 60-70% if I want to stop the plan before 10 years

- $200/month mimimum

- 5-8% return according to what we have discussed

- transparency about which funds my money is going into
The clear advantage I see is the fact that the pro-achiever is apparently managed by mercer. With fund managers, I would reasonably assume that it provides and edge over ETFs.

But on the other hand, I'm worried about the 13 year commitment because a lot could happen in the future. Especially as I'm in university now and don't have to worry about bills, debt, other living expenses.

Meanwhile I've been doing my own reading and am considering an ETF RSP with FSMOne + roboinvestors like kristal. (To take advantage of this recession period while at the same time taking small steps towards active investing) 

- 0.08% fees 

- Lower minimum - 50SGD if I'm not wrong

- more personalisation if i choose to (Even though I am only planning to invest in SGX through FSMOne)

Any advice, or other alternatives would be greatly appreciated (: Apologies for the length of this, but I'll be glad to supply any other info if it'd help!

Edit: thank you so much for the answers. I was leaning towards the ETF RSP/Roboadvisors option but now I have a more concrete idea of why this is the better option.

235,f7pv93,r/SGExams,t5_3ph6l,77619,outroqi,False,public,,[A Levels] U for H2 Econs throughout JC to A in A Levels,"i received my A level results yesterday!!

h2 economics has been the bane of my existence since i entered jc. i have never gotten above an E in any test ever. j1 ct1, lecture tests, class tests. mostly U, some S. for promos, all my classmates were happy that they had improved from CTs and i remember my guy friend was so happy that he got a B and when he saw me so happy he asked if i had gotten A. little did he know, i had just scraped an E (46%) and was just overjoyed to pass. when jc2 came, it was worse. my micro was already weak, added to completely new topics from macro.... i started to zone out and skip lectures to eat lunch with friends or study other subjects. for one of my lecture tests, i actually scored 0/20. my own teacher wrote ""what happened to you?"" on my script. somewhere after ct1, when i scored a U (again), i woke up and realised A levels was just under 8 months away. so i started putting in double the effort i'd put in in j1. i started studying the content myself and going for consults. and i actually understood the concepts, but for some reason i couldn't score in the essays. mid years came, and i scored a big fat U. not 0 anymore, but still a fail grade. i was discouraged, and i knew time was running out. i signed up for econs tuition as a last resort.

the tuition did really help, the notes provided were concise and summarised my school notes with all the right keywords. i started to feel more confident in my answers, and i thought maybe if i could get a C for prelims and then a B for A levels, i would be satisfied. but when prelims came, i got another rude shock. i scored an E, again only scraping a pass by one mark (46%). meanwhile my friends and classmates were all celebrating with their Cs and Bs and even As. the same guy friend mentioned above scored an A and this time i turned away from him before i could break down. i cried when i received my econs results. i felt like the double effort i'd put in over the last few months to catch up on content and build my micro foundation was for nothing. 

but this time, i knew my problem. i had severe time management issues -- often when the exam finished i hadn't even started on the third essay. i went to my tuition teacher and school tutor for help. they both told me there was only one way -- to write 3 essays a day, in 2h15min, until i could train myself to finish a paper.

by this point, there was only a month left to the econs paper. and i felt like there was no hope. being idealistic, of course i wanted the A, but was it realistic to go from E to A? nevertheless, i started writing. it sucked. after the first week, i still had barely enough time to even start the third essay. my hands hurt from the constant writing. i had to use the same tactic for csq as well. i finished 9 or 10 school papers and yet i still couldn't finish writing. the same thing happened in the second week. unbeknownst to my friends and then-bf, i was crying in the school toilet on study breaks because i felt like a failure. i even wished i had taken any other subject but econs.

but as time passed, my writing speed did improve. i found that the more i wrote, the more i was able to recall content faster. and it really helped. but by then, i faced a new set of problems. my micro had always been weaker than macro and in my bid to finish a paper, i'd neglected revising my content. with A levels the next day, i walked in knowing almost nothing about market structure or the tax/subsidy part of DDSS. i was only strong in market failure and the whole of macroeconomics, which was what i was banking on for the essay.

the paper was bad. everyone remembers the csq question about globalisation being reversible like wtf is that?? and for the essay, afterward when i went on reddit, i saw everyone had done the market failure qn. and written sources that i hadn't thought of. i knew i hadn't done spectacularly. i'd left some marks blank for the csq (mainly the 2m questions). but at the same time i was proud of myself, because it was the FIRST time in my whole life i'd actually managed to finish an econs paper!!!

the week before results day, i started praying. praying for at least a C. because i didn't have high hopes. one of my friends from my clique comforted me, saying she had gotten E in prelims and then A in A levels but i felt like that was really the miracle case, 1 in 1000 kind of chance. i thanked her but told her to be realistic about the situation and not to give me false hope.

when results day came i didn't dare to open my cert for an hour. those letters would decide my whole future, at least for the next few months. i had two panic attacks and had cried twice by the time an hour passed. my best friend and i promised to open our certs together, and so when i finally opened my cert, my eyes happened to land on the bottom letter first. i saw H2 Economics -- A. not a C, not a B, but the most coveted A. i tell you there was no way to describe the way i felt in that moment. i screamed. and then i broke down. i couldn't believe it. i was shaking and gasping and i felt like my skin was tingling all over and like i was about to faint. 

honestly i still cry because i'm so overwhelmed that all the effort i put in paid off despite all the odds. so i want to say it's possible. please don't give up. and i'm sorry if this post sounds like i'm bragging, but i'm honestly not --- as someone who has been an econs failure throughout, i just wanted to share my joy with reddit because my heart is so full to bursting :"""") and of course if anyone needs any tips feel free to pm me i'll try my best to answer!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7pv93/a_levels_u_for_h2_econs_throughout_jc_to_a_in_a/,26,169,0,169,0.98,Sat Feb 22 16:25:57 2020,A Levels :snoo:

1. Time management

I started working since year 1 of university so managing time well is exceptionally important. Every minute saved from each module makes a difference. Before class, I read the lecture notes (a quick scanning if time is tight is better than nothing). By having a rough idea of what will be covered during class b4hand, I can absorb the materials more easily as the professor teaches. Pay attention in class, so you know what questions you have. Ask these questions during the break or after class (There will be a couple of students doing that, so don’t worry). This helped me to save time because I can clear my questions instantly. I would have spend more time if I revisit the notes some time later to figure out the answers to my questions. Leave the figuring out part to tutorials - more efficient and effective. [Listen](https://bit.ly/2MNJfXJ) to some nice music while studying helps too

2. Proritise your work constantly with a to-do list. 

Time will pass real fast. Keep track of the assignments, and prioritise your work. Weekly planner is quite useful for me, as I need to keep track of important dates (project group meetup, exams, tutorials due date etc). The planner can also help organise your tasks that you need to accomplish so you can have a clear picture of what your day/week is going to be like. 

3.Choosing modules

Going to university after Junior College is quite overwhelming for me, primarily due to the change in learning environment. One of the questions I was having to refine my strategy on what modules to take and when to take it every semester. My tip is to read module reviews, to get a rough idea of the modules you intend to take. Note that the professors teaching the modules may vary every semester, so ask on top of asking your seniors.

4.Explore 

Take the modules you like or interest you. Get out of your comfort zone. Popular modules that some took are language modules, computer science modules. You can save quite a lot of money by taking modules in schools. I have friends who picked up 3 languages. But of course, gauge your interest beforehand. Since Data Science has gained so much popularity, do your homework to see if it you are up for the challenge. Before I took the computer science modules, I went to look at the list of resources to get a sense of what will be covered in school. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h0ve0p/uni_life_in_universitytips_nus_fass_modules/,9,145,0,145,0.99,Thu Jun 11 16:43:17 2020,:redditgold: MUST-READS: University :snoo_smile:

And he even wrote a god damn letter to my higher in charge that they should take me out of this vocation. 

Moreover, my concerning parents couldn't bear the sight of my nasty skin and took me to see a dermatologist specialist, whom wrote a letter for me to endorse at the MO to take me out of this course because the conditions of saf driving school is really not very healthy for my skin

Despite the fact that I explained to the MO about how my itching also affects my driving, (can't concentrate on the road if its itching - some instructors even asked me whether i wanted to ooc or not because my skin looks bad but I was stubborn at that time and wanted to go on). The god damn medical board still thinks I'm fit for driving course and will send me back once my excuse driving ends. I dont get it. All the overwhelming evidence pointing to the fact that this course is horrendous for my skin and they still tell me that my skin do not fit the criteria for a revocation.

Guys, I need advice

#Tl;dr I think I accepted a job offer but am now faced with a better offer from current employers to ''make me stay'' (I wasn't leaving cos I hate them, just to clarify), how do I ''cancel'' my acceptance of the job offer



I completed a part-time diploma this year with straight A's, and as I was feeling very motivated I was planned to continue on to degree in private uni. Unfortunately due to a lot of reasons I was unable to secure a loan. 

So fine, I decided that I'm simply gonna delay my plans a little and keep working to earn half my school fees, and then hopefully by the 4th term I'll be able to rely on my sibling to help me apply for a joint loan.

However, current job pays me a survivable salary (1800) that suited me before, but now with my savings intentions it is severely ''lacking'', simply not enough. Therefore I decided I need to go out there and find me a new job.

I did a bit of reading and asking around and the more common advice was to secure a job before quitting. So that's what I did. 

Two weeks ago I started job hunting, last week I did 3 interviews from 3 different clinics. This week I was offered one that was really good, offer was 2300.

I told the recruiter (middleman, have not really communicated directly with the prospective employer other than during interview) that I was really happy with the offer. 

They are aware that I'm only able to join by Jan 2021 (during circuit breaker my current employer forwarded hours to financially help me get by and so if I still intend to survive these months it would take me max until end December to return the hours) so I was especially happy that they could accomodate such a long wait time.

I finally go to my current manager to put in my resignation. Things to note: I fricking love this clinic, I love my colleagues very much, and I'd say I've contributed well as a nurse and performed better than I care to acknowledge (I have anxiety and low self-esteem, makes me think I'm the biggest fuck up). I explained the job offer and all (which clinic, which branch, expected salary) when asked. Manager didn't show any strong emotion and was very understanding. 

Within one hour of me doing so my manager sits me down again to let me know that together with my employer she has come up with an offer. In essence, it's better than the offer from the new clinic, plus I get to stay with my beloved colleagues. I didn't give any answer, said I'd think about it, simply because I was overwhelmed. 

Current clinic counter offer no outpatient/dental benefits butin the 2yrs 3mths I've been there I have never once used it (wasted, I know). Current clinic will require me to go to other branch on select days, only 2 different branches that are highly accessible, 1 being v close to home. Prospective clinic is a bigger group (seems more stable/ structured) and has outpatient/ dental benefits, has 7-ish branches that I also have to travel between from time to time, but all are q far from home, at least 1 hour travel, all with vastly different opening hours (to cater to different crowds).

This is honestly my first time changing jobs under such circumstances and I don't know if I'm just dumb or naive but I really have no idea where I've made a mistake, I feel like I made several though. I also have anxiety and I'm honestly _panicking_ so I just need some people with functioning brains to help me

I have questions:
1. Am I now in a way ''legally bound'' to this new clinic cos I expressed my gratitude and all for their offer? I haven't sat down to sign any papers yet but they're already planning where to place me and when I start
2. Was I actually wrong to not have discussed this earlier with my current employer?
3. Am I ethically wrong to accept this offer from my current employer? I don't even know if my seniors are paid that much, plus I'm really stressed that my employers see this as a ''favor'' to me (I hate favors, never know if I can ever adequately repay them)
4. I'm very much keen to stay with my current clinic, is this seemingly greedy of me? Like I'm money-hungry? Also how do I tell this to the prospective employer?
5. Is there anything I should clarify before accepting or rejecting this offer?
