I’m a representative from a Youth-Corp affiliated, student organization called ‘ALittleChange’. Our organization is looking to expand and we’ve turned to Singapore’s largest student run reddit thread to recruit! If anyone’s interested in starting a COVID related initiative, looking for opportunities to contribute to the volunteer space in Singapore, or simply looking to rack up some VIA/CAS hours, do consider joining our society. Signups and further information about what we do can be found on our website at [https://www.alittlechange.sg/](https://www.alittlechange.sg/)

That being said we’re initiating a card drive in the next 2 weeks to show our gratitude and support for the COVID-19 testers at SGH’s microbiology lab. These healthcare professionals have been working tirelessly since the start of the epidemic to assess and analyze the numerous swabs that come from the various testing facilities around Singapore but unlike their front-line counterparts, they receive comparatively less attention. If you want to show your appreciation for the researchers at SGH’s microbiology lab, sign up at the link below and we’ll contact you with further updates on how you can help! Thank you and stay safe friends 😊

1,SGExams,32019,[UNI] 2020 NUS Architecture Aptitude Test and Interview Experience,funcmx,livefloppingwhale,1585974513,46,1,"I wrote this so that I could help out the batches below us on the NUS Architecture aptitude test and interview! I will be updating this if I got in successfully. Anyways I’m not bothering to hide who I am, so feel free to call me out if you know me

**Background:**

I was an art DSA student in RGS, thus my academics results are not as strong, getting a GPA of 3.60 in Y4. In RJC, I took up H2 Physics, Chemistry, Math and Art and my results dropped even further, barely scraping 2 passes to be promoted. I managed to somehow pull it up a little by A levels. My RP is 81.25 without my Higher Chinese and the IGP for Architecture in 2019 was 77.5. I applied for the course (second choice) between 10-15 March and got informed that I was shortlisted for the interview on 27 March.

Due to COVID, the interview style for us is quite unique and completely home-based. My aptitude test is from 8.15-9.30am and my online interview on Zoom was at 10 am (4th April) with the first panel. However, before that (1st-2nd April), we had to submit a portfolio of 5 works (as a PDF file) on an online platform showcasing our techniques and skills in different mediums or subjects. They can range from paintings to sculptures to fashion design, as long as they showcase your skills.

The link below is my portfolio, in which I put in my most recent digital (don’t shame me, it’s fan art) paintings (2020), 1 pen observational drawing I did during one of my remedial lessons (2019), 1 realistic watercolour piece (2017) and a painting that won 1st prize in an international art competition (2017). As you can see, there’s literally nothing on architecture in my portfolio. (I kinda sneakily clicked on some people’s portfolio and I was rly shookt to see people with a full-on architecture portfolio. Respect.)

[https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo](https://imgur.com/a/iPAk9Vo)

In the PDF that was sent to us, we were required to prepare a few things to get ready for the aptitude test:

Pencil, colour pencils, eraser, stapler, fast-drying glue, clear tape, ruler – 30cm, scissors, penknife, small cutting mat (10cm x 15cm), 2 pieces of A4 size black cardboard –paper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of A4 white cardboard–paper thickness between 200 to 220 GSM, 1 piece of tracing paper.

1 day before the test/ interview:

I wanted to get ready for the types of questions they might ask, so I researched on:

1. Singapore’s/the world's best architectures and what makes them good. Some examples you might want to read up on might be Gardens by the Bay and Marina Bay Sands etc.
2. Famous architects and the buildings they have designed
3. Architecture concepts and how to make paper architectural models (to prepare for the aptitude test)

Aptitude test:

They gave a super long quote about hierarchies in buildings and how the people in the past were just beginning to see buildings as systems with hierarchies, and then asked to make an abstract model out of some philosophical question posited. Some questions include ‘can multiple hierarchies coexist?’ and ‘what are some ways that hierarchies can overlap or interfere with each other?’ and gave us about 1h 15 min to complete a sculpture out of paper in response to these question. It was confusing asf tbh.

I was nervous and was literally spilling glue everywhere and my hands were shaking so bad omfg. The 1h goes by very fast when you’re trying to think of what to do, sketch out a model and at the same time try to visualise it in 3D and make it. Anyway this is the link to my model that I had submitted, if anyone is curious. Clearly I did not read the words ‘abstract’ while reading the question but I figured it was fine (I hope)

[https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu](https://imgur.com/a/gBjbqAu)

Interview:

There were 2 interviewers in my panel and they were both super chill and nice, they didn’t want to stress me out, so they told me to screenshare and show my portfolio and my model to them in my own time. I first shared my model and talked about how I interpreted the passage, about how hierarchies make me think of contrasting elements and juxtapositions. I then described my structure and how I made use of all these contrasting elements and used symmetry to make it balanced. At some point, one of the interviewers leaned into his computer screen and said ‘hm! Good enough’. They asked me 2 more questions about my structure, why I decided to present it as a building and why the symmetry. They care a lot about your thought process and how you interpreted the passage, I think, rather than the actual finishing of the work.

Next, they had me screenshare again and talk about my portfolio in my own time. As I talked about my portfolio, they were super curious about it, and asked quite a lot of questions, like ‘is the first one from an anime?’ and ‘was the third one a class assignment?’ and ‘were the realistic pieces digitally manipulated?’ (for the record, they were not). They saw a watermark on my first artwork and asked if I had a social media, so I briefly said that yeah, I have an art Instagram! But they were the most interested in the last piece, they asked for a walkthrough of my thought process for it and so I did.

After the portfolio, they asked the standard question ‘why do you want to study architecture?’ and this is where I recommend you to spam some of your knowledge on architecture that you researched beforehand. I didn’t really do it, but looking back, damn I should have. They then asked ‘so why is archi your third choice?’ and I just went like fdsjkfnskjanfdf I regretted my choice

Anyways they had me leave the meeting once they were done and the interview time overran by 10 min, and I was literally the first one to be interviewed, so don't expect your interviews to start on time.

All in all the aptitude test was a pretty scary experience, but the interviewers surprisingly made the interview session pretty chill, and they try to make it less awkward. Good luck juniors! I hope this would help you know what to expect a little better, or help any batch below that might have an epidemic during the year they’re applying for Uni.

I have a long time horizon. I have a fairly stable job despite the epidemic which pays well, although the pay has certainly taken a substantial albeit temporary hit. I do not foresee requiring to use the money invested even in tougher circumstances. I should have sufficient back up for a few years even if I lose my job which is a remote possibility. Although it wouldn't be pretty.

The fund has an average net return of about 20% annually over the past several years. Of course, past performance is no indication.

So, the risks I could come up with are as follows.
1. I could lose everything invested if the hedge fund closes shop.
2. I have little to no control on the investments.
3. I suppose there's no dividends to collect.
4. The money will be locked in for some years.

I'm sure there are many other things I need to consider. I would certainly appreciate any opinions on this.

0,singapore,219990,Please be a bit more concerned about Covid19,ffr8z6,Rubriclee,1583740258,87,1,"Singapore has been faring quite well thanks to the quick and hard work of our government and healthcare officials. However, we are to expect worse days ahead and even deaths to be reported. Yet I see long queues for food at many places, and also comments like ""It's just the flu"" which are meant to assure people and reduce panic.

While I do not agree with supermarket runs and other selfish behaviour, I think we do need to at least a little bit more concerned about Covid19. Here's why:

* It's not just the elderly and those with existing medical conditions who will be critically ill. Even the young and healthy (except perhaps little children) can have their immune systems go into overdrive and attack their organs.  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/).
* Dr Richard Hatchett--Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations--wiho has 20 years of experience dealing with infectious diseases considers Covid19 to be more frightening than Ebola, MERS and Sars due to its infectiousness and much higher fatality rate than flu (compared to what was initially predicted). [https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs](https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs) 
* Even if local healthcare is capable of handling Covid19, it will not be able to do so if hospitals are overwhelmed by huge numbers of cases. This is what happened in Wuhan and is happening in Italy.  I find this report by a surgeon in Italy to be extremely compelling and moving: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony\_of\_a\_surgeon\_working\_in\_bergamo\_in\_the/?utm\_source=share&amp;utm\_medium=ios\_app&amp;utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf) 

So can we all be at least a bit more concerned and continue to play our part in fighting this virus? We will not win the war by panicking and stockpiling; by blaming governments and countries, people of various races, etc. This is a global war! Be vigilant but stay calm. Stay home if you have even just some respiratory symptoms (and isolate from family members if need be) and see a doctor immediately if it worsens. Cover your mouth with tissue when you cough or sneeze. Be nice to one another, and remember to take care of both your physical and mental health.  That's all I have to share for now.

3,singapore,216847,(yet another COVID thread...) Youngsters don't care much about it? Older generation care too much?,f7setj,johnotcena,1582377437,16,1,"This is simply my personal observation, but does it seem like teenagers care about COVID to a less extent compared to adults in Singapore? As a student in JC, I've seen many not wearing masks (even in the canteen during peak break periods), not really caring about washing hands with soap regularly, and not abiding by the rule of sitting a seat apart during lectures (this is the rule enforced for social distancing). Meanwhile, my parents' generation (50+ years old) are executing so many hygiene practices. From washing hands with soap immediately after coming home (first thing to do before anything else), to keeping up with the news on the number of cases in Singapore, to doing 'house arrests' to their children so that they do not go out. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, of course, I'm making a general observation. Of course, some adolescents care about COVID a lot, and vice versa. I don't think anyone is wrong or right (I personally care about COVID enough to follow some basic practices, but not to the extent of being so 'germophobic'). But my question is:

&amp;#x200B;

**WHAT CAUSED THE SPLIT IN MENTALITY TOWARDS THIS COVID SITUATION?**

&amp;#x200B;

For the older generation, perhaps they:

\- Care about their children so much, that they take this situation seriously

\- Have gone through such an epidemic in 2003 (SARS), so they are more cautious

&amp;#x200B;

For the younger generation (mine), perhaps they:

\- Are getting irritated at their parents' diligent care (to the extent of forcing children to not go out with friends), hence in rebellion, they show that COVID is not that serious of an issue to warrant such cautious measures

\- Are also irritated that school life has changed drastically. 'MASS ACTIVITIES CANCELLED' screams out a lot of pain for students who were looking forward to school events (orientation, especially orientation).

\- Have not understood the severity of the situation (not caught up on the news? was not alive to experience SARS epidemic?)

4,singapore,216728,Don't push your weight around,f7my7n,chintokkong,1582342651,6,1,"Here's an article from mothership: [Ho Ching says ‘counterproductive’ for Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi to call for Asean to lift travel bans](https://www.mothership.sg/2020/02/ho-ching-china-wang-yi-young-man-counterproductive/)

.

Here are some quotes from the article:

&gt;Referring to Wang as a “young man” in a Friday, Feb. 21 Facebook post, where she shared an article from Nikkei Asian Review, Ho said it is “counterproductive” for the Chinese foreign minister to urge other countries to lift the travel ban.

&gt;This is because China is still imposing restrictions on its countrymen within its own borders, the 66-year-old wrote.

&gt;She further said: “There is a time and place, and this is not the time and place.” (*referring to the meeting on 20 Feb where ASEAN and China foreign ministers met to discuss on working together to deal with the virus outbreak*)

.

More quotes from the article:

&gt;Wang had also voiced his concerns about Singapore’s “restrictive measures” to Singapore’s foreign minister Vivian Balakrishnan on Wednesday evening, Feb, 19, saying he hoped “normal exchanges” between Singapore and China can resume as soon as possible now that “the epidemic has eased and the situation is under control”.

.

Outwardly in public, China often appears polite to Singapore, but we don't know what their government really thinks about us.

But we do know that China is big and powerful, and is starting to push its weight around the region in recent years. And there were times when we can even feel them pressuring us directly.

We know China is going through really tough times now. It's a very terrible situation over there right now. We also know their economy is significantly affected. But please, *don't push your weight around*, and make demands on us to solve certain specific problem of yours, especially when they are inappropriate. Because we also have our own set of problems.

.

Just read this forum's top post a while ago: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f79g8a/rant_from_a_simple_ntuc_part_timer/

Similarly, this message goes to customers who go around stores trying to find and buy much wanted items during this period of time.

*Don't push your weight around.*

Everyone is stressed. Don't pile on the stress. Even if you are worried and scared and angry and frustrated, do remind yourself that the person in front of you may be feeling so too.

Don't regard the other person like shit.

.

I'm not sure how long this virus situation will last. But it's going to be a testy period for all of us. People are scared and angry. Lots of tension in the air. And in our frustration, it's easy to lash out and start pushing *all* blame on others.

People pushing all blame on the government. Government pushing blame on the people. One group angry at another group. Another group angry with this group. This group angry with that group.

I'm not such this is how we can get through a crisis.

.

Let's remind each other, we don't just have internal problems. We are facing external issues too.

Just like how we don't want countries of power to push their weight around on us, whatever power we have (however limited it is), let's not abuse it for our own selfish benefit/ego/pride at the expense of others.

Today there r 40k+ cases. Granted, Singapore is a MUCH MORE compotent and credible government. I think we all trust they are fighting the virus with all they got. My question, however, is why not close schools and encourage companies to work from home? Despite all the containment measures, credible sources such as the CdC and harvard gazette claim that spread can only be delayed , not stopped. Even considering the delayed response of the CCP, the fact remains that  even after a month of whole cities going on lockdown, the situation has not settled down - we are yet to hit the inflextion point.  The health chief came out today saying that SG is in a very precarious position too. Closing schools for one should prevent further transmission ( especially since most students go through public transport) , and not to mention children have weak immunity. Further still, We DEFINITELY do not want them to pass on the disease to the sick and elderly. Most infected areas have closed down schools - even without many cases.  Most sgans work from home atleast once a week ( or so i read in a cna article) ; i would think the amount of meetings and direct contact with clients is going down : infact these therm checks r a waste of precious company time

\- Lower population density in major cities (the majority of people in the larger cities live in town houses, not apartments).

\- Lower reliance on public transport (at the cost of the profusion of motorbikes, urban pollution, and greater likelihood of deaths from garden variety pollution-induced respiratory illnesses).

\- Fewer transit flights from elsewhere; reducing the total number of possible imported cases.

Nevertheless, the quarantine measures that contributed to the success may only be described as ""ruthless"". With SARS, all 63 cases in Vietnam was linked to one patient zero, an American business men who stayed in Hong Kong prior to arriving in Vietnam. He fell sick, was transferred to a private France-Vietnam hospital where a WHO doctor, Carlo Urbani, diagnosed him for SARS. This doctor later contracted SARS and died. Before his eventual passing, Urbani and co. urged Vietnam to close the hospital. Vietnam government basically decided to go to red immediately. Command, control, coordination and information gathering was centralised.

The hospital was closed and most of the staff remained inside. The net effect was: [""The net effect probably was that they gave SARS to each other and not to the outside world""](https://www.nytimes.com/2003/05/07/world/sars-epidemic-containment-vietnam-halted-sars-saved-life-nurse.html). The chain of transmission was stopped cold, at the cost of 63 infections, and among them, 6 deaths. The Vietnamese government may be frivolous about many things (like garden variety food poisoning or quality), but not about (so-called) national security threats (not just pandemics, though). (I stole that last line from \[[“The Italians are frivolous about many things,” he told me, “but not about counter-terrorism.”](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/09/edward-luttwak-machiavelli-of-maryland)\]. The success in cutting SARS transmission chain was particularly notable especially when later study showed Vietnamese healthcare workers during SARS [did not used PPE consistently](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3322918/).

One feature of the mobilisation for quarantine in Vietnam was the immediate mobilisation of the military. The military despite not being ostensibly trained for pandemics control (as well as other disasters) is usually the only organisation with a lot of spare resources, including manpower, specialist knowledge (biological threat defence), logistics, command, control, communication, coordination, transports, food, supplies, organisation, housing, etc ... that is not normally already engaged in the civilian economy; thus representing a strategic reserve often mobilised for things that are not war.

For this nCoV quarantine, for eg:

\- A regimental barrack and headquarter was transformed into a [quarantine centre](https://tuoitre.vn/ben-trong-khu-cach-ly-phong-dich-corona-cua-quan-doi-sat-bien-gioi-viet-trung-20200207093338312.htm) with the regimental troops serving as guards, logistics, supply, security, and health care. The conditions in these centres are frankly, not nice if not Spartan. 

\- At home quarantine are ensured that they remain quarantined by twice daily visits from the local police and healthcare workers.

\- Escapees from one of this quarantine centre sparked nothing less than a manhunt. Photos, pictures, names, copies of ID cards are immediately distributed to local hotels, motels, restaurants, eateries to corner and capture the escapee.

It's also less embarrassing than the one our parents and grandparents had where they worried about their lanjiao shrinking due to swine flu. 

""The boy’s problem had started at school, where he’d heard rumors that tainted pork—inoculated against swine fever—could cause koro. Earlier that morning, he’d eaten a steamed bun with pork in it. When he went to urinate, he looked down and felt his penis start to shrink. “Frightened, he quickly grasped the organ and rushed to his parents shouting for help.”

More people followed. Before long the hospitals were flooded with patients. Pork sales plummeted. The Ministry of Primary Production announced that both swine fever and the vaccine were harmless to humans, but the epidemic seemed to accelerate. For seven days it continued, until finally the Singapore Medical Association and the Ministry of Health started appearing on television and radio to announce that suo yang was a purely psychological condition, and that no one had died from it. There was an immediate drop in the number of cases. By November, there were no reports at all.

In the end, a total of 469 cases were recorded, though the real number was certainly higher, since the survey only included Western hospitals and did not account for traditional Chinese doctors. All patients who were interviewed by doctors had heard stories about koro before they experienced it. After the epidemic, the Chinese Physician Association concluded that “the epidemic of Shook Yang was due to fear, rumor mongering, climatic conditions, and imbalance between heart and kidneys….” Meanwhile, a Western-oriented “Koro Study Team,” concluded that koro was “a panic syndrome linked with cultural indoctrination.”

11,singapore,229826,Who should you donate to? -- Looking at charities offering Covid-19 support and their use of funds,g4i9xy,TheStateOfIt,1587340636,36,1,"Recently, you may have seen and heard of [multiple campaigns](https://give.asia/campaign/donate-your-solidarity-payment-to-break-cycles-of-inequality#/) and [stories](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/sporeans-donate-their-solidarity-payouts) about people who are donating their $600 payout to charities around Singapore to support vulnerable groups. You may have even donated to them, which is fantastic.

Me being stupid old me, I hadn't realized I didn't have my bank account registered with the government until they kindly hit my phone up to let me know. Thanks, big G. Anyway, given my extra time waiting, I wondered who exactly I should my $600 to??

Singapore, to be fair, has loads of charities for numerous causes, from protecting vulnerable women and sexual assault survivors to migrant workers to elderly healthcare and so on. Nearly every cause under the sun is covered by an IPC (Institution of a Public Charter, basically the fancy acronym for *""charity""*). You could get lost figuring out which one to donate.

To me, the biggest issue was making sure **the money I donated was put into good use.** I've covered that quite a bit [in the past](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aeeulj/heart_of_god_church_an_indepth_look_into_their/) as one of my major concerns about donating money for a good cause. And now, in a time where we realize helping our fellow residents of the nation, citizen or not, is starting to become a pressing issue, I thought I could help a little.

This is to make sure whoever your donating to is *trustworthy* and makes sure your money goes to the right place. As far I can see, most of the charities here appear to be, but just for comparing how money is used, I think it'd be good to check on it.

*****

### What I'm Doing ###

In case you didn't know, Singapore has an [online portal for charities](https://www.charities.gov.sg/Pages/Home.aspx) where you can look up each charity, their expenses, donations and so on. Make sure you have Singpass first, as some IPCs require Singpass to see their financial information.

This site does present two problems, though. First, the site is **very clunky**. You go to the second page of a search, the site crashes. It can take horrifically long to load at times. And even then, quite a chunk of financial information is woefully off, categorised in all the wrong places and vastly different from their actual income statements/balance sheets.

Secondly, it doesn't tell you how *good* the charity is. One can look at a charity, see it has 15 million in donations, and go *""dayum that's a nice charity""*. But it doesn't exactly tell you that only spending 3% of that 15 mil on charitable activities is bad, which it very much is.

To help, I've decided to **rank charities in Singapore** based on how they **use their expenses efficiently**. To determine how efficiently charities are using funds, I'm using [CharityWatch's ranking process](https://www.charitywatch.org/our-charity-rating-process). CharityWatch is a watchdog for charities in the United States to ensure that most of their expenses are going towards actual, charitable causes rather than something else (*like owning shopping malls or starting music careers, for example*), and also ensuring they are efficient in their fundraising efforts. 

As such, I will give charities an overall rating from **A+ to F** rating based on the measures above, so that you don't donate to a charity that wastes its dollar a whole lot. An **A+** means they spend over 90% of their expenses to charitable causes *and* expend less than $5 on fundraising for every $100 used for charitable programmes. There are many variations either way, which I'll try to explain in the rankings below.

All these charities listed are either [in the major solidarity payment donation page](https://give.asia/campaign/donate-your-solidarity-payment-to-break-cycles-of-inequality#/), part of [Preetipls's Fundraiser](https://give.asia/campaign/preetipls-x-utopia-for-migrant-workers-ngos-433#/) or those under [Giving.sg's SGUnited page](https://www.giving.sg/sgunited). Mercifully, a majority of them lie in the A range, with a few quirks here and there. Do take note I left some charities out, primarily concerning hospitals and NUS, because just filtering which payments are 'charitable' are difficult due to their nature. Just don't forget about them can already :--)

The only thing I feel CharityWatch is missing from their ratings are how much *income is left unspent*, which could really affect whether your donation is being kept in an IPC's pockets. I didn't fully keep track, as I can understand why some charities keep more than they expend, but I will highlight particularly egregious examples, in addition to areas where the Charity Portal messed up in their financial evaluation.

Lastly, just because a Charity scores low, *doesn't mean its truly evil*. Most IPCs have **vague definitions** of charitable expense. Some just loop every single expense into one, some leave out factors other charities include (*like salaries etc.*) and some just list every expense without definition. I can tell you, after taking an accounting module in uni, I am *none the wiser*. 

These charities, no matter how great/poorly they rank, all seek some good in the community, so if they score poorly here, **DO NOT TAKE MY WORD AS GOSPEL**. Just double check for those that don't score as well, and keep your cause you care most about to your heart when donating.

*****
### Ranking the Charities ###
*(All based on their latest financial info, if available)*

**A+:**  Transient Workers Count Too (TWC2), SPD, Children's Wishing Well, Beyond Social Services, Home Nursing Services, REACH, O'Joy Care Services

Most of these causes have used over 90% of their expenses on charitable programmes and haven't wasted a lot on fundraising, indicating efficiency in their use of funds. TWC2's finances are also reflected incorrectly in the Charity Portal as they double counted on expenses in their financial sheet, so they've done a lot better than originally looks.

**A:** HealthServe, AWARE, CARE, Metta Welfare Services, Trybe, Dover Park Hospice, Alzheimer's Foundation, Club Rainbow, Yong-En Care Centre, New Life Stories, Singapore Red Cross.

Both of the charities in Preetipls' fundraiser rate at A or above, indicating your dollar is going to good use if you donated to her :--). I'd also, personally, advocate for donating to AWARE, they deserve it for the assistance they lend to women-at-risk and sexual/domestic abuse survivors. I got stuck a bit at covering *Trybe*, mainly because they didn't record fundraising expense, but elsewhere they look alright. 

However, even though they are ranked at A, there's no guarantee that *New Life Stories* are that great, as they only expended less than half of their income in the previous report on charitable causes. They *are* a childcare centre, so maybe they were just saving for a new centre, who knows. I'm no expert.

**A- or B+:** HOME (A-), SG Children's Society (A-), Boys' Town (A-), *Community Foundation of Singapore* (A-), Singapore Breast Cancer Foundation (B+), Free Food For All (B+), Care for the Elderly (A-)

Although HOME *only* scores an A-, mainly due to a relatively low percentage of expenses towards charitable programmes, I would still highly suggest donating to them, given the conditions migrant workers have had to go through and their current, ongoing situation. On a personal note, I'm donating my money to them, TWC2, AWARE, HealthServe, Beyond and Red Cross.

The reason why the *Community Foundation of Singapore* is in italics is because, out of 39 million in total income, only **9 million** was spent on chartiable programmes and causes. I can give New Life a pass, but this I just *have* to draw attention to. I doubt they will be like this in this current time, though. Benefit of the doubt. Just ensure when donating to them, your money goes to the right place/people. 

Free Food for All and Boys' Town also had anomalies. Free Food For All didn't have their finances reported in the charity portal, so I had to check their own financial statements. Even then, a lack of statement on fundraising activities could mean the B+ may not be fully reflective of their use of money. 

Boys' Town was quite the reverse, as though their finances are listed in the portal, the *actual* financial statement is nowhere to be found. Still, I'd suggest donating to Boys' Town as well for their work for at-risk children.

**B or B-**: Filos Community Services (B-), Singapore Hospice Council (B), Food Bank (B), Hagar Singapore (B-)

These ones are generally less efficient with their dollar, though there's no real egregious cases like those I pointed out earlier. Only trouble was that Food Bank's Charity Portal page was all over the place from what I can recall, where their expenses are all over the shop as recorded in the portal. Other than that, they still use money somewhat efficiently, so no real massive problems here.

**C or D:** Blossom Seeds (D), Food from the Heart (C)

I've heard of Food from the Heart and the supposed good they've done a lot, so they surprised me with their low ranking, especially since they supposedly spent only *36%* of all expenses on charitable causes. Bit of a shame but oh well.

Additionally, I think Blossom Seeds also gets a bad rap here. If you look at their actual financial statement, their expenses to charitable causes may appear to be greater than that listed on the portal. However, I was unsure about this, as it mainly concerns tricky to classify payments (i.e. salaries? Also, vehicle upkeep isn't classified despite this being an elderly transport service). I came up with a **B-** for them with an alternative figure, which is still low but *wayyyy* better than the D as ranked here.

### So what now? ###

Honestly, all the efforts I've seen in Singapore so far have been so damn heartening. Even if it is reactionary in nature to social issues that has been persistent for decades and exacerbated by this epidemic, the support for these vulnerable groups has been tremendous from a significant portion of society (or portion of my friends, either one).

I have to say again, though, *DO NOT TAKE THESE RANKINGS AS GOSPEL*. There could be all sorts of kinks in accounting stuff like this. I'm not majoring in it, I only took one university module in it. I tried my best to make sense out of a clunky portal, a rating system from a different country that misses out certain aspects of charities, and whatever financial info I know/I could find. It's good, but **not perfect**.

Honestly, I thought I'd find some IPCs listed that could abuse this situation for profit, but honestly, I don't see too many negatives. Some could be more efficient with spending, some could use more of their income, but on the whole, most seem pretty trustworthy to me. Which is better than what I can say about other groups that claim to be IPCs (*here's looking at you, mall near Buona Vista*).

The very last thing I can say is, if you *don't* need the $600 in this time, **PLEASE DONATE**. Donate to social issues you care about. Donate to vulnerable societies in Singapore. And donate to groups that you can *trust*. There can be many groups in Singapore willing to take advantage of this situation for a profit. 

I hope this ranking, while not the most comprehensive, can at least account for some of this, and make sure your donations are going to good use.

**TL;DR:** Most charities listed above are good to donate to. That's nice :--).

This Act does quite a few things, but one of the things it does is _give power_ to the Minister for Health to order (via a _control order_) people to stay at a place (i.e. stay home), close premises or facilities, and restrict gatherings, etc., as needed, _to control the incidence or transmission of COVID-19_.

This **power** lasts for a year. (Of course, the act could be repealed before that, if the epidemic/pandemic ends.)

Now, a _control order_ that puts into place the restrictions that were announced last Friday was also issued today using the powers given to the Minister for Health. You can look at that [here](http://www.egazette.com.sg/pdf.aspx?ct=sls&amp;yr=2020&amp;filename=20sls254.pdf). (Again, this link will become invalid in a few days.

So some of you may say, that is an unreasonable course of action at the time because it was not announced as a pandemic yet, etc. so to close our borders immediately on the premise of a possibly contained virus is uncalled for. But I think that any kind of easily contact spread virus = grounds for at least immediate border closure to all flights originating from the country of the epidemic. We did not do this for MERS-CoV because MERS is difficult to transmit from person to person even with close contact, so the chances of it become a pandemic is low. But all viruses that are easily contact spread from person to person such as Covid have high potential to become pandemics. It is a cause to raise the alarm immediately. This is especially the case for Singapore because the majority of our tourists come from China and we get large numbers of Chinese tourists every day (before Covid) and therefore we are one of the most at risk communities. 

Now that we only made the decision to totally close borders two weeks ago, we take on an unnecessary increase in casualties and economic damage. Since the end outcome was total border closure anyway, the net loss for the country = present and future costs incurred due to additional influx of cases - revenue earned from keeping borders open for a few more weeks. If I do very simplistic calculations based on tourism and investment gains from 2018, the immediate loss incurred from a border closure on day 1 of receiving notice, is about 3 billion's worth in 3 weeks - far less than the 40+ billion we are setting aside for current and future measures.

Of course, there would be some more cases after border closure due to people getting infected with the first wave of tourists/returnees but not manifesting symptoms until 2 weeks later (hence possibly spreading it during this time). But I think it would be far less than the amount we currently have due to keeping borders open for another few weeks before closure, letting more infected people enter and spreading the disease. 

My opinion is that the initial low number of cases (80-100) and the slow rate of increase (several to ten a day) made us complacent of the situation, that we overlooked the possibility that it was the calm before the storm and that there were many potential cases still brewing in our midst (now showing symptoms). So now we have the second wave, which is all the people who came in before and during those few weeks when the borders were still open/ those that interacted with them.

So the conclusion is, if I were the government, I'd have taken a guaranteed few billions in economic loss over potential tens of billions, and closed the borders to at least all China incoming flights (or all flights) upon receiving notice of a easily contact spread widespread epidemic. Perhaps it would not have been ""reasonable"" then, but looking back at it from now it would have been the correct thing to do, since we ended up having to do it anyway. The short term infection figures from a virus with a long incubation time and being asymptomatic during that period are VERY misleading, and to base measures off those figures is a mistake that practically every country made and hence are facing the same pattern of a huge spike in cases. I think this is a lesson to learn about the pattern of how pandemic cases rise and we need to prepare for the correct initial response if such situations ever happen again.

its too late now. but it seems like my sompo traveljoy purchased on feb 16 for bali apr26 doesn't cover travel cancellation (unless perhaps if indonesia closes down bali).  


right now singapore's quarantine on return policies for asean countries has basically put off any reason to travel. its an outright ban yet the way its worded that probably doesn't allow travel insurance claims. (ie: you can travel if you want, just that you will get locked up at home for 14 days on your return)  


 I was reading a few policies. eg: 

MSIG:

We will pay for the unused travel fare, accommodation charges and deposits the insured person has paid or payments which the insured person legally has to pay and which cannot be recovered from any other source, if the journey is unexpectedly and unavoidably cancelled due to any of the following reasons which take place within 30 days before the start of the journey but after the date of arranging this insurance and the journey.

7. Epidemic or pandemic at the planned overseas destination as declared by the World Health Organisation.

  
so if i did buy msig, i would be covered for the trip cancellation.  


so any frequent savvy flyers, please recommend insurance companies that do what is reasonably sensible.

When there's people going all the way to senoko industrial area to purchase disinfectant, you know things are getting ridiculous.

Overnight in Asia, we hosted a call with Professor John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at The University of Hong Kong and expert on coronaviruses. He was a key member of the research team at The University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He has been studying coronaviruses for 25 years. Below are my notes transcribing the call. 

Quick summary: 

Look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it’s below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.
 
My notes from the call below:
 
Q&amp;A Session with Professor Nicholls:
 
What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official “confirmed” cases?
 
People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is &lt;1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons: 1) either China’s healthcare isn’t as good – that’s probably not the case, 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARS there’s probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There’s a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to SARS and MERS we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to SARS to MERS. So a correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold.
 
You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that?
 
There are two ways to detect a virus: 1) Through the genetic material – DNA or RNA or, 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors’ labs look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests they are using PCR which give you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there’s another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can’t turnaround in 5-10 mins which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases.
 
Your colleague at HKU estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb first we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past?
 
Those figures did not take into account restriction on travel, quarantine etc. These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically, these models have not been all that accurate.
 
When do you think this thing will peak?

Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit.
 
Sunlight will cut the virus ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 mins and in the dark it’s about 13 mins to 20 mins. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That’s why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infections rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing is still cold which is why there is high infection rates.
 
In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10 degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And high humidity the virus doesn’t like it either. That is why I think SARS stopped around May and June in 2003 – that’s when there’s more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavourable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold – it’s always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favourable in Asia in about May.
 
The second factor is that of personal contact. With SARS once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal oral route, there was much less emphasis on the masks, and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of the social hygiene (than China). So in those countries you should see less outbreaks and spreading. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open-  there’s more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries the sanitations systems tends to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May.
 
People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it’s all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials – is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say “I told you so”. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn’t come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It is Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus – the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people etc…
 
What do we know about the transmission rate? It’s been estimated around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic?
 
This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don’t have with this virus).
 
We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages at the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine to the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers.
 
Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the R0 of 2.5 or 2.7.  Do you think that is high or low. What does that mean?
 
Measles was about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it’s about 2.2 as it’s being transmitted within the community.
 
Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with SARS and MERS.
 
There’s talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don’t think there are any super spreaders.
 
What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic?
 
Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That’s based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days.
 
There’s a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shredding the virus and he was asymptomatic.
 
That’s something about kids and we saw this with SARS. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus which we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer.  SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn’t the virus killing the patients it was the body’s reaction.
 
We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer.
 
Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms or mortality rate?

SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity – try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc.. The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it’s those with the co-morbidity are most at risk. For the seasonal influenza that’s also what we find. It’s the people with the co-morbidity that have the increase mortality rate.  Having said that there’s a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30.
 
I think this looks more like the seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity.  Now that we have better case control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%.  When you look at all the death reports – separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China.
 
Mortality rate in China – is much higher? Why?
 
Its related to the environment. In the high income countries you don’t have as high a population density, higher level of environment control and hygiene. In Indonesia – it’s unlikely to spread much as it’s very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that’s unlikely – too hot there’s not a lot of travel there. Europe – possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher.
 
At this stage it’s a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the “lethal virus” but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don’t call that “the lethal influenza”.
 
There’s news reports that antivirals are being used and that it’s working what are your thoughts on that?
 
With SARS it didn’t seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seems to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it.
 
Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit.
 
The problem with the antivirals – because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so can now test it to see what will work and not work.
 
Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything?
What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals – it’s to take the work load off the staff which is likely exhausted.  
 
In HK with SARS we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the work load off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit.
 
The recovery rate now higher than the deaths rate? Thoughts on that?
What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn’t know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don’t get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge.
 
I’d consider a patient recovered if he’s been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid were very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn’t know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression.
 
I haven’t seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged.
 
Evidence of E-coli?
Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK.
 
What does it mean for a patient to have recovered?
That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That’s the criteria for Hong Kong. But there’s no good data or guidelines on this.
 
What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population?
If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don’t have a ”spell check” so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won’t mutate.  This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months.
 
Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. 
With SARS we didn’t know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn’t be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workload off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan.
 
If we look at the serious cases being reported it’s about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for the severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption?

In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that’s why it’s important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It’s very important to dissect it out.
 
Would it be too early to make conclusion outside of Wuhan? It’s still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making assumption with very little data and very early data?

That’s all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages – there’s such a variable. But now for political reason people are far more aware of the virus so it won’t be as epidemic as it was early on. There’s far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behaviour. Which I’m not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far less outside of Wuhan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f06uuc/clsa_conference_call_with_coronavirus_expert/,0.0,"['&gt; Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity.   \n\n""Really meh...""  \nTime to fit in more outdoor exercise in the next month or two.']"

&amp;#x200B;

This general election will be like no other that we have experienced,” Singapore’s prime minister, Lee Hsien Loong, declared this week, announcing that the city-state would go to the polls on July 10th. Procedures may be a little different from usual, given the continuing outbreak of covid-19. But the outcome will be just like the previous 12 national elections: the ruling People’s Action Party (pap) will romp home with a huge majority of seats.  


The pap is a slick political machine which has held power since before independence in 1965. Its share of the popular vote has never dipped below 60%. Even at its lowest ebb, in 2011, the party retained 93% of the elected seats in Parliament. Last time around, in 2015, it won almost 70% of the popular vote, perhaps boosted by the death earlier that year of Lee Kuan Yew, Singapore’s first prime minister and the incumbent’s father.  


The pap’s popularity stems in large part from its competence. It has presided over decades of rapid economic growth, with little of the corruption that plagues neighbouring countries. But the party is too thorough to leave its prospects up to voters. It has devised an electoral system that makes life difficult for its opponents. In most constituencies a party must field a slate of four or five candidates to compete, with the winning slate taking all the seats. The need in such seats to find multiple well-known candidates, pay for all the deposits (at almost $10,000 a pop) and win over a much larger pool of voters puts a heavy burden on opposition parties. In fact, only one such constituency—Aljunied—is not in the pap’s hands, having fallen to the Workers’ Party in 2011.  


The agencies that draw electoral districts and supervise the vote are not independent, but answer to the prime minister. Exacting rules govern everything from the size and placement of signs to a ban on negative campaigning. Candidates must not say anything “that may cause racial or religious tensions or affect social cohesion”.  


The rules will be even tighter than normal this year because of the coronavirus. Rallies are banned, which is a blow to the opposition, which usually counts on big jamborees to fire up cautious voters. Instead, up to five members of a party can campaign together on “walkabouts”. Each member of the group must stay a metre away from the others and from the public, to limit potential contagion. The government will also help candidates to stream online pitches to voters. Campaigning on television and radio is strictly limited, but that did not prevent six ministers, including Mr Lee, from giving televised speeches earlier this month outlining the pap’s vision—nothing to do with the election, just part of the fight against covid-19.  


The biggest hindrance to the opposition, however, is the perpetual stifling of public debate. The constitution lists no fewer than eight different reasons why Parliament might limit freedom of speech, and it has made eager use of them. Since the previous election, the government has strengthened laws on harassment and contempt of court and dreamed up a new law to expunge online statements it deems false: the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act. A tightening of the Public Order Act requires organisers of public protests to apply for a permit at least 28 days before the event or face a fine of $14,400 or up to a year in prison, or both. The overall effect—driven home by frequent investigations and prosecutions of opposition politicians for assaults on truth and the good name of the authorities—is to discourage criticism and participation in parties other than the pap.  


Nonetheless, the opposition has won over some notable recruits. Lee Hsien Yang, the prime minister’s brother, has joined a new opposition outfit, the Progress Singapore Party (psp), which was founded last year. Its leader, Tan Cheng Bock, formerly served as an mp for the pap for 25 years but speaks now of a climate of fear in Singapore. The party wants to boost job creation, delay any rise in a nationwide goods-and-services tax for five years, and lower the voting age from 21 to 18.  


The government’s main vulnerability stems from its handling of covid-19 and the economic damage the epidemic will bring. At first Singapore was held up as a model in the battle against the disease. Then tens of thousands of cases began to emerge in dormitories for migrant workers. In total the country has seen more than 40,000 infections. In response, it imposed a “circuit breaker” from early April until mid-June during which most Singaporeans had to stay at home. Partly as a result, the government forecasts that the economy will shrink by 4-7% this year.  


The pap’s “4g” cadres—its rising fourth generation of leaders—have been given leading roles in managing the pandemic. **Their lacklustre champion, Heng Swee Keat**, the finance minister, who is expected to take over from Mr Lee during the next parliamentary term, has devised several stimulus packages worth a total of $72bn, almost 20% of gdp. More than half comes from Singapore’s formidable reserves. “Our reserves allow us to deal with this crisis from a position of strength, and give us options in a period of uncertainty like this,” he says.  


It should all be enough to retain the support of anxious voters. In recent surveys, some 80% of respondents told Blackbox, a Singaporean pollster, that the country is heading in the right direction. The real test for the pap will come after the election. A prolonged downturn will gnaw away at the basic compact between the pap and its voters, who disregard its domineering and nannyish ways because of the economic growth and social stability it has provided. Meanwhile Mr Lee has said he will retire before his 70th birthday, early in 2022.

32,singapore,243613,Why We Shouldn't Have an Election Right Now,hed1fq,TheStateOfIt,1592912324,44,1,"This'll be a fairly short post, and I may miss out on a few points that could be brought up here, but this is why hosting the election right now is a dumb move.

-------------

**1 -- Unfairly Disadvantages Certain Groups of Voters**

I don't know if there'll be any change to the voting procedure to previous General Elections outside of the simple move of ""*follow safe social distancing, wear masks and stand metres away from each other y'all*"". In which case, this will be a disaster.

You see, in the [Voter FAQs](https://www.eld.gov.sg/faq_voters.html), there is *no mail-in voting* allowed. If you're hospitalised, cannot vote. If you're on a SHN, cannot vote. If you cannot make it, physically, to a voting centre, cannot vote.

This will compromise *several* voters. From those issued a Stay Home Notice, Quarantine Order or similar stuff, they obviously cannot teleport the ballot box to their room, so that's them done. Any elderly or people with pre-existing medical conditions are putting themselves at risk whenever they go out and vote. No matter how few cases there are, there's still cases. It's either risk a life-threatening disease for these people (heck, for others as well) or don't get a chance to make a change for you and everyone else.

**1b -- The Health Risk**

Already touched on it a bit on the last point, but now we all are summoned to gather in one place to vote. Obviously there'd be restrictions at the actual location, but what about transport? What about areas outside the boundaries of polling booths (like nearby malls or similar areas)? Everytime I go out to shop, I have a sense of fear and risk. Now that'll be put into everyone gathering in a single location to vote.

**2 -- Abandons Citizens in the Middle of a Crisis**

Parliament is dissolved. Ministers were often the ones we saw on TV that announced all the changes to current social distancing protocol. Some of these changes were by the week, some were by the day. As much as I don't like the PAP for being not so transparent, at least I can say they were **there**, making changes and finding out how to recover.

However, now, literally *DAYS* after Phase 2 is in place, seeing the biggest lift in restrictions for Covid-19, they choose to leave Parliament. What happens if a sudden spike emerges in cases? What if there's more incidents that arise in this state of entropy known as 2020?

In a pivotal time of crisis, where the ship could sink anytime, the ship has been abandoned just to confer on who should steer it.

(*Disclaimer: I know it's just one institution out of many being dissolved, but still, there's bound to be a knock-on effect after this.*)

**3 -- The Obvious Effect of Covid-19 On Voters**

Okay, now I'm just gonna put a disclaimer here and say anything and everything can affect how people can vote, and how ruling parties, in any scenario, can convince voters to keep voting for them. But in the middle of a global issue, with everyone looking at MPs more than ever, this is probably the biggest point.

I don't know any specific term (not a polsci major), but there's lots of signals being sent that certain national messages targeted towards recovering from Covid-19 are being used for political gain for certain parties (and as much PAP implications this hold, this also applies for several other parties as well). This epidemic is being politicized at a time where, honestly, it shouldn't be. If we're supposed to 'stick together' or whatever the current buzzwords are, the last thing we need to get through this is something that can divide everyone, from families to friends, co-workers to commuters.

**4 -- It's Not Needed**

We literally have until April 2021. We didn't need to drop everything in the middle of the year. We could've waited until Christmas. Or CNY. That's a *loooooong* way away. Why the panic? I know they had it planned for April or some shit before Covid, but why have it now **before the whole situation is dealt with?**

----------------
There may be some gaps missing in my argument. This was done *really* quickly in response to the announcement just now. I suggest checking out any other feed that will cover the elections (*say, CAPE or SG Climate Rally or just your parties' webpages*) to get more accurate information about the upcoming elections. I may have missed some info rushing this, so lemme know any other reasons why this election shouldn't be held now.

Vote wisely, y'all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hed1fq/why_we_shouldnt_have_an_election_right_now/,1.0,"['When an election is held is determined by when is most ideal for the ruling party.

Because the PAP will hold elections whenever they determine is best for them, not best for you or best for the public.']"
33,singapore,240803,Anyone else receive this anti-BLM message on whatsapp? I'm not sure if this is propaganda or not. I'm suspicious as to its origin,gz5zdu,casperzero,1591644327,11,0,"&gt; From a Singaporean Chinese living in Singapore：
&gt; 
&gt; I questioned the white police’s abuse of blacks, but my American colleague made me think.
&gt; 
&gt; Yesterday, my white American colleague David and I participated in a video conference about the export project. He was late for 30 minutes. After the line connected, he joined the meeting. He explained that it was late because the demonstrations by the people caused traffic jams.
&gt;  
&gt; After the meeting, I specifically asked him not to go offline, so as to chat with him about the unrest in the United States.
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him: Is the United States safe now?  He told me it was safe, I smiled and sent him a few pictures:
&gt; 
&gt; Demonstrators burned the American flag, etc.
&gt; 
&gt; While he was looking at the photos, I asked ridiculously: Is this America safe?  If yes, please do tell me what is unsafe?
&gt;  
&gt; David understood what I meant. He smiled embarrassedly, shrugged, and said: This kind of thing is very common in the United States, but this time someone recorded a video, plus the police did a bit too much. So a large-scale black riot occurred.
&gt;  
&gt; He said it casually, as if nothing unusual had happened.  
&gt; 
&gt; I asked him: Don’t you worry that black people might one day take up arms and retaliate against white people?
&gt;  
&gt; After listening to my words, David gave a hearty laugh. He gave me a grave look. He said to me:
&gt;  
&gt; James (my English name), black people are absolutely afraid to use guns against white people. They are not stupid. What kind of consequences will result from doing so? 
&gt; 
&gt; Black people are very clear about this point.
&gt;  
&gt; Since the establishment of the United States, black people have served white people, and this is what it means for them to live.  In the United States, as long as a white man is killed by a black man, the black man will be sentenced to death or life imprisonment. However, if a white man kills a black man, the probability that the white man will be guilty of murder or manslaughter is very low. The most serious being a fine or a short sentence.
&gt; 
&gt; After hearing what he said, I felt very indignant. I told him: The United States is a country with serious racial discrimination. Apart from white people, any colored people living in the United States have no human rights and are denied.
&gt; 
&gt; David was puzzled and asked me why I was angry.
&gt;  
&gt; I said: I feel sad and indignant for the black man who died tragically under the knee of a white American policeman.
&gt; 
&gt; David listened to me and asked me in a serious tone: Are you really sad about the death of black people?
&gt; 
&gt; I said: Of course, should an innocent person be abused and killed by white policemen, shouldn't he be sympathized?  
&gt; David listened to me, sighed, and then asked me:
&gt;  
&gt; Do you know who has the lowest status in the United States?  
&gt; 
&gt; “Black"", I blurted out.
&gt; 
&gt; He smiled contemptuously and told me point blank: it is the Chinese!
&gt; 
&gt;  Looking at my startled expression, David continued:
&gt;  
&gt; The status of black people in the United States is higher than that of Chinese people, and black people are particularly willing to attack yellow people, especially Chinese students and other Chinese.
&gt;  
&gt; The situation is this: white people despise everyone, and black people despise the Chinese: this is the contempt chain.
&gt;  
&gt; David asked me whether I knew that during this riot, many Chinese shops and Chinese students have become the targets of black attacks?
&gt; 
&gt; I had serious doubts about his remark, because the riot has nothing to do with Chinese or Chinese students.
&gt;  
&gt; He sent me some photos of the riot scene:
&gt; 
&gt; Chinese restaurants and grocery shops lit by demonstrators.
&gt;  
&gt; Even a Chinese student who was a takeaway deliveryman became the target of the demonstrators' attack. His head was seriously injured, his head was dripping with blood, his eyes were smashed, and his life was in serious danger.
&gt; 
&gt; Seeing my glum silence, David went on to say: Black people are the most willing to attack Chinese or Chinese students. When they are angry, unhappy, and need to vent, Chinese often become the target of their attack.  During the previous epidemic, many Chinese and Chinese students were attacked by black people:
&gt; 
&gt; Because the Chinese were wearing masks, a black man hit him with more than 40 punches in the head!
&gt; 
&gt; A black man poured sulfuric acid into the head of a Chinese woman who came out and dumped garbage, causing her terrible burns!
&gt; 
&gt; David told me: James, you are sad for the death of the black people, and you are humbling for them. I really have a hard time understanding.  When black people face white people, they are very pitiful and cowardly, but when they face Chinese or Chinese students, they are different.
&gt;  
&gt; They will never let go of any opportunity to insult or beat your compatriots. Can you understand what I mean?

(Credit: David Kiu on Facebook) 

I rarely post on FB apart from the odd vacation post, mainly because I believe everyone is entitled to their point of view and I seldom see the need to share mine. I’ve posted on climate change, conservation and similar topics in the past because these have enduring significance and impact and I thought important enough to share some views. The elections this coming Friday will also be an event of enduring impact in Singapore, hence I thought to post some thoughts.

I can understand the many grievances that have been voiced against the ruling party. Certainly much of the unhappiness is real. Life is a rat race from the time we go to school, throughout our working life and even post retirement as we need more funds given we live longer lives now. Even after slogging, there is no iron rice bowl and things continue to get more expensive and life continues to get more competitive, with foreign talent in our schools and workplaces. It can feel like life is neither good nor fair. Has the ruling party really done a good job? Have they lost their way? Do they have our best interests at heart? Do they listen, or know what is really needed? Do they deserve the vote for the next five years? Should we hand the reins to the opposition? Will they do a better job? Will having more opposition voices make things better? These are legitimate questions. Ultimately everyone needs to come to a conclusion about these questions for themselves this Friday because we are voting for the future of our families. The below is just my personal view about five grievances I’ve heard championed by some of the opposition parties in some form or other.

First, is a grievance that life is getting tougher and the government has failed us. On this, I think it’s worth remembering that it is a fact that Singapore is a tiny island nation with no resources. One that could easily become irrelevant to the rest of the world. This one fact means we are destined to hustle. It means we need to carve our own relevance. It means we need to force the rest of the world to want or need us. That means working harder and smarter than everyone else so others don’t eat our lunch. If you want to be a Singaporean, there’s no escape from this reality.

To be Singapore is to constantly fight for relevance. It doesn’t matter which political party is in power or what the balance is in Parliament, life will never be easy in Singapore because of this fact. If you want an easy life, you have a better chance emigrating as many have done in the past. It doesn’t cost anything for someone to paint a picture of an easier life to win votes, and it is tempting to believe it is possible. But you had better be sure because if you buy into it only to realise later you’ve been sold a pipe dream, it will be too late to earn back the hard fought position and relevance that has taken decades to build. I generally view with suspicion anyone offering an easy solution for an easier life because that’s just irresponsible and ignoring the reality of our circumstances.

Second, is a grievance that the system is not equitable or that we don’t have enough social mobility. There are many different variations of this grievance and it manifests in unhappiness with ministerial salaries, or in the tuition epidemic, or in “elite” vs “neighbourhood” schools, and so on. Some of this resonates with me. My heart breaks every time I see an elderly person having to sell tissue paper or collect cardboard. This is not the Singapore I want.

The truth is that there is indeed social and income inequality in Singapore. But this is also evident in every society. You only have to look at the waves of protests around the world in the last few months to know this. For us, we came from a society that was equally poor a generation ago, so any progress from that point will by definition be more unequal. My parents were not graduates but their children, my sister and I, were both able to graduate and find good jobs, thanks to their hard work to provide for us. Not everyone was as lucky. More can and should certainly be done to make sure that no one is left behind and that everyone has a chance to move up.

To close this gap, there are only three ways. Lower the penthouse, raise the basement, or build a lift. Lowering the penthouse is generally a bad idea as it is a disincentive, so we are left with the other two options.
Both will require the government to be able to invest more which requires that we can continue growing our economy. Without that, we will never be able to afford the social investments and mobility we need. To dish out more from a shrinking pie will just cause the pie to shrink faster. Anyone can say that we need to invest more in this or that. But the reality is that you cannot have more investment in education, in healthcare, in social assistance, in innovation, all at once. Social investment is one area where the community can and should do more rather than just rely on the government. I generally view with suspicion anyone who tells me I can have my cake and eat it, because you can be sure you will be charged for two cakes later.

Third, is a grievance that the government has allowed too many foreigners to compete and take jobs at the expense of equally qualified locals. This is a delicate issue. Most of us at some point have probably thought to ourselves, “I could have done that job just as well or better, so they must have hired that other person instead because he/she was cheaper foreign talent or they hired their own (assuming the hiring manager is also foreign).” We rarely think, maybe we are not competitive or not hungry enough.

The fact is that companies are just looking to hire the best person for the job at the best cost, regardless of the nationality. And increasingly also regardless of the location. I’ve never heard of a company wanting to hire a less capable and less qualified person who is also more expensive. I probably wouldn’t want to work for a company like that anyway as it won’t last too long. As many people have now been working remotely for several months, companies are also realising that many jobs can be just as easily performed in Singapore, or Mexico, or Egypt, or Rwanda, or any number of places where the quality could be just as good for a fraction of the cost.

So to force a company to hire a Singaporean in Singapore at several times the cost yet at the same level of capability will more likely cause jobs to leave Singapore and result in fewer opportunities for everyone here. The only true solution is not to force companies here to hire more expensive Singaporeans, everything else being equal, but to help Singaporeans become the best candidates. Or else we go back to the first scenario, that Singapore becomes irrelevant and unnecessary.

By all means ensure that companies hire fairly and give jobs to equally qualified locals. But would anyone really want to be hired even though they are the worse candidate, just because they are local? Some countries do that but that is not a road that leads to sustainable competitiveness. I generally view with suspicion anyone claiming to be able to protect my job for me, because generally no one can do that for you if you don’t do it for yourself.

Fourth, is a grievance that we need more diverse and dissenting voices to ensure checks and balances (aka no blank cheque), and give more voice to those whose interests are not represented. This is quite a fashionable point of view, because it sounds appealing in theory to have more scrutiny or debate.

The strange thing to me about this though is that those that claim to offer this rarely really offer any view that is not already being heard. Just because the final decision is not one that represents the minority view, doesn’t mean that the diverse views were not considered or consulted. In the end, no decision can make everyone happy and the job of the government is to make the best decision for the majority, while continually listening and taking into account the needs of the minority. In the pandemic response for instance, the first wave of support did not do enough for self-employed persons and this feedback was heard and addressed in subsequent waves.

Indeed, it feels more likely that the opposite risk is more worrisome, which is that of creating populist politics that force governments to make decisions that pander to vocal minorities or provide temporary benefits, at the expense of long term interests or the silent majority. Or worse, prevent governments from making unpopular decisions for the long term benefit of the majority because of the loud voices of the vocal minority.

After all, a tax hike may be the right thing to do but will never be popular and not having a strong government to push such policies through will mean that we shy away from the tough decisions needed. Imagine if the government does not receive a strong mandate. Then the next time they are faced with a potentially unpopular but right decision, they will naturally think twice because it could cost more votes. Would we want a government that avoids making tough decisions even though they are the right ones?

What we actually need is a government that really listens well and makes policies that benefit the majority of the people for the long term. Having more opposition doesn’t necessarily create this. It is created by strengthening the institutions that represent these interest groups, whether it is the arts, or SMEs, or religious groups, or others. Some of our NMPs for example have done a great job of this. I generally find suspicious anyone asking for votes solely on the basis that they can be a check and balance, because it usually means they are not really bringing anything else valuable to the table.

Fifth, is a more recent argument that the new generation of leaders in government is not as capable, evidenced by how the COVID response has apparently been a failure, and then that somehow this is proof that a parliament with more opposition would have done better. On the COVID response, there are certainly opportunities to improve but I believe the fairer characterisation is more success than failure. Could we have locked down earlier, or introduced quarantine earlier to prevent imported cases, or acted earlier to stop the dormitory spread? Maybe. All great with hindsight.

But looking at the current situation around the world, I struggle to find examples of any other countries that have performed better in managing this crisis. I for one would rather get COVID in Singapore than anywhere else in the world. We are not yet out of this but I am certain when we look back after all the dust has settled, we will find that what we have accomplished is a rare feat that most countries will be envious of.

One personal anecdote. The company I work for has opted to return or refuse COVID related government relief funds all around the world, on the principle that these funds would be better spent helping others in more need. While working on this, I found that nowhere in the world were relief funds disbursed as quickly or without the burden of red tape, as it was in Singapore. While others were still scrambling to work out what to do, Singapore had already put money into people’s hands.

Would it have been as fast if we needed to debate every aspect of this in parliament? Would a parliament with more opposition resulted in a better or faster outcome? I struggle to see how this could happen. I generally view with suspicion anyone promising improved speed or better outcomes without showing how they would achieve this, because words are cheap.

During election season, it’s normal that opposition parties come out with campaign promises that criticise the status quo and promise an attractive alternative. No one will vote for you otherwise. I don’t blame the opposition parties for appealing to these grievances. It’s just the nature of politics.

It’s difficult sometimes to try to address these grievances because the feelings are real and that needs to be acknowledged rather than made to feel invalid. When the ruling party does this, it creates a sense that they are disconnected or not listening by trying to tell people you should not think or feel this way.

Hard truths are difficult to tell, especially during election season. It doesn’t make you popular or win you votes. But these grievances and arguments need to be examined closely to also remove the false promises behind them. That’s the job of the voter, distinguishing between the empty promises of those appealing for your vote, and real policies that will make life better.

In my mind, one test is this. If we rewind the clock to the start of the year, would I trust any of these opposition candidates to do a better job? Some of them were already in parliament so actually the question is, if we had a few more of these other ones, would I feel more comfortable and confident? Or less? During a crisis is when we most need the best government we can have. There is no bigger crisis than the one we are still in.

As I said at the start, ultimately each of us must come to our own conclusions. Our earlier generations have worked hard to put us where we are now. At the very least, we owe it to them, to ourselves and to our families to reflect on our choices and be sure for ourselves which is the mirage and which is truly the oasis.

40,singapore,139512,Need Life Advice - True Blue Singaporean Who's Now Black and Blue and Getting the Blues,9sla7i,xbriannova,1540879685,110,1,"Hi guys, I've been stalking this reddit for months now, and owing to how my life is going, I thought I should seek advice from my fellow Singaporeans here. I'm not sure how to phrase it all, but I'm going to try. (WARNING: GIANT WALL OF TEXT AHEAD)

Basically, I'm having a very serious crisis of sorts that I can't even classify with any confidence. I can't call it a mid-life crisis because I'm pretty happy with my job. Is it a personal financial crisis? Maybe, but I know for sure that I'm not starving when it comes to food or even savings and insurance - though I still have problems in this arena, they're not life threatening. Is it an identity crisis? No, because I know who and what I am.

I guess I'm just afraid for the future, of where I'm going with my current course and outlook in life, and I'm not sure if I'm making the right moves. I'm also afraid for the country's future, which is, of course, very much related to me since I'm a citizen of Singapore. Bringing it all together - basically, my worst fear is that Singapore becomes a dystopian nightmare and I'm going to suffer for it, since I'm a freelancing tutor.

I guess I'll break up my question into huge chunks. Let's start with money and work. Basically:

(EDIT: I've decided to leave out everything else not under work and money to a later date)

\- I earn under S$1,000 during off-peak months (usually November and December, under S$2,000 during the holidays (CNY, mid-term holidays, eg) but at my peak, my income balloons to up to S$3,700. This year is the first year I've worked as a Full-time tutor for an entire year (I started out last year, June, and was still building my business). My entire year's income is about S$25,000.

\- Benefits? People say that as a freelance tutor, I have no benefits. But part of the reason why I became a full-time tutor is because I disagree. My working hours are incredibly short. Even during peak periods, the longest I've worked is 5.5 - 6.5 hours a day, not counting travel time, because at least I get to relax and read books/play games/listen to music on the way. Usually, I work 3-4 hours a day. My working environment is rarely oppressive - I've only encountered one or two parents/guardians who are really a problem (one of them frequently delays payment while the other is a grandma with unrealistic expectations for her grandson despite being uneducated and knowing nothing about the ways of educating a child AND making sure he comes out alright and mentally balanced.)

\- The downside is that I'll still have to work if I'm sick. But I'm a strong man. I'm rarely sick - maybe once a year, and I'm a tough guy. I once taught tuition for an entire day despite having a crushing headache, a debilitating fever, flu, cough, runny nose, all the bad stuff. Ain't shit to me. It was unpleasant but I got through it, and I recovered very quickly from such illnesses. I was mostly fine the next day.

\- Basically, my goal is to maintain a very good work-life balance such that my physical and mental health remains optimal, and I don't have to lose all my hair over work. At the same time, I want to earn a sustainable income. I want my work arrangements to be flexible.

I won't ever become crazy rich, but I don't aim to be. Highest I'm aiming for is high-middle class. This way, to paraphrase Daniel Defoe, I won't have to want for anything, and at the same time, I won't gain the shameful excesses and debauchery of the rich, losing my moral fiber, character and discipline.

\- I don't plan to ever retire, but scale my working hours according to my abilities. The way I see it, I'm, in a way, already living a life that makes retirement meaningless, seeing that I have gained an incredible reservoir of personal time thanks to my lifestyle.

\- However, I plan to slog it out when I'm young (though this loses some meaning when I'm working a maximum of 30 hours a week where 'slogging it out' meant working double that to an office worker), in order to repay the remainder of my university debt (which is laughably easy to repay now that there's no interest as my father owns it, having paid for it in my stead after I graduated, and I've already paid slightly over half of it, 2018 being a good year), to build my savings in order to finance my savings plans, capital for investments as well as some basic insurance that will ensure that I don't end up in the streets if I happen to get lung cancer or something.

\- I'm proudly anti-CPF. As such, I'll avoid contributing to CPF unless absolutely necessary. This means higher disposable income, and savings. I'll instead shift my savings plan from public to private sources, as written above. Only trigger I can think of that'll force me to put money in CPF is if I need to get a house - I know that there are some benefits associated with paying for your house using CPF money. For one thing, I already have $6000 to $10,000 tucked in there that I will never, ever be able to touch. I can rescue that sum by using ALL my CPF money to get a house. Furthermore, there are government benefits if I pay with CPF money, as far as I know.

\- My current plan to maximize income (if I want to) is to put myself in tuition centres and schools hiring allied tutors, working longer hours and teaching more students to earn more at the high tuition rate that I'm earning. This might increase my monthly income at the cost of some of my work-life balance.

\- For now, my SOP for the future is that I'll keep myself as healthy as possible such that I can work this job all the way until I'm freaking 70 or something. With this kind of lifestyle, exercise and healthy food is easy to get, so I find that this is not a problem. If worse comes to worse, if I ever become... less productive from a bum leg or broken kidney or something, I'll just scale down my working hours accordingly. By that age, all my savings plans and investments would have matured several times over, so there's that.

\- However, I'm getting the blues over this because of the inherent risk in being a freelancer - it means unstable pay (in comparison to a regular job), less protection (as evidence by that parent who keeps delaying payment. I have to hope Singapore doesn't suddenly get an epidemic of less-than-moral parents in the future). Although I'm confident of my abilities and my plans... I just can't shake off that sense of unease that came with the freedom I have. Some of my friends say that it's because of my upbringing - traditional parents with traditional Asian values = regular job, regular pay, regular benefits, conventional thinking.

**So... Here's the Question: Do you guys think that my alternative answer to the standard 8-6 office work life is sustainable and viable? Any suggestions to make it better? Any warnings to give me?**
