0,SGExams,29530,[Uni] Pharmaceutical Sci vs Pharmacy,fbuelx,rainbowtwinkle11,1583071234,5,1,"hi everyone i’m here to clarify things and ask in depth regarding the difference between these 2 courses. from my own understanding, pharma sci dives deeper into the components of drugs and its formulation whereas pharmacy learns about effects of drugs on human body and things that are more patient related (correct me if i’m wrong). but i’m also wondering about the main difference in career prospects for these 2. is it right that a pharma sci degree does not allow me to work in the healthcare sector as an allied health profession? and is it possible for someone with a pharmacy degree to do research e.g formulating drugs, vaccines etc or will this be more suited for someone with a pharma sci degree (or any other degree)? i am also wondering which degree is more flexible if i’m unable to decide between the 2... i don’t mind doing research and/or interacting with patients but i would like a degree with a brighter career prospect. hope someone can provide more info on this, thank you!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/fbuelx/uni_pharmaceutical_sci_vs_pharmacy/,0.0,"['Hi,it is right that pharm sci degree does not lead to an allied health profession,as it emphasises on the drugs itself , industrial/lab/other applications and drug research,while pharmacy degree leads to  pharmacist and emphasises on clinical pharmacy practice (dispense med, double-check for cross side-effects,advise on drug usage and other stuff). \nOf course ,there is also research in pharmacy ,but pharmacy research emphasises on clinical pharmacy practice, which is very different from formulating drug and doing drug experiments all that in pharm sci (correct me if im wrong). \n\nCareer wise ,it really depends on your interest and goal,  dig more into drugs and do lab stuff ,or practise pharmacy in pharmacies and hospitals . Not sure about the exact salary ,but i think pharmacist is a stable job and salary grows slowly and steadily ,whereas pharm sci. grads have more options and higher chance to get a more decent salary(depends on role ,for example management).

1,SGExams,28955,[Uni] ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING 2.0!,f8pvec,pinktreachery,1582543502,38,1,"Hello! I’m a current NUS Nursing student. This **LONG, INFORMATIVE post** is for those thinking about NUS Nursing but have some doubts regarding Nursing in general!

# 1 Curriculum

## 1.1 NUS Nursing

## Curriculum overview

Generally, the first 2 years we focus on learning the different body systems, how they function (Anatomy &amp; Physiology) and dysfunction (Pathophysiology), coupled with each condition’s nursing management and hands-on skills. Interesting modules will also be taught such as communicating effectively and being culturally sensitive in the clinical setting, basic psychology for nurses, mental health nursing, and even ethics and law. The 3rd (and final year for most) will focus more on gearing us for eventual practice in the clinical setting with modules tackling leadership and community health. Finally, we will embark on a 3-month final clinical placement to emulate the real pace and nature of work, ensuring that we are competent to practice as registered nurses upon completion.

For people who can and choose to finish with an Honours degree, they embark on a year-long research project usually in their area of interest. Faculty staff members and hospital staff will act as mentors for these projects. Some examples of research projects can be found here: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf)

***Difference between honors and without honors:***

* Basic monthly starting pay for some hospitals are different, may vary from $50-100 according the the annual graduate employment survey here: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)
* Some overseas masters/PhD programmes require either an honours degree (directly)  or a normal bachelor’s degree with at least a few years of clinical experience
* Some hospitals/employers may view an honours degree more favourably in terms of salary and/or career progression

Complete information here on the NUS Nursing website, subject to changes every year: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/)

## Day-to-day lessons

Fun! We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins that can breathe and have pulses etc. We also have these people called standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills. They act like real patients with real symptoms and real family issues!

## Lectures and tutorials

Some lectures are video lectures - can watch at home at the pace you want! School is only around 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs. But of course, there are e-lectures to watch and tutorials to do and textbooks to read, so it’s not like you won’t have to do much studying outside those 2-4hrs/day. But if you manage your time well, it’s alright!

## For those worried about having no bio background:

There are people in Nursing who haven’t done bio since sec 1/2, and from poly who did non-science courses such as international business or mass communication.

The kind of bio that we learn is different from H2 Bio. H2 Bio deals with the very minute things like oxidative phosphorylation and ETC and Krebs cycle and all its small molecules. However, we deal with humans here. Human anatomy and physiology, the human body and how it dysfunctions. The anatomy and physiology mods are pretty similar to secondary school bio - you learn about the heart and how the blood flows in general, as well as how it dysfunctions. However, we don’t delve too deep into the molecules at all - that’s for the medical students to do. Yes, there will be a LOT of medical terms, and you have to be ready for that if you join nursing or any healthcare-related field, honestly. It’s hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will come naturally :)

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn’t delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries.

## For those scared of blood

During nursing school: We have cadaveric sessions - this means that you get to see real, preserved human bodies and you are required to touch and observe them, texture and all, during those anatomy sessions. They don’t look like normal fresh organs anymore - you can search some “science cadavers” to see what they look like! As for blood, generally you have to be alright with the sight of it as your first lab session will already have a finger-prick glucose test that you do on your friend (and vice versa). During clinicals, you will be exposed to wounds that may be huge and bleeding, etc, so you have to be okay with it. I do have some friends who enter nursing and medicine who are afraid of blood and needles and things like that - you can get used to it, through repeated exposure.

As a real nurse: You have to be alright with these sights as there of course may be some instances where the patient vomits blood/starts bleeding from somewhere and you have to manage the patient. If you are scared of blood and get posted to the operating theatre as an OT nurse, then you will be assisting doctors in surgeries where you WILL see these. I suggest you try to watch some youtube videos to see if you can take it. Do know that you can get used to it!! Bottomline is, you can’t be afraid of your own job.

## Lecturers/tutors

All teaching staff in ALCNS are previously doctors, nurses or pharmacists (for pharmacology). Usually, our heavily science-based modules are taught by previous doctors (eg: anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology), whereas more nursing-based modules are taught by previous or current nurses. This honestly helps a lot as our lecturers and tutors have had vast experiences in the clinical world, and therefore better able to relate what they teach with the clinical setting.

## Clinical placements

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards). But you will be reimbursed (paid) for the whole duration of placements!

## 1.2 Nursing degree vs diploma (polytechnic)

Main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around $800-1000 monthly, depending on the hospital (based on this [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278) and this [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)). You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last year, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about $3100-3300 a month on average (just refer to the MOE website above).

# 

# 2. NUS Nursing student life opportunities

## 2.1 Unrestricted Electives

You are required/allowed to take a minimum of 2 (for bachelor’s degree) or 3 (for honours degree) unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the nursing curriculum.

## 2.2 Local and Overseas Community Involvement Programmes

The Faculty of Medicine (Medicine and Nursing) has a lot of student-initiated CIPs both locally and overseas. You can join many things, from conducting free basic health checks in the neighbourhood, to volunteering with patients with dementia at a community hospital, to teaching basic first aid and english lessons to kids overseas - there’s really a lot of opportunities for us to give back to the community. Furthermore, you get to work with the medical students too as most of these projects are jointly planned and executed by both nursing and medicine students.

## 2.3 Student Leadership Opportunities

Similar to “student council” in secondary/JC, you can join the Nursing Subclub, Mednurse Club or SNASC to champion your peers’ causes and hopefully make a difference in their lives and in the profession of nursing. Other leadership opportunities include but not limited to: leading CIPs, organizing freshmen orientation, nurses’ day etc..

## 2.4 Exchange Programmes

ALCNS partners with several universities in different countries worldwide for student exchange programmes. Some countries include: Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia, Korea, etc. The exchange programmes may occur during school time or vacation time, and usually lasts 1-4 weeks. Selection process is through application and is based on the student’s own merit (academic and portfolio, contribution to the school).

# 

# 3 Admission Information

## 3.1 Indicative Grade Profiles

## A Levels 2019

10th percentile: CCD/B

90th percentile: AAA/A

## Polytechnic GPA 2019

10th percentile: 3.33/4.0

90th percentile: 3.86/4.0

## 3.2 Admission Interviews

Not for everyone. Usually only done for people with rp near the cut-off point, to prove that you are not joining nursing purely because you can’t apply to any other course with your grades. This will weed out people who have absolutely no idea about nor passion for nursing. There are people who get in with lower rp than the IGP, but please put Nursing as 1st choice as that is a factor too. The format is somewhat like a panel interview, with 1 or 2 faculty members as your interviewers. 15-30min each.

## Tips

Be prepared but do not memorize a script. Just think through the usual interview questions and some of these additional questions below. I came up with this questions, it is in no way supposed to be representative of what the school will definitely ask. This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: Why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: What have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks and where you intend to go.

## 3.3 Scholarships

There are 2 kinds of “scholarships” - one is called MOH Scholarship and the other is called hospital sponsorship. The differences are below. There are also available financial help from NUS and ALCNS itself. Please refer to the NUS/ALCNS website for more information.

## MOH Scholarship

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (given in 6-monthly basis)
* PROS: money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get (requires excellent A Level grades (usually &gt;85 rp from what I heard) and &gt;4.0/5.0 CAP for mid-term scholarship.

## Hospital Sponsorships

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates want to work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, easier to get.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else, just monthly allowance

You don’t need to decide whether you want to take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they want to get sponsored by.

# 

# 4 Nature of Work

## 4.1 Job Scope

As for job scope, you go in as SN I as mentioned earlier, which is more senior than SN II, Enrolled Nurses, healthcare attendants, etc. The implication is that you will be usually the main person in charge of a cubicle, for example, with around 4-8 patients at any given time, updating the family members, doctors, other healthcare professionals.

## DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?

I love this question about the stigma hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers MAY not be done (or not usually done) by staff nurses - it is usually done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses.

Staff nurses’ \*main\* roles are as follows:

1. Dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr’s orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are THE EYES. IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. Side effects of medications. Psychological state. Family/patient concerns. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: “nurse! Why does my father have an IV drip???” - have to explain that it’s because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

Sometimes SNs may get assigned (or just do) the “cleaning” duties due to reasons such as understaffing or skin integrity assessment. That’s honestly good, to remain competent with basic nursing care of the patients such as helping with activities of daily living (bathing, toileting, etc).

## 4.2 Salary

Nursing is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market. 

As mentioned earlier, refer here: 

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)

## 4.3 Career progression

There are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor’s degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take an advanced diploma or master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. 

They are: management, clinical and education tracks. 

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff problems etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like “mini doctors”. If you don’t know, some clinics in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds (must take extra course) without doctors. The only thing they cannot do will be surgery. 

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach. 

Occasionally, some people do clinical and education for example, this is called joint appointments. So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

&amp;#x200B;

# 5 Other common questions

## 5.1 Medicine vs nursing

**Know that: doctors cure, nurses care.** So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer for theory: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics, good enough to catch mistakes but not deep enough to the point that we are able to treat diseases with multiple complications for example!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look at the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children? What will the side effects of the meds/surgery be? Will he be able to cope?

So ask yourself, which role do you want to play?

## 5.2 Why NOT nursing?

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there’s anything that made me want to turn away from Nursing. From my convos with many nurses in the wards, it’s mostly these:

1. You will inevitably get attached to some pts, especially if you work as a community hospital nurse where pts there stay for 3 months or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)
3. Nursing is an extremely tiring job, physically and emotionally. Be prepared to work long hours with limited time for your own needs such as food or even simply toileting. While it is my intention to elevate the profession of nursing by addressing stigmas, I do not intend to over glorify the profession and give everyone the false hope that nursing is very fun and easy. It takes real guts and strength to be a nurse, and you should only join if you think you are up for the challenge to learn and push yourself.

## 5.3 Overseas nursing

I think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, are trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a fresh grad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.

There’s also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I’m not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fast food meal in the US can easily cost $15. 

I think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes, you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues.

Bottomline is, it’s up to you, and what is the most important for you :)

## 5.4 Dealing with deaths as a nurse

I haven’t personally experienced it as a nurse as I haven’t been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals.

1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.
2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it’s a death after all, I know that she’s in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.
3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it’s your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It’s alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.

2,SGExams,34213,[Uni] Advice on which nus course to appeal to,ga43fj,fgfjfl,1588140665,1,1,"so i am in need of some advice on which course i should appeal to. my rp is 87.5(w/o bonus) and my choices are as follows:

1.medicine
2.pharm sci
3.science
4.pharm

I recently got rejected for my first and second choice and got into science instead. However, after i submitted my application, i realised i was more interested in studying drugs than science in general but i didnt put pharmacy as third choice because i didnt really want to become a pharmacist and heard job prospects were quite bad. however, i recently found out that with a degree in pharmacy, i can still get jobs similar to a degree in pharm sci such as quality assuarance or regulatory affairs? is this true? which is also why im conflicted on which course to appeal to (pharm sci or pharm) as i am aware that pharm sci only takes in 30+ students so there might not be slots left and considering my score didnt even make the cut in the first place. i feel that i might have a higher chance at appealing to pharm and maybe transfer to pharm sci after semester 1? is this advisable? also, will it be harder to transfer considering they alr accepted ppl who appealed to pharm sci previously?lastly, does putting pharm as fourth choice affect my chances of appealing in?

tbh i ultimately want to get into pharm sci but i wld rather be in pharm than life sci(the course im planning to take in sci) since i will still get to study drugs at the end of the day.

3,SGExams,42555,[A Levels] NTU Biological Science with second major in medicinal chemistry and pharmacology OR NUS Chemistry with specialization in medicinal chemistry,htlcd3,immahugesimp,1595096467,6,11," I am torn between which to choose from, NTU or NUS. I dont really care about prestige, i just want a focused course that i can enroll in. Sadly, due to my IB score, these are the only two options that i can choose from; if not ideally, it would be pharmaceutical sciences in NUS.

My ideal career option would be research and development of drugs in a pharmaceutical company and potentially set up my own company making pharmaceutical drugs in Singapore (manufacturing). From young, i always wanted to do manufacturing and have interest in drugs, thus, i am really conflicted between the two degrees.

I got 2 questions that i need clarification;

1. Pathway to get a ""medicinal chem"" specialization degree between NTU and NUS.
2. Do i really need biology for my career pathway that i want? I feel like NTU course is abit off-track from what i want to do as it involves molecular biology and cell structure, which is totally unrelated to drug discovery and manufacturing in the pharma industry.

Based on my knowledge, I know that in NUS, you will need to study general chemistry till you are in your third year. Only then, you will get to choose your specialization (and it depends on your score). But in NTU, you will be in your second major course from the get-go, thus, dont have to fight for the ""specialization in medicinal chemistry"" title. This gives me more security, knowing that i can at least graduate with a second major, rather than a normal science degree. So, right now i am leaning more towards the NTU side.

However, i dont know if biology is really relevant in the future!

Both courses are the same number of years and but NTU is in life science and NUS is in school of chemistry.

I am in a HUGE dilemma now!!",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/htlcd3/a_levels_ntu_biological_science_with_second_major/,1.0,"['The NTU option sounds closer to what you want.  \n\n\nNot sure about NUS but NTU Chem only have 1 mod on biology.

- 300000 deaths
- 13km from epicentre
- first time in 200 years of earthquake on caribbean plate, hence low level of preparedness

christchurch 2011

- 180 deaths
- large area of destruction due to close distance from epicentre
- unstable and saturated soil caused liquefaction
- many affected suffered from depression and anxiety due to trauma

kyoto protocol 2005
- iceland able to increase greenhouse gas emissions by 10%
- japan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 6%
- however global greenhouse gas emissions still increased by 35% as main contributors (usa and china) did not sign protocol

iceland volcanic eruption 2010
- closure of europe's air space due to extensive ash clouds produced
- 1.2 million passengers disrupted

volcanic soils in java and bali, cultivation of coffee tea and rice, support large agricultural community. soils still more rich in minerals than other places despite constant use. (can be used for both benefit of living near volcanoes and factor for increased food production)

for every us$1 increase in income, 20% of it is spent on food in dcs, 60% of it is spent on food in ldcs (hence ldcs more affected by food pricing than dcs)

7,SGExams,53344,"[O levels] “Withdrawal symptoms"" after finishing most papers",jkcxvo,NotFromYouTube,1603987853,17,1,"Many of you may have heard of withdrawal symptoms after one has stopped drinking alcohol, stopped doing drugs or smoking. 

I now have 1 week until my paper 1 for physics and chemistry and I have decided to pick up my PS4 after 3 months. The feeling I got when I turned on my console was the same feeling of looking at homework as a primary school kid. I stopped playing after like 5 minutes due to my brain going into overdrive telling me to stop and study and my entire body feeling itchy and I also felt very irritable. 

Holding the controller in my hand is the most unnatural and disgusting feeling I ever felt even though I fucking love video games. Why I labeled this as “withdrawal symptoms"" is due the similar symptoms. This is the first time I have stopped studying in almost 2 and a half months and I study almost 5 hours a day. Today was the first time I stopped in a while and felt this. To really test if this was something like a withdrawal, I went to my room and did some MCQ papers and 4 hours flew by. I did not feel any dread or boredom while doing the papers, hell I even felt happy and energetic.

Did o level really fuck up my brain to the point I hate the things I love and love the things I hate? Or is this just a one time thing? To give you context I used to study 5 hrs a day before my CT or Exams but only like 2 days before. O level was the exception. I am also able to play games 5 hrs a day. I don't really have a in-between and although this may make me seem like some top school student flexing, no I'm not. I go to a normal neighborhood school and get slightly above average grades all the time. What have I become, I became the very thing I sworn to destroy. Can any seniors tell me if this ever happened?

TLDR: Played PS4 after 3 months of studying for o levels and felt absolutely terrible while playing and stopped and went to study even though I love video games and hate studying",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jkcxvo/o_levels_withdrawal_symptoms_after_finishing_most/,1.0,['same here :”) except i only stopped 1-2weeks before but still felt weird to suddenly stop for a while']

9,SGExams,10491,[Uni] ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING!,azgfh5,pinktreachery,1552229929,70,129,"Hello! I’m a current NUS Nursing student, and will be happy to answer any questions. This post is for those thinking about NUS Nursing but have some doubts regarding Nursing in general!

I can understand how daunting it can be - especially since you’re signing up for a specialized course / professional degree where you know exactly that you’ll be one thing at the end - a nurse.

Please correct me if I’m wrong for any of my statements :)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*PAY (poly vs degree)** 

Yes, the main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around 800-1000$ monthly if im not wrong, depending on the hospital. You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last yr, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about 3100-3300$ a month in average.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*JOBSCOPE:** 

As for jobscope, the diploma holders, ITE cert holders, and foreign nurses will be under your leadership. You will be the senior in the ward. For jobscope of SN I and SN II, i believe it lies in how many patients you take care of and how many people are under you, plus some admin things to do. SNII has more responsibilities but in general, your jobscopes are more similar vs the ite holders and foreign nurses.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?** 

I love the qn about the stigma hehe. I broke that stigma to a few parents yesterday during open day hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers will NOT be done by staff nurses - it will be done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses, those from ITE / foreign nurses (tho there are some nurses from overseas who get promoted to SNs eventually!).

Staff nurses’ jobs are as follows:

1. dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr’s orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: nurse! Why does my father have an IV drip??? - have to explain that it’s because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*WHAT HAPPENS AFTER NURSING DEGREE?** 

Furthermore, there are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor’s degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take a master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. They are: management, clinical and education tracks.

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff probs etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like “mini doctors”. If you don’t know, some clinica in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds without doctors. The only thig they cannot do will be surgery.

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach.

Occasionally, some people do 2 of the 3 + research, this is called dual appointments :)

So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*ADMISSIONS:** 

IGP can be found on the NUS website. I heard that your cohort did well this year, so it may increase, tho it has been consistent the past few years. If your rp is much higher (tho we dont know the cut-off), you don’t have to go through interviews (perhaps 80++++). There are people who get in with much lower rp than the IGP, please put Nursing as 1st choice if you are worried you can’t get shortlisted for interviews!

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*INTERVIEW TIPS:** 

This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: what have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks above and where you intend to go to :)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*CURRICULUM** 

Omg funfunfun. We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins who breathe and have pulses etc. We also have standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills.

Lectures and tutorials. Some lectures are video lectures. Watch at home at 2x the speed!!

School is only 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs or blahblah! :)

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*HELP! I DONT HAVE BIO BACKGROUND!** 

That’s alright! I have friends who haven’t done bio since sec 1/2, and friends from poly who did intl business/engineering.

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn’t delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries 😉

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*CLINICAL PLACEMENTS** 

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards) ☺️ but you will be paid!!

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*SCHOLARSHIPS** 

Some scholarships for nursing students! By year 4, 80% of the whole cohort will be under scholarship.

**1. MOHH Scholarship**

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (i think iz 1,100)
* PROS: money money money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get.

**2. Hospital Sponsorships**

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates wanna work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, super easy to get. They give freely one.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else

You don’t need to decide whether you wanna take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they wanna get sponsored by.

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*MEDICINE VS NURSING????** 

Know that: doctors cure, nurses care. So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look a the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children?

&amp;#x200B;

**\*\*WHY NOT NURSING??** 

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there’s anything that made me wanna turn away from Nursing. My answer was I haven’t been to hospitals long enough for that, but from my convos with many nurses in the wards, it’s mostly this.

1. You will inevitably get attached to some, especially if you work as a community hosp nurse where pts there stay for 3 mths or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)

&amp;#x200B;

Whew! Hope I answered all qns. Feel free to comment if you wanna know anything else :) Nursing is not just a dumping ground for students who messed up A Levels :)

So I have been diagnosed with anxiety and chronic insomnia 2 days after my myes started  
As in I would have major episodes of not being able to sleep for 30-50 hours at a go 
It also started right before my very myes first paper(needless to say I bombed that paper but some how scraped through chem p3? I think it's funny lmao) 
Okay anyways 
I was away from school for the whole month of July,meaning I missed out on myes and many lessons 
Aka I'm behind 
By quite.a.lot 
I've been getting help from the psychiatrist and school counsellors,aka changing my medication 3 different times with different side effects 
And sometimes the cocktail of drugs wouldn't even be strong enough to out me asleep 
Currently,I started school two weeks ago
Work is tough to catch up,and it sucks to see your peers being able to stay in school and mug 
Or being on task/kiasu-ism etc 
Sometimes ill go to school not being able to sleep at all 
Sometimes ill wake up 2-3 times a night and find it extremely difficult to fall back asleep,hence, getting up at 4 am to do work and going to school at 6 am 
By the end of the school day I'll be to exhausted to do anything but craving sweet sweet sleep badly 
I'm currently trying my best to complete work and exercise,while maintaining my emotions 
(Eg trying to learn nuclear physics almost 1 week before they give a lecture quiz on it event though you haven't attended any of the lectures and have no idea what's going on in lessons are fun while having to worry about 20 other pieces of work) (but ahaha it's okay now I'm getting the hang of it) (not to mention I've forgotten alot of what I've studied for myes due to the month's worth of inconsistent well rested and not rested nights)  
Some of my jc friend know 
Most of my classmates don't know 
My school knows and I'm blessed that they are helpful and understanding  
But I guess idk I feel demoralized in that sense almost everybody is like 1000 steps ahead of me 
While I'm trying to take it what is happening,what had happen and juggle my academics 
Most people told me to retake j2 
But I worry things could get worse 
And I want to pursue what makes me happy because honestly I want to get a career asap and help those who may be in my position (if that makes any sense or it could be a form of escapism) 
Doesn't help that prelims are in 1 month 
Caffeine doesn't really help in the morning (I'm allowed to take it only in the morning) 
So by the time I get home 
Even though I can function (sort of) 
I'm left tired 
But I don't want to back down 
What is the point of this post you may ask? 
I'm not here to paint a flowery picture,saying things will get better as long you get help and put your mind and soul into anything you do. 
I'm here to say that if you are strong.We can do this.Even to the people who are functioning just fine but are on the verge of breaking mentally,take a step back and breathe. 
Life is unpredictable 
Let's view our future as a grey area 
Because I tend to think everyone thinks it's either black or white 
In my case ,retake j2(not that it's a bad thing) or deal with it and graduate(which also may not be the best)
I'm just ranting at this point but those taking any major exams soon,rest well,exercise a positive mindset and carry on 


Psps:idk I feel like this whole experience made me wanna study psychology in the future or sth but see how everything goes first (bigger lols cuz I take PCMG)

2,singapore,227747,Why are cigarettes not banned in Singapore?,fz3nmp,dhduifcdkdid,1586606399,102,1,"ps: smokers out there please don't hate on this

I have had this question for quite some time, and most of us probably also did when e-cigarettes were banned in Singapore. 

And yes I understand that Singapore's intention of banning them were because statistics indicated that there were a huge number of youths starting to vape, compared to tobacco smokers using it to quit. It was to protect the younger generation.

In a [today online article](https://www.todayonline.com/commentary/why-singapore-bans-e-cigarettes) , they mention that if tobacco was banned, it ""will give rise to black markets and increase the flow of smuggled cigarettes into Singapore.""

I don't understand the weigh between health of Singaporeans vs the black market.

Another perspective: Why did we ban drugs then? 

And I don't think drugs being much more harmful is a valid reason of banning them instead of cigarettes.

10,singapore,207882,Carpooling from SG to JB gone bad,enb30a,heyboo_,1578767248,5,1,"LONG POST BUT I NEED YOUR HELP. 

Let me start by saying that I (F26, not a local) tried this carpooling thing from SG to JB for the first time today. I was with a friend who’s accompanying me to go JB for some shopping and massage. He booked this carpool through Telegram and he arranged everything but it was also his first time. His colleague told him about it when he asked him about the fastest/convenient way to reach JB. So, we were quoted $25/2 pax for one way. Everything was okay... until it wasn’t!

We were at the checkpoint and the officer was asking a lot of question to the driver. Long story short (cos they were speaking in Malay and Chinese which sadly I don’t understand), we ended up being called to go to the office. 

Here’s the thing, I am so scared of having a record to my name cos 1) I’m not a local, 2) I’m working in a large organisation and I need to declare my offences if ever I have one. 

I was overthinking at that point. I was wondering what if this car had drugs in it and we were caught?? I would be like an accessory to the crime or whatever you call that thing. 

We were stuck in the office for about 15 mins and the fucking driver was making too much noice in the office that resulted to the officer calling my name. 

Officer: “OP? OP? Who’s OP?”
OP: “Uh yes?”
Officer: “Do you know this guy? Are you friends with him? Are you somewhat related to this guy?”
OP: “No.” 
Officer: “Is your husband related to this guy?” 
OP: “What? No.”
Officer: “Are you paying him for his service?”
OP: “Yes.”

I don’t know what was happening at all and why I was asked those questions. While the officer was questioning me, I fucking knew my face looked so confused with what’s happening and the officer knew that I was telling the truth! And the driver was looking at me like he wanted me to say that I knew him and we were friends! But I never lie to immigration officers cos they will definitely know if something’s up. 

The officer started raising his voice to the driver and they were in a heated argument but then long story short again, they let us go and we were on our way to JB. 

When we got out from the car, my friend told me that while we were in the office, the driver was telling lies. He told the officers that 1) we were his friend 2) I am with my husband. I was like “WTF?! Why wouldn’t he inform us beforehand??” 

The next fucking thing is, just after he dropped us at the mall, he sent my friend a voice msg which he wasn’t able to listen to not until we’re back in SG 2 hours ago. He asked for a photo of my IC/Pass and called me “ah moi”. My friend told me that “ah moi” is a very rude Malaysian term to call a lady. He told me it’s equivalent to a Chinese prostitute or something along that line. 

WTF?! He gave us enough trouble already and now this? Why does he even need a photo of my IC?? And calling me that??? Such a fucking pig!! 

My friend never replied to him but forwarded me the voice msg. I also forced my friend to give me his number cos I am so pissed off that I wanted to revenge him and make his life a living hell. 

He is so fucking disgusting. Hearing his voice msg (which realllllyyyyy sounds so demanding) and remembering how he looks like makes me wanna puke my gut out!!! I can’t believe there are men like him!!!

tried explaining to her that if i got actual help for adhd then i wouldn't see the effects of it quite as much. nope.

&amp;#x200B;

Then I asked who is he calling from, which then he only briefly identified himself as DHL Customer Service **(RED FLAG #2)**. Then I clarified that I infact did not dispatch any parcels from China. After some back and forth I unknowingly disclosed that I have a pending parcel from somewhere in China to SG. Which then he promptly informed me that my parcel from Shanghai to SG is currently being held at China customs, and he is very concerned about this case, apparently due to the requirement of presenting ID when sending a parcel **(RED FLAG #3)** the reason my parcel is being held is because the custom found cOnTrOlLeD gOoDswhich may include controlled drugs  **(RED FLAG #4)**, and I need to settle with customs, which in simple terms, means my identity is being used by somebody else to ship drugs across border.

&amp;#x200B;

The scary part about this is that googling this number: **+65 65427558**, shows DHL as #1 search result. i kupped and actually called DHL SG hotline to confirm that, #1: They don't call customers, like at all; #2: DHL SG doesn't even have Mandarin speaking hotline.

18,singapore,232323,An Island Nation of Redditors with Legalized Drugs,gag203,OGKebabEater,1588189118,3,1," 

Hello all,

I am here with my plan for my [subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheRedditNation/) Reddit Nation

If you are interested in joining a (hopefully) newly formed island nation then this is the place to be.

I have prepared a plan that explains how we will go about doing such a task. More detailed elaborations for each component of the plan will be given at request.

Obviously the first question is where we would have our island. I have identified places of interest. One place of interest is the Nation of Belize. Belize is a small nation with a low GDP of 2 Billion and they are selling off most of their island. Islands with 50-100 acres can be acquired for around 500,000; give or take 50,000. From the people (Government Officials) I have contacted, they are perfectly okay with this plan.

Now here is a 5 step proposal of how this will come to fruition (I will expand on how we will finance this)

1. Acquire the island
2. Set up the initial infrastructure  

   1. Form of Government that I propose is a constitutional monarchy  

      1. Country will be run as a democracy (two chamber form of parliament)
      2. Noble titles such as Duke, Earl, Count, Lord, Baron etc will be sold off to help initially finance the island.
   2. Establishment of the Government Building  

      1. For now this is where the government will convene until more infrastructure is added and the island is improved.
      2. People will be made citizens at this location
   3. Establishment of Civil Services  

      1. Waste collection, Police, Social Services
   4. Establishment of a Port  

      1. This will allow supplies to enter the island.
      2. This will allow for the island to participate with the rest of the world economically(I will expand on this later).
      3. The port will function as the entrance point and exit until the runway can be constructed.
   5. Establishment of Resident Housing  

      1. This temporary housing will be until the island can be developed and more permanent buildings can be put up.
      2. Resident Housing and the Government building will be set up near the port until island development is completed
   6. Set up a massive solar powered crypto mining operation to help finance further development of the island  

      1. A partnership with big mining companies can be brokered to have this set up
3. Make the Island a desirable location  

   1. Set up the island as a luxury city  

      1. Free housing for citizens
      2. Free healthcare for citizens
      3. Free schooling and university for citizens
   2. Build resorts and legalize gambling on the island  

      1. The revenue generated from such activities will help finance further development of the island
      2. With the revenue generated from this, the island will be able to provide for the residents a luxury city
      3. The gambling industry investments will help to finance the island as well
   3. Make the island a banking haven  

      1. Set up a bank on the island
      2. No KYC laws will be enforced on the island
      3. This will attract forgien investment into the island
   4. Allow cryptocurrency companies to conduct business without oversight and for miners to set up large scale operations using solar powered energy
   5. No income tax,sales tax, capital gains tax or corporate on the island  

      1. Commercial businesses such as casinos, resorts, and banks will just pay slightly inflated property taxes
      2. This will help attract a lot more forgien investment as well
      3. Will attract companies to set up offices here and thus bring jobs to the island.
4. Expand on the island infrastructure  

   1. Build an airport. The islands have enough space to accommodate runways for planes even up to jumbo jets
   2. Build more free luxury housing for residents
   3. Establish schools and universities
   4. Establish libraries
   5. Establish Museums
   6. Establish a healthcare system
5. Enjoy the luxury haven of an Island that we have built

Now for the question of how much this island will cost and how we will get the funding

According to my calculations (you can look at them below) it will cost us $2,600,000

* The Island itself  

   * 500,000
* The Port  

   * 200,000 to build  

      * This will benefit us later when we receive forgien investments
   * 500,000 for 250 passenger ferry  

      * We will budget around 100,000 for operating costs
* Initial Buildings  

   * 1,000,000  

      * These buildings will be permanently built but occupied until the island is built and then will be sold off to recoup the investment.
      * Buildings include
* Civil Services  

   * Around 50,000 to purchase initial equipment and medical supplies
   * Another 100,000 to purchase ATVs
   * Another 100,000 to purchase off roading vehicles
* Bitcoin mining operation  

   * We will get the money for the operation by partnering with a large company
* Water Purification  

   * 50,000
* Food Supply  

   * We will purchase MRE’s and other preserved food products for the island
   * An exact count of this cannot be made until we move further into the plan
* Further development of the island  

   * This will be financed by the forgien investments in regards to banking, gambling and tourism along with money raised from property taxes

Now in regards to how we will raise that sum

* We will sell off noble titles (this is why we will set up a constitutional monarchy)  

   * While no price has been established yet, the titles for sale can include  

      * Duke, Duchess.
      * Marquess, Marchioness.
      * Earl, Countess.
      * Viscount, Viscountess.
      * Baron, Baroness.
* A small percentage of the island (less than 25%) will be earmarked for sale immediately. The part earmarked for sale will be part of the planned downtown district/capital and developers of this land will be allowed to build whatever structures they want and won't have the problem of jumping through hoops like zoning laws.  

   * On a 60 acre island, 15 acres would be marked for sale  

      * The acres on this haven of an island will be sold for 250,000 each so the island would raise 4.5 million and the sale of said acres will help kickstart the massive infrastructure of the island and provide the island with adequate funding.
* Once the island is set up, the island will continue to profit from digital activities which will allow it to not have to charge an income tax or corporate tax  

   * Digital activities include the solar powered bitcoin mining operation  

      * We will partner with an existing bitcoin company for this
   * Solar powered web hosting
* People can become citizens for a fee of $10 which will mainly go to the printing of their ID and filing in the government archives but the island will profit a few dollars off of this

19,singapore,230747,"Lee Kuan Yew Review, Part Two: You are free to agree",g6f35b,TracingWoodgrains,1587610863,42,1,"Yesterday, I posted [part one of a four-part review of Lee Kuan Yew's *From Third World To First*](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/g5qot3/book_review_lee_kuan_yews_from_third_world_to/). Since a decent number of people ended up enjoying it, I'll be posting the other parts of the review over the next few days. 

As with last time, since I'm an ignorant American with no personal experience of Singapore and only LKY's word to go on for much of the detail provided, I'd be particularly interested to hear where I oversimplified things or where people would contest this interpretation of events. Note as well that, since I initially wrote this to an international audience, throughout the essay I assume rather less familiarity with Singapore than you all have.

With those notes taken care of, enjoy the review!

###You are Free to Agree

Are you a fan of free speech? Are you eager for everyone to have a platform? Are you in favor of an open, unconstrained press? 

Lee Kuan Yew isn't, and he's probably poking fun at you.

######Free Press

Here are a few of his choicest quotes on Western-style free press:

&gt; My early experiences in Singapore and Malaya shaped my views about the claim of the press to be the defender of truth and freedom of speech. The freedom of the press was the freedom of its owners to advance their personal and class interests. ^\(186)

And: 

&gt; I did not accept that newspaper owners had the right to print whatever they liked. Unlike Singapore's ministers, they and their journalists were not elected. ...I do not subscribe to the Western practice that allows a wealthy press baron to decide what voters should read day after day. ^\(191)

And, when he got into an argument with the US State Department:

&gt; The State Department repeated that it did not take sides; it was merely expressing concern because of its ""fundamental and long-standing commitment to the principles of a free and unrestricted press""--which meant that ""the press is free to publish or not publish what it chooses however irresponsible or biased its actions may seem to be."" ^\(192)

All that's pretty straightforward, and clearly goes against the principles of free speech, right? Then you get to the next quote:

&gt; *We have always banned communist publications; no Western media or media organization has ever protested against this.* We have not banned any Western newspaper or journal. Yet they frequently refused us the right of reply when they misreported us. ^\(191)

Here's a question. You're a tiny city-state occupying valuable territory, trying to stay independent. You are watching the cultural revolution sweep across the homeland of three-quarters of your people, and you [keep noticing them funding your newspapers](https://www.nytimes.com/1971/05/17/archives/paper-in-singapore-ceases-publication-red-link-charged.html). Meanwhile, other superpowers are locked in an all-out ideological struggle with those forces, a struggle that's shaping policy around the whole world. The country's dominant English-language newspaper at the time of gaining independence was ""owned by the British and actively promoted their interests."" ^\(185)

What's the right level of freedom of press?

Keeping in mind that the book is telling things from LKY's perspective and so naturally seeks to cast his decisions favorably, his position has some nuances that make it easy to be sympathetic. First, there's a different standard for local and foreign media: ""We had to tolerate locally owned newspapers that criticized us; we accepted their bona fides, because they had to stay and suffer the consequences of their policies. Not so 'the birds of passage who run [foreign-owned papers].'"" ^\(187)

Second, as he mentions above, he didn't ban non-Communist foreign press. Not exactly. Instead, every time a paper refused right of reply for a story he felt was misrepresented or slanted, he just restricted sales licenses to smaller numbers, with an eye towards reducing advertising revenue but not towards outright banning the ideas. This led to occasionally amusing exchanges. In one back-and-forth, after the Asian Wall Street Journal (AWSJ) published an alleged defamatory article and had sales restricted, the AWSJ offered to distribute its journal free to its deprived subscribers to ""forego its sales revenue in the spirit of helping Singapore businessmen"". Singapore's government agreed, as long as it left out advertisements. The paper backed out, claiming cost issues. Singapore offered to cover half the additional costs. When the paper refused, Singapore gave an official response: ""You are not interested in the business community getting information. You want the freedom to make money selling advertisements."" ^\(193)

Third, well, it's only paranoia if you're wrong. In addition to facing consistent attempts at covert communist influence, I learned post-reading that Lee Kuan Yew had [at least one memorable run-in with the CIA](http://jfk.hood.edu/Collection/White%20Materials/Security-CIA-II/CIA%20II%20013.pdf) (h/t [/r/singapore](https://old.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/2zzlz3/til_cia_tried_to_bribe_mr_lee_kuan_yew_and_got/)). In 1960, they offered him $3.3 million to cover up a failed attempt to buy information from Singapore intelligence officials. Lee's response? ""The Americans should know the character of the men they are dealing with in Singapore and not get themselves further dragged into calumny. ...You do not buy and sell this Government."" Never one to ignore leverage, he requested that instead of covert bribes the US provide public foreign aid. They complied.

Dystopian information lockdown, or prudent defense against foreign influence and misinformation? LKY is convinced, rightly or not, that it is the latter. Read with modern US politics in mind, it's easy to compare it to deplatformings from tech websites, concerns about Russian infiltration of social media, or the controversies around fake news. The context changes, the challenges stay the same.

######Free Speech

I frankly have much less sympathy for LKY's eagerness to sue people for libel. It's worth mentioning that Singapore has avoided one obvious concern about relying on courts here: [corruption is almost non-existent in Singapore](https://www.transparency.org/cpi2018), and deliberately so. We may come back to corruption later, since LKY does spend some time on it. Still, there's something unsettling about the leader of a country keeping a hawk's eye watch for anything that misrepresents him, then turning the power of the courts on the individual or newspaper who went after him.

He talks about a fair number of legal battles with evident satisfaction, about taking this opponent or that who accused him or corruption or lied about him to court, then winning the battles. He anticipates the obvious criticism about this practice, and defends against it:

&gt; Had I not sued, these allegations would have gained credence. ...Outrageous statements are disbelieved only because they are vigorously refuted. If I failed to sue, that ould be cited as proof that there was something in it. ...Wrong ideas have to be challenged before they influence public opinion and make for problems. ^\(130-131)

And: 

&gt; Far from oppressing the opposition or the press that unjustly attacked my reputation, I have put my private and public life under close scrutiny whenever I appeared as a plaintiff in court. Without a clear record, it would have been an unnecessary hazard. Because I did this and also gave the damages awarded to deserving charities, I kept my standing with our people. ^\(131)

Left unspoken, though, is that *he's the one who's in charge of this whole system of lawsuits.* Vigorous refutation of an idea can happen in writing, in speeches, in any number of official channels. If he wants to keep his public and private life open to scrutiny, he can do so however he chooses. Electing to wage time-consuming and costly legal battles against people who put forward unsavory ideas is hardly the only choice for the most powerful man in a country, and it's a choice that I feel warrants skepticism.

I'm much more fond of his response to a London Times reporter who made accusations he disputed (emphases mine): 

&gt; I wrote to invite Levin to a live television debate in London on his allegations. Levin's editor replied that no television station would be interested. *I had taken the precaution of first writing to the chairman of the BBC*, my friend Marmaduke Hussey, who had agreed to provide half an hour and a neutral moderator. When I informed the London Times of this offer, the editor on Levin's behalf backed off, arguing that my response should be in the same medium in which Levin had attacked me, namely the Times. I wrote to regret Levin's unwillingness to confront me. *When the* Times *refused to publish my letter, I bought a half-page advertisement in the British daily, the* Independent. Interviewed on the BBC World Service, I said, ""Where I come from, if an accuser is not prepared to face the person he has attacked, there is nothing more to be said.""

&gt; Levin has not written about Singapore or me since. ^\(196)

There's something delightful about the image of a politician going up to a reporter and saying, in effect, ""Heard you were talking smack. Debate me, you coward.""

Another instance shows up, by the way, in which it's hard to make assumptions about Singapore. Given LKY's desire for control over media messaging, you might expect some sort of overreaction to the internet. Instead, his message comes with characteristic bluntness: ""Countries that try to block the use of IT will lose."" ^\(196) 

######On nanny states

One last topic remains to be covered here. From banning everything from drugs to tobacco advertising to chewing gum to [eating durian in public spaces](https://www.yearofthedurian.com/2014/10/llegal-durians-how-much-trouble-wi.html), Singapore has inevitably faced accusations of being a ""nanny state.""

LKY has this to say on the subject:

&gt; Foreign correspondents in Singapore have no big scandals of corruption or grave wrongdoings to report. Instead they reported on the fervor and frequency of these ""do good"" campaigns, ridiculing Singapore as a ""nanny state."" They laughed at us. I was confident we would have the last laugh. We would have been a grosser, ruder, cruder society had we not made these efforts to persuade our people to change their ways. We did not measure up as a cultivated, civilized society and were not ashamed to set about trying to become one in the shortest time possible. First, we educated and exhorted our people. After we had persuaded and won over a majority, we legislated to punish the willful minority. It has made Singapore a more pleasant place to live in. **If this is a ""nanny state,"" I am proud to have fostered one.** ^\(183)

To rephrase: ""Yep, we're a nanny state. Works great. Any questions?""

I'll repeat my prior explanation of LKY's approach: Will a policy make people more self-sufficient, more capable, or safer? Ultimately, does it work? Oh, and does it make everybody furious?

Great, do that. 

On a world scale, I think I would be uncomfortable with this sort of standard. I believe in the importance of creating robust societies where a wide range of ideas can thrive, and this sort of deliberately limited culture doesn't really provide that. But part of creating robust systems is questioning assumptions and experimenting with dramatically different approaches. I'm from Utah, ground zero for Mormonism and its strict standards. As such, I grew up in a similarly self-restricting and proud ""nanny state"". While it wasn't right for me in the end, for a lot of people I'm close with, those unambiguous strict standards work *really, really well* in a way that ""eh, just do what makes you happy"" doesn't. A single city of five and a half million people seems to me just about the right size to run that sort of experiment.

###Interlude Two

While reading the book and looking a bit into Singapore, I came across a few pieces of info that don't fit naturally into a review but deserve at least a moment's attention. One is the matter of Singapore's airport.

You might recall from my first review a brief mention of Lee Kuan Yew's focus on first impressions so people would ""know that Singaporeans were competent, disciplined, and reliable... without a word being said"" ^\(62). Singapore's Changi airport takes that to its natural conclusion. He was determined to make Singapore a transport hub of the region and decided to write off their investments in an older airport to perfect Changi in a number of details. After seeing Boston's Logan Airport, for example, he reported being ""impressed that the noise footprint of planes landing and taking off was over water"" ^\(203) and adjusting plans accordingly. In the end, they spent six years and $1.5 billion constructing the airport in a sort of [anti-Brandenburg](https://www.bbc.com/worklife/article/20181030-what-happened-to-berlins-ghost-airport) approach.

And (h/t [elsewhere on reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/interestingasfuck/comments/cam405/airport_in_singapore_has_a_slide_that_will_take/)): The airport is *wild.* Features include: [multi-story slides](https://i.imgur.com/cm4zskR.gifv), a massive playground of [climbing nets](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/transport/changi-unveils-new-playground-featuring-ropes-nets-and-a-pole-at-t4), an indoor playground and [waterfall](https://static.businessinsider.sg/2019/04/jewel-changi-airport-pix.png), [hedge mazes and canopy bridges](http://mentalfloss.com/article/501651/singapore%E2%80%99s-airport-getting-two-different-garden-mazes), and, well, [just about everything else](http://www.changiairport.com/en/discover/attractions.html#/filter?tab=all). Oh, and it has airplanes too. It's been ranked pretty consistently as [the best airport in the world](https://www.worldairportawards.com/worlds-top-10-airports-2019/). 

Until next time.

20,singapore,230554,Singapore - Over-sheltered and Exclusive?,g5xiou,mild-eccentricity,1587544744,35,1,"I'd like to preface my points with the following. 

1) I believe that not all Singaporeans are the same and this post is not directed to every Singaporean individual 

2) I wish to learn what you guys think of our cultural environment. If that means disagreement then I think that's great so long as its civil. 

3) I am not some expert in sociology or history. These opinions are derived from my lived experience. You may have lived through different experiences and that's great. 

4) I am not trying to insult, attack or accuse any individual/groups. These are just my thoughts and I am open to changing my mind. 


Now, I've had this feeling that Singapore is rather segmented from the world and within it's own groups for awhile. I couldn't place a finger on it for some time. But I currently believe the following: 

Singapore's environment produces a level of exclusivity in our culture that's based on similar cultural beliefs as opposed to race. This leads to subtle xenophobia that may manifest in anti-foreigner sentiment, unwillingness to mingle with locals who ""jiak kentang"" and a mindset sometimes lack civil responsibility (us versus them mindset). 

Growing in school I was often different from my peers. I spoke and thought differently due to the more westernized and liberal upbringing. I had different hobbies and a different sense of humor. I tried my best to fit in, even trying to put on an accent, and made some friends. However, I found that many Singaporeans aren't as willing to mingle and socialise because I appear different to them. I didn't conform to the mold of the typical Singaporean. This was worse in NS as I was exposed to many people from less privileged backgrounds who may hold stronger prejudices against me. Nevertheless, I tried my best and made a couple of friends. 

I learned that many Singaporeans believe that a level of conformity is a pre-requisite for forming close bonds. Being seen as 'not normal' wont lead u to get bullied but it make socializing harder for you. My Australian friends who have studied in singapore during an exchange share similar thoughts to me (despite being ethnically chinese). 

Living in New Zealand and Australia for a number of years then exposed me to how Singaporeans act overseas in Universities. They often stick close together and tend not to mingle out of their Singaporean groups. Some of them proceed to complain about how hard it is to socialise there and how people dont wish to befriend them. Some of them regularly poke fun at the whites there. For those people, I hardly see them initiating conversations with the locals very often. For the most part, some of them do succeed in integrating well into the new environment. 

Personally, I believe that this is a product of being over sheltered and conservative in Singapore. We dont need to confront racism as a serious social problem here, if theres any we leave it to the government to jail serious offenders. Conservative tendencies lead to a level of discomfort when dealing with alcohol, socializing with strangers and drugs. The small country and school culture allows for many people to retain at least 1 social circle during their life - the idea of leaving everything behind to start anew is foreign to them. I think all these things, coupled with their expectations of homogeneity in social circles, lead to some Singaporans facing issues overseas. 

I used to use the term 'close-minded' as a description for Singaporeans but I realise it's not accurate. It seems to me that Singaporeans may be open-minded but dont see the point in accepting people who may be different because of the lack of challenges that our environment provides when it comes to building a community. Everything is homogeneous, we've successfully integrated multiple races into our cultural identity and if theres anything wrong ------ 'GAHMENT will take care of it. 
Pls note that tolerance ain't acceptance.

The baby\'s mother had gone out with her husband and returned to the babysitter\'s place to find her child drowsy like she was drugged.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Toxicology reports later found 10 drugs in the first baby and six in the older one, including sleeping pills, antihistamines and anxiety medication. The babies have since recovered.\n\n&gt; Sa\'adiah had prescriptions for some of these drugs. An empty slab of Zolpidem, also known as Stilnox, was found in her home. The sedative was also detected in the younger baby and on a milk bottle.\n\n&gt; A slab of Chlorpheniramine, also known as Piriton, with 10 remaining tablets was also found in her home. The antihistamine was detected in both the babies.\n\n&gt; Diazepam, a medication for anxiety also known as Valium, was found in both babies. The drug was also detected on a handkerchief with brown stains in Sa\'adiah\'s home.\n\n&gt; At the time of the offences, Sa\'adiah was on at least three medications that were later found in either of the babies. These are Zolpidem, Xanax for anxiety and Diazepam.\n\n&gt; According to medical records, drugs found in Sa\'adiah\'s system in September 2016 matched those found in the babies a few months later, the court heard.\n\n&gt; PROSECUTOR QUESTIONS ACCUSED ON DISCREPANCIES\n\n&gt; Deputy Public Prosecutor Seah Ee Wei on Wednesday quizzed Sa\'adiah about many alleged inconsistencies between her oral testimony and her defence documents, which were filed in August 2019.\n\n&gt; She said Sa\'adiah stated in her defence documents that she was started on her prescription for Alprazolam or Xanax for anxiety only in 2018. However, she testified that she began her prescription for this in 2016.\n\n&gt; ""I put it you that you lied because you wanted to distance yourself from the drugs found in (the babies),"" said Ms Seah.\n\n&gt; Sa\'adiah disagreed.\n\n&gt; She also disagreed with several assertions by Ms Seah, who said that Sa\'adiah lied to distance herself from the drugs found in the babies, by claiming that she was not prescribed nor had taken several drugs even though medical records showed otherwise.\n\n&gt; In particular, Sa\'adiah had said that she was never prescribed diazepam from 2016 to August 2019, even though medical records showed that she was prescribed this medication 52 times in 2016, and five times in November 2016 alone.\n\n&gt; Responding to this, Sa\'adiah repeatedly maintained that she had already been prescribed Diazepam before caring for the babies, but eventually said ""yes"" when asked if she had lied in her filed defence documents.\n\n&gt; DID SHE GIVE THE BABY FLU MEDICINE?\n\n&gt; The court heard that Sa\'adiah had said in a statement to the police that she had crushed half a pill of flu medicine and mixed it with water to give to the younger baby.\n\n&gt; This was because the baby had the flu and her mother purportedly asked Sa\'adiah if she had any medication. Sa\'adiah supposedly said she had flu medicine but added that it is not for children.\n\n&gt; However, when pressed by the prosecutor, Sa\'adiah said on Wednesday that she did not give the medication to the baby in the end.\n\n&gt; ""I think back again. Because it\'s not suitable for her. And it\'s very complicated to give it to her while she\'s crying,"" she said.\n\n&gt; She added that she had earlier admitted to giving the baby half a pill because she was ""provoked by the police"".\n\n&gt; When asked by the prosecutor if she had lied in her police statement, Sa\'adiah said ""yes, it\'s a lie"".\n\n&gt; The prosecutor also asserted that Sa\'adiah did not actually care for the babies, as she gave them poisons and intentionally hurt them, but Sa\'adiah disagreed.\n\n&gt; When probed by her defence lawyer Chua Eng Hui from Luo Ling Ling LLC, Sa\'adiah teared on the stand.\n\n&gt; The trial continues. If found guilty of administering poison with the intent to cause hurt, Sa\'adiah can be jailed for up to 10 years and fined. She cannot be caned as she is a woman.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"
26,singapore,247976,COVID19 is easily treatable but politics and greed has killed half a million,hlhv5k,qsgsg,1593929597,2,1,"All of us follow the news which are mostly citations from US media. US media unlike Singapore are controlled by a few rich and influential tycoons. What they choose to report or not report is a form of  gatekeeping.

I have been following the COVID19 news very closely since the outbreak in China and subsequently the potential treatments that are emerging since then. As someone that spends alot of time following this and seeing how much selfishness and greed has somewhat directly resulted in many preventable deaths is really frustrating.

**The first real treatment came from a US Doctor who used  Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) + Zinc and managed to prevent his 80%+ of his COVID19 patients from being hospitalized and had a case fatality rate of just under 1%. The cocktail was given to patients that he deemed at risk pre-emptively** **(ie given early)****.** Donald Trump spoke to this Doctor and that was when a simple straightforward solution became buried under a campaign of misinformation.

&amp;#x200B;

1. Dr  Zelenko shares his findings on HCQ + Zinc
2. Trump talked about it to the media
3. A few early studies in the US showed HCQ alone given to serious cases did not have any effect. ( Why was this anti-viral cocktail given so late to patients and without Zinc?)
4. Some doctors started warning of HCQ causing heart failure (HCQ never had any such warnings and has been used as anti-malaria drug for decades before COVID19 and this was previously not stated on World Health Organization's\[WHO\] website)
5. Subsequently WHO changed their HCQ recommendation to warn that it can cause Heart failure 
6. Three US doctors published a big data study stating HCQ had no effect on COVID19 patients globally. The scientific paper was published on *The Lancet*, medicine’s most respected scientific journal.  Data was provided by a company called Surgisphere.
7. After this study, WHO suspended all ongoing HCQ related clinical trials.
8. Medical professionals worldwide started questioning the data used in the study. An Australian hospital claimed to not have given any one their data and another hospital claimed the numbers are incorrect. Questions also arise on how Surgisphere managed to get the data from Africa where experts working there knew records are mostly paperwork and difficult to obtain.
9. Investigation was conducted and Surgisphere refuses to release the raw data used in the study
10. The Lancet retracts the scientific paper.
11. **New studies are beginning to emerge, the latest showing a 13% reduction in death rate when only HCQ is given early.  The study was published in the International Journal of Infectious Diseases** 
12. Gilead Science, an american Biotechnology trialed their COVID19 drug Remedsivir in US and in China.  China results showed that the treatment neither improved patients’ condition nor tamped down on the amount of virus in their blood
13. In the US Remedsivir began their phase 3 trial(last hurdle before approval) but their primary objective has been changed after the study started. (talk about changing the drug's primary objective after completing phase 2 with the original objective)
14. Remedsivir approved. Shown to reduce hospitalization by an average of 4 days. No change to case fatality rate. (compare that to HCQ +Zinc above in bold)
15. Gilead Sciences donates Remedsivir.
16. Gilead Sciences prices Remedsivir at  $2,340  per treatment (compare that to HCQ + Zinc at $30)

I hope the above sheds some light on some possible reasons why a safe, cheap and effective cocktail  that is readily available is not being utilized widely now.

Why were the early studies conducted in a way that was different from how Dr Zelenko advised? Why was the Fraudulent Lancet HCQ paper published, was there an agenda behind it? Does the Pharmaceutical industry want to discredit other drugs to boost their own sales? Or is it a political play to make Trump look like a fool before the upcoming US elections for recommending HCQ + Zinc , which he personally takes?

Police officers approached him to check on his well-being and attempted to guide him onto the pavement to assist him. The man was uncooperative and incoherent. As officers attempted to engage him further, he started to gesticulate and speak loudly while continuing to walk in the middle of the road, around the junction of Fullerton Road and Esplanade Drive, which was dangerous as there were vehicles driving by. For his safety and the safety of other road users, officers attempted to pull him onto the pavement, but he continued to act violently and resisted the attempts to pull him to safety. Despite repeated reminders to the man to comply with Police’s instructions, the man continued to be aggressive and charged towards one of our officers. One of the Police officers used a taser with the aim of subduing the man. However, one of the probes of the taser was later dislodged, limiting its effectiveness. As the officers were moving closer to assess the health condition of the man, he got up from the ground and dashed across the road junction. Officers caught up with the man and he was eventually subdued when a second round of taser was deployed. In the process, the man assaulted and injured two police officers. The man was arrested for disorderly behaviour, voluntarily causing hurt to public servants and alleged consumption of controlled drugs. He is also wanted for an outstanding warrant of arrest. In considering the use of force, the Police take into consideration the proportionality of the force to be applied vis-a-vis the perceived threat, the safety of the target on which force is to be applied, and that of the general public and our officers. As far as possible, officers do not want to use so much force as to hurt the target. However, this means that it may not be so easy to subdue him. It is a difficult balance, but officers have chosen to err on the side of taking consideration of the target’s safety where they can.

Tan became distant, aloof and uninterested in his work, and took frequent medical leave.\n\n&gt; He lost his job at Dentons Rodyck in September 2017 after being told to resign. Untreated, Tan’s depressive symptoms worsened and he turned to binging on alcohol. When that gradually lost its effectiveness, Tan turned to methamphetamine, which he found calming.\n\n&gt; In 2018, Tan came to know that his wife had remarried, which triggered painful memories, resulting in him relapsing into drug consumption.\n\n&gt; Tan was arrested at Woodlands Checkpoint on 17 March 2018 when an AETOS officer who searched his vehicle found a grey pouch in the area behind the driver’s seat, which contained a glass tube and an improvised glass apparatus commonly used to consume methamphetamine.\n\n&gt; An Immigration and Checkpoints Authority (ICA) Task Force officer who also searched the car found four straws and other utensils wrapped in newspaper at the back of the car. Tan admitted that he used these to consume methamphetamine, which is a Class A controlled drug in the First Schedule to the Misuse of Drugs Act (MDA).\n\n&gt; Upon further inspection, a red packet containing 10 slabs of tablets and a crystalline substance was unearthed. All 100 tablets were analysed to contain nimetazepam, which is a Class C controlled drug in the First Schedule to the MDA. These had been purchased in Malaysia at Iman’s request, with Tan agreeing to deliver the drugs to Singapore for a price of $750.\n\n&gt; A second packet of crystalline substance was also found in a spectacle case in the back netting of the car. Both the packets of crystalline substances were sealed in bags and sent for analysis, where they were found to contain methamphetamine.\n\n&gt; The first packet was found to contain not less than 7.13g of methamphetamine, while the second contained no less than 1.65g of the same drug. Tan admitted to buying the methamphetamine for his own consumption.\n\n&gt; After he was arrested, Tan was brought to the Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) office where he provided two bottles of urine samples. Both contained methamphetamine.\n\n&gt; Tan later admitted to consuming the drug at the residence of the individual whom he had purchased the drugs from. He did so to feel alert and awake in order to drive back to Singapore, according to the prosecution.\n\n&gt; CNB officers raided Tan’s house the next day and found more drugs in the drawer of his bedside table. This was found to contain no less than 4.39g of methamphetamine. Tan said that he intended to consume the drug himself.\n\n&gt; This was noted by DJ Kaur, who commented that the amount of drugs were small and meant for personal consumption.\n\n&gt; The judge also took into consideration that Tan had spent many hours in therapy for depression and drug use and that a doctor had noted that Tan is unlikely to relapse.\n\n&gt; Tan has since remarried and is a managing director at his own law firm. After the hearing, an emotional Tan was seen hugging his wife and other friends and family, around 15 of whom had packed the court room.\n\n&gt; For possessing drug utensils for consumption, Tan may be jailed up to three years or fined up to $10,000 fine, or both. For each of the other four charges, he faces a jail term of up to 10 years or a maximum fine of $20,000, or both.\n\n&gt; Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore\n\n&gt; More Singapore stories:\n\n&gt; Most Singaporeans neutral or positive about foreigners in the country: Reach poll\n\n&gt; Married parents to get $3,000 grant for each baby born from 1 Oct to 30 Sep 2022: Indranee\n\n&gt; ERP rates at 6 CTE gantries to rise by $1 from next Monday: LTA\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)""]"

I’m writing my thoughts here.

I understand that for historical reasons and because bad people exist ( drug kingpins will keep trying to make money), the death penalty exists in Singapore. The drug kingpins and middle men will therefore always seek and identify - and also be approached by - people who would be willing or unwilling sellers and mules. 

Are there enough safety nets in Singapore that would help a person push back on being a customer-facing seller/dealer or a mule?

For those that take up such work because it is “easy money” - I can think of daunting roadblocks such as:
- think of the people you want to see before you are executed after being caught someday, because you will eventually be caught ( tip off by jealous people, for e.g.)
- build up skills now and you can get honest employment and can also explore doing business.
- being taught the impact of their actions on users ( who themselves need help to understand they should not take drugs in the first place)
- meetings with others already on “death row” to get dissuaded ( how to identify those vulnerable)
- other ideas?

For those that take up such work because of coercion or duress:
- what are the things that they can do? (For example: approach police or some NGO)
- safer alternatives to loan sharks ( are there any?)
- how to deal with blackmail ( e.g if their personal pics and videos fall in others’ hands, then how to disclose parents or family and deal with the first wave of anger and ridicule them them).

Have such discussions happened in Singapore?

Are there organisations or ministries that think about and identify and help those who have slipped through support nets?

How would a person who feels helpless know whom to approach and what to tell?

I realise also that reducing the demand for drugs is another approach, but there would be the bored people who need something new. I haven’t thought that through.

This is all that I’m capable of thinking of. There are much smarter people than me in this sub and in Singapore. I would like to learn their thoughts.

While admittedly I'm not like the significant proportion of the Singapore Reddit community that completely oppose the death penalty, I am completely against this particular instance involving Syed Suhail.

The current coronavirus case makes it all the more unfair that he's being executed on such a short notice (8 days, if I remember correctly?). Furthermore, I do feel that his case warrants a commutation of his sentence to be reduced. Even if reduced to life imprisonment, that's already better than getting hanged.

It's not like he's a criminal boss or a big-time drug runner. Also, to put it in a way, in this instance he's a product of the shortcomings of Singapore's systems. I don't think it's right for the country to kill its own citizens because of its own shortcomings.

Local figures like Kirsten Han and Subhas have also taken to social media to raise awareness on the issue, in hopes that Syed Suhail's death sentence will be commuted. Wakeupsingapore (as much as I hate that Instagram page) has also shared some posts relating to the death sentence.

- Cost of controlling the drug. Someone tried to argue with me that decriminalising the drug reduces costs of enforcement and punishment. However like with all drugs, legalizing drugs also requires the process of controlling it because all drugs can be abused. What then is an acceptable amount? Who should be allowed to buy and distribute it? All this costs money. Whether it is safe or not, it is already illegal currently. That is all that matters. There is no need to incur the extra cost and challenge that comes with legalizing it.

- We have a reputation to upkeep. No drugs means no drugs. Drug traffickers don't care about the difference between cannabis and heroin.

Click to see the gallery.\n\n&gt; SINGAPORE: Law and Home Affairs Minister K Shanmugam rejected the notion that Singapore is softening its stance on drugs as Parliament passed amendments on Tuesday (Jan 15) to the Misuse of Drugs Act, some of which will bolster the country\'s drug rehabilitation regime.\n\n&gt; One of the changes to the Act would allow recalcitrant drug abusers - who have been caught three times or more, but do not face other criminal charges - to be sent for rehabilitation instead of being put in jail.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Under the previous long-term imprisonment regime, these offenders faced at least five years in jail and three strokes of the cane.\n\n&gt; ""There is a risk of these changes being characterised as we are going soft ... we will point out that the approach we are taking is based on evidence. It\'s not about going hard or going soft,"" Mr Shanmugam said during his closing speech in Parliament.\n\n&gt; ""The knowledge and experience built up over the last 20 years enables us to take a risk-based approach which, as far as possible, takes into consideration an individual\'s risk and protective factors so that the intervention is most effective and appropriate.""\n\n&gt; During the debate, several Members of Parliament raised concerns that the move could be perceived as a softening of Singapore\'s stance on drugs.\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; Advertisement\n\n&gt; ""I am concerned that this approach may be perceived to be soft, a slap on the wrist, and may send the wrong signal to those tempted to experiment with drugs,"" MP for Tanjong Pagar GRC Chia Shi-Lu said.\n\n&gt; MP for Tampines GRC Desmond Choo asked if “removing the threat"" of long-term imprisonment would send ""conflicting signals"" on Singapore\'s zero-tolerance approach to drugs, as he urged authorities to consider a cap on rehabilitation stints before a jail term is imposed.\n\n&gt; Mr Shanmugam said authorities will distinguish between offenders who consume drugs and those who also face charges for other offences.\n\n&gt; Noting that the drug situation has improved - almost 5,800 abusers were arrested in 1996 as compared to slightly more than 3,000 in 2017 - Mr Shanmugam said authorities can afford to focus more on rehabilitation for abusers.\n\n&gt; ""Long periods of detention can affect abusers\' employability after they are released,"" he stated, adding that reintegration is also a challenge they face.\n\n&gt; Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Home Affairs Sun Xueling said the Government is ""keeping abreast with new research and developments"" to better achieve its aim of reducing overall drug abuse.\n\n&gt; ""I also want to emphasise that we are not becoming more permissive about drugs,"" she added. ""Drugs come at a high cost to society and suffering behind every abuser is a family. We have no reason to go soft and we must not.""\n\n&gt; RESOURCES A CHALLENGE?\n\n&gt; Beyond matters of principle, the changes to the Act also mean that more drug abusers will enter the Drug Rehabilitation Centre. One out of every two abusers who may have been jailed will now qualify for rehabilitation, Mr Shanmugam said.\n\n&gt; The maximum period of detention in the centre will also be raised from three to four years.\n\n&gt; Several MPs raised concerns about the resources needed to fulfil these initiatives, noting that counsellors already face challenges - like mental health stressors - in their jobs.\n\n&gt; ""While the amendments do not foresee any increase in public expenditure, how much more support will be given to counsellors and halfway house employees and volunteers to help keep recidivism numbers low?"" Workers’ Party MP Pritam Singh asked.\n\n&gt; ""The reality when we speak of rehabilitation and the new calibrated approach is that someone, somewhere will be on the delivery end of the outcome sought.""\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Ms Sun acknowledged that the initiatives could be resource-intensive, but said the use of digital technology will help where possible.\n\n&gt; For instance, she pointed to the Singapore Prison Service’s plans to hold counselling sessions via video-conferencing and an app containing self-help resources and a job database for former offenders as examples.\n\n&gt; “The app and video conferencing initiatives will go a long way to benefiting inmates, including drug offenders,” she added.\n\n&gt; PROTECTING CHILDREN\n\n&gt; The MPs, however, welcomed changes that would make it mandatory for parents and guardians of youth drug abusers who are under supervision orders to attend drug counselling.\n\n&gt; If the parents or guardians refuse to be involved in the counselling without a reasonable excuse, the Court can fine them or order them to attend the sessions.\n\n&gt; In addition, the changes criminalise various acts that expose children to drugs. For example, it is now an offence for an adult to recklessly leave drugs or drug utensils within easy access of a child.\n\n&gt; Mr Shanmugam said this serves to ""protect children, young persons from the reckless acts of older people"".\n\n&gt; “We have to give the next generation the best chance of living a drug-free life,” he added. “Young people who have already started on drugs, we must provide them with the support to get out of that cycle as quickly as possible.”\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n0.3.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

Our dogs, cats and rabbits live through hell during their childhood stay at puppy mills, kitten factories and rabbit farms.

Their parents are still in hell. They spent an eternity in their painful cages and their mothers are repeated rape just so they can make their owners rich.

After they give birth, their mothers would never see their babies again.

Though we conveniently deny it, animals do have feelings. They feel joy, fear and tears. Those places cause immeasurable amount of suffering.

Even though we are not from the same specicies, we should show empathy towards our favourite companions. They made us smile when we are sad, they give us comfort when we are lonely. We should reciprocate and protect them in return.

Singapore should not be a country where the strong eat the weak and instead strive towards building a community where the strong protect the weak. There are no weaker beings than our little companions. Lets ban puppy mills, kitten factories and rabbit farms.

P.S. The idea is not an all out ban like drugs. You can still buy from private breeders. It is more like a chewing gum ban. The goal is to increase the number of shelter animals adopted, decrease the number of animals killed and decrease the suffering at puppy mills, kitten factories and rabbit farms. .

59,singapore,159821,I view Singapore with rose-tinted glasses. Tell me what am I missing?,b1pcem,Ganaria-Gente,1552716804,194,184,"As someone living in Canada, I have been reading about Singapore with fascination for a long time, and for many years have admired Sing's authoritarian-democratic, free market/socialist model that you guys are enjoying.  Please tell me where i'm wrong:

- Urban transit: way better than Canada's shitty public transit system. Plus, singapore heavily taxes car ownership. Result? public transit is well funded &amp; popular, while car ownership (which is very expensive &amp; heavily polluting) is very low &amp; only for the rich (who must pay heavy fees &amp; taxes). This also means gas prices don't worry you, whereas we are obsessed about it. 

- Healthcare: again, way better than here. Canadians always compare themselves against the awful BS in American healthcare and think we have it good.  Wrong!

- Housing: This one's huge. As you may have heard, Vancouver &amp; Toronto are in the Top 5 world's most expensive cities for housing. And yet, fools here are overstretching their mortgages irresponsibly.  Meanwhile, homelessness is awful &amp; getting worse. Subsidized Housing has a long wait-list, and is filled with drug addicts, shifty people, or worse. In contrast, Sing has negligible homesslessness, and housing for the masses is well-subsidized.  And it's safe. And there's no ""housing envy"" when one house looks wealthier than your neighbor's. (also, here's a quote from the Economist: ""Singaporeans are granted an extra discount if they choose to buy property located in the same neighbourhood as their parents, nudging them to help with care that could otherwise fall to the state."".....that's genius!! holy shit!)

- Public Safety: street crime rates are rock bottom (something that Sing has in common with Jap and SK and TW). I get the impression you can really trust in the Singapore police.  Not so here, where the police &amp; the public have an uneasy relationship. 

- Drug problems: Sing, again much like JP, SK, and TW, has no real endemic drug problem. In contrast, the foolish War on Drugs has been a massive &amp; expensive failure for Americans, while Canadians are also addicted (albeit with homegrown drugs instead of Latin American stuff).

- Multiculturalism: this is another Big one.  Canada (and esp. our shitty Prime Minister) likes to brag about its multiculturalism &amp; diversity, while ignoring it's failures.  Here's the problem: **self-segregation**. Like most other Western countries, Canadian multiculturalism is basically ethnic enclaves: Indians live &amp; interact with Indians; Chinese with Chinese; white people with whites; Persians with persians. And entire families (except their kids) speak zero English. And you know what, that's because human beings prefer to be that way. Our brains are wired to behave like that.  But in singapore's case, the govt literally forces Indians, Chinese, Malay to live next to each other.  Which means everyone learned English, and you don't hear accusations about racism or Islamophobia or whatever.

- Balance between free speech &amp; social harmony: now, this is a controversial one.  China/Russia/Iran has chosen to ban free speech &amp; censor the internet. USA has free speech (well, mostly) but as a result allows a lot of bullshitters &amp; assholes &amp; shitty MSM. Sing has free internet, somewhat-free speech, and somewhat-free elections. Basically, if you are not a troublemaker, you will be fine 99% of the time. You know all the dumb shit happening in American MSM? I personally hate these professional liars. that's not a problem in Sing. 

- Economy: what can i say that hasn't been said? here, Canada relies on just finance, lumber, oil, tech, entertainment sectors.....and not much else.  Very unstable, unreliable and undependable.  Meanwhile, it doesn't matter how hard Xi Jinping shills the OBOR, cuz Sing will always always be super important.  It doesn't matter if it's oil, cars, cheap plastic toys, piss &amp; poo....if there's ANY product (or parts of a product or factory) that need to be transported in a cost-effective way from Asia-Pacific to Europe/Africa/South Asia (or vice versa), you need to use Sing. That's impressive for a ""country"" that consists of just one metropolis.

- Corruption: Sing appears to be less corrupt than TW and SK and equally with JP. Canada meanwhile is currently embroiled in yet another govt scandal (again, thanks to our retarded PM). 

- Political partisanship: Doesn't really exist in Sing. But absolutely exists (and poisons) most other democracies, including Canada.

61,singapore,163270,"Is this analysis of drug enforcement effectiveness data ""potentially misleading""?",bbuoxm,SmirkingImperialist,1554949024,68,31,"As I grow older, I came to the belief that government anywhere does not really know what they are doing. A government's competence has little to do with how it is structured or what law it is enforcing but rather the general level of development and competency of the population.

One thing the Singapore government is very proud of, apparently, is the draconian enforcement of criminalisation of certain substances called ""drugs"". The government from top to bottom keep saying the same thing: our effort is great, we don't have as many drug users as other countries. The Singapore ambassador to the US wrote very proudly that Singapore in the Washington post that Singapore managed to reduce the number of drug user arrested from 6000/year in the 90s to ~3000/year in 2017.
https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/health/singapore-is-winning-the-war-on-drugs-says-ambassador-to-us
(Washington Post is behind a paywall)

While what he wrote was technically correct, he conveniently ignored the data in the in the 2002s. No one seems to read the annual report the CNB put out or the data released by CNB, apparently.
https://www.cnb.gov.sg/newsandevents/reports-(overview)
https://data.gov.sg/dataset/demographic-profile-of-drug-abusers

The 2002 report contained data of total number of drug users arrested from 1992 to 2002. The number of drug users arrested did decreased from &gt;6000 in 1992 to ~3300 in 2002. The point of lowest number of drug user arrested was actually in 2005, with 793 arrested that year. The 2005 report was very, very proud of that fact, and it was short. 7 pages long. An equivalent report of the Australian counterparts is 60 pages long.
The lowest point for number of drug user arrested was in 2005, with 793 arrested.

Then the number started ticking back up. About 2 years later, the number was 2211. The 2007 report is still relatively short, 6 pages long; but it contained only 2006 and 2007 numbers. Then things kinda keep going up; and in 2017, the total arrests of drug users is 3091, the report is 19 pages long, and the draught of data is still the same (just 2016 and 2017 numbers).

The CNB used to release a data set called the street price of major drug of abuse. The price of heroin, according to that data set has crashed straight through the floor. If I ask you to name single legal thing that you can buy in Singapore whose price has decreased in absolute terms in 2017 compared to 2008, you will be very hard pressed. If I expand it into illegal drugs; it's easy. I questioned the CNB over this data and they gave me some very unsatisfactory answers. Then the dataset was taken off data.gov.sg.

In the course of researching this topic, I came across the most useless Master thesis dissertation ever:
https://scholarbank.nus.edu.sg/handle/10635/23099
The dissertation is supposedly an analysis of the CNB effectiveness as a case study. It spent 80 pages on basically literature reviews of methodology, Singapore's laws, and the CNB structure and resources. Then the actual part that is directly related to the title, the analysis, is 10 pages long. My PhD committee will fail me if my dissertation has that structure.

All of the data I used in in the public domain; some have since been rescinded since I contacted the CNB over my interpretation of it.

So, what happened? We keep reading in the news about the CNB busting kilos of drugs, but one cursory look at the number of judicial execution see an interesting trend:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capital_punishment_in_Singapore
It went down. From 1994-1996, Singapore executed 50-75 people; no doubt a lot of them drug traffickers. This probably contributed to the drop of drug users in the 90s. From the low point of drug users arrested in 2005 to 2017, the number of executed per year remained well under 9 per year. How?

Before I answer that, here's another interesting trend: the purity of heroin in Singapore went from ~50% (sample seized in 80s) to 5% (more recent samples).
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28670869

Think about that for a moment. How can the purity of drugs go down? If your drug is less pure; you need to haul more of it and make yourself easier to be caught. Every other category of drugs, including alcohol during the American Prohibition displayed the trend of increasing purity. Americans went from drinking beers before the Prohibition to 80-proof moonshine. Methamphetamine went from 20-30% pure ""Yaba pills"" in South East Asia to 80-90% pure crystal meth (a lot of which sold by North Korean diplomats). Even cannabis: cannabis growers should receive PhDs for their astounding feats of selective breeding despite very limited equipment. They managed to create strains with ~50% THC (the psychoactive components cannabis), up from the rather low 10-15% of yesteryears.

Here is my interpretation and speculation as why heroin sellers can still sell their stuff and not get executed as much recently compared to the 90s. Heroin is still a major drug of abuse in Singapore: about one-third of user arrests are related to heroin. Singapore death penalty are based on the amount of pure substance trafficked. In the case of heroin, it's the amount of pure diamorphine. 15g is the mandatory threshold. What happens for every seizure is the police need to estimate the purity, then calculate from the total amount of heroin no. 3 (low quality) seized to get the pure diamorphine quantity. Basing the penalty on the total pure amount is absolutely vital as far as the law goes since without this, it's hilariously easy to frame someone for a death penalty: throw 2kg of flour mixed with 0.5g of heroin into someone's possession and viola, deadman walking.

When heroin sold and trafficked was 50% pure, getting caught with 30g is a death penalty. More recently, heroin has become less pure; meaning ~300g will be the death penalty. Still heroin is heroin, less pure heroin can't deliver the same high and users won't accept it.  How can the sellers make up the 45% missing ""purity""?

Enter: ultra-potent synthetic opioids. Heroin is ~2x more potent than morphine. Fentanyl is ~100x more potent than morphine and Carfentanil is ~10.000x more potent. rug mules can traffic 5% heroin and 0.9% fentanyl or 0.009% Carfentanil mixture for the same potency. 15g diamorphine is enough for ~100 average doses (150mg diamorphine/dose). Opioids build tolerance so new users may need ~10-20mg but long-term users may require over 200mg. 30g of heroin no. 3 (the common type of heroin sold) result in death penalty. Now with the new mixture, the death penalty starts at ~300g of 5% pure heroin mixture; and it's enough for 1000 doses instead.

Fentanyl and Carfentanil are Schedule 2 drugs: misuse attracts jail terms but not death penalties. And we need them to remain available or a lot of patients will suffer needlessly.

There is an important lesson of war and conflict: when you are fighting other humans, who are intelligent and adapt to your tactics, you will find your tactics fast becoming less and less effective. In a total war, you can go balls-to-the-walls genocidal and ""make a solitude and call it peace"". The civilian society is not a warzone, the population are not partisans and guerrillas (by and large), and the police can not be the Gestapo or NKVD (I hope).",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bbuoxm/is_this_analysis_of_drug_enforcement/,0.0,"['&gt; I questioned the CNB over this data and they gave me some very unsatisfactory answers.

62,singapore,162078,Does Offensive Speech Include Anti-LGBT Rants?,b8dbgi,jtcd,1554172560,171,139,"From the article [Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga lyrics listed as 'offensive' in Parliament handout](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ariana-grande-lady-gaga-lyrics-listed-offensive-parliament-handout-135538741.html):

&gt; The minister also said that offensive speech can lead to “**dehumanisation**” and create an environment “**conducive to discrimination and eventually violence**”. Offensive speech, which can imply that its targets lack **morality, intelligence or dignity**, is “even more insidious” than hate speech, he added.

Lawrence Khong, FCBC Pastor, February 19 2014:

&gt; The greatest fallacy of the LGBT argument is: I have no choice. I am born this way. Therefore, I can't help it. I've tried so hard to change. So give me my space. It is my right. Don't oppress me.""
&gt;
&gt; As a pastor of more than 36 years, I've heard this again and again from different people, even well-educated and successful people, on so many different destructive behaviours.
&gt;
&gt; This is exactly what drug addicts have told me. ""I have no choice. I can't help it. I've tried so hard to change. I've gone in and out of DRC. Everytime I come out, I am determined to change. But before I can get home after my release, I'm back on drugs. So I'm born this way. This is my fate, my lot. Give me my space. It is my right. Don't oppress me.""
&gt;
&gt; A husband said to me, ""I can't help it. When I am attracted to a woman, I have to pursue her until I can have her. I love my wife. But I can't help it. I am made this way.""
&gt;
&gt; **I hear the same from wife beaters, gamblers, kleptomaniacs, pedophiles, homosexuals, lesbians and so on**. Now, in putting them on a linear list like this, I risk being misunderstood as comparing the LGBTs, for example, with drug addicts, wife beaters and so forth. Hey, in no way am I saying that. Not at all.
&gt;
&gt; So, as a pastor, I make time to hear them out. I have seen them crying profusely in my office about their struggles. They are so genuine, so honest with their feelings, so sincere, and **yet SO WRONG**.
&gt;
&gt; I counsel them to act against their own passions. I confront them with their wrongs—because even if it is a case of compulsive disorder or pre-disposition as some would claim, they cannot use that as a final criteria for what is right and wrong, and justify themselves. In fact, being pre-disposed in a certain way does not mean that the person has to give in to those predispositions. So, I help them not to make excuses. I teach them to take personal responsibility and not to blame others. And above all, as a pastor, I help them to encounter God and His power.
&gt;
&gt; I've seen many change over the years. But there are also many who harden their hearts. Some get angry at me for calling **what they do as sin**. For example, pornography, drug abuse, molestation, **homosexuality**, adultery, etc. Sadly, just because I don't accept their excuses, they walk away saying that I don't understand. They think I despise them when **I insist that what they’re doing is wrong**. However, like a physician, the most cruel thing to do is to tell a patient that his cancer is ok. Everything is fine.
&gt;
&gt; This is the deception I see occurring around the world in regard to morality. If the gay who practises anal sex says ""I am born this way, so give me my rights,"" why can't the pedophile and all those who practise incest, necrophilia and beastiality say the same thing.
&gt;
&gt; What if one day we discover the existence of a violent gene. Do we then relax or abolish laws against murder? The difference between man and animal is this: as human beings, we don't have to yield to our primal instincts. We cannot just do whatever we feel like doing, however we please. We have the freedom of choice and the capacity to do what is best for humanity, for our nation and for civilisation.

In 2016, devout Christian, Bryan Lim, threatened to [""open-fire"" on LGBTs](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/bryan-lim-charged-threatening-open-fire-lgbt-community-singapore):

&gt; I am a Singaporean citizen. I am a NSman. I am a father. And I swore to protect my nation. Give me the permission to open fire. I would like to see these £@€$^*s die for their causes...

Perhaps Minister Shanmugam has a point about offensive speech. It can indeed certainly ""create an environment conducive to discrimination and eventually violence"".  

I wonder whether hate speech laws will protect all targets or only select groups.

Narcotics officers took over the matter and arrested them.\n\n&gt; Several items were seized from the hotel room, including a used syringe, two straws, a white bottle, and three packets of drugs.\n\n&gt; Analysts from the Health Sciences Authority found that one packet contained 0.14g of ketamine, while the other two contained 0.92g and 0.42g of methamphetamine respectively. The straws were stained with cocaine and methamphetamine.\n\n&gt; Besides the three security personnel, the prosecution will be calling 20 other witnesses, including Sim.\n\n&gt; They will also introduce text message records from Sim’s mobile phone to prove that Ler knew he was injecting methamphetamine into Sim.\n\n&gt; Sim has since been dealt with separately in court.\n\n&gt; NEW CHARGES UNRELATED TO HIV DATA LEAK\n\n&gt; Ler’s current trial before District Judge Christopher Goh is not related to the HIV data scandal earlier this year, which affected 14,200 individuals here.\n\n&gt; His partner, Brochez, is accused of leaking the records of HIV patients from a Ministry of Health (MOH) registry — data he had gotten through Ler, who was previously the head of MOH’s National Public Health Unit.\n\n&gt; Ler lost his appeal in March against his conviction for helping Brochez cheat on a blood test, so he could continue working in Singapore, and of providing false information to the police and MOH. Ler is now serving a two-year jail sentence.\n\n&gt; The prosecution meanwhile applied for two other charges against Ler to be stood down.\n\n&gt; They are for failing to provide a urine sample to the Central Narcotics Bureau on March 2, 2018, and for failing to take reasonable care of confidential information regarding HIV-positive patients under the Official Secrets Act.\n\n&gt; If convicted of administering methamphetamine, Ler could be jailed up to 10 years and fined up to S$20,000. If convicted of possessing a drug utensil, he could be jailed up to three years and fined up to S$10,000.\n\n&gt; The trial continues on Thursday afternoon.\n\n&gt; \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)']"

I don't hate Singapore and I'm grateful for being born here. But I've told myself that I don't want to spend the rest of my life here and be buried here someday.

I'm currently 21 and now serving NS so it's not like I'll be able to go anywhere soon. But as a person who grew up spending too much time on the internet. My interests, ideas and views has aligned a lot differently from the culture of my own country. I've been obsessed with America, reading up a lot about it, watching too many videos, film and t.v about the U.S and I don't want to have shame admitting that I really like the U.S and really want to migrate there someday. Even my bunkmate has told me that I'm a person who was born in the wrong country cause I've ironically develop an American accent without even stepping foot in the U.S which people in N.S doesn't take kindly if you have a different accent.

I want to experience a lot of the things that they have there that I can't have here as a Singaporean because we are a small state with a lot of restrictive laws which made me really upset. 
That's not to say that I want to do drugs and all of those nonsense stuff but a lot of the things that I want are cheaper and much more accessible there that I'm willing to sacrifice some of the comforts here to move there.

And I know this is weird but growing up with gaming especially Tactical FPS games has made me obsessed with firearms that I started spending so much time watching gun Youtubers from the States like Hickok45, Garand Thumb, Larry's Tactical, Colion Noir that furthered my obsession with the gun culture the States have and I really wanted to be a part of that culture which is non-existent here and the entire region.

I've tried going to different subreddits asking for advice and a lot of people have been encouraging me to follow my dreams and move but obviously with most of these people being American they would be more bias about people liking their country. Someone even suggested enlisting in the U.S military with a green card but getting a green card is extremely difficult in the first place and I don't even know if I'll be enlistment age by then.

I've tried sharing this with my mom but my parents are extremely unsupportive of my endeavor and would just blare all the cliche arguments about why USA bad. And this has made me feel even worse if my parents are not even supportive of my life dream. 

I know this post has been going long but I've been keeping this in for awhile now and I just wanted to let it off my chest. I really wanna hear what is your input of this from as fellow Singaporeans and what advice can you give to help my feel less helpless.

I’ll be honest. I’m not the most hardworking of people and I wanted a break from studying to play a quick game of Dota 2. I stopped playing for awhile and really wanted to get back into it after so long so I went into my brother’s room looking for a mousepad. That’s when I found it.

I found a small plastic smoke pipe that looked like it had been burnt at the bottom so it has clearly been used. It caught me off guard and at a glimpse, I only saw those gel balls you find it clothing around it so I thought maybe he was weird and experimenting by burning those but I looked around and saw a packet. I picked it up trying to see what it was and I found a bunch of white crystals. Opened another drawer and it’s full of those compact blowtorches.

I don’t know what to do. I never thought this would happen to me. I always was the person to tell people what was the right thing to do. I’d probably tell someone in my situation to just call the police as we shouldn’t always take things into our own hands. But I’m afraid.

I have no idea what this will do to my family. My mum and dad have been on shaky grounds as my dad cheated last year plus their both over 50.

I signed a contract in a tech company starting this November. I'll relocate to Singapore by the end of October and I have some questions. I'd highly appreciate some feedback regarding my choices :) Some background information to me:

&amp;#x200B;

* 28years old
* Swiss
* \+- 200k SGP$/year package
* local contract (Employee pass)
* covering APAC (travel 30-50% for business)
* athletic, likes to workout couple times a week. 
* enjoy good food, no alcohol / drugs etc
* not materialistic at all

&amp;#x200B;

I read already a bunch about Singapore and I really look forward to move there. My plan is to rent an apartment (1room) at the concourse skyline ([https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/20135839/for-rent-concourse-skyline](https://www.propertyguru.com.sg/listing/20135839/for-rent-concourse-skyline)). It's a 1km walk to the office and a 25min car drive to the airport. I don't want to own a car so it's important to me to be close to both office and the airport and downtown. I'm selling all my furnitures and my car. My plan is to arrive with 2-4 bags of clothes and my laptop. I'll buy a bed and a desk for the apartment, I don't think I need much more. I read on different post that sometimes it's not allowed to cook in the apartment and that's why there are usually no dishwasher. I heard the best option for daily nutrition is the food court where it's also affordable but I like to cook sometimes (specially breakfast) by myself. Currently I have no plans going back and no matter what happens I'll stay for at least 2 years but it's very likely that I extend for more years if I like it in Singapore and renew my Employee Pass). My work contract is a local one and unlimited. I also plan to learn a little bit mandarine (speaking not writing). So my goal is to take on average a 1h class a week.

&amp;#x200B;

My questions:

1. would you recommend this location for my use case or should I look for something else? 
2. Do people really almost always eat out and don't cook at home? 
3. What are the best practises to go to the office (1km walk) in business clothes without sweating all over the place. Do you rent some electronic scooters or maybe it makes sense to buy a handy one. 
4. I need a 24/7 gym membership, any other recommendation than this one: [https://www.loftgym.com/](https://www.loftgym.com/) ?
5. what else should I consider before moving there?

The teenager had wanted to celebrate her birthday at a hotel with friends, but a misunderstanding turned it into a nightmare, involving police arrests and over 14 hours in custody for the girl and her friends.

Taking to Instagram on Sunday (Nov 24) to share her ordeal, user Sharonia Paruntu said she had spent 14 hours under police arrest after a deodorant powder - tawas powder or alum powder - she had taken to W Singapore in Sentosa Cove in a small resealable plastic bag was mistaken for drugs by the hotel staff.

The police told The New Paper that on Nov 10, at 9.29am, they were alerted to a packet of white powdery substance, suspected to be drugs, found in a room in W Singapore.

A man and three women aged between 18 and 19, who had occupied the room, were subsequently arrested for suspected possession and consumption of controlled drugs.

The police said: ""They were released unconditionally at 1.43am on Nov 11 after preliminary testing on the white powder and their urine samples turned up negative for controlled drugs.""

On her Instagram account, Miss Paruntu described the exchange with the police in the hotel room.

She said after they found the bag of powder, she had said: ""Yeah, just put (the powder) on your armpit then you wouldn't smell for the rest of the day.""

She said the police escorted her and her friends out of the hotel in handcuffs.

Miss Paruntu, an Indonesian living in Singapore, posted: ""And the police escorted us out of the hotel with handcuffs, and it was really humiliating because some of the hotel guests saw us and assumed we are (criminals).""

Lawyers and legal experts TNP spoke to said the police had acted well within their powers.

Criminal lawyer Amolat Singh told TNP that under the law, the police can hold a suspect in custody for up to 48 hours to conduct preliminary investigations.

He added that the basis of having reasonable suspicion is enough for an arrest to be made.

According to Miss Paruntu's Instagram stories, two of her friends were stuck inside the hotel room's bathroom at around 2am because they could not open the bathroom door.

Her other friends attempted to open the door but ended up breaking the clear sliding door.

They decided to call the hotel staff for help. The staff who arrived then spotted the bag of powder, but according to Miss Paruntu, did not ask her what the powder was.

Mr Singh said the circumstances surrounding the incident, including the broken bathroom door, coupled with the bag of white powder, could have appeared incriminating, increasing reason for suspicion.

The 14-hour arrest was also not entirely out of the ordinary, lawyers said.

Mr Rajan Supramaniam, a senior criminal lawyer, told TNP that test procedures could take several hours because the specimen has to be sent to the Health Sciences Authority for testing and can take some time.

He said the police have to adhere to protocol, and as long as there is reasonable suspicion, the police have to do their duty and act within their powers.

He added that it is also not out of the ordinary that the police had cuffed the teenagers.

Mr Supramaniam said that there are situations in which the police will cuff their suspects, such as if there is a large group, or the suspect is insolent, uncooperative or exhibiting rowdiness or violent behaviour.

Miss Paruntu posted on Instagram that after her mother wrote to the Singapore Tourism Board and the Marriott customer service, the hotel, which is under Marriott International, apologised and refunded the $1,700 they had charged for the broken door.

TNP contacted Miss Paruntu for comment on Sunday but did not receive a response by press time.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/e1u84e/birthday_girl_friends_held_by_cops_for_14_hours/,0.0,"[""Instead of SWATing, couldn't people just CNB people with bags of talcum powder then?""]"

I was born in Australia, but my Mum is from Singapore. I am currently in university in Australia, and I have recently had my PR application approved, therefore I am now a PR of Singapore. I will be doing NS next year.

I'm prescribed Generic Dexedrine (Dextroamphetamine/Dexamphetamine), for TBI in Australia. As far as i've researched, it is a prohibited drug in Singapore, and only Methylphenidate is prescribed for TBI/ADHD. However, on the HSA website, they allow import for personal use, as long as you apply in advanced.

What i'm worried about is if this applies for tourists only, or includes PRs. In the case that it does not include PRs, then I would like to know if the **Misuse of Drugs Act** would apply to me, which states that **a person who is a citizen or a permanent resident of Singapore outside as well as within Singapore where he is found as a result of urine tests to have smoked, administered to himself or otherwise consumed a controlled drug or a specified drug, he may be dealt with as if that offence had been committed within Singapore.**

What this means is if I took Dex legally in Australia, and went to Singapore, and i'm tested positive for Dex, I will go through the same consequences as a person who took Dex illegally in Singapore.

&amp;#x200B;

The problem is that, I will be going to Singapore in January to do a medical screening, as required before enlisting to the army. They are most likely going to drug test my urine. Then again, in the medical survey required before registering for medical screening, they ask for information about pre-existing health conditions. Im afraid if I list TBI and Dextroamphetamine as a current medication, it will qualify as evidence of taking controlled drugs. On the other hand, it could give allowance for the presence of Dex in my system.

Thanks for taking time to read this, it's a really stressful situation for me. I've emailed HSA about the eligibility to import Dex, but i'm afraid to contact CMPB, as i'm afraid mentioning my prescription for Dex would result in the possibility of being labeled as a controlled drug user.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/e11ahn/dexamphetamine_consumption_as_a_pr_in_a_foreign/,0.0,"[""When you go for medical screening, at the end of the screening, you will see a doctor who asks you if you have any current medical conditions. If you have any documentation in Australia about your condition and what is prescribed to you, just inform him. If you don't have any documentation, get it asap.\n\nI believe, since your medication is prescribed by a practising doctor and consumed in that country, there will be no repercussion. However, if you are bringing in controlled medication to be consumed locally, you will need approval from HSA at least 10 days prior to your trip.""]"

But majority of the world view I once held over 10 years ago have changed. I no longer support the death penalty or caning. I am no longer homophobic. I learnt the nuance of all the different ""drugs"" and its history, and I believe individuals should have the right to do what ever they want as long as it doesn't affect anyone else.

The show's ultra realistic and gritty tone with a tinge of political conspiracy was really well suited to the backwaters of Louisiana. The entire experience got me thinking about what would a True Detective style story would be like if it was set in Singapore.

I remember my parents telling me about how Singapore in the past was nowhere near as safe as it is today. In the 1960s and even until the early 1970s, shootings between the police and criminals were frequent. Violent crime was pretty rampant, Vice was common (Secret societies, drugs, prostitution etc.) and to top it all off, the war in Vietnam was going on and the fear/threat of communism was very real in Singapore at the time.

Several inspirations for our plot could include(I'll add more when I can think of them):

-Shootout

-Politically motivated actions by the government in order to cover up a government official's family member being involved with X or Y crime

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Spectrum

The core vibe of the story would be a mashup between True Detective Season 1, Se7en(movie) and Fargo Season 2. The dark humor of Three Billboards outside Ebbings, Missouri also comes to mind and I think that the more unfiltered and less politically correct and racially/religiously charged social environment of the 1960s and 1970s would be conducive to this type of humor. Above all, however, I must stress that the story must be gritty and realistic, ala HBO style. Maybe we could even fit some Baby Driver in there because I want music to be a almost like a character throughout the series. A mix of international hits and local music from the time to supplement the score. This is such an interesting time period and I think that with everything that was going on at the time, the setting will make for an amazing TV miniseries. Obviously authenticity is of paramount importance cough Criminal Minds: Singapore cough so I hope that everything from the music to the setting and clothing and vehicles will be accurate to the time period.

I think the most difficult part of crafting a story like this would be weaving the political elements into it.

(I'm spitballing a plot off the top of my head so I apologize if it's incoherent)
------------------
Series TITLE: Spectrum (2019)

A Vietnamese refugee turned teacher is brutally murdered. Other seemingly unconnected murders happen and the police see connections between these as being the work of an individual or a group of serial killers. The detective is puzzled with these. There are religious elements to the murders. A doomsday cult is immediately suspected.

As the main detective character slowly uncovers the truth about the serial killer throughout his investigation, he realizes that corrupt, senior members of the police force have been turning a blind eye or sometimes dismissing or covering up the killer's tracks. Turns out the killer had been killing prominent trade unionists, activists and dissidents, or in the eyes of the top brass, communists and leftists, and disguising them as seemingly unconnected ritual murders.

After going through a huge effort to arrest/kill the serial killer, his actions are publicized in the media but something about the crime still unsettles him. He looks through his case notes and finds the connections between the suspected communists and their fate (ritually murdered, drugs planted on them, accused of associations with secret societies and gangs and imprisoned). Frustrated with it, the detective character doesn't outright become a communist but he starts digging into another previous ""communist"" raid by stealing Special Branch documents from archives -the infamous Operation Coldstore. Through these documents, he discovers that the government had been falsely arresting ""communists"" to strengthen their hold on power and stifle dissent.

The detective and his journalist/detective partner are shocked and they try to have their story published in international press. On the way to the British Embassy (Commonwealth officials want dirt on the SG government and police), the ISD arrests the detective and his partner in what is now today known as Operation Spectrum although for our story, the raid probably should take place earlier (around mid 1970s to no later than 1983) because the Cold War was already winding down by late 1980s and the government has a more legitimate claim.

The detective and his journalist partner are branded as communists and treasonous traitors trying to ""subvert and overthrow"" the Singaporean government. Both are revealed to have been watched from the beginning/snitched out on by a close friend who was secretly a government informant.

I'm not sure how the story will end but I'm hoping it'll be climactic or it could end tragically with the detective and his partner being executed or they could go to the gallows knowing that the truth had come out because one of their close friends manages to escape with their case notes, publishing them in international media.

The story could start in medias res with the detective and his partner being interrogated and him explaining how everything came to be.

(Regarding the political aspect, I am aware that it's really similar to Fatherland and its plot point about the cover up of the Holocaust and its subsequent uncovering but I think that the stories are sufficiently different to allow it. )

Please tell me what you think about this! Any suggestions on how such a story could be improved would be nice.

110,singapore,116780,Depressed about future prospects,868w56,GramTooNoob,1521692994,173,234,"Long story short, my dad suffered a major stroke 2 years ago which left him bedridden in a nursing home and I rage quit my job 1 year ago. My father lost all his asset gambling in his younger days so he had no asset to his name and I have been living with two sisters (unmarried). Normally I should not have to worried about this, but it turns out my Dad only had $2 in his bank account after gambling the CPF he withdrew at our world class casino. He didn't have much insurance because he cancelled them to save on premiums. For what he had, Aviva denied his claim because they claim he false declared his health status on application (many years ago) and will thus ""eat"" his premium and terminate the policy. The only thing I managed to claim successfully was the DPS and Eldershield thanks to NTUC, but it was after a lengthy one year process to obtain all the ""funny"" documents they needed. Apparently taking care of a mentally incapacitated person is harder than taking care of a dead person, thanks to red tapes everywhere. You don't just walk and say, I am the son and expect everything to fall into place. There is no one unified system at all.

Nonetheless, there was a whole lot of drama in the first year of his stroke due to the hospital, social workers and incapable relatives that requires me to attend to every single thing like I own the company, and I can take time off anytime I want to be a good son like on television. Eventually I was so burn out that everything finally forced me to rage quit my job after a falling out with management. Stuck in a contract was horrible enough but they were so eager to take advantage of the fact that I needed the job and money, instead of negotiating properly. I also dropped out of private uni because I needed cash flow to pay for all of my father's bills and that Kaplan was insensitive to my predicament by not allowing partial refund of my paid fees. Instead asking me to pay the full amount again when I am ready to re-module. I didn't take that well, so I did not extend the deferment. *Let's not say I did not try to get my degree, ok?* My dad rather gamble than fund my studies and when I finally saved enough for further studies, I need to pay for his medical needs. I was screwed over hard, and ultimately no money means no paper degree no matter how talented I may be. I even tried to negotiate with the company to send me for training on company time, but its always no training budget for contract staffs. And then the usual, if you go training on company time, then what we hire you for? During my years in the company, never once was I send for training. When there is a new project, they just hire someone to implement it instead of giving me the opportunity. And when its implemented, I get a few power point slides and magically I'm qualified to support the new system. It really is vomit blood.

Although I was jobless for a year, the nice thing was that I was able to get everything settled personally like the good son I should be. Or at least, I thought it should be. But it turns out that putting him in a nursing home does not entirely resolve me of my problem. He has so many medical appointments that requires me to follow up, and if I don't attend, there are funny cases where medication is missing or not collected from the hospital. Or the appointment rescheduled to another time so I can attend. I don't really know whose fault this is since the excuse I keep hearing is that **""Sorry, I don't speak English so I cannot understand""**, so I need to be the one to take care of everything, because once again... I am the son. This keeps taking up my time and I cannot rid myself of them, so this becomes a problem when I want to find a new job. My education level is only up to Diploma and that limits my options. The roles I quality for are pretty much IT Helpdesk / Technicians which don't really have a work life balance option due to over-outsourcing. Pay wise, they are only around $2.6k and it is pretty much a dead end career, so there is no progression path. Having to pay for my father's needs and eventually his 2 sisters as they get older, with this salary really puts me at a lost. 

I have a D7 in O'lv math and that is what really screw me over big time but unless I am really that bad at math, I absolutely do not see how I can start a family (If I even have that option) and take care of everyone with a low salary. The reason I need to take care of his 2 sisters is that they took care of me when my father didn't and they took out their savings to pay off my father's gambling debts, which he didn't even brother returning to them when he withdrew his CPF. Even now, when I am not working, for some strange reasons the government's means testing suggest that I can afford to pay $1200++ a month for my father's nursing home and this is excluding all his other medicines and specialist appointments. He has over 20+ medications and among them are anti depressive pills which I don't even have the luxury of taking. As much as I can, I have tried to make ends mean but at some point in time... there is only so much one can do. Social workers I spoke to are like, well live for yourself, not for others. Find a girlfriend! But i look at my situation and I don't exactly see how I even have the luxury to live for myself. If anything, I don't know of any girl in Singapore that would even consider my position as potential boyfriend material. The truth is, I have been fighting by myself for the last 30 years without anyone to seek advise from. Friends? Let's just say, its different from television. Everyone has their own problem and their broken fingernail is more important. The best you can get out of anyone is pretty much, a listening ear on whatsapp and some **""You can do it! You should come to church and donate for Jesus's blessing.""** 

I don't blame anyone though and this really issn't a rant post. I appreciate everyone that has been in my life, whether good or bad *(everything is a learning experience)* but ultimately, there is only so much you can beat out of a dead horse. After considering all possible options, I truly believe that ending my life and letting the government take care of my family's needs might be the best logical choice. Alternatively, I can rob the bank and get myself caught intentionally so I can get some free re-skilling opportunities in jail. Maybe when I come out, I can become some story teller with a very dramatic bestseller book to fund my retirement. To be honest, I don't know what I am expecting from this post, but this is in a way my attempt at screaming for help. Whether I deserve help or how much help I truly deserve, I don't know. Counselors always tell stories where family of 4 struggle with a household income of $2k, and they live a very happy, satisfied life so I will be just fine if I try. But how true is this story really? The bright side is that maybe the hubby can have sex with his wife to destress, but I can't fuck anyone in my family to destress. Maybe the 2 kids will grow up and help to support the family, but my situation aren't even that. I honestly feel that, I have reached the end of the crossroad and this is the end of my bloodline. I don't do drugs, I don't drink, I don't smoke, I don't go pub/club, I haven never even gone on overseas vacation, never took a plane before, I save whatever I can. I don't even go to cinemas. I'm not even fat, I eat a very cheap diet that puts me a little underweight but where did this effort ultimately took me? A boring person with an unattractive lifestyle that no Singaporean girls will want to date, and a aging family to take care of. Honestly, where is my future? I don't see any. To be honest, I may not have the budget to spurge on dates even if a girl want me. Singapore is just very plain straight forward. **""Bo money ah? Die lor. I only got one life, you want? Come take it la.""**

Its a pretty long post, much longer than I expected and I thank you if you have read everything. In a way, I felt better after getting this out. If you are responding though, I have a question. If you were in my position, what would you have done? Would suicide really not be the most educated option?

Lurking on the r/Singapore and r/Hongkong subreddits. 


Once HKers invariably find out that I'm from Singapore or Singaporeans find out I live and work in HK, the inevitable question is: do you like Singapore more or HK more? 


I just want to qualify that I love both places. Singapore is home. But each place has its pros and cons. 

This isn't an exhaustive list, but it's something I have at hand when I talk to people.

1. Property prices and sizes. Singaporeans always complain about property prices, but HKers will just laugh. HDB has done an amazing job of ensuring that most Singaporeans will be able to have a flat more than double the size of a Hong Konger at a third of the price. 

2. Food. Forget about Michelin stars and gourmet food in HK. Yeah, great food, Hong kongers get to eat goose and amazing dai pai dong food and better seafood, but Singaporean food culture wins hands down. Better street food culture in the hawker centers, more variety with Malay and peranakan food, more spice, more flavour, more intensity and vibrancy. That said, HK isn't too far behind.

3. Sovereignty. Singaporeans have a sense of nationalistic pride and assurance that our country is our country. Hong kongers will always have a cloud hanging over them: I expect this to get worse in thirty years. Big brother over the border is watching.

4. Vibrancy and character. Hong Kong wins hands down. Less government regulation, more freedom to do whatever you want, people are less afraid to be creative. There's more energy on the streets, a sense of urgency and a pulse that races faster than Singapore. The neon lights of Hong Kong, the old, delapidated buildings add to the noir charm. The cleanliness and blandness of Singapore is boring in comparison.

5. Crime. Singapore has far less crime. Drugs, sex and violence here are much more common, more shootings, gang warfare, triads, etc. Adds to the character of the city but also not the safest place.

6. Schooling. Not Joseph schooling, but in terms of education Singapore provides a lot more for a lot less. People always complain about the stress levels in Singapore but in HK you start interviewing for good schools when you're 2 yrs old. It's absolute madness. International schools and private schools cost a bomb.

7.  Scenery. HK is way more scenic than Singapore. So much more nature, national parks, hiking trails, waterfalls, mountains, real beaches, coast lines. People die from getting lost in the mountains. 

8. Climate. People in HK complain about the hot and humid summers: but it's like that in Singapore all year round. At least you get winter, autumn and spring in HK. With that comes typhoons and killer storms.

9. Health care. So what that Singapore is a hub for medical tourism. The health care is nearly completely free in HK, for HK residents. You can get major heart surgery here and stay in the intensive care unit for months and only have to pay a token sum. Major medical issues aren't going to bankrupt you.

10. Location. Weekend trips to Japan or taiwan, or even Shanghai. A lot more convenient from HK than it is from Singapore.

11. Public transport. MTR beats MRT. Faster, more reliable, larger volume, cheaper. Cars are also much cheaper in Hong Kong.

In summary, both places rock and I'm blessed to have lived in both places. Don't make me pick a place.

Unreasonable control over child in specific. Child is already a young adult, but brought up being told to do everything. Old generation upbringing method which involved one sided verbal scoldings. This is gist of the issues.

I intend to speak to my stubborn parent again. But this time, instead of casual remarks, to be more serious with a framework in mind. To ask what are the expectations and what is the meaning of showing care and love, according to the parent. Thought maybe this is not carried out properly and not shown correctly. What worked on the elder siblings (myself included) not necessarily means the correct way to bring up children. 

Anyone with comments about this? I had approached younger sibling via text and got a small bit of understanding. I sympathize with her plight (overly controlled by parent unnecessarily since young. And now able to break free by staying away from home for as long as possible daily) although I do not agree with her actions. Still, she is matured enough to stay away from alcohol drugs and partying. Mostly just in healthy company of friends and work/study (I hope. And I trust her words).

We should strive to resolve conflicts if any, through constructive conversations. When my younger sibling did this, she got scolded instead. One of my deeper regrets is not stepping in and interfere at that stage upon learning of the incidents. Was told that by keeping quiet I showed my respect to my parent. But at the same time, I showed to my younger sibling that she is alone at her struggles and no one could understand her even when the situation was unreasonable. I keep thinking back and this is one of the moments I think I am damn useless as a brother/member of the family. 

Current situation: constantly nagged at by stubborn parent despite what I say. Despite parent watching so much of China shows on mediating family issues :/. I managed to get elder sibling to reduce or stop interfering that much (having two individuals exerting excessive control over a child is crazy) while tried my best to be approachable and understanding to younger sibling.

Issues being nagged at or scolded at: coming home late (12 to 1am+ almost daily). Used to be everything at home from using phones. Watch shows, going out with friends at day time. Can't say my younger sibling is the best child, but I see that with such a parent it is difficult to love the place called home. Is there anything I could do or try one at a time? I wish to involve just myself for now. My elder sibling is as stubborn, and could be unreasonable at times. 

Sorry that this post is rather incoherently typed, can't write logically with my mind being in a slight mess. I also do not wish to bring up very specific incidents as to remain slightly more anonymous, if possible.

Appreciate comments on what I could do at home to help out. I don't think I should just let the issue remain as it is. Else I will have a parent who wants to be loved but hated by the child.

It\'s a dream come true.""\n\n\n&gt;That dream would not have been possible without the help of a good Samaritan she met and befriended at a bus stop in 2013 while serving out the last bit of an 18-month sentence for drug offences at a halfway house. The Secondary 2 school-leaver got to know technician John Shu, 52, and shared with him her wish to further her studies so as to give her children a brighter future.\n\n\n&gt;A few months into their friendship, Mr Shu - who earned slightly over $2,000 a month then as a mechanic - gave her about $6,000 without hesitation, to pay for her diploma in marketing management from Kaplan. The Straits Times ran a story about his astounding generosity in 2016.\n\n\n&gt;She said: ""I\'m very thankful to John, who first gave me hope and helped me see the light.""\n\n\n&gt;She is also grateful for having received the Yellow Ribbon Fund Star (Skills Training Assistance to Re-start) Bursary - valued at over $20,000 to pursue the degree.\n\n\n&gt;The bursary helps needy former offenders with vocational and skills training, which they need in order to find jobs. Since it was launched in 2010, there have been 143 recipients and 76 have graduated with either a diploma or degree.\n\n\n&gt;Ms Tay\'s troubles began in her teenage years, when she was introduced to drugs and was sent to the Drug Rehabilitation Centre (DRC) for a year when she was just 18. At 20, she gave birth to her first child and quit the habit.\n\n\n&gt;But when her marriage collapsed, she went back to drugs as an escape from her woes. Her second former husband was also a drug abuser and the couple were arrested together in 2012.\n\n\n&gt;She has four children - two from each of her marriages - between three and 14 years old. She lives with the two from her second marriage, while the children from her first marriage are with their father. Related Story\n\n\n&gt;Help from a stranger turns her life around\n\n\n&gt;During her second stint at the DRC, she resolved to turn her life around. She saw how other addicts lost everything they had - from material possessions to loved ones - because of their addiction. She did not want that to happen to her.\n\n\n&gt;A fellow inmate at the DRC encouraged her to further her studies. ""Without an education and a proper job, I felt quite hopeless. Many posts require at least a diploma or degree now,"" she said.\n\n\n&gt;Her previous jobs had been waiting on tables or as a retail assistant and they never paid her more than $2,000 a month. She had no money to pursue a diploma - until that chance meeting with Mr Shu.\n\n\n&gt;After obtaining her diploma, she devoted her energy to getting a part-time degree, while juggling work and motherhood.\n\n\n&gt;Finding a place to live was also a problem - she and her children lived with a friend until she obtained a one-room rental flat from the Housing Board earlier this year.\n\n\n&gt;For close to two years now, Ms Tay has been working full-time at a ship management firm where she is a trainee technical officer now.\n\n\n&gt;She would study during her lunch hour and after work, often into the wee hours. Her efforts have paid off.\n\n\n&gt;After her exams in May, she also started working part-time as an accounts executive three nights a week at motor spray painting firm Chye Hin Motor, so she could earn extra income to buy a flat.\n\n\n&gt;Mr Shu, who only has primary school education, said in Mandarin: ""I feel happy and proud for Jaycie that she has a degree. I treat her like my younger sister and I feel my sponsorship of her diploma was worth it.""\n\n\n&gt;For his big heart, he was nominated as a finalist for The Straits Times Singaporean of the Year in 2016.\n\n\n&gt;And one good turn led to another: Kaplan Singapore was so touched by Mr Shu\'s generosity they decided to sponsor his daughter\'s tertiary education in 2016.\n\n\n&gt;They gave Miss Shermin Shu, 23, close to $20,000, about half of which went towards reimbursing her polytechnic education and the rest to pay for her degree in fashion media and industry at Lasalle College of the Arts, easing her parents\' financial burden.\n\n\n&gt;Mr Shu\'s wife runs a coffee stall and they also have a son, 21, who is now serving national service.\n\n\n&gt;Miss Shu, a second-year Lasalle student, said she was grateful for the sponsorship. ""It has made my parents proud,"" she added.\n\n\n&gt;As for Ms Tay, she cherishes her new lease of life and dreams of a brighter future for her family.\n\n\n&gt;She said: ""Don\'t give up, there\'s always hope in life.""']"

Since then, he has stayed clean, with the help of a support group, following his release from the DRC.\n\nLike Alan, a steadily growing number of well-educated and high-flying professionals caught for drug consumption have been sent to the DRC for treatment and rehabilitation in the past 10 years.\n\nLast year, 120 of the DRC inmates had tertiary or higher education - a rise from just 10 in 2008, the Singapore Prison Service told The Straits Times.\n\nThese well-educated inmates formed 9 per cent of all DRC inmates last year, up from under 2 per cent in 2008.\n\nSaid lawyer Rajan Supramaniam: ""In the past, drug addicts typically came from broken homes and dysfunctional families and were not so educated. But now, more are well-educated, have good jobs and come from middle or even upper middle class backgrounds.""\n\nThe trend worries Law and Home Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam, who called for the anti-drug fight to be made a national priority last year.\n\nMr Shanmugam disclosed that more students and professionals were being caught for drug offences. For example, 70 professionals and managers were nabbed in 2016 for drug abuse, an increase from 49 in 2014 and 50 in 2015.\n\nThose whose work involves dealing with drug offenders say the well-educated DRC inmates include such professionals as lawyers, finance executives and civil servants. Some of the former offenders told The Straits Times that they picked up the habit while studying or working overseas and continued with it after returning home to Singapore.\n\nIn recent months, a few highly educated and well-heeled members of society have made headlines because of drug offences. The scion of the family behind the Metro department store chain, 42-year-old Ong Jenn, was given a two-year jail sentence for possessing cannabis in July last year.\n\nThe grandson of Metro founder Ong Tjoe Kim, he became addicted while attending university in the United States. Last month, prosecutors appealed against his reduced drug charges, arguing that he should be convicted of the more serious charge of trafficking as he had enough cannabis to last him for 17 months.\n\nIn March, Stuart Koe, the managing director of pharmaceutical firm ICM Pharma, was jailed for five years and nine months and given five strokes of the cane for selling Ice to an abuser. Koe has a PhD in pharmacy and is the founder of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender website Fridae.com\n\nA key reason for the growing number of such drug users is the growing popularity of cannabis, which has been legalised for medical or even recreational use in some states in the US, said those interviewed. This has sparked curiosity and interest in the drug in Singapore.\n\nMr Robin Tay, head of programmes and counselling services at The New Charis Mission, said: ""These people buy the argument that cannabis is safe since it\'s legalised in some places and they use it to relieve stress. They feel they can control the drug, instead of being controlled by it.""\n\nWhen asked about the well-educated inmates at the DRC, a Central Narcotics Bureau spokesman attributed this to the increasingly liberal attitudes among youth towards drug use. This is influenced by such factors as drug use being legitimised and decriminalised in other countries. To counter such attitudes, the bureau will continue to educate people about the harm that drugs can cause and the serious penalties drug offenders face in Singapore.\n\nThose convicted of consuming a controlled drug could face a jail term of up to 10 years or be fined up to $20,000, or both.\n\nBesides cannabis, Ice is another drug popular among the well-schooled crowd who use it to achieve a sense of euphoria. Some take it to stay focused for long hours at work or even for studying, drug counsellors told The Straits Times.\n\nTake the case of Mr Matthew Poh, 47, who, in his 20s, got high on Ecstasy pills every weekend when he and his then wife went clubbing.\n\nHe said: ""I took it to escape the stresses of running a business.""\n\nMr Poh, who has a diploma in business management, used to run an interior design firm with 60 staff and earned a six-digit annual income before he turned 30. Spending a few thousand dollars a month on drugs hardly burnt a hole in his pocket.\n\nBut in 2013, his life went downhill after his mother died and his wife left him for another man. He stopped working, became a bankrupt and spent his entire day taking drugs such as Ice and cannabis.\n\nAfter almost two years of drug-filled days, he wanted a new, clean life. He surrendered to the authorities and spent eight months in the DRC.\n\nMr Poh, who now runs a cafe that hires former drug offenders, said: ""The routine inside the DRC kept me busy and I wanted to change. Without my time at the DRC, I would probably still be on drugs.""']"

Everyone else had moved on except for me,"" said Mr Sivabalan.\n\nProposed changes to the law might mean that repeat drug abusers who  do not commit other crimes, like Mr Sivabalan, will not have to serve  time in prison and have a criminal record.\n\nUnder changes to the Misuse of Drugs Act tabled in Parliament last  Monday, repeat drug abusers who do not face other concurrent criminal  charges will be redirected to the prison-run Drug Rehabilitation Centre  (DRC) instead of long-term imprisonment (LT).\n\nCurrently, abusers arrested for the third time or more for drug consumption are given LT sentences.\n\n&gt;STRONG COMMUNITY SUPPORT  \n **The important thing is not DRC or LT, it\'s what comes after  that, the care that they get from a strong community support system,  especially more supportive employers willing to take a chance on them.**  \n DR THOMAS LEE, an addictions specialist at The Resilienz Clinic. DRC  is the prison-run Drug Rehabilitation Centre; LT refers to long-term  imprisonment.  \n \n\nLT1 and LT2 sentences - given to abusers caught for the third and  fourth or more times respectively - carry heavier penalties, with jail  terms starting at five years and a minimum of three strokes of the cane  (for LT1).\n\nDrug abusers who go to the DRC would not have a criminal record upon release, which could aid their reintegration into society.\n\nUnder the changes, the maximum DRC detention period will increase  from three to four years, with the maximum duration of supervision after  completion of the community-based programme also increasing from two to  five years.\n\nThe tilt towards a DRC-focused regime is among a raft of changes to  the Act. If passed, the changes are scheduled to be implemented from the  middle of next year.\n\nBut the changes have resurfaced an old debate on what is the best way to treat drug abusers.\n\nSome counsellors, academics and halfway house managers who spoke to  The Straits Times welcomed the move towards a more rehabilitative  approach for abusers.\n\nOthers, however, have raised concerns that the authorities are  signalling a softening of the no-nonsense stance towards drug abuse.\n\n#### SIGNIFICANT AND OVERDUE\n\nWhen the LT regime was introduced in 1998, then Minister for Home  Affairs Wong Kan Seng told Parliament that ""hardcore addicts"" - defined  as those who have been admitted to DRC or prison for drug offences more  than twice - ""(were) not to be treated as victims"".\n\nThe ""only way to treat these addicts is to imprison them for a long time"", he had said.\n\nAssociate Professor Ferlin Jayatissa from Singapore University of  Social Sciences\' (SUSS) School of Law sees the changes as marking a  significant shift in how those who only abuse drugs are dealt with.\n\n""The authorities are finally becoming sensitive to the different  profiles of people involved in drugs. Now, they are viewing drug abuse  as less of a criminal offence, but more as a social ill to be managed,""  said Prof Jayatissa, a former criminal lawyer.\n\nSimilarly, Pastor Don Wong, founder of The New Charis Mission halfway  house, said the change is long overdue. In his experience, there are  many who cannot kick the drug habit even after the LT sentences. ""These  people are not criminals, they need treatment for recovery,"" he said.\n\nHalfway houses and counsellors see the change as a more tailored and  flexible approach, with shorter DRC detentions allowing abusers to  better reintegrate into society.\n\nOne key benefit is how drug abusers are not kept away from their  families for too long, resulting in less disruption to family  relationships, said executive director of the Singapore Anti-Narcotics  Association (Sana), Mr Abdul Karim.\n\nThis is crucial as family members could be part of a social support  network that helps keep abusers on the straight and narrow, he said.\n\nLT inmates are likely to be middle-aged or older, and they are often  discouraged at the thought of being in prison for such a long time, said  Pastor Wong, a former drug abuser who was jailed nine times, mostly for  drug-related offences.\n\nAnother benefit is that ""pure"" abusers are less likely to pick up bad  habits from other criminals, said case manager Coreen Chong at halfway  house The Turning Point.\n\n#### SOFTER STANCE TOWARDS ABUSERS?\n\nOthers worry that the move signals a softening of the Government\'s  no-nonsense stance towards drug abuse, especially among young people.\n\nCounsellor Janet Wee sees a need to educate the young about the  latest changes, especially when it seems that there is a less deterrent  effect now.\n\n""The Government has to communicate that it\'s a more rehabilitative  approach - that we want to help you. But on top of this, a strong  message has to be sent that if you continue doing drugs, we will still  come after you,"" said Ms Wee, managing director at Acorn Quest, which  runs counselling services for former offenders.\n\nBut it is not clear how effective the DRC programme has been in  curbing drug abuse. While the recidivism rate among abusers has dipped  from 62.7 per cent in 1996 to 28.6 per cent in 2015, it is not clear if  the improvement stemmed mostly from the DRC or LT regime.\n\nWhile the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) declined to give the number  of those in the LT scheme, there were 1,360 DRC inmates last year.\n\nAbout 30 per cent of local DRC inmates were detained, convicted or  jailed again for a new offence within two years of their release,  according to the latest SPS figure on the cohort released in 2015.\n\nProf Jayatissa said he does not view the changes as a softening of  stance. He noted other proposed changes include making it an offence for  an adult who permits a young person below 21 to consume controlled  drugs in his possession.\n\nLawyer Ray Louis said removing the mandatory LT sentence might not  mean less of a deterrent for repeat offenders. ""If you are an abuser who  has already been in and out of prison, would the sentence really be at  the back of your mind and help you rehabilitate?""\n\nDr Razwana Begum, a former probation officer and a senior lecturer in  criminology at SUSS, said it would be tougher for offenders going  through the DRC track.\n\n""For offenders in jail, they just have to follow the rules, but  outside, they have to find a job, go for urine tests, learn how to say  \'no\' to friends who ask them to do drugs again - it\'s challenging and  requires discipline,"" she said.\n\n""So the non-custodial option, not going through long-term  imprisonment or detention, it\'s not any less punitive or easier for  them.""']"

125,singapore,139662,[TIL] The differences between a military court and a civilian/criminal court,9svfkr,nattybattywatty,1540958710,26,1,"So I guess everyone must have heard the news just now about the officer being charged in the criminal court for the death of the late CFC Dave Lee (if you have not, original thread is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/9su3tl/death_of_nsf_dave_lee_officer_to_be_charged_6/)). 

TLDR; Captain being charged under criminal law for failing to evacuate him in a timely manner, charged with rash act, 6 other servicemen refereed to MINDEF for investigations. 

&amp;#x200B;

From reading the comments, it seems like we're not too sure on the differences between a criminal court and military court...in any case, out of curiosity I went ahead to do some research on military law and came across this NUS-run organisation called the [Military Justice Project](https://www.mjp.sg), which provides really good FAQs for NSFs/NSmen/Parents who need to know more about military law!

&amp;#x200B;

Did some more research and here's what I managed to gather:

* There's a difference between military law and criminal law, although there are many areas which overlap. For instance, flouting training safety regulations or AWOL from camp is chargeable under military law, but not so much on criminal law. However, common offences like drugs, etc. are covered under both sets of laws. 
* As such, usually for cases like these, if its a criminal offence, it'll be undertaken by the public prosecutor and AGC/police, and out of MINDEF hands (like that captain). If they determine that no criminal law was breached, they'll refer it to MINDEF, which then dissects them under military law (like the 6 servicemen)
* Taking reference from a previous case, the officer who was found guilty for the rover overturn death case was charged in criminal court and jailed. 
* Interestingly, General Court Martials (GCM) under military courts are open to the public, although you'd have to give a good reason why you want to attend (usual camp security i guess)
* Depending on the offence, a military offence under GCM may or may not show up on your record. For example, an offence committed under criminal law (e.g. theft, rape, drugs) will be reflected on your civil criminal record, because it is a criminal offence. However, if you are charged under offences under the SAF Act, it's likely it WON'T show up
* Those who siam NS (aka NS default) are charged in the civilian courts because the Enlistment Act is under Civil Law. Military Law has no effect on pre-enlistees (because they have not gone under the SAF Act yet).
* For NSmen, you are only liable for military offences in your capacity as an NSman (e.g. during ICT or IPPT). However, a civil offence committed as an NSman (e.g. during ICT you go stab someone) can be punished under military law too.

I was treated differently because I was different. I played with dolls, hated any toys designed for boys. I was a really effeminate kid back then. I grew up going to sleep when my parents weren't home due to work, and waking up for school only after they left for work in the wee hours. I only get to see them on weekends if I was lucky. Career obsessed. I had little supervision, I did what I want, ate what I want. At 14 I was obese, 175cm and 110kg. I was teased and bullied in secondary school for my weight, mannerisms, and for my gayish-like behavior. I got to know about a gay chatroom and decided to have a look, only to be rejected by guys one after the other. With all the pain I took it in and vent it out on swimming, I lost a lot of weight. At 15, I looked better aesthetically, I was toned, I lied to myself by acting manly until that personality became part of me. I met a guy for the first time at 15, in his car, and was raped. I bottled it up and didn't talk to anyone until towards the end of december, I overdosed on 400 pills from various drugs. I locked the door. Stupid decision. After 30 minutes, I shouted ""MA"" when I started to get scared because my whole body started feeling numb. Only seconds after I tried to open the door but my hands couldn't even move. I have on and off flash backs of being given cpr in the ambulance by paramedics, and the next thing I knew I woke up in the hospital after being in a coma for 2 weeks. Apparently I died, and paramedics brought me back. I was still broken, spiritually and physically. 

After that, I lived my life with tons and tons of counselling. From 16 to 20, I was diagnosed to have body dysmorphia disorder and depression. I was given medications and had to go to a lot of therapy. Over the years, I got better, but I had irreversible self esteem and confidence issues since. At 22, I was saved by a guy who loved me with all his heart, even though I had so much baggage. We are still working things out despite it all. But because of what happened, I was inspired by the paramedics, not a day goes by where I don't think about how I could have been dead. And this made me become a paramedic myself. I may never be happy with myself, no matter how much therapy I get. Being bullied and teased does scar you for life. Even if so, this community does mean a lot to me because for not having experienced a real family, you guys have made me feel like I'm worth something.

Another thing was that the whole drug law thing happened in the 70s due to the massive amount of drugs and gang violence the country had from the 50s to the 70s. 

Also apparently there was a group called Ah Kong which was an organised crime gang that originated in Singapore but ran the heroin trade in Europe from the 1970s to the 1990s, they produced the drugs in the golden triangle (search that up) and were one of the biggest drug syndicates in the world at the time.

I'm not  a Singaporean but have visited several times in the past. You generally have a great country and city. The only thing that makes me scratch my head, is the strict prohibition of cannabis when it is being legalized throughout the western world. 

The obvious contradiction, is the ample supply of alcohol. I would like to know what you all think about this topic?    
Would weed make the society fall to bits?

Singapore seems to be a historical oddity and perhaps its success is due in part to the discipline of its people, I can foresee weed sparking a generation of kids who don't want to do National Service and don't want to work long hours every week.

I can also see weed sparking long repressed creativity and allowing Singapore to flourish as an intellectual hub, and Asian silicon valley.  The current prohibition of weed and psychedelics, in my humble opinion makes Singapore unlivable for many westerners. 

The vast bulk technology and creative workers here in Australia indulge in weed and hallucinogenics regularly. These drugs are much safer and have much more productive effects than alcohol... why does Singapore insist on their criminalization despite the inherent hypocrisy, and counter examples to their logic throughout the world?

My colleague said Singapore has a ""white list"" (of approved music) that radios can choose from. It feels like this list is literally 100 songs from the 80s - 90s.

Only a few times a day, they would play new songs (Top 40). I even made a song request once, some David Bowie song the week he passed. They sent me back something like ""sorry we don't have this song."" I'm like bruh...

Oh yea, and when they receive requests, it has to be faked because their ""requests"" would be the same songs they play everyday anyway.

I understand the censorship of songs, or the lack of hip hop (because of the use of drugs, swearing), but please, someone explain to me what's up with the radio stations.

I roll my eyes every time the djs are like ""songs coming up next are..."" I'm like bruh, I know what songs are coming up.

The station we usually have on is FM 98 but it's the same for all stations (including the Chinese ones, which they are repeating the same festive songs over and over, sometimes up to 3 times a day).

Thanks everyone who answered my previous question about where to live in Singapore. Lots of useful information. Now I am trying to start planning budgeting and so forth. So my question is: if we exclude rental costs, how well can a couple live in Singapore on a $2,000/month budget? A few points of note:             
-We don't plan on having a car.                   
-We don't drink, smoke, do drugs or gamble.                
-We don't buy expensive clothes (Uniclo is as high as we go)                      
-We like to have a diet full of fresh fruits and vegetables.                                                       
                          With that in mind, would $2,000 be enough to cover groceries and essential living expenses (except rent) and the occasional eating out at a mid-level restaurant and visit to the movie theater?

Many from the Marijuana community are cheering this on coz it will be the first country in South East Asia to actually discuss Marijuana as a medicine and not just ""drugs are bad... mmmmkay"". If the bill were to be realized, it will make Philippine the first country (other than Israel) to legalize Medical Marijuana while surrounded by countries that have the death penalty for it.

The Philippine is in relative close proximity to Singapore and a significant portion of Singapore's current population is from the Philippine.

I got some hypothesis of what might happen.

* Initially, the government is going to pretend nothing is happening
* Once medical marijuana programs is established, ""marijuana refugees"" from neighbouring countries, including Singapore, will flock to the Philippines, just like what happened in Colorado
* Increase in cases of people bringing in medical grade tincture, leading to a spike in arrest
* Mandatory Death Penalty comes into question once someone brought in 200g worth of Marijuana tincture
* Probably increase in teen drug use as the ""wisdom"" of anti-drug propaganda became unstable.
* Future government will struggle to classify Cannabis as it is not exactly pharmaceutical grade medicine and rather falls along herbal remedy. Will instead settle for selected current pharmaceutical companies like GW Pharmaceuticals to fill in the gap.

[Imagine Dragons Evolve World Tour](http://www.sportshub.com.sg/sportshubtix/Pages/Imagine-Dragons-2018.aspx) @ Singapore National Stadium

7 January 2018 l Ticket prices starts from S$98


Since making their full-length debut with 2012’s multi-platinum Night Visions, Imagine Dragons have drawn worldwide adoration for their anthemic yet moody alt-rock. On their third album Evolve, the Grammy Award-winning band shift perspective and take on a brighter but more layered emotional outlook.

Throughout Evolve, Imagine Dragons find unlikely glory in intense self-reflection. On “Whatever It Takes,” the band turns self-doubt into a soaring, shimmering epic driven by heavy beats and Reynolds’s rapid-fire flow. Another moment of reckoning, “Thunder” brings waves of majestic harmonies and warped vocal effects to Reynolds’s recounting of his life’s journey so far.

Formed in 2009, Imagine Dragons first revealed their emotionally charged and inventive sensibilities with a series of independently released EPs that earned them a grassroots following. Signed to KIDinaKORNER/Interscope by hit making producer Alex Da Kid, the band greatly expanded their fan base with the release of their multi-platinum breakthrough single “It’s Time” (featured on the 2012 EP Continued Silence). With their past hits also including “Radioactive” (a diamond-selling smash that won Best Rock Performance at the 2014 Grammy Awards), Imagine Dragons went on to see Smoke + Mirrors debut at #1 on the Billboard Top 200 album chart upon its release in early 2015.

1,NationalServiceSG,3987,Update of my excuse live fire,i5huw3,confirmedbear,1596820689,4,1,"Hi you guys might Remb a few weeks back or maybe 1 month ago where I had an enquiry about my excuse live fire. So 2 days ago on the 6th of august I got my life fire excused removed by the medical board of MMI. I just wana say that the whole entire process will take shortest 1 month to get rid of your live fire excused mine took like 5 months plus cos of circuit breaker and I also had to undergo a surgery so it was delayed by 1 month.   (depending on how fast you get your memo and when you book your medical review)  So the process is you will need a memo from a doctor stating that you fit for live firing. The type of doctor will depend on your type of medical excuses. For example mine was because of adhd so I had to go to a psychaitrist to get the memo. I would suggest a psychiatrist working for the government hospital and not private one because number 1 it’s free of charge for NSFs to get the memo and number 2 it’s up to the army psychiatrist to decide wether you are fit for live firing. Your private psychiatrist can write all the good and atas words for you but it’s the saf army psychiatrist that will have the final say regarding your excuse live fire or whatever excuse you are trying to get rid of. Plus army Doctors are more inclined to believe government hired Doctors rather than private Doctors because army also know that private doctors will write whatever you want as Long as you pay them the money. So after you get ur memo from the psychiatrist or whichever doctor pertaining to your medical condition you need to book a medical review with your camp MO preferably through ns portal and ask him if he can remove the excuse for you or not. If no it’s straight to the medical board. Than you have to wait for 1 month for your date with the medical board. Longest to wait it’s 6 months because the medical board believe it or not is also quite busy. I was naive to think that I’m the only one with problems in the army. Turns out when I went to the medical board that day got people from the scdf also come to medical board for their problems too.  So on that day when I went to the medical board to convinced the MO to remove my excuse live fire it was quite relaxed and informal. Meaning to say they were quite chill and I dare say in under 10 mins they agreed removed my excused live fire because my problem was not serious (never commit and crime do drugs or beat anyone up). I want to say more but I scared that I’m unknowingly breaking some laws or something. Also I would like to clarify my intentions when I say under 10 mins the Medical Board removed my excuse live fire not because they didn’t do their job properly but because I actually convinced them that I was unfairly diagnosed and wrongfully given the excuse live fire not because they are lazy and quickly want to to their job. 

Yes you might think like many of my combat fit friend will say “it’s only live fire nia shoot also got no glory” please do not think like that not many people in the world will have the privilege of shooting the SAR 21 only male NSFs Singaporeans and female sign on have the opportunity and maybe some other counties that buy it from Singapore. Other than that not many people in the world have the privilege to shoot the SAR 21. 


If any of you ladies and gentlemen have any questions regarding removing any medical excuses especially live fire which it’s a serious thing you can message me I will be more than happy to help you.  Also if you have more questions regarding my journey to have my live fire excused removed  feel free to message me. I don’t want to say so much over here as I scared I might say something I’m not suppose to say. 


Thank you for reading this lengthy post. I hope you have a nice day ahead and enjoy your National Day!  🇸🇬

My experience with the module was alright? The content was definitely overloading since there were 4 hours lecture each week. (I skipped most of them and after midterm it was pre-recorded due to covid) You may like it if you want to know more about drugs like nicotine, caffeine and their effects. As someone who does not have any biology background, I think most of the content could be understood (because there are just biology terms for you to read and go).\n\nFor midterm, it was a MCQ test with a one paper cheatsheet (2-sided). Basically put everything in the cheat sheet (my cheatsheet font size was 6 haha) and read through all the content(so that you know where to find that drug in your cheatsheet) you should be able to do alright. I remember the average was 39/50 and I scored 41/50.\n\nI remember CA2/CA3 (not sure because both have the same submission date) as one being a poster and one being a commentary. The poster one was basically answering one of the two given questions in your poster. (I did something on alcohol) Does not have to be particularly aesthetic because I made mine really nicely using Photoshop but still scored B+/B for that haha. (The content is the main point yea) The commentary one was just find some photo/make ur own poster/arts and write a paragraph on that based on the given question. Spent around one day each for the CA.\n\nThere was supposed to be a CA4 final in the first place but it got cancelled due to covid and changed to take-home assignment instead. The midterm was adjusted to have greater weightage (like 40% if im not wrong? 20% each for the remaining CAs). So basically another poster to be done based on the question. I totally did not listen to the lectures after midterm due to other busy modules but still managed to do the poster out within 1 day.\n\nWorkload: 3/5 (Before midterm, after midterm 1/5)\n\nDifficulty: 3/5 (Did not really get what the profs are looking for in the remaining CAs but I guessed I didnt make the effort to)\n\nConsider the amount of time spent on this module, I think this module was rather chill for me but may not be the same for you since the syllabus made some adjustments during the semester itself.\n\nHope this helps :D""]"
