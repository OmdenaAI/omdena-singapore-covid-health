They have to take time to plan the correct steps to understand the patient's situation comfortably for the patient to open up appropriately of their own accord.

summerfellxx,ng6k8b,Anyone know where to get tested as an Adult for auditory processing disorder?,2021-05-19 21:57:20,askSingapore,44675,6,8,"I know mostly these tests are for children. But i really need to know what’s wrong with me. Surprisingly I am in college now and only now at the age of 24F, I realised I have EXTREME difficulty retaining or remembering things through HEARING especially if learning a subject I lack experience in e.g dance.  I literally cannot remember steps just by talking. This is a huge problem for dance cos I can’t write stuff.

Also eg. If someone is conversing with me - and another loud interruption happens or someone else talks loudly, I can’t even understand what the person i was talking to was saying even though i can hear him.

When I was recently reprimanded in college of course through talking, i went home, remembered only bits of the negative parts and completely couldn’t process the other information. I only recently started writing literally what they said down AS they talked because my linguistic skills were a lot stronger and by doing so- I remembered immediately. Anything written is easy for me to remember. So i started asking if i could write while they spoke.

Especially in classes where there are many new, complex information I’m not used to, eg music theory, there was one the teacher said SOOOOO many things, and it was all talking, and I literally blanked out because i couldn’t process what she said. it sounded like German or some weird language. And i felt really demoralised and lost. 

In another class,a teacher was talking a lot about something. I asked her a question and she said didn’t I already say that? I was speechless - i absolutely couldn’t remember she did!!!

However, in literature class, because its my strong suit, I could easily process every thing he was saying. 

I think it’s combination of very foreign subject and too much talking.

not to mention, constantly loud environments and overly loud people (like for 2 straight hours) really stress the SHIT out of me. I have to hide in a library. of course, sadly, it affects me having friends. I’m very sensitive to sound. Anyone goes through this???

THIS IS REALLY SUCH A PAIN IN THE ASS T__T please help, anyone? If you know anywhere that can help me or get tested etc. I dont want to seem like a slow learner.

Just go back and read and process, and you will learn much better after a few lessons. \n\nI don’t like overly loud environments or people either. I think this is common.

kanicroquette,l0ac4u,Where to get assessed for eating disorders?,2021-01-19 10:44:30,askSingapore,44675,9,42,"I might have an eating disorder, I don’t know I don’t want to self diagnose. 

My friends pulled me aside to ask me what’s up with my eating habits etc and told me that they’re worried I might have a disorder so I guess that planted the seeds of doubt in my head? 

I sometimes get nauseous thinking/looking of food. But then sometimes I can’t stop myself from eating a lot? Like more than the average person. Even when I’m not hungry. I sometimes eat until I feel like I’ll burst from how much I eat. 

I do fast after that though. I feel very nauseous after eating and will sometimes vomit, but I’m not doing it on purpose? It’s just how my body reacts. I did notice hair loss though. 

On good days I usually eat a meal a day? or a meal with snacks. Bad days I just eat an ungodly amount. 

I’m overweight and I’m very concerned about gaining weight like most people? I count my calories too (and I plan which has lesser calories etc) but most people do that. So to me these are normal things but hearing my friends concern makes me rethink everything. 

I just want to get assessed to maybe put my mind at ease? I’m not sure where to get assessed. 

I’m seeing a psychologist though for other mental health conditions so maybe I can bring it up with her? Or is it not within her job scope/not qualified to assess these sort of things?  

I was thinking of CHAT but I think they’re more towards mood disorders?

What I feel could be done better is that they could’ve asked for some prominent “activist” to give a sharing so that we could’ve understood their lives better and the difficulties they faced in school when it came to coming out/being discriminated, but no, didn’t happen.

Resources and therapy to help patients and prevent this cycle of abuse is pitiful.', '> # Woman jailed for injecting insulin into her son for \'peaceful\' death in plan to kill entire family over her childhood rape\n\n> SINGAPORE: A woman who was raped and molested by her older brother when she was a young girl developed traumatic symptoms that were triggered when she saw her brother lead a ""normal life"" by getting married and having a child.\n\n> The woman, now 29, decided to set her entire family on fire and kill herself, but wanted to spare her favourite son, who was then six to seven years old, by giving him a ""peaceful"" death with less pain.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> She injected him with insulin on 13 occasions over seven months, giving the boy headaches, dangerously low blood sugar levels and a seizure.\n\n> The woman, who cannot be named to protect the identity of her son, was given five years\' jail on Wednesday (May 5) for one charge of poisoning her son.\n\n> After medical staff detected something amiss with the boy\'s repeated hospitalisation, the woman\'s offences were uncovered. She was diagnosed with major depressive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Munchausen syndrome, a disorder where a person makes up a disease.\n\n> The court heard that the woman stayed with her parents and her three brothers when she was born. When she was nine to 12, one of her brothers molested and raped her.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> He was sentenced to a boys\' home, but the woman ""hated him"" because of what he had done to her. Her relationship with her mother deteriorated as she felt her mother had taken her brother\'s side.\n\n> The woman also asserted that her father had also raped and molested her, but this was not proven in investigations.\n\n> She ran away and got married. She lived with her husband and had two daughters and a son with him. Sometime in 2017, after her father died, the mother of the accused moved to live with her.\n\n> In September 2018, the brother who had raped her got married. A few months later, his wife became pregnant and the accused found out about this. The court heard that this made the accused angry with her brother for being able to move on with his life. She felt he did not deserve such happiness after what he had done to her.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> HER PLAN TO KILL HER FAMILY\n\n> The accused decided to kill herself, her mother, her brother and her three children in September 2019, when her brother\'s wife gave birth. She intended to burn everyone alive with petrol, except for her only son, her favourite child.\n\n> She intended to kill him by injecting insulin into him, as she did not want him to die in pain. At the same time, the boy reminded her of her brother and she began hating him.\n\n> After searching online for a ""peaceful"" way to die, the woman chanced upon the use of insulin. She found that high doses could cause one\'s blood sugar to crash, leading to brain damage, coma, or death. She decided to use two to three insulin pens at one go and inject a high dose into the victim.\n\n> She bought the pens from Malaysia and learned how to use them by watching YouTube. She administered the first dose to the boy, who was then six, in January 2019 after taking him to Causeway Point for lunch. She injected the insulin in his arm in the toilet after the meal and observed him, noticing that he became ""extra hungry"".\n\n> She continued to do this between January and July 2019, administering 20 to 30 units of insulin to the boy on 13 occasions. He began feeling side effects such as severe headaches, nausea, vomiting, double vision, tinnitus, photosensitivity and numbness in fingers.\n\n> He was hospitalised three times with low blood sugar levels and a hypoglycemic seizure on one occasion. Medical staff puzzled over the cause of his symptoms, and he had to be rescued with intravenous drips.\n\n> In July 2019, the victim went to the zoo for a school trip. According to a teacher, he was fine, but his mother claimed he was having a seizure and administered insulin to him. The hospital later confirmed he did not have a seizure on this occasion.\n\n> HOSPITAL UNCOVERS PLAN\n\n> During a hospital visit on Jul 16, 2019, a therapist spoke to the victim, who said his mother had injected him with medication from a pen on many occasions on his arms and buttocks. He said he would be hungry after the medication and opened his haversack to show biscuits and sweets that were inside.\n\n> Hospital staff confronted the accused that day, and after she admitted to injecting insulin into her son, the hospital called the police.\n\n> The victim showed symptoms suggestive of PTSD and has been discharged into the care of child protection services.\n\n> PSYCHIATRIC EVALUATION\n\n> His mother was arrested and subsequently remanded. She was found to have major depressive disorder of moderate severity and PTSD, as she was directly exposed on multiple occasions to sexual violence by her biological father and brother, psychiatric reports said.\n\n> She was found to be a pathological liar, with her behaviour towards her son showing her need for attention. One report found her case to be a “classic presentation of ... Munchausen syndrome by proxy”, where she created symptoms of illness in her son for attention. She also displayed strong antisocial personality traits, although they did not amount to a disorder.\n\n> While her disorders substantially contributed to the offences, she was not of unsound mind at the time and she knew what she was doing, and that her actions would harm or even kill her son, the reports concluded.\n\n> PROSECUTION CALLS FOR SIX YEARS\' JAIL, DEFENCE ASKS FOR FOUR\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Bhajanvir Singh asked for six years\' jail for the woman, saying she needs three to four years\' treatment for rehabilitation. She cannot be relied on to be an effective and safe mother towards her children, he said.\n\n> While she has shown some improvement due to the counselling, trauma-focused therapy and medication she has been receiving in remand, she remains ""an unreliable and ineffective mother"", said Mr Singh.\n\n> She has also continued to lie to her cellmates, friends and prison counsellor that her son was fathered as a result of her brother\'s rape as she felt she would ""enjoy more sympathy"" this way, he said.\n\n> While in remand, she has lost her temper at other inmates and thrown tantrums that drew disciplinary actions against her.\n\n> ""This is typically a case where the accused was unable to accept the fact that her brother was able to move on with his life,"" said Mr Singh.\n\n> ""Because of this inability to accept this, she harboured dangerous thoughts of killing her brother, her mother, herself and her three children. In fact, she said she intended to do this in September 2020. This coincides with the time her brother\'s wife gave birth.""\n\n> He said the insulin injections would have continued if not for the alertness of the staff at National University Hospital, and that the accused ""played with the life of her son"".\n\n> He added that the charge she faces is amalgamated and she could be jailed for up to 20 years, double the punishment as it is amalgamated and includes multiple instances of offending.\n\n> Defence lawyer Ng Pei Qi said six years is not warranted, calling instead for four years\' jail. She said her client was molested and raped by her father and brother since she was nine.\n\n> ""Her trauma is so deep-rooted that she sees the face of her attacker in her son,"" she said, calling the case ""a tragic backlash of years of untreated trauma"".\n\n> The accused is ""a slave"" to her mental disorders and felt guilty, feeding her son snacks after the injections as she felt she was countering the acts of insulin.\n\n> ""The court is not sentencing a cold-blooded woman today, who cannot move on from her past, but a victim whose trauma has caught up with her,"" she said.\n\n> In response, the prosecution said depression, even if severe, cannot be a licence to kill others, and that the accused knew what she was doing.\n\n> ""The rape by the father is an assertion made, and not something that is borne out by investigations, while investigations revealed that she was molested and raped by her brother, there is nothing to show that she was actually raped and molested by her father,"" said Mr Singh.\n\n> The judge noted that the accused\'s conduct was ""clearly reprehensible"", but also that she had mental disorders that substantially impaired her mental responsibility for the acts.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', ""Maybe the brother's wife should be reminded how he commited incest on his own sister.

I don't give a fuck if his a teenage boy cuz the one who stuck his hands into my panties and laugh at me as he fingered me at 10 yr old was a 14 yr old teenage boy who felt he had the right to touch me that way and I was being ridiculous, rude and unfriendly to object. I have 12 yr old boys sexualise me and call me a prostitute when I was 12. I don't give a fuck what age they are. \n\nI'm sorry that happened to you. Those boys are trash and should be punished. \n\n\n>This boy being so deliberately forceful to ask me when I am alone in his home and stuck with him for the rest of the day cuz we needed to go to a school ECA together and spend the rest of the day together, was frightening. \n\nI wasn't there so I can't judge. But if he was being forceful and deliberately asked you when you were alone at his house so you'd feel pressured then he's in the wrong. \n\n>All I know is, I don't wanna cause any trouble and get out and away from him as soon as possible. I didn't know him well enough. I didn't know how he will react. But I didn't get a feel he was a kind hearted good tempered boy. I had bad vibes. \n\nAfter hearing the context, you were a kid and did the best you could to get away safely. \n\n\n>I personally am not comfortable with you thinking just because you are boyfriend, you have full rights to kiss her without consent. \n\nFor the record, I don't feel like I have full rights to kiss her without consent. I mean that since we're in a loving relationship, it's normal for us to kiss each other e.g. a quick peck before parting ways. It'd be ridiculous to ask for consent everytime we kissed. \n\n**By your logic, my gf should ask for my consent before kissing me or initiating sex?**\n\n\n>It sounds like if you become a husband, you will feel like any sex with her is a right and consent is not needed just like you already feel entitled to kiss her just because you are her boyfriend. This mentality is a dangerous mentality that leads to you potentially getting caught up in a non consensual case. \n\nThat's quite a big jump in logic. I think your past trauma might be affecting your view of what a healthy relationship is. Everyone has different standards. It's fine as long as both parties in the relationship are happy. \n\n\n\n>All my most romantic dates are with men who checked all the way if I was feeling OK. It was caring, loving and romantic.\n\nIf that's what you prefer then okay. But don't impose it on others. Again, I'm **not** saying consent doesn't matter."", 'YOU are not getting it. Like I said, there are MANY rules in BDSM to ensure the quality of consent stays consistent throughout. For one, most people would have some form of  agreement before the scene commences(whether in text messages or an actual quasi-contract, seriously). And there are rules to keep checking that the consent is there throughout the scene itself — yes, you are actually supposed to stop and keep checking that the other guy is okay. This is unlike normal sex. \n\nSo, that person is most definitely NOT SCREWED if the partner accuses of rape post-scene. For one, there is usually evidence to prove consent where there wouldn’t usually be in a usual sexual encounter. \n\nOtherwise, you seriously think that people are stupid enough to engage in BDSM play without some kind of safeguard meh?? \n\nAll this information can be googled within 10min. Maybe you should try researching before you actually talk about the subject matter.', "">By your logic, my gf should ask for my consent before kissing me or initiating sex?\n\nI always ask men for consent before I touch them sexually. And even wanking or anything, I will check if he is doing OK too in the midst and should I carry on. Consent is super important to me. I always tell a man I don't want him to do anything he don't want to do in sex ever with me. I make sure the men I am with are consensual all the way. \n\nI don't understand why this is so difficult for you.\n\nMy own brother has experienced rape by a woman. He froze too. As he was so shock it happened. He didn't say no but he felt raped and violated after. This happens to men too. So I very careful about male consent. Male rape is worst because a man can still get hard and feel he didn't consent to it. But society views getting hard as consensual. It's not. \n\nOf course in long term relationships, you reach a stage where you can read each other silently whether they consent or not. I know when my current man doesn't want sex when I initiate and I back off. He doesn't need to tell me with words. \n\nBut usually disagreement whether it was rape or not usually happens in two people who don't know each other very well. In those scenarios, it is best to continously check for consent."", 'Not everyone into bdsm is as well prepared. You are being quite short sighted', ""Okay, let's put aside sex. In your opinion, should my gf or I ask for consent before every peck on the lips?\n\nAnd I'm sorry to hear that your brother is a victim of rape."", 'Well, if you’re telling me that there was absolutely no preparation going into the BDSM scene at all, then I would hardly call it BDSM in the first place and it would be classified as a case of normal sexual encounter. Again this goes back to your fundamental lack of understanding about what BDSM is about in the first place.  \n\nAnd if a normal sexual encounter produces a party that is physically battered and traumatised, then yes, he/she is absolutely entitled to make a police report on account of sexual assault or rape.', 'As I said, if the relationship is new and you don\'t know each other very well yet and how each other character is like. It is good to talk about this even. What is OK and what is not OK with her. You might have boundaries too. And learn her boundaries. \n\nSometimes PDA is not OK for some folks men and women and prefer only in private settings. I think alot needs to be communicated and not assumed. \n\nThe first time you kiss her, I think it is not mood kill to even say, ""Is it OK if I kissed you?""\n\nI don\'t know, I always find it super sweet when a man asks. I feel respected and cared for and treated like a human being when he does and not like an object that he takes whenever he wants just because he assumes it\'s OK. \n\nAs you get to know her preferences very well, you can go accordingly to whatever that is. \n\nAs for my brother, yea, it happened in thailand, he was early twenties. The lady was like 50 yr old or something. He was a short and skinny fellow. And the lady was big, much bigger. So because it was thailand, we felt there is no point doing a police report as we were just tourist there. I never ever want my sibling to have to deal with shit like that. \n\nBut he is happily married so I think he is doing OK..., because even after the incident, I kept checking in on him and he likes to say, ""I am a man, I can take it."" \n\nI take consent very seriously and I am aware this issue is worst with men as they sometimes feel less masculine to talk about being violated.', ""I'm sorry, I'm done trying to explain it to someone who doesn't want to get it"", 'Nah. You just can’t take being called out for talking shit about sth you don’t understand at all.', ""Right... and you can't admit that not everything works the way you think they do"", 'Do you... even know what sado-masochism is?']"
betaorionis-,krry4p,Why can't mentally disordered people donate organs in SG?,2021-01-07 01:01:53,singapore,378959,9,7,"Under the Human Organ Transplate Act (HOTA), any Singaporean/PR >21yo is automatically an organ donor (you can opt out). But people diagnosed with mental disorders are not included. Why? It might be easier to understand if the donor is alive while he donates an organ but even upon death, people with mental disorders cannot be organ donors. Can't seem to find any explanation online either.",0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/krry4p/why_cant_mentally_disordered_people_donate_organs/,"['I think it could be because of informed consent. It would be difficult to ensure that they fully understand the implication of opting in or opting out.', 'I went to specifically look up the wording of HOTA, and it states: ""*No authority shall be given under subsection\xa0(1) for the removal of the organ from the body of any deceased person\xa0— (e) whom the designated officer, after making such inquiries as are reasonable in the circumstances, has reason to believe was mentally disordered, unless the parent or guardian has consented to such removal.*""\n\nI believe it has got to do with mental capacity to make informed consent. Like you mentioned, while it is clearer for a living donor, mental capacity to make informed consent also applies to deceased persons following their deaths (e.g. legitimacy of wills) - we cannot retrospectively determine if the person could have wanted to opt out of the scheme prior to their death. It is very possible that someone whom the law deems as ""mentally disordered"" would have wanted to opt out of donating, but did not have the capacity to do so. I guess it is more prudent to assume this scenario than otherwise.\n\nHaving said that, the law does provide provision for the parents or legal guardian to make the decision on the person\'s behalf. So I guess the way it is worded is for prudence and attempting to balance rights vs mental capacity.\n\nPerhaps one interesting issue that comes up then is whether a proper will, written by someone who has a history of mental illnesses (but in remission/have full mental capacity), to donate their organs, will contradict/take precedence over HOTA.', 'Cos there is no evidence to prove or disprove that mental health is linked to organ health and how it may affect one another. The human body is rly complicated n we havent found any evidence that may suggest positve or negative effects of such a procedure.

What do they need to understand if they've already died?"", ""Can confirm.  I'm pretty sure I'm retarded and I got small pp. Not sure if causation or correlation"", 'Because consent is made before you passed. If you opt out of it and you pass away, you explicitly say that your organs should not be used for donation and the governing body cannot use it for donation regardless of situation. In the case of mental disability, you are considered “opt out”, so you are not consenting to donation of your organs.', 'It\'s also illegal to transplant the organs of dead people without mental disorders who did not consent while they are alive. \n\nWith that said, since people with mental disorders are deemed unfit to male an informed decision, they are taken to not have given consent to it, so when they have passed on, they are treated the same as any one else who have not consented (opted out).\n\nEdit: To the other comment, please do not try to make this a narrative of ""people with mental disorders are discriminated like how gay men could not donate blood"".']"

My father did ask her and was told that it’s for feng shui, but it’s just a cover or a delusion on her part.\n3.

So I conclude that if it happens to be Scenario 2, it has to be either one of these:  \n1. She is actually having psychotic delusions and is seeing things, and is deluded into thinking that by doing it, she’s doing it for the sake of feng shui.\n2.

mangopangoh,nnncy8,Secondary school dropout pondering what to do with my life,2021-05-29 21:20:35,singapore,378959,140,589,"I dropped out about 6 years ago when I was in Sec 3 because of 2 and a half years of bullying... perpetrated by my teachers of all people. I did go back to school for a while the year after but after the dams burst, they couldn’t be closed and the mental toll it took on me proved to be too much at that time (depression, anxiety, communication disorder).

From then until now, I’ve been mostly doing part time online work - doing write ups for some websites, helping out with brand promotion material, translating freelance etc. I had such a hard time coping with trusting adults/authority figures after I dropped out that I didn’t even consider any further education.

Recently though, since I’m about to become an adult myself (21F) I’ve been thinking about the future and whether I can actually earn a living for myself this way... I’m thinking of maybe starting to study for the O Levels privately (is there an age limit?) since I did pretty well in school before dropping out. I’m also considering going to a specialised language school since I’ve saved up quite a bit and afaik, being a translator doesn’t absolutely require a specialised degree beyond language certifications. (I’ve taken HSK6 and JLPT3 so it seems plausible to me... Might need time adjusting back to being in a school environment though.)

But to be honest, I don’t really have any passions or interests in life... I just want to be able to make a living and let my parents retire without needing to worry even more about their immature child (AKA me) :’) 

Anyone been in similar situations looking for your future? Or any advice would be appreciated as well.

It depends on the type of mental disorder you have and whether it’s being managed appropriately.\n\nFor example, I have relatives who have depression. If it’s not managed, they literally will lie in bed and cannot function. In such situations, it’s not an issue of discrimination but an issue of non-performance at the job. Think of it this way; if you just keep taking extended MC without explaining what’s going on, at some point your bosses will also need to know what’s going on.\n\nIf you’re bipolar, you can have similar issues if not managed.

People with mental illness do get married and have kids but it’s inevitable that they have to tell their partner about it. It’s up to the partner whether they can accept it. I also know some people who choose not to have kids because of fear they pass on the illness but again that’s a choice rather than being forced not to have kids.\n\nAll in all, get help. There’s nothing to be ashamed of and the help you get is what will enable you to function better.', 'Hi! Going to touch on my experiences regarding the second part of this question first since I’m too young to know if I’m not gonna have a future, then the first part briefly. \n\nI was diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder in my final year of poly at 19, but I’ve been experiencing symptoms since I was 13. It only took me this long to get diagnosed because I thought I was overthinking it/projecting onto myself until I experienced multiple breakdowns which eventually led to me being hospitalised in IMH. These events definitely affected my grades, but only because I went untreated for too long and because of the disorder itself. However, regardless of whether you have a mental illness or not, please please please seek support if you feel that your mental health is suffering. There are resources available if you search them up, and don’t worry about judgement because your wellbeing is more important. And I don’t self-diagnosing is wrong per se, just that it is still an assumption at the end of the day and such assumptions could pose a danger to yourself (misdiagnosing, self-medicating, etc.)\n\n\nWhat I did: \n\n1. I went to the school councillor. I didn’t wanna make a mountain out of a molehill so, as a student experiencing problems, I sought out what made sense to be an unbiased and professional second opinion. While it wasn’t a great experience (because school councillors are trained to give advice/counsel, not treat people with psychological disorders), the councillor called my parents to have them take me to a polyclinic to see if I can get a referral to see a psychiatrist. (school councillors will only break the confidentiality agreement if they think you’re in danger,  thoughts of suicide and self harm included). this made talking to my parents easier because they heard another adult tell them to get their kid help, where they’d previously only brushed it off and shut it down. \n\n2. I saw a GP at a polyclinic and told him about the symptoms I’ve been experiencing. I did prior research to what I thought I had so I could be more specific in identifying the problem. The doctor then gave me a referral to see a psychiatrist at SGH. \n\n3. I saw the psychiatrist at SGH and she asked me questions about the things mentioned in my referral, my childhood, family life, social life, school life. I was then diagnosed with MDD and was prescribed medication and given the option to get therapy or not (I said no to therapy cos money was short)\n\n\nMy school life didn’t change during this process, and I’m very lucky to have had such supportive and understanding family, friends and lecturers. I had to be hospitalised from school after a bad episode, and my lecturers kept me company while I waited for my family to pick me up, and let my friends off from school so I could have their moral support. I had to start having therapy from then onwards. Appointments for medication and therapy sessions sometimes fell during school hours but my lecturers made accommodations for me regarding this. \n\nMy grades, as I said, did suffer. My lecturers and group mates could only be so patient when this was all happening during my final year project. And, while I was ashamed for not doing better, I like to think finally getting my diploma meant that that shitty, shitty year wasn’t in vain.\n\nmy boyfriend stuck through all of this with me, and we definitely wanna get married and have kids. I know I’m definitely beyond lucky at this point. \n\ncareer wise, I decided to take a gap year after graduating to make sure I have my shit together as much as possible before tackling the greater stress that is Uni. like some comments have said, employers can’t access your medical records without explicit permission from you. HOWEVER I do have a friend who studies nursing and is pursuing nursing now, and she was kept from a scholarship (we suspect it’s because of her various mental illnesses because literally everyone in her class got a scholarship, and her O Lvl score was lower than half the class), and it was hard for her to get into Uni because of issues with her nursing certification cos of her conditions.  \n\nmental illnesses are incredibly common and could last between a year to a lifetime. I believe everyone deals with some form of it to some degree at some point in their lives, so don’t feel like something is wrong with you or that you’re alone. we’re all out here just going through it man. \n\nALSO IMH ISNT THE ONLY HOSPITAL YOU CAN GO TO FOR HELP. I’ve heard many patients go for treatment at SGH because it’s easier to keep their condition lowkey, and I’m pretty sure most (if not all) hospitals have a psychiatric ward. \n\nTL;DR the possibility of having a mental illness is not a threat to a happy and normal life, so talk to a professional because it’s really going to be okay!', 'For some very high-risk occupations (e.g. fighter pilot), it think it makes sense to prefer someone with no history.\n\nI think you still can elected tho, if people like you and you might be appreciated for a new perspective you can bring.', 'It’s not wrong to self diagnose (mental issue or not) but it is definitely better to have a doctor to diagnose you. By self diagnosing, you’re putting yourself at risk because (again mental issue or not) you may have a bigger or unknown issue at hand. There could be options not considered beforehand that Can make it extremely dangerous to self diagnose. Especially for mental illnesses because you could potentially lead yourself down a rabbit hole. \n\nIf you do think that you are suffering from a mental issue, please do seek help and if it’s affecting you too much in your daily life, get a diagnosis. There will at least be certainty to what your condition is and ways to treat it. Not sure if this is true, but by going to IMH you have the choice of not continue if u feel uncomfortable going. There are a lot of other good advices here, but in terms of how much it affects your life, it really depends on how serious the issue is. \n\nI was diagnosed with ADHD way back when I was younger but since then I haven’t really gone back. But my ADHD isn’t as serious compared to the other kids so it honestly didn’t affect my life a whole lot.', 'Hi OP, sorry to hear that you are in this state of self-doubt!

Mental capacity is assessed by a medical professional and concerns your ability to make important decisions (such as managing your assets).

A little background: I have always been the person that is easily alarmed and panic. I also tend to worry excessively everyday to the point that I can easily be worn out just by worrying and being anxious. But I thought it was normal for everyone to feel some stress. 

However, since enlistment I feel like my mental health has been deteriorating. In BMT, my sergeants told me that I am just adjusting to military life. So, I did not pay much attention to it. However, in unit i notice that I became increasingly more forgetful and blur... Like people have to repeat many many times in a row before I can even understand. I just feel like zoned out and anxious all the time... 

I did a google search and did a self-diagnosis test and I think I do experience some symptoms of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD). 

I am from a front-line unit and I worry that I make mistake that cause harm to anyone because of my anxiety and inability to concentrate...

Throwaway1245121,oapy6c,"[Rant] (Trigger Warning: Depression, Suicide) Feeling Suicidal, I think my prospects are looking bad after Poly.",2021-06-30 12:53:57,SGExams,77716,12,24,"I'm not sure if this is the right place for it nor if it is a rant, but seeing as the source of my suicidal thoughts and stress are stemming from my Polytechnic issues, I thought I'd let it out here and maybe get some ideas as to what I can do in the future. Mods, if this violates any of the rules, feel free to take it down, thanks.

Here goes.

Backstory, I'm currently a year 3 Accountancy student in NP with a GPA of 3.70-ish. I have severe depression and anxiety disorder and thus, this usually led me to being not being able to socialize well as I'm very paranoid. My studies and GPA are all I have to ""validate"" me as I have not accomplished anything in life. This semester has been completely confusing for me as a lot of the content I was taught, it took me a while to grasp but that was okay.

My main grip is with my projects, to cut thing short, I am one of the ""outcasts"" who often get stuck with the remaining unfinished groups and it just so happens, this year, my groups were pretty horrid. 

We've just submitted a 30% grade project with a lot of the components missing and I am worried for my overall results. Coupled that with a module that is heavily project based, with my group not doing much each, we have one groupmate who just sits in call and does nothing, and I'm feeling confused and lost.

I'm aware that to enter local Us, we need a pretty high GPA and mine is currently somewhere on the borderline. I do not expect to be able to maintain it at all due to these two modules and thus, do not know what are my prospects. I think somewhere along the lines of an Advanced Diploma or ACCA, perhaps.

These thoughts and what my current reality is has left me feeling extremely locked-in. I feel suffocated and completely and utterly burnt out. I do not discuss my suicidal thoughts to my friends except for one extremely close one that has the same issue as I do not wish to burden the rest but it has come to the point where I just do not feel like going on anymore.

ubtokenceo,nshqjv,The rise of mental health awareness – and the stigma that remains attached to certain conditions,2021-06-05 06:52:55,singapore,378959,3,97,,0.93,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/singapore-mental-health-awareness-stigma-conditions-depression-14903772,"[""> # The rise of mental health awareness – and the stigma that remains attached to certain conditions\n\n> SINGAPORE: It’s been five years since Sabrina Ooi, 30, attempted suicide - and two since she penned a blog post discussing her attempt.\n\n> The blog post, published on October 9, 2019 - one day before World Mental Health Day on October 10 - was the first time Sabrina publicly shared about that dark period in her life.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Since that fateful day in 2016, suicide has been decriminalised in Singapore after the committee reviewing the Penal Code acknowledged that treatment, rather than prosecution, was the appropriate response to people who feel they have no choice but to take their own lives.\n\n> Sabrina has also co-founded a mental health community, Calm Collective Asia, with two friends during the “circuit breaker” period.\n\n> While she’s been called an advocate for mental health, she prefers the term: “Mental health expert by experience”.\n\n> “I think this advocacy thing just happened because I’m in my personal journey of processing what I’ve gone through and wanting to help others going through something similar,” she told CNA over the phone.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Occasionally, being open about her anxiety and depression has even led to strangers pouring out their stories to her on social media.\n\n> “Whenever I share, I go through a vulnerability hangover. It can be really tiring, but I know that sharing my story is helpful, both to others and for myself in getting clarity about my own story,” she said.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> But Sabrina noted that this candour about anxiety and depression doesn’t always extend to another mental health condition she lives with: Bipolar disorder.\n\n> This condition causes extreme and unusual shifts in mood, energy, concentration, and activity levels that affect one’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.\n\n> “While I've been open with talking about anxiety and depression, I'm still very careful about the term ‘bipolar disorder’ because people tend to freak out and make their own assumptions about the condition,” she said.\n\n> “I've had friends completely wash their hands of me. They decided they didn’t really understand it and couldn’t support me in this part of my journey.”\n\n> The circuit breaker almost broke Syazwan.\n\n> Like Sabrina, 30-year-old Syazwan Rahmad, who is also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is no stranger to a fear of judgement.\n\n> This partly stems from his own “shock” when he got the unexpected diagnosis recently, he explained, as he thought he only had depression.\n\n> “I don’t want people to think that I’m crazy. I’m scared they don’t want to be around me because I have a disorder. Till today, I have this thought in my head,” he told CNA.\n\n> Syazwan has since disclosed his condition to family, close friends and even to the public in a CNA Insider story that tracked the economic impact of COVID-19 on his dance career. But he admitted that he still struggles with criticism.\n\n> “About 20 per cent respond with negative comments about my career and me as a Muslim (when I talk about my mental health). But ultimately, I’m so open because I want people to know it’s okay not to be okay. Be true to who you are and that’s where healing will start,” he said.\n\n> SOME CONDITIONS HARDER TO DISCUSS\n\n> The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a need for more mental health support, with an increase in people calling in to mental health helplines.\n\n> Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore saw an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019.\n\n> Likewise, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) received an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020.\n\n> Yet, despite more people seeking help for their mental health over the past year, and the increasing awareness around conditions like anxiety or depression, other conditions remain difficult to disclose, said seven individuals who spoke to CNA.\n\n> Some of these conditions are bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia.\n\n> The traits of people with BPD include a feeling of emptiness, fear of abandonment, intense anger and irritability, unstable emotion, idealising and devaluing people, possible psychosis when stressed, and even binge eating, said Dr Roger Ho, an associate professor and senior consultant at the Department of Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore.\n\n> (Photo: Unsplash/Cristian Newman)\n\n> He added that there is also the possibility of physical self-harm among those with BPD, which is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD).\n\n> “Another symptom we pick up is they will cut themselves. In the emergency department, when you see someone with a lot of scars on their forearm, the patient might have BPD,” he said.\n\n> “But society doesn't know much about BPD; they think it’s just depression. The self-laceration is a very unique sign. When you ask someone with BPD why they cut themselves, they usually don't say they want to end their life. They want to experience the emotional pain they’ve had in the past.”\n\n> Dr Ho, however, reinforced that while some people might possess the traits of BPD, having a personality disorder is more than just checking off these traits.\n\n> “Having a personality disorder means that the traits become so strong that the person has interpersonal problems. These problems affect their life, whether it’s family, work or study,” he said.\n\n> Similarly, the stigma attached to schizophrenia - a psychotic disorder - prevails in Singapore.\n\n> According to a 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on May 21, about one-third of the population who have been diagnosed with psychotic disorders had a diagnosis of schizophrenia at some point in their lives. This makes schizophrenia the most common psychotic disorder here.\n\n> The results were part of the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among those living in Singapore aged 18 and above, their associated factors, and the treatment gap of the disorders.\n\n> \n\n> Despite the prevalence of schizophrenia, public understanding is lacking, with people with the condition being perceived as “dangerous or as individuals incapable of managing themselves”, said Ms Lim Lay Keow, a senior case manager at the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme at the Department of Psychosis in IMH.\n\n> “Schizophrenia is still sensationalised by the media. The accessibility to smart phones allow for photo or video taking of a person in distress, subjecting them to be judged online.”\n\n> This behaviour, Ms Lim noted, doesn’t just make it difficult for those with schizophrenia to disclose their condition for fear of discrimination. It also results in self-stigmatisation, where the person with schizophrenia finds it difficult to “differentiate themselves from the condition”.\n\n> The deeply entrenched stereotypes about schizophrenia also make it harder for the public to understand that schizophrenia is “not a personality flaw but a disease of the brain”, she added.\n\n> YOUTH MORE CANDID, BUT STIGMA REMAINS\n\n> Even before the pandemic last year, younger people were increasingly open about their mental health on social media, with some talking about therapy sessions or situations where their mental health conditions might flare up.\n\n> But Ron Yap, who was diagnosed with OCD three years ago, said this conversation doesn’t translate into less stigma for all conditions.\n\n> “While there has been more conversation for disorders like generalised anxiety disorder and depression, there’s still stigma surrounding more uncommon disorders, like OCD,” the 23-year-old said.\n\n> “Even though non-sufferers (of anxiety disorders and depression) will never experience the depths of pain and discomfort those conditions cause, they can at least get a rough, if imperfect, idea of what it’s like to suffer, by taking the times in which they experienced anxiety or sadness and amplifying the intensity and duration.”\n\n> But with OCD, the 23-year-old said, “It’s harder to fathom how and why someone would wash their hands 50 times to the point of breaking their skin, go to the bathroom 20 times before bed or dwell on a distressing thought for a whole day to the point of paralysis.”\n\n> To a non-sufferer, he added, such behaviour is “simply irrational, and even insane, and this impression hinders one’s ability to empathise with the sufferer”.\n\n> Ron, who runs the Instagram account @mentalhealthceo, believes misconceptions about OCD don’t help, such as that there’s only one type of OCD “exemplified by someone who obsessively washes their hands or clothes over and over again”.\n\n> “OCD and its rituals can manifest in countless different forms. I know someone who has to eat their food in a certain order, otherwise they wouldn’t be able to consume the meal at all,” he said.\n\n> A screenshot of @MentalHealthCEO, an Instagram account that Ron runs to raise awareness about anxiety and OCD.\n\n> Although a huge part of Ron’s life involves breaking the stigma around mental health, he still hesitates to disclose some of the “more personal symptoms” of OCD to people around him, such as going to the bathroom multiple times.\n\n> “I sometimes mask it by coming up with stories about why I usually spend so much time in the bathroom or through humour, especially when I don’t feel comfortable talking about my OCD in the moment or if I feel like they wouldn’t understand,” he said.\n\n> ADDRESSING BLINDSPOTS WITH NUANCE\n\n> That said, openness about anxiety or depression doesn’t mean a lack of stigma around"", ""> these conditions, experts observed.\n\n> “From what we’ve observed, some of the challenges faced by those living with mental illness include being labelled as ‘attention seeking’ when they talk about their mental illness, or that they’re ‘overreacting’,” said Ms Jasmine Chang, a clinical psychologist at IMH.\n\n> “Even though there’s awareness around mental illnesses, admitting to having a mental illness is actually a different story.”\n\n> She added that some of her clients fear that their diagnosis might affect their employment and appraisal, while those serving National Service worry about being negatively evaluated by their peers.\n\n> \n\n> With increased awareness about mental health, more nuance is now needed to take people's understanding to the next level, advised clinical psychologist Ms Chang.\n\n> For example, there is a difference between having a couple of bad days and having prolonged periods of bad days that debilitate you and prevent you from doing anything else.\n\n> “All of us experience varying levels of sadness and anxiety. While we experience sadness and anxiety in our everyday life, depression and anxiety disorders lead to significant impairment and distress in someone’s life. It affects their ability to go to work, to sleep, and for a sustained period of time,” she said.\n\n> Public education about the diagnosis would also help, she added.\n\n> “This involves highlighting to people that mental illnesses can be managed with the right treatment and support, and those living with mental illnesses can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.”\n\n> Besides managing symptoms, Sabrina, who has depression in addition to bipolar disorder, believes it would be better to look deeper at what causes them.\n\n> “Usually the triggers stem from your childhood trauma, environmental triggers, and even biological factors. So it’s good that we start talking about anxiety and depression, but we need to take it a step further and understand the root cause,” she said.\n\n> (File photo: AP)\n\n> And while media campaigns like Beyond the Label aim to change public perception around mental health conditions, some said labels actually help them make light of what they go through.\n\n> Sabrina, for example, doesn’t mind that some mental health conditions are more prominent than others, because it helps her “reshape her perspective” on what she’s going through.\n\n> “I’ve had people tell me they honestly don’t know what bipolar disorder is. And I realise I have to link it to depression or something more familiar to them for them to understand,” she said.\n\n> “So at least the increasing awareness of anxiety and depression has helped me talk about my condition.”\n\n> Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg. You can also find a list of international helplines here.

itsjoshtaylor,nk1nnf,Toxic family: What to do when I can’t move out?,2021-05-25 00:15:27,singapore,378959,38,107,"Toxic family that distresses me/ makes me sad everyday; want to move out but rent is expensive in Singapore. I also have a non-HDB approved dog that I love with all my heart, and I’m not moving without her. It’s common to move out in the US, but less so here in Singapore. I was wondering if anyone might have advice.

For context, I’m 21 years old. My dad has traits consistent with schizoid personality disorder while my mum is emotionally immature/unstable and has traits consistent with narcissistic personality disorder. Both of them have no empathy, love, affection. They don’t seem to want any personal relationship with me and barely interact with me at home, but when they do, it’s usually verbal abuse (my dad) or invalidation (my mum). 

I’m also an only child, so while I have no sibling fights to worry about, there’s also no sibling support. (There’s a popular notion that only children are spoiled with their parents’ undivided attention - and that is often true - but where parents are too old, too tired, or generally neglectful, the only child has absolutely no attention or human interaction or mental stimulation at home. Thank god for the internet!)

I’m currently seeing a counsellor for depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD stemming from childhood emotional neglect. (If you experienced emotional neglect as a child, and are still a student, your school/uni likely offers free counselling - it helps!)

Anyway, living with my parents is bad for my mental health AND my relational health. I think I’d be a much better friend/girlfriend if I lived on my own in a stable environment.

TL;DR Toxic family, want to move out, but housing is expensive in Singapore and it’s not a common practice. Is anyone in the same boat?

EDIT: Thank you everyone for the excellent advice and for sharing your experiences!! I can’t express how grateful I am for your advice, kindness, and support. I love hearing your stories, like how your siblings would defend each other from difficult parents. Anyway, know that you guys made me feel much less trapped - I realise i actually have many options (thank you!) - and am much more hopeful about life. Also, big love to those of you who went through similar things. I’ll reply to your comments more personally later after my sleep!",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nk1nnf/toxic_family_what_to_do_when_i_cant_move_out/,"[""I can relate to emotional neglect, it's always strange why such parents bother having kids. \n\nMy mom just explained that she had kids because she believed the religion she believes in, apparently say humans are obligated to have children as part of her God's demands. \n\nBut they were not asked to love their children so she doesn't need to have feelings towards her kids. She just needs to pop them out and don't care. Which is exactly what she did. Employed maids to do all the mom stuffs and she never even ever touch her own baby. Like change their diapers or feed them milk. She did the legally bare minimum of being financially responsible. She runs her own business and pretty much just had her life. Her kids are not a priority. Well she employed maids to take care of them that's it. But quality time, nope. \n\nDont ask me what my mom religion is because she is damn weird with religion. She says she worships everything. Christianity, every Taoist Buddhist Deity and Islam too. She gets involved with all. Her point is also incase one of them is real so she worship all. Her religions are really her own made up rules. \n\nHowever I did move out at 19. Started working. Rented a room for 800bux a month. Never gone back. Best decision of my life for my own mental health. \n\nMy mom made me suicidal. My dad is the type who believe kids is woman's business and not his problem so he is as aloof and cold. Doesn't even wanna talk to me at all. \n\nBoth got good career and make good income though. But I definitely never felt warmth from them or any loving emotion from them towards me.\n\nHowever I have siblings and we are tight and gave each other loads of love growing up together. This part is ironic.\n\nI used to date a man who will always fight with his siblings to get the attention of their mother. They are all BFF with their mom and wanna be her favourite. So in a way, his relationship with his siblings are pretty bad. Btw these are not teenagers but adults in their 40's and 50's. \n\nAnd my own situation is the exact opposite, we had to stick together and watch each other's back against our parents. We were insanely loyal to each other and would cover up for each other or take the fall for each other. Like for example, I am the only non smoker among my siblings but I will always take the fall if their cigarettes is found and I will say it's mine. It kinda doesn't matter to me because my parents already always thinks the worst of me since I was born and they believe I was their worst kid. Although I am in a way the most clean, free from drugs and cigarettes or anything illegal.\nIf I am grounded, my siblings will help me sneak out and sneak back in. And really lie to cover me."", ""There is really only one thing you can do - stay out of the house for the whole day, only go back to sleep.\n\nWith the pandemic and lockdown, I suggest going over to a friend's house, then coming back to sleep. Bring your laptop with you to do your work.\n\nMost importantly, surprisingly least mentioned, exercise regularly. Getting into your best shape possible will help your mental health tremendously. It improves your perception of your self-worth, so you become more resistant to external abuses. If you're in a good shape, people may think twice about confronting you. And if you learn self-defense, you won't be feel threatened easily.\n\nI've been where you are. I've tried sitting my parents down and talk things through, but it doesn't help. They are old and stubborn and lack logical reasoning. You need to start looking inwards and ignore toxicity. Whatever your parents say, just ignore. They treat you like shit, so why bother? Just treat them as non-existent. Don't act hostilely, don't give any attitude, just poker face and ignore. Live your own life, they don't matter.\n\nInternet self-help is your best friend. I find Jordan Peterson's words particularly helpful. Hope this helps."", 'Do you intend to take your dog with you if you were to move out?

Sure, when we do meet up, we give updates to each other on how we are doing but we aren\'t close. Our relationship feels like a wound from long ago and has long healed with scars remaining.

I totally agree that Singapore shouldn’t always be so focused on building family-oriented apartments and society as the mental health of individuals are usually overlooked as a result. Also, unmarried individuals can only buy a HDB at 35 years old, and I guess that led to many people tying the knots to BTO so they have their own home. But anyway, my suggestions:\n- If you’re in the university, you could look for hostel options. \n- There are options of renting shared rooms that costs about $300-$500 (per month). The downside might be you don’t know if you might have “weird” roomies or housemates which might also cause distress. So you’ve to consider the areas, landlord etc. Some rent out the house totally so you live with tenants, some with a family, and some with elderly who lives alone. I think you’ve to access which might suit you better\n- If moving out is not an option (always have savings so don’t deplete all your savings to rent something, you need something for rainy days, imo), stay in your room as much as possible (out of sight out of mind). Find ways to do up your room to make it cosy and personal for you. Maybe even get sound proofing etc. \nI hope this help and that you’ve people whom you could talk to when you’ve problems.

Thank you for the courage to share your story, I'm in a similar situation as you are too - similar age, toxic narcissistic parents, wanting to move out but can't because of financial constraints, depression and CPTSD from childhood emotional neglect (I'm actually quite pleased to realise that there are people out there who know what CPTSD and CEN are!). Only difference is that I have a sibling, and I can't bring myself to leave without them. So that's a whole other dimension to simply just renting a room for $xxx and moving out. \n\nI think my advice is the same as everyone's here... limit the time spent at home/ in contact with them. Draw boundaries where possible and safe, speak clear simple sentences to parents so they're a bit less likely to twist your words, never tell them about things that they could use against you (e.g. your interests, hobbies, something nice you bought for yourself).

One landlord was an old lady who really took care of my colleague and even cooked meals for her. As you're a female, it might be easier to rent from a small family or from another lady. Do have a few months worth of rental saved up before you move out. You can also get free 2nd hand furniture from Facebook groups or carousell. A room costs $500-$700 depending on your location, so if you have a decent paying job you should be ok covering it while saving up. \n\nOnce the world opens up and covid is a thing of the past, you can also look into working overseas. On cruise ships for example or doing a stint in another country (e.g teaching). Lodging will be provided and you will save on rent. Not to mention you'll be able to broaden your horizons!

If a family member friend is depressed, be there for them and help them! \n\nHowever, personality disorders like SPD and NPD are different from mood disorders and are handled differently. You rarely hear psychologists advise people to confront, help, or stick around a narcissistic family member or friend. It sounds a bit heartless, but psychologists give this advice for a reason (a quick google search will explain it better than i can) \n\n2) Therapy typically requires willing participation. Also, SPD/NDP are notoriously difficult to treat because of the very nature of those disorders.\n\n3) Taking responsibility for my parents’ mental health is too heavy a burden for me at my current stage of life. I’m still trying to recover from my experiences and sort myself out (I really don’t want to turn out like my parents).

While in some cases, that\'s fine, but there are others where the parents become too feeble to take care of themselves and get put in some old folks\' home, despite having multiple kids. Some of them die, orphaned by their kids. This to me, is just disheartening and soul-crushing. While in this case her parents haven\'t necessarily been any good to her, I\'ve always felt the need to ask myself ""what kind of a child am I if I can\'t take care of my parents when in their old age, when they are weak and prone to ailments, as they have taken care of me when I was young, and unable to attend to my own needs?""\n\nThis is why I try to get people to consider, not moving out as a first option.

Isn\'t it EVEN MORE unfortunate for her, as the victim, that nobody else could have given her the help she needed earlier (i.e. getting her out of the situation living and being brought up by toxic parents) that she now has to deal with ""depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD stemming from childhood emotional neglect"", and has to continue to suffer ""living with my parents is bad for my mental health AND my relational health"".\n\nThe very common table flipping to throw a pity party for abusive parents is just disgusting. Will you please, as the abused child, try to understand where your parents are coming from?!!!!\n\nYes, typically abusive parents were abused themselves when they were children, and that\'s why we\'re told to be sympathetic towards their abusive behavior LOL. How about the abused child - they had abusive parents too! Yet somehow they\'ve managed to become aware of the situation and try to claw themselves out of the situation by voicing it out, seeking help, trying to move out, etc. There is NO EXCUSE for abusive parents to behave the way they are just because they were abused themselves when they were little.\n\n> with that said, I do hope that even if you do move out, do check in with your parents from time to time. if you have trauma from emotional neglect (albeit due to your parents), surely you wouldn\'t want them to receive the same treatment from you, would you?\n\nNo, she does not have to do that. In fact, I would recommend the EXACT OPPOSITE. Again, if this were an abusive gf/bf, spouse or friend, you and everyone in society will be telling them to ""BREAKUP/DIVORCE THEIR ASS ASAP AND BLOCK THEM/CUT THEM OUT OF YOUR LIFE"".

It’s a shame that they probably turned out this way because of being neglected themselves and then not having enough mental health awareness to seek help when it wasn’t too late. It’s really sad, and I see it as some kind of generational(?) illness(?) that gets passed down. For this very reason, I won’t be having kids of my own, even though I’m quite good with them. \n\nI don’t think I will neglect my parents ever - I have too much of a sensitive conscience for that kind of stuff - and I intend to be filial to some extent, because I know I wouldn’t be able to sleep well otherwise!', 'I assure you that there\'s tons of people who think just like you, so my annoyance isn\'t directed at you specifically.\n\nI have seen too many people try to encourage adults who were abused as kids to reconcile with their parents because ""they\'re your parents"" and ""they raised you1!1!!!"", while I assure you if it were the bf/gf, spouse or normal friend who abused the person, the same monkeys championing to ""reconcile with your parents"" will be screeching ""BREAK UP AND DIVORCE THEIR ASS, MOVE OUT ASAP"" instead.\n\nI\'m sure the abusive bf/gf, spouse, friend, etc was not all abusive from the start and possibly had times when they were a ""good person"" and ""there for (victim)"", but this is automatically nullified from the moment they were abusive. Why should there be an exception to this for parents?\n\nBUT YOUR PARENTS GAVE BIRTH TO YOU is another toxic meme that\'s spewed far too often. Okay but so what? An abusive person is an abusive person. Doesn\'t matter if they\'re my parents, the president of the United States or God. Again: An abusive person is an abusive person.\n\n> what kind of a child am I if I can\'t take care of my parents when in their old age, when they are weak and prone to ailments, as they have taken care of me when I was young, and unable to attend to my own needs?\n\nYou (and many others) say that you ask yourself this and that abuse victims should also ask themselves this about their abusive parents and LeArN tO aPpReCiAtE tHe GoOd In ThEm, but have you stopped for even one second, before spreading the ~~bullshit~~ gospel of a happy perfect world, to think about what ""care and needs"" the victim\'s parents have given them?\n\nPlease don\'t say ""food, shelter, clothing, education"" because those are BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS FOR CHILDREN which are REQUIRED BY LAW. Meaning the abusive parents WILL have to provide those or they will face possible JAIL TIME.\n\nI quote the lovely gifts that OP\'s parents have bestowed upon her:\n\n* ""They don’t seem to want any personal relationship with me and barely interact with me at home, but when they do, it’s usually verbal abuse (my dad) or invalidation (my mum).""\n* ""...depression, anxiety, and C-PTSD stemming from childhood emotional neglect""\n* ""...living with my parents is bad for my mental health AND my relational health. I think I’d be a much better friend/girlfriend if I lived on my own in a stable environment.""\n\nTelling abuse victims that everything they went through is all OK (BECAUSE LE PARENTS, THEY GAVE BIRTH TO YOU!!!!!!!) is like a punch in the face because you\'ve just invalidated everything that\'s made their life miserable that they\'re trying to escape from. In other words, that makes a person who makes such statements NO BETTER than the abusive parents themselves.', ""I just want to point out that you should not feel obligated to be filial to them. \n\nI also fell into this way of thinking in the past and continued to keep in touch with my father who has several traits of NPD. It took a toll on me despite reduced contact, and I eventually had to cut contact completely. It was really hard, but one of the best decisions I made for myself. \n\nMy father was neglected as a kid too and I really feel sad that he had to go through that. However, this does not excuse him from his behaviours that causes distress to the family. \n\nIt was hard as I was judged by others for cutting contact, but I had to make an effort not to be guilt tripped by people who have little understanding of my situation. \n\nI think of this way. I didn't get to choose my parents. They made the choice to give birth to me, so they should be the one who's responsible for my wellbeing. I'll reciprocate if they were good parents, but they're toxic, then I will not feel bad for leaving. \n\nUltimately, always prioritise yourself and do what's best for yourself. I suggest setting boundaries, and figure out how much contact with them is optimal for yourself."", 'You have such a kind heart OP. Wish I could help you take care of your dog. Hope you can find a friend willing to share an pet-friendly apartment with you. If it is financially-viable, could you board her a couple of months with a friend or boarding house while you settle your own moving out affairs? Ask around. I am helping a neighbour to board a sick stray cat for 6 months now with 3 cats of my own. I’d be ready to help if I had the space.\n\n I do agree with you. Usually for people, or in this case, parents with NPD traits do not see the need to seek help. It’s near to impossible to drag them to therapy even if it was for their their own good. As their child, you either turn out to have NPD traits yourself or an empath. I’m an only child too, but I was way older when I realized my parents had NPD traits. You discovered it when you are young, good for you!\n\n It was soul-crushing, and moving out felt like you could finally breathe. Mental health was 100% better after that. I used to harbour so much resentment and anger. It was always invalidation and criticism aimed towards me, we don’t speak, don’t hug, but now I can visit my parents and be kind to them no matter the past (when they start their toxicity I shut them down quickly excuse myself “have to go somewhere now kthbxbye”). I was deathly afraid it was a generational illness too. Did end up having a child though. Was terrified to be a bad mom but hugs, smiles, music, dance parties, kind loving encouragement and support is rampant in my own home now.']"

Think of it as cancer, where you have to undergo continuous repeated treatment. And sometimes its like acid reflux, where you have to live with it and learn to cope. It\'s not a 1\\~3 session thing, like Flu or some eye surgery where its just go in, get diagnose and then out.\n\nUnless you are feeling rich, or you don\'t care cause parents will be footing the bill entirely, then by all means go private.

So no need to go to IMH or think of IMH as the only choice. Imo, given my personal experience... I would say that IMH only go if you are at serious risk of immediate self harm or a public risk.

Knowing that private practices here are incredibly expensive I thought it would be sensible to request a polyclinic referral to IMH, since they claim to offer talk therapy/counselling (which I what I was looking for anyway) for a fraction of the cost.\n\nIt was a huge mistake. The service was incredibly indiscreet (yelling my name across the reception lobby?), brusque and frankly upsetting. Not gentle with the more vulnerable patients (those strapped to chairs and beds) at all. The therapist in question turned out to be a psychiatrist, who interrupted me after 10 minutes and asked if I needed more sleeping pills (???). She said the most important thing was to take meds and address the physical symptoms of anxiety first before going into the counselling part which unfortunately, I really disagree with. Meds can be incredibly helpful when it comes to treating mental health but I would never start a course without a doctor I trust and who doesn\'t already know my situation inside-out. As impractical as it sounds, I ended up Skypeing in with my former therapist from abroad simply because it felt like a safer environment for me.\n\nThis was a couple of years ago. I\'m much better now and no longer require therapy (yay!) and have been told of many affordable/pro bono/sliding scale services that have been popping up in SG since.

Weak_Assist,o3w9cv,Invisible Burnout,2021-06-20 11:11:14,nus,21233,5,79,"An incoming 3rd-year FASS double major + USP

Academically, I am barely clinging to USP/honours. I am too ashamed to let others know my grades because it would shatter their perception of me and of USP students. As I hear others talk of their results, of SUing B+s and A-s, I sit in silence, taking the true extent of the depravity of my results and academic performance to the grave. Coming from a not so good JC, perhaps I was over ambitious in taking up my academic workload. People are able to(as far as I can tell) have a life and go out on weekday evenings/Friday nights(even during recess reading week where I would be spending almost the entire time buried in work), juggling way more commitments during the semester(both in school and beyond) than me while I study but still can't get anything close to respectable results. Something is not working in my study techniques and I do not think it is due to differences in IQ alone. This is exacerbated by the online year which looks set to continue where Zoom seriously inhibits learning. Motivation is low and at times non-existent. Due to my academic workload, I have instances of 3 midterms in 1 day followed by 2 the next day and finals 5 days back to back. Somewhat unsurprisingly, I failed and have to remod one of those modules and blacked out for another, frustratingly grasping at the pathetic excuse of my understanding of the skills required. Time is running out and I now have to salvage what is left of the ruins

My social life is also non-existent. Despite being involved in leadership positions for 2 activities and having stayed on campus in my 1st AY, I am a social ghost. People (ostensibly) are nice and kind, seemingly welcoming of me( and I am grateful for this), but this is all encompassed in work-related matters. Messages that are non-school or CCA related are almost non-existent and new members/even CCA members who are not frequent are able to socialise and be bonded with the group way better than I could, despite my leadership capacity. Perhaps I give off a ""business only"" feel. Perhaps I am just not sociable(I have long suspected some variant of ASD or schizoid personality disorder or other similar ones but have never had the ability to get tested). These \\has eluded me for years, way before I entered university. To get a sensing of the lack of social life, I can go for more than a week without meeting anyone outside of my immediate family for a meal or any other social activity outside of academics/CCA. This is again exacerbated by the online semester. I enjoy both activities and attempt to put my best into them braving late nights and rushing deadlines to give my all to the activities, but at times I can't help but think that people would rather I not be there. Perhaps I brought this upon myself by taking on what perhaps I could not. Friends are hard enough to make much less significant others(the latter of which I have concluded and accepted with some readiness that my perpetual singleness is ideal for everyone). Even a society initiative fell flat on its face in its attempt to get people of the same majors to bond.Perhaps I have an ingrained human repellent...

As my leadership commitments end and I return to being an ordinary member(if I choose to return), I will disappear into the shadows. In the eyes of some(perhaps many more deep down), the task is done and the instrument's usefulness has expired. Hence, I am to be forgotten and cast aside. If something unfortunate will happen to me, I can somewhat confidently count with my 10 fingers(including my immediate family) the people who will genuinely miss me...Perhaps I give myself too little credit. Perhaps I have no one to blame for this but myself. Perhaps I am just an attention-seeking snowflake.

There are many others who have much less of a social life than you and you just do not see them because they are true phantoms. When comparing our social life to others, we tend to compare to those of social butterflies as they are more prominent and they stand out more to us than those without a social life. Furthermore, we are more likely to take notice of them because of how often we will see them or how often they post on their instagram stories. If this is of any comfort to you, I and many others can go for one year without meeting anyone outside of immediate family for a meal or any other social activity outside of academics/CCA. Just speaking for myself, I haven't even leave my house since summer holidays started and there are many others who are in similar spots. Yes, I do agree friends are hard to make but just put yourself out there and you will find those that you are similar to you. The truth is you don't need many friends and you just need a few friends who are always there for you no matter what happens. There is still a long runway in life so don't get too uptight about what happened in the past 1 or 2 years. Like what many others will say, just focus on working on yourself and take things as they come. And even if you are an attention-seeking snowflake, there is nothing wrong with it.

So now I just do what i like, invest most of my time in my hobbies (all at home, I nvr left home since vacation started actually). Its really hard and psychologically tiring to do things you don't like or are not comfortable with, and even more draining to compare ourselves to others.

A lot of people don’t mind just making friends on these apps. \n\nAll the best, OP!', ""Yup, seconding this. The one year gap to meet some people is true.

I need some advice from seniors who have personally went through or know people who went through a similar situation. I have a few mental disorders and i am currently seeking medical help and therapy and SGH. It has been ongoing since 2020 and i thought it would get better by 2021, but to no avail. My past 5 months in JC have been painful and induces even more stress on me. I am not able to cope with my studies because my brain does not prioritise, let alone think about academics. My biggest concern is my mental health and i have lost motivation to study or do anything. I have not even started studying for MYCTs. For the past 5 months, i missed out on many days of school due to medical appointments and personal refusals to go to school. I think that my subsequent months in JC this year would be the same unless I miraculously recover instantaneously one day, but i doubt so because the therapy requires time.
As such, i am thinking of stopping school now and returning to the same school next year as a JC 1 student. Is this possible? Does it vary for each school?

itsdababyfr,nsxa7g,[Rant] My toxic father and how it's affecting me mentally,2021-06-05 22:45:29,SGExams,77716,12,63,"Haiz, there's so many things that I wanna get off my chest. First off, growing up I'm a really anxious kid, in fact I have GAD (generalized anxiety disorder). I've been coping well though, until Covid-19 hits, which is also the year my O Levels.

Everything just went downhill from there. I used to play basketball because it gets me into the zone and not be anxious, however once covid start, I basically can't play it anymore causing me to exercise less often. 2020 was hell to my mental state of mind, and I was starting to go insane, like literally. There are days when I feel really anxious and to cope this, I will do weird obsessions like touching a part of the wall until it ""felt right"" which may takes like 2 hours (something like OCD but I didn't see a psychiatrist so🤷‍♀️)

Unsurprisingly, I didn't do well for my O Levels, getting a mediocre L1R4 of 15 nett. Till today, I always thought to myself, ""If only I look after my mental health maybe I'll do well. If only...""  After that thought, I almost instantly lose motivation. I could be just doing some work and that thought just enters into my mind, and most of the time I'll just give up and watch tiktok.

Well guess what, MY FATHER HAVE TO ADD SALT TO AN OPEN WOUND. Everytime I would do something considered rebellious or just raise my voice, he will say, quoted "" you know why you flunked your O-Levels? Is because you are not filial and don't respect your elders. I see you liddet confirm fail poly one"" and then proceed to talk about 天在看 and wut not. Walao, why need to talk about the past WHICH I'M TRYING TO FORGET AND MOVE ON, JUST SAY  BE MORE RESPECTFUL CAN LIAO LORH. I wake up feeling great today and had all my work planned, guess what, he said that to me this morning and I didn't do shit today.

Not only that, he is just really toxic as a person. Throughout my childhood till today, he ALWAYS love to trash talk., Saying things like ""Wa you don't know this question you just fail and go ITE "" WTF💀 It works sometimes because it motivates me to work and prove him wrong, but he says that to me during COVID-19, when I fell into the rabbit hole of obsessive and compulsive behaviors.

There's some [research comparing the 2 topics here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paraphilia#Homosexuality_and_non-heterosexuality) you can read about if you're interested, but TLDR; both paraphilia and homosexuality was found to be similar in onset (i.e something in the brain just clicks for you to find attraction for a certain demographic) + that it lasts a lifetime. It's important to note that the study concluded that they belong to 2 different categories.\n\nto be perfectly honestly, i'm not equipped to dive into a discourse about moral and ethics here so i shan't lol. From the way i view the subject of sex - it boils down to a simple concept of consent. Are both parties of age (i.e capable of making sound decisions about their bodies)? Are both parties willing?"", 'Fair enough and I agree on the issue of consent.\nLike I said, I only asked this question because I found it intriguing that the only thing the pro and against LGBT parties seem to agree on here or elsewhere is that pedophilia is disgusting - although they speak of being marginalised themselves for something they consider out of their control.']"

If anyone knows any school staff that I can contact to ask, that would be great too! Thank you :)

Hello! Am a freshie matriculating into psychology this year! 

Was looking at the courses offered by NTU Psychology, before making my decision I was enticed by many HP3xxx modules offered, especially those related to developmental psychology. However, after accepting the offer and discovering the NTU class schedule website, I found that the HP3xxx modules are a bit,,,, sparse??? Compared to what’s listed on NTU’s official website at least. 

I’m interested in:

- HP3602: Reading Development Disorders

- HP3603: Sensation and Perception

- HP3001: Learning and Behavioural Analysis

They are still listed on the Psychology curriculum on NTU’s website, but I can’t find any mention of them being taught in at least the past 2 years. I know I can’t do anything about it now but I would appreciate knowing if I’ve been scammed into thinking NTU’s psychology curriculum had what I wanted LOL. 

Does anyone on this sub have any idea if these courses are still being taught? 

Really hope I don’t have to fight for places in crazy popular modules that I’m not that interested in, like social and criminal psychology, or be forced into taking my pick of a strangely wide variety of animal related psychology modules (they kinda relate with social psychology I suppose, but still weird).

I do not personally have much experience with IMH / public mental healthcare in Singapore, so would appreciate if anyone has some answers for these questions:

1) how long is the waiting time at IMH?
2) do you think that the boomer generation have lots of undiagnosed mental conditions or trauma because perhaps mental health awareness isn’t as common back then? Thoughts?
3) just wanted to gather stories / accounts of any experiences at IMH. Was it good? Did you feel safe and understood?
4) if one does not have a mental health condition, but is going through a tough time, will they be eligible for public mental healthcare (ie. to see a therapist through our public system) as private therapists are much more expensive?

Like my aunt told me she was raped by my uncle, and it was a somewhat common occurrence for big families back then. No idea the validity of the claim.\n\n3) I suffered from ADHD, I recall the doctors I met inform me they couldn't do much to assist me other then asking me to read self-help books (lmao) and unwillingness to assist further.\n\n4) Honestly, if I have the financial stability and the time. I would want to get properly treated. Mental health is long term process, and almost all appointments occurred during the weekdays which proven to be extremely difficult to inform my employer. I noticed even with subsidy, medication related to mental health are much more expensive.\n\nWhile Singaporean healthcare is decent and affordable for general disorders.

It is not about awareness of mental health - perhaps it could be dementia or the echo chamber of seniors’ WhatsApp messages (I find that super scary). \n\n4.

Mental illness is something both of my parents couldn\'t fully grasp since my diagnosis back in 2009.  they also think that all mental illnesses are just depression.  My SO\'s mom obviously has bipolar disorder that left untreated since her postpartum depression. she literally walked out from the family one day and never return. no one knows where she is, the only thing we know is that she is still alive and she stopped treatment in IMH. \n3. I had psychiatric treatment in NUH, SGH and IMH. and frankly speaking, IMH has the best treatment in both psychiatric and psychology department. it was in IMH that I got my diagnosis ""clearly"". however, inpatient in IMH is the worst bc I stayed in general ward before and IT WAS HORRIBLE! haha. they do have mood disorder clinic which is better than the general ward. I didn\'t stayed in the mood disorder clinic bc I wasn\'t qualified but my friend did. \n4. usually they can go to the polyclinic and get a referral letter to see a psychiatrist in IMH. but the GP will tell them to try the psychologist in polyclinic first if possible. and usually it takes some time to get an appointment. It is not as easy to see the psychologist in imh as well. patient have to go through a psychiatrist before a psychologist. patient usually have to go through the first session which lasted about 20 minutes to evaluate which therapy best suited for them and whether if they suit a psychologist or a counsellor. there are a couple of counselling services that charge slightly cheaper and affordable like clarity counselling and Shan you counselling centre. \n\nI hope this helps.', '1.

They just don’t want patients/staff to get hurt so they will restrain the patient. Normally restraining is the last resort. \nOutpatient wise, pretty much the same.

To those with social anxiety, how did you fare in school?",2021-04-17 12:02:31,SGExams,77716,40,223,"Hello r/SGExams, I have been reading a book about social anxiety and it really showed me that people really have it worse and are often pushed aside or not really thought about it especially in schools. 

Disclaimer: I'm just putting my thoughts as what I have learnt about the anxiety people face and wish to produce a discussion here as I believe learning about the people around you helps you to be a better person in general. There is a tl;dr at the end  


**We all have some level of Social Anxiety**

That feeling of ""damn, shit. I'm nervous, what if I screw this up"" , the sudden increase in heart rate as you are asked to do something or worse present in front of class. 

The common advice we hear is to not just step out of the comfort zone and put yourself out there and most people can do that just fine. But there is that group unheard, and usually unnoticed. The super quiet type, not because they don't like people and don't like to talk but their brain is constantly scaring them from making the smallest step in interacting with people. Those are the ones with Social Anxiety Disorder or SAD for short.   


I kinda feel bad for these group of people cause I didn't really learn about them in school and who knows the people around you that are actually suffering from it. 

&#x200B;

**Shy/ Introvert vs Socially Anxious** 

It's very common to label these people or just shy or introverted because it is more likely. 

Introversion does not equal shy. Introvert gain energy through social interactions, if you feel tired after talking to people you are most likely introverted. You can be the most confident person in the room but also be the introverted one depending on your ""social battery"" 

Shy people are those who feel uncomfortable being nudged into social interaction, be it the presentation in front of the class or even feeling lost during conversation with friends because you feel like you have nothing to say.  But for one, they usually have experiences of being comfortable socially in their very close friend groups.

Those suffering with SAD are what I would like to call the socially anxious. They seem to experience anxiety in a very strong level.  The very strong feeling of what the average person might feel. They can find themselves thinking about a social interaction that day for the whole night, or getting a strong panic feeling once being put in a place where they have to speak up. 

I can't begin to imagine what it was like to have that feeling as I learn more about the disorder and what some may face. If you don't have social anxiety, imagine the heart racing feeling you might experience times 10. And having your own inner thoughts constantly judging you and thinking you will fail if you do something as simple as asking the time. 

If you think you might have SAD, do look up the [DSM-5 criteria of diagnosis](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/social-anxiety-disorder-(social-phobia)-dsm--5-300.23-(f40.10)).

**What can we do to help?** 

I believe the first step in just being a humane person is to just accept and acknowledge these people and not increase their feeling of constantly being judged by people. 

Don't ask ""Why are you so quiet"" that everyone hates hearing. If you do care about them, just ask how they're feeling genuinely

If you are friends with any shy/social anxious person, do acknowledge their attempts at interaction. To just acknowledge what they say if you hear it and not interrupt them and further push back their attempts socially. 

&#x200B;

**What can schools do?** 

I do believe when teachers encourage students to improve their public speaking skills or interacting with group mates in lessons is very important. However, it must be done in a way that is inclusive while lending a hand to people who really feel uncomfortable. 

Exposure to social anxiety is important (and mental health in general) To those unaffected, it will never cross their minds to believe that someone could be so anxious that they want to never speak. 

Lastly, teachers need to be aware that there might be people who are struggling and they really need the helping hand to push forward in their lives. Young teens may not even realise that they have a problem until it becomes too late.

&#x200B;

**Things to think about**

Can you think of people around you that may have struggled with their social anxiety. 

Have you struggle with your own level of social anxiety? 

Is your level of social anxiety too much to handle? If so, find help in any way you can (friend or a trusted adult)

&#x200B;

tl:dr Social anxiety is something everyone faces but there are some that are unable to handle the load on their mental health and I believe learning about it can bring about better inclusion with others around you. So do check in on the people you care about; including yourself.",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/msjmdg/o_levelspoly_discussing_social_anxiety_in_schools/,"[""Thanks so much if you read all of it, I do believe that mental health and the various conditions people may have is something our education system has to work on to improve the lives of the future generation.

I'm shy/introvert but I still want to talk to people but it's just so hard to express myself to friends until recently. I'm totally fine with my family though.\n\n**[Primary School]**\n\nIn primary school, everyone just feel so scary to me and Idk what my mind was thinking back then. I wanted to talk and make new friends, but I can't because I lack the confidence to approach. There were some kind classmates who either talked to me occasionally or once in a blue moon. But I can't help but feel like it's out of pity because no one else seemed to approach me. When my teacher gave me a high leadership role in class (ideky..), I hated it. \n\nI knew I wouldn't be able to do well and I wish people can just talk loudly, act normally like how they do with others but whenever I talked to the class, it was really quiet. I understand, they were just paying attention to this classmate who rarely talks but I don't like the silence. I'm happy though that sometimes, me and 1/2 classmates would go home together and just talk about our day. It seemed like that's the only time I feel like I can talk the most casually. Otherwise, there were actually days when I go to school speaking only a few words or sentences. Somehow, I managed to do well in school though but it feels kinda sad that my achievements was probably what people remember me for. Unlike many people who looked forward to school to see their friends, the lack of friends and social interaction made me look forward to school because of the teachers and the joy of learning.\n\n**[Secondary school]**\n\nSecondary school was much better though, especially in Upper Sec. Probably because I entered secondary level with the mindset of wanting to be more confident in talking to people and making friends. I like observing my class a lot, since I was at a seat whereby I can see what is happening around. It was to the point I know the character traits/personality of my classmates just through observing. Even if I didn't talk to them, it's as if I talk to them because I observe their interactions with others.\n\nSecondary school had a few group work tasks, so I guess that kinda helped me to be given the opportunity to talk? I realised I'm better talking in smaller groups but can barely handle it talking in a big crowd like in front of a class.\n\nIn Lower Sec, it was first time asking if I can join a group and it felt heavy doing it because I was scared of being rejected. But they gladly welcomed me and that might have had a positive impact. I also became good friends with one of them and probably the first person I hang out with after school hours. Though I don't like some of my classmate's personality, I'd rather be with them than any of my primary school classes since they seem more willing to approach this classmate. But I hated it whenever I'm seated beside someone whom I have no confidence to talk to and it's unbearably awkward when other seatmates can talk to each other normally and then there's me. It's not like I don't want to talk, I just don't know how to start a conversation and probably my seatmate didn't know how to either.\n\nIn Upper Sec, it was a smaller class but it feels more bonded though I hated some of their rowdiness. I feel more comfortable in this class and I'd say though I'm not exactly close with most of them and of course there's still awkwardnes to a degree. But most of them were a bunch of people who were willing to talk to anyone and act like themselves regardless of your personality. They'd be the ones starting a conversation first, which helps me to also carry on the conversation casually. There were many funny moments with my seatmates and also classmates approaching me for help in a subject (since I was one of the few in class who does very well in the subject) gave me the confidence to talk and help them. Man, I even put in extra effort to make notes that could explain the concepts in a much more simplified manner (since textbooks can be long winded and the English too chim to grasp). Just for them. And the look of relief when they finally understood the concept or question is an immense joy to me.\n\nI also made friends whom I occassionally contact or hang out with even after graduation. My Upper Sec teachers were also very nice and I appreciate the attention they give me though I feel very bad whenever I screwed up by not finishing my homework.\n\nBut outside of my form class, I still experienced this fear though and lowkey isolated myself whenever it's mother tongue time. Ideky, my batch of mother tongue classmates are probably some of the nicest and least problematic out there but I have this unreasonable fear of talking to them. They're mostly introverted too and well-mannered but we only talked occasionally and outside of class discussion, no one except for one or two seemed to talk or approach me. Whenever we wait to enter the class, I always feel very awkward because everyone else seem comfortable with each other and then there's me. Tbh I come to mother tongue class looking forward to my teachers and some funny classmates (imagine if they weren't there, my day would feel so boring 😩).\n\n**[TERTIARY]**\n\nI feel like it was back to square one in trying to gain confidence but at least I made some friends. But seriously, my fear of talking to people came back again though it wasn't as bad as primary school. I was more confident in talking to my CCA friends than my classmates and when I told my CCA friend that I'm not confident in talking, she was surprised because I seemed talkative/confident to her. \n\nI just have that fear of rejection or being talked over, that's why I rather do things alone not because I don't want to be with people, but the negative assumption of people (ignoring me) that I had in my mind, makes me rather be alone. Whenever I'm in groups, I feel like a filler member because the lack of confidence somewhat affected my willingness to put in more effort. I wasn't a confident speaker like the rest but I did try to practice rehearsing more and my groupmates did compliment everyone's effort no matter how good or bad we turn out, so that kinda gives me strength in a way though I still feel bad for them. \n\nI hated it whenever we have those personality or character traits game since my classmates don't know me at all since we rarely talked outside group assignmemts and we weren't too comfortable with each other. I was barely involved in the game and it was unbearable for me since I just put on a smile that was lowkey shivering just because I don't want to look aloof. \n\nBut somehow, in my last year of school, I managed to break out of my shell and got more confident in speaking. Thanks to a Kpop group lol. You might want to check out my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/mqrrm7/its_cravitys_1st_anniversary_and_i_have_many/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on how it helped me become more confident in speaking, writing and expressing myself. But all these years since primary school, Kpop has always been my coping mechanism after a day of dealing with unbearable awkwardness in school. But I'd also thank my groupmates too for finally wanting to put in more effort to know each other especiallly since we went through so much difficulties together."", 'I teared up bc i felt so heard. \n\nI feel like my social anxiety is a result of build-up over the years and it got more evident?/worse when i got to my tertiary education. The school i went to requires a lot of group work, interactions and presentations and it stresses me out bc i am not good at talking and voicing my opinions in the first place. I feel like it’s bad luck for people to have me in their teams. \n\nI’ve received a lot of feedback from teachers telling me to interact with my teammates more or made me feel that my part of the presentation was lacking. As a result my grades and gpa dropped and i skipped school as a form of avoidance which made my gpa dropped even more. Which is kind of awful bc i did wanted to go to uni but considering my gpa now i don’t think i can make it. I wasn’t eating in school and my weight got to 3x.xkg. I thought i would be able to manage getting through but some things happened (in school and outside) I ended up taking 2 sems off. I ran out of class one day to go to the student care center and cried a lot trying to calm myself down and the counsellor offered to hook me up with a one-time psychiatrist to help me. From there i met my current psychiatrist and psychologist and i’m currently receiving help and going for cbt sessions! \n\nI’m not sure if my friends know about this or not bc i’ve never spoke about this to them before. \n\nI hope more places and people have this awareness... i don’t really want to hear people asking why i am being so quiet and calling me antisocial and other instances and yet i don’t know how to explain to them or tell them', ""Hmmm as a more outgoing and wild person my advice for those who struggle in groupwork is to observe who are the better ppl to work with.

I just kept pushing myself to talk and socialise in Poly. The key mindset is that everyone is new and is learning in life so they are very similar to you. With that mindset I just forced myself to interact during Poly orientation and it turned out fairly well', 'I had always been quite a socially reclusive kid. From my primary to secondary school years I had always tried to mask it with confidence and nonchalance whenever I feel it creeping on me. Remembering the nausea, panic and stress that I went though trying to keep up my fake confidence and not wanting people to make fun of me. \n\nTo keep up this confidence I kind of turned to substances to quiet the doubts in my head but I think I just came out more fucked even after being sober because I never really learned how to cope with people staring at me weirdly and thinking that everyone is using me/hates me/gossiping about me because whenever that happens I just get high or drunk. Now I have no shield and it\'s getting pretty scary. \n\nI guess in my brain I thought of how much people hated me whenever I went to school. I always skipped school because I was bullied/teased quite a bit. I also never went for any camps or excursions because I didn\'t want to be around people/ sleep with strangers in the same tent in a foreign place because I was probably going to do something stupid to make them hate me.\n\nWith presentations. They sucked I remmeber I cried during my first presentation because I was so nervous and was shaking so hard. I still do this but on a lesser degree, I try to keep my deliveries confident but the only difference between now and then was that I don\'t cry anymore lol. But whenever I\'m up there presenting. The guy in my brain is like ""hey you fucking idiot, people are judging you for your shaky voice. You sound so stupid and uncredible, how do you even expect people to think you researched what you are saying if you can\'t even deliver it correctly?"" And I start to panic live with classmates watching. \n\nI got frequent anxiety attacks in school, I usually masked it quite not decently. When I have a attack I get extremely quiet and kind of catatonic? I don\'t speak or move until my brain stops buzzing, even when someone speaks to me. \n\nI find my whole ordeal quite hilarious because due to this I was too afraid to talk to anyone about how I was feeling. I had never been to a counsellor because that situation of being alone with a stranger to talk about my deepest problems isn\'t something I want to experience. Also thinking of going to therapy after I get a stable job with enough funding but I also don\'t want to go to my GP and tell them I need a referral. So I just live with it. I don\'t know if I\'m getting better but I pray it\'s just a chemical imbalance so I\'m waiting til my early 20\'s after my brain developed and my hormones calm down if I would be better. Because that\'s literately my only hope for the future rn.', 'I started showing symptoms of SAD in late 2016, self-diagnosed myself and had a psychiatrist confirm my diagnosis in 2017 (Sec 1) and as of 2019 I no longer have SAD. Here\'s what I have to share: \n\nTo start off, I\'m not a very sociable person. I frequently have trouble with social interactions. Sure I have some close friends, but most of the time I\'m pretty awkward when I interact with others. My psychiatrist said I might be on the spectrum, but I haven\'t been officially diagnosed. So I was (still am) slightly anxious when interacting with others. \n\nI think the incident which triggered for my social anxiety was when I was shouted at by my father\xa0 at lvl 1 of a shopping centre atrium(?) of a shopping centre for around 20 seconds (he had every right to scold me in that case, but he didn\'t have to shout). Everyone from the 1st to 5th story was looking at me. I\'m not gonna elaborate on the amount of humiliation I felt that day. \n\nSince then, I started to become extremely self conscious about everything I did. I was afraid of people\'s judgement of me based on everyday stuff like: \n\n• How fast I was walking (afraid I was walking too fast or too slow)\n• My speech (I sometimes speak too fast and mess up my pronunciation as a result)\n•Which part of the corridor or pathway I was walking on (whether I was too close to the edge or the centre, especially when someone else was walking towards me from the opposite direction)\n• Where I positioned myself when on the bus/MRT (I was usually standing)\n• The way I had to ask other people to make way for me to alight the bus/MRT when it was packed\n• The way I ordered food at the canteen\n• Any and all other actions I did during social interactions \n\nI started having anxiety whenever I left my house. The anxiety I was feeling was even more extreme when I was in school, since repeated interactions with people in school meant that I was more likely to be judged, and that people were more likely to remember any ""stupid"". things I did. To be fair, I\'m sort of a judgemental person, and I remember little details or actions people have done for years. So at that time I felt that my fear of being judged was justified. \n\nWhenever I was anxious, my heart would beat really fast,\xa0 I would sweat a lot and get sweaty palms, and my thoughts would be completely focused on what was causing the anxiety and I would have trouble getting a clear train of thought. I would mess up my speech even more than before. In extreme cases, I would have a mental breakdown and cry. \n\nMy social anxiety was at its highest in 2017, the year when Secondary school started. Orientation was pretty tough for me, since I knew no one in my class, and only had 3 people from my primary school (who I wasn\'t friends with) in sec school. I had anxiety throughout the orientation programme, especially during activities like sharing about myself, ice breakers, stage performance etc etc. I was afraid of asking questions in class and didn\'t seek consultation with teachers because I feared that I would waste my teacher and classmates\' time, and that people would resent me for it. I also had fear of talking to others, since I couldn\'t pronounce some words clearly and people had to ask me to repeat what I was saying (I was\xa0 recommended by a few people to go for speech therapy, that shows how bad my speech is). I hardly contributed during group discussions and project work out of fear of being judged for giving a stupid input. I was anxious while queuing up and ordering food because of my speech problem and how it would delay people waiting for their food. I feared PE lessons because I had poor performance in sports. PE games really spiked my anxiety because I was bad at some games and made my team lose. \n\nI thought that this level of anxiety was normal for people, and never discussed it with anyone. Sometime that year, I started realising that this anxiety was not normal and not everyone had such high levels of anxiety that I had. I searched up my symptoms and found out about SAD. A few weeks later, I had an anxiety attack in a movie theater that made me cry in the theater. I finally told my parents about my symptoms and asked for medical assistance. \n\nI went to the Child Guidance Clinic and was officially diagnosed with SAD. There, my psychiatrist gave me plenty of insight and advice, which allowed me to ""cure"" my SAD. \n\nFirstly, she told me that most people don\'t really judge you. Most people will forget any ""dumb"" thing you did in a day or two. And as for the judgmental people, she said that the judgment didn\'t matter. So what if people judge you? Why do you have to care about their judgement of you? How would it personally affect you? As I started thinking about it, I started realising that the judgement didn\'t really matter. \n\nThere was also the issue of my confidence. Being more confident really helps in reducing anxiety. One of the ways to boost confidence is to have proper body posture for something like walking. I started taking slightly longer strides, looking straight ahead at eye level instead of looking down, allowing my arms to move naturally instead of keeping them stiff at my sides, and walking at a pace that I was comfortable with. ""Facing your fears"" is also another way to improve your confidence, so I started getting consultations with teachers, then eventually progressed to asking questions in class when I needed help. I started speaking up more in class, giving more inputs during discussions and eventually managed to lead a few discussions in group/project work. But this exposure to our fears must be paced properly. You can\'t expect someone who has SAD to transform from speaking one or two lines for a group presentation to making speeches during school assembly in a few days. \n\nIt\'s important to have a support system as well. I shared my fears or any ""incidents"" with my parents and they supported me thoughout this part of my life. I also had a close friend in school who supported me. He frequently gave me advice on what to do in social interactions and helped me whenever I had an anxiety spike. \n\nEventually, I cared less about people\'s judgement, became more confident, and with support of family, friends and my psychiatrist, I no longer have SAD. I\'m still more anxious than most people when interacting with unfamiliar people, when being awkward in social interactions, and whenever I have group presentations. But I no longer have extreme anxiety and I\'m not afraid of leaving the house anymore. \n\nMy essay writing skills aren\'t the best and I didn\'t really proofread, so I hope that I wasn\'t too long-winded and that this helps anyone who\'s reading this!', 'Thank you for making this post\n\nI struggle with social anxiety and i used to be unable to post/write online due to anxiety. Texting was also bad for me especially texting to people I\'m not close with. (F2F is still bad even now) surprisingly multiplayer games with chats helped me to be able to slowly overcome my anxiety to type/post online since sometimes you meet people who likes to chat. (Being anonymous on the internet helped a lot)\n\nWhen I was in primary/secondary school I would usually skip if I\'m late for school. I guess I did ok in primary/secondary since I was able to graduate and go to a school/course in poly I wanted 😅\n\nThings like talking to teachers is also hard so most of the time I wouldn\'t ask for consultations unless I went with a friend. If I didn\'t know something I would just google or ask my friends. (Presentation sucks)\n\nI couldn\'t really ask help from my parents (and they are quite dismissive of what I\'m facing lmao) or friends cause like what you said they aren\'t familiar with mental health issues.\n\nI can\'t go to imh and get clincially diagnosed either since that required my parents knowing about it. So I\'m stuck with conselling (still good tho but no meds)\n\nEither way I did get help recently in the end but I wish more people were educated about mental health because if someone really thinks that they have issues what they are experiencing would be dismissed as ""oh that\'s normal"" ""nah you\'re just shy"" etcc and in the end they never receive help or just doesn\'t look for help since the person thinks they themselves are overreacting and that they don\'t need help.\n Source: me who struggled many years and not realising it wasn\'t just shyness\n\nSorry if it\'s a long comment', 'After seeing your insightful discussion about social anxiety, I really wish there were more people especially lecturers in polytechnic would be more understanding to people with social anxiety participating in class discussion. Personally I see my level of anxiety as pretty high as I was diagnosed with severe anxiety consisting of social anxiety and GAD. I would say participating in class has been really rare as the anxiousness and struggle to not breakdown and have an anxiety attack without thinking others are looking/judging is really hard.I would not continue with the details but everyday is just constant panic.As a freshman in my Polytechnic,my polytechnic emphasises on participating everyday for my class discussion for my daily grade,and I didn\'t write my diagnosis in filling out my details because I wanted to prove to myself that people who struggle can do it too or be even better.But with this invalidating doubt from others about mental illness especially some adults , it still is hard voicing about our mental health.Even with the notion ""you aren\'t alone"" , have we actually lend a listening ear and extensive care to someone who is alone and suffering , of course they are busy but this notion is hypocritical. But I agree with what teachers/lecturers can do to help students with social anxiety but I\'m just curious if the implication of you have to act like "" you\'re a business person"" have forcefully kicked mental health out of the picture as Im from a business course and I would like to hear your insight from it . But lastly i appreciate you speaking out on these issues so that people with anxiety has a voice to look out to, with that thank you :)', 'Hi, i\'m personally in uni rn, and I still face the same issue. Last time I used to be a girl who would stay silent and stand in front of the class when the teacher asks me to present.\n\nThe increase in heartbeat and anxiety attacks still happens for me despite the years of presentation experience. I try to ignore them while presenting, and just make sure I know what i\'m saying. \n\nIf you realise, most presenters do mess up when they are presenting, followed by a, ""sorry I meant this not that."" Realising this helped me put a lot less pressure on myself. It\'s the realisation that it\'s not only okay to screw up but it\'s perfectly normal. No presentations go perfectly. People honestly don\'t care about a minor blunder or you saying the wrong thing (even a major blunder is excusable sometimes) as long as you correct it afterwards.\n\nHowever, even though I say all these, my friends (and definitely the audience) can still hear my nervousness from across the room. My voice trembles when I speak, and my whole body also starts trembling. I\'ve learnt to tell myself it\'s okay to have my anxiety attacks, don\'t let it get the better of you. Let it happen and live with it, don\'t need to try to get rid of it! So every presentation now has me with a trembly voice - but imo if i present the content necessary, it\'s a success!', 'Thanks so much for this post. For 18 years of my life, I thought that I was just shy or introverted, but turns out I just have social anxiety (undiagnosed). Gotta thank social media for this one.\n\nI remember that in Pri 1 you had a lunch buddy for a few weeks, and despite my head saying ""talk to him! just say what you\'re thinking!"", nothing came out. It felt like a knot in my throat, and I never managed to say a word to him at all. He asked me what I\'d like to eat for two or three days and I stared back at him, and then he just gave up. I felt really bad but happy when he finally left me alone, as I couldn\'t order any food with him following me everywhere.\n\nThe same thing happened when I had a buddy when I was Pri 3. She asked me how to pay sixty cents to one of the stalls, and I could only stare back at her despite me wanting to answer her. I felt so guilty that I couldn\'t give her a reply.\n\nIn school, whenever the teacher students to each read one line of a paragraph according to the seating plan, I would count the number of students and try to find the line that I was supposed to read, and practice it multiple times in my head. It was worse when you had to stand up in class, because it felt like everyone was staring and judging you. It felt like I was in an unwanted spotlight. If you could leave after finishing a test, I would wait for someone (or two, or three) students to submit their papers before I dared to submit mine. Social anxiety also made me be more prepared. I would bring all the pens and tools I needed (eg. curve ruler, graph paper) so that I didn\'t need to ask from anyone (cause I can\'t).\n\nI don\'t really know how I got over a big 50% of it since then, but I can order food outside now, and ask strangers for directions instead of relying on signs and gut feeling before GPS was available (only when I REALLY can\'t find my way though), and being able to contribute in group discussions (still shuts down when I feel unwanted or unneeded though). I\'ve also noticed that my heart gets pumping really fast, hands get sweaty and I subconsciously start shaking my leg a lot before a big thing, eg. interview, presentation, etc., and I notice that my stomach churns and gets upset right before it too (probably a flight response). \n\nI think that before schools can start to help (teachers can be more lenient on such students), governments should educate on social anxiety and other mental health related issues. The lack of education in areas that play such a prevalent part in our lives can affect the way teens feel about themselves, rob them of opportunities since no help is sought, and in serious cases, be life-threatening.', ""I do not have SAD but am just shy and introverted.\n\nIn Secondary school, I had a small handful of friends that I'm close to. It also helps that my teachers don't call on me that much to talk in front of the class.\n\nIn poly though, I had to make new friends, which wasn't easy at the start since I was quite the loner. Especially before I had a group of friends that always form a team for teamwork. Getting the courage to talk to people to ask if they have a slot for me was nerve-wracking. As for presentations, it was the worst. Be it in person and in front of the laptop, they are both things I can't deal with.

I didn’t really realise that I had social anxiety when I was in primary school, but when I found out that I had social anxiety in sec Sch it only made my anxiety worse. I got more self conscious avoided going out more and when I think back about how I was in primary school, I started to realise that I was literally care free in primary school I did not worry about little things like being worried about getting judge about others like I DID NOT CARE. If u ask me I would literally do anything to go back to my old self, where I literally didn’t care about what others think of me. :) so in sec Sch after I realised I got social anxiety I don’t know why I just started shutting myself out from the world. Simple things like wearing a watch to school changing my hairstyle or wearing a jacket in class when it gets cold, I didn’t dare to do anything. I often reject my friends when they ask me to go out for lunch or dinner etc. I just head back home straight away after school every single day. But sometimes my friends just drag me out that was when I really had no choice. In classes, I was basically in silent mode. I didn’t dare to talk, speak up or ask qns in class. I guess most of my classmates just think that I was an introvert that y. I don’t think my friend suspected a thing since I’m more talkative around her. I took my o level last year and you know that’s when the period where most Teachers will just tell us to look for them during consultation and as expected I didn’t went for any except for one, where I had a few of my friends I’m comfortable with with me.

deenutz98,o1yrxl,Unit MO for medical review with permanent excuses,2021-06-17 22:36:48,NationalServiceSG,11091,4,6,"Hi all,

I was diagnosed with adjustment disorder last year with anxiety by psychiatrist and Unit MO had given me permanent excuse for firearms, stay-in etc. After I was given those perm excuses, I felt that the excuses helped my mental health as an NSF. 
 
Unit MO had referred me for follow-up with PCC but I had yet to go. Was originally scheduled for PCC on April 2021, then made a request to postpone to June 2021 due to work commitments in unit. I have yet to go for PCC as of today. Was supposed to go for the June 2021’s appointment but It got postponed due to P2HA (Phase 2 Heightened Alert). Now my S1 is telling me to head down to my Unit MO for medical review. 

Honestly I am very afraid that they will revoke my perm excuses. Though it has been a year, I still feel anxious and stuffs. You could say I’m trying to feel better but its not that I have “fully recovered”. Now that I am scheduled for medical review by Unit MO, my anxiety is back again and I’m having heart palpitations, lost of appetite and all after I heard that I am scheduled for medical review. 

I honestly hoped that the Unit MO would not revoke my perm excuses and could understand by helping me “live-through” with the excuses I have on hand.",0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/o1yrxl/unit_mo_for_medical_review_with_permanent_excuses/,"['MO cant revoke perm excuses.

AcanthisittaParty986,kwqqdu,[Rant] Transgender Discrimination in Singapore Schools and MOE's denial of mental health issues,2021-01-14 05:44:37,SGExams,77716,306,2793,"Note: I am posting this on a throwaway as I am an active redditor to avoid disclosing my main account containing information that I'd like to not reveal. However, some of you may know who I am.

Having been essentially barred from returning to lessons in my government MOE school, I have become a target of the MOE. To give a bit of background, I am transgender male-to-female, using she/her pronouns. I used to attend an all-boys' primary school and it was the worst period of my life - I couldn't fit in and constantly got bullied because I was 'too soft' and 'needed to man up to the bullies'. Despite being there, I always wanted to dress like girls, have a typical female hairstyle etc. Things took a turn ever since I entered a co-ed secondary school; I started making more friends and understanding my identity. I was then taken to the gender clinic at the IMH. However, since getting a medical diagnosis of gender dysphoria from the IMH, my schooling life in the MOE system has gone from great to utter trash, pretty much forcing me to transfer from my current school to a polytechnic course which is not really ideal and not exactly in line with what ambitions I had in mind.
(Gender dysphoria is listed as a disorder under Gender identity disorders in the ICD-10 by the WHO)

Here's a timeline: ever since getting the diagnosis, I informed the MOE of it through my JC, and the reply from the MOE according to my school's administration was simply that 'This is a new issue and we would like to work with you to learn more about it.'
All was well for several months, though rules were vague given that I had a proper diagnosis from a qualified doctor. My classmates and subject tutors are highly supportive.
Then, as I was about to undergo hormone therapy (a treatment explicitly stated in the ICD-10, again, and recommended by the multiple doctors attending to trans patients in Singapore) the request was suddenly blocked as the MOE had intervened, apparently for the reason 'students in MOE schools are under our control, and we have every right and say over their treatment'. This meant that my doctor had to call off the referral, causing me further mental trauma as this affected my ability to pass and present as a female. Alongside this, I was informed that I had to cut my hair to fit the boys' hairstyle in the handbook, and that I was specifically to wear the male uniform; that could probably have slipped under the radar but it seems unlikely as all these troubles started in the same month. In addition, if I became unable to fit in the boys' uniform if I somehow got hormone therapy, I would be expelled from school, instead of being allowed to wear the female uniform. The principal's explanation for this was that 'due to your presentation, you would be as disruptive to the school environment as a student with severe autism'.

What right does the MOE have over the MOH? Why is the MOE interfering with my medical care, and the irony of [MOE advocating for mental health issues](https://www.moe.gov.sg/news/parliamentary-replies/mental-health). I cannot speak for others, but in my experience, these are outright lies and just a farce to gain support from the younger generations of students.

Update: MOE has posted a complete [denial](https://i.imgur.com/8WcQGMB.png) of this issue on Facebook. That is an outright lie, contradicts what I was told by my doctor, and I am sure my classmates can vouch for me. In addition, they do not respect my pronouns and instead intentionally misgendered me (against the advice and recommendations)",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kwqqdu/rant_transgender_discrimination_in_singapore/,"[""Hi everyone, just a friendly reminder that discussion here should remain civil and not violate the rules of reddit and our subreddit.

Only a parent could have done that. I’m quite well-versed in the medico-legal systems here, and you’d be surprised at how little say MOH has over doctors, let alone MOE. MOH would never intervene directly at the clinician-level, only at the policy-level, they simply don’t have the power. Such things related to treatment goes through SMC, an entirely different independent body. With treatment related issues, MOH makes broad rules in parliament but would never make specific recommendations to overstep SMC’s jurisdiction. Even then, the broad rules are always in consultation with SMC.\n\nAdditionally, while it sounds strange, MOH actually has little control over public hospitals too, other than through broad policy. About 10 years ago, we restructured the system such that all “public” hospitals are in fact private companies. That’s why on official documents they are called “government-restructured” hospitals and not public hospitals anymore.\n\nSo I’m not too sure who or what may have changed the doctor’s mind, but some part of me doubt that it’s MOE/MOH. Unless he’s not really a doctor but a psychologist?\n\n(Fun fact: Lawyers and doctors in Singapore are professions that have been allowed to self-regulate. MOH and Minlaw don’t decide who gets to practice law or Med. Rather, independent bodies SMC and Law Soc get to.

Systems that are outdated for a first world country like Singapore. Where Academics are still prioritized over the mental health of students, rights and individualism just to make things ""Equal"".   \nSingapore\'s community, is the biggest problem when it comes to reforming these old views. Adults who think that LGBTQ something not meant to be and unreasonable. People who think a mental illness is just Crazyness. People who blame the school for bad students when the school has already done everything they could. Parents who think that children will behave if they suffered more. Students forced to believe that ""Academics"" is the only way to please their parents. Teachers who don\'t understand what students want and blame the students for not listening when the class isn\'t productive for the students. We have MPs calling LGBTQ rights a ""Stupid Issue"". A pledge, that promises us free of racism, discrimination. Yet this persists.  \nOur community, for a first world country is very outdated. Everything about the people is outdated. Schools not being schools but places where you\'re forced to study just to get a job. Teachers, unable to understand you and you refusing to understand them back. Schools enforcing ""Handphone management"" without any regards of how important social media is to students. You\'re not suppose to stomp on people until they become what they ""Should be"". I\'m not thanking my school for ""Helping me keep my handphone management better"", I\'m not thanking my school for ""Grooming"", I\'m not thanking my school for ""Being mature"".   \n\n\nI\'m thankful for the teachers that have helped me and supported me along the way, thankful to the friends I had that I otherwise wouldn\'t have had such experiences. I\'m thankful to myself, for enduring these 10 years.\n\nFor 6 years in my primary school, I was known as the ""Trouble maker"". Attacking people whenever I felt upset, getting into all kinds of disciplinary trouble and whatever. I was ""A bad kid"", from their view. During Primary school, I had no proper social skills, I was still living in this fantasy in my head. I didn\'t know how to react, I had ATD, I had extremely unstable emotions. Everyone laughs, everyone blamed, no one to hold my hand properly. Until Secondary School, my teacher understood I had these problems. I was brought to proper counselling, I slowly learnt how to manage anger, manage emotions. I got much much more better... until I got diagnosed with Gender Dysphoria.  \n\n\nI was a good student in secondary school. My hair was short, my uniform was good. I loved helping teachers and everything. I was always the ""Good student"" compared to the old ""trouble maker"" of the past. I\'d help teachers get books, and in return I get their respect and a lot of ""Love"" from them. While yes, I had the pain of living as a corpse. I had no long hair, I had no uniform I could comfortably wear, I had no name which I can smile to, but there was one thing. The only thing that made me happy in times of crisis. My Long Nails. It was such a small thing, that most teachers barely notice it until I actually show it... and when they decide to force me to... my Gender Dysphoria, Autism and Emotional unstability that I was suppose to have fixed (As in maintain/control the reactions) a year ago, came back. I was loyal to this rule system, I helped the teachers, I had all the love for the school and everything. And my loyalty is crushed, shattered. Spat on, just because ""Its my duty to enforce the school rules"". School rules are suppose to be expandable. You can\'t just implement changes after someone breaks down. You\'re not even suppose to let that happen in the first place. A teacher is suppose to be like a parent to students. Youth happens once, only once. Never again. Your freedom, your one time where you\'re not going to be plagued with the worries of adulthood. The School, The System, The Ministry has no respect for it.  \n\n\nAnd honestly, we have no time to ""Wait out"" this kind of change.

The Singapore government in my opinion has the responsibility to ensure the well being and safety of the people, and they do so by:\n\n1. Ensuring contentment of the people. The government wants to make Singapore a nice place for the maximum possible people, even if it means punishing an outspoken minority to placate the majority, rather than having both groups pissed off at them. (See the ban on long hair, escooter ban, censoring of fight scenes in films throughout the 70s, refusal to introduce female conscription)\n\n2. Economic growth. The government aims to make enough money to maintain Singapore\'s status and soft power, even if it means giving in to the rich at times in exchange for them not pulling stuff to ruin the economy and overiding the wishes of the ordinary people (See American Marine, Hydril, Integrated Resorts, our comrade Liew)\n\n3. Maintaining law and order. The government wants to maintain the stability of the country, even if it means punishing an innocent minority as long as they believe it to be an avenue to introduce ideals that threaten to weaken social cohesiveness (see Operation Coldstore and subsequent events during the Malayan emergency)\n\nNow most of the main sources of hostility seems to come from these two groups (not exhaustive):\n\nA: Religious fundamentalists. Not people from any religion, nor a specific religion. Only the fundamentalist portions that like to ram homophobic ideals into their community, and incite other moderates to support them, and a lot of them tends to be rich ppl and Karens considering how religions like Christianity or Taoist cults are seen as status symbols by many. Unfortunately, they have a history of playing around the government stance on religious speech to remain untouchable since the 70s, and they are also actively influencing their own religious communities. However it is a known fact that many of these people keep close relations with questional organisations overseas, in particular fundamentalist groups in the US, and with the recent attack in the US Capitol the government may be more receptive to feedback on the threat they pose to our national security, which was [acknowledged by Shanmugam](https://www.pap.org.sg/news/three-threats-to-singapore/?doing_wp_cron=1610705372.2764470577239990234375)\n\nB: [Older people.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/younger-people-more-liberal-than-older-respondents-polled) In the 1980s there was a HIV pandemic, the government took the opportunity to [demonise the LGBT demographic](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258144619_It\'s_the_Gays\'_Fault_News_and_HIV_as_Weapons_Against_Homosexuality_in_Singapore) perhaps to force through the redevelopment of Bugis, which was already delayed several times since before independence. Unfortunately these means people living through that time period ended up with a bad impression with ""the ah kuas"" especially so when ordinary Singaporeans were still significantly isolated from the rest of the world without internet, and recovering from the anticommunist arrests. Obviously most of them wield a larger amount of influence compared to the more supportive younger people, in Mediacorp, MOH, MOE, MOM, PA, SPH, Mindef etc. Now the government is making a lot of emphasis regarding ""the future of youths”, ”new generation” etc, so we need to convince the government that LGBT acceptance is what the youths wants, unfortunately this will take a long time and is dependent on how much control group A and B has over their children because acceptable rate is still around 49% among 18-25', ""you just don't lol this country is wack asf I'm doing my army shit and leaving asap"", 'If your first response when Trans people are having their rights violated is to whine about SJWs and promise that any change to the status quo will bring violence then it sounds like you are ""you are one of those right wing \'Asian values\' people"" \n\nElectoral politics, especially in socially far right Singapore, has always been a lagging indicator of social norms.  Also you sound like you want people who are currently unrepresented should stay unrepresented and shut up because no one is currently representing them. That is an authoritarian tautology and I really don\'t know why anyone who knows what is good for them would accept it.', 'The answer is yes.

You are not a collective and your view represents neither the majority’s view, nor every single girl/woman’s view.\n\nAs long as a handful of women/girls are uncomfortable, that is enough to warrant discussion and relooking. And bear in mind many would simply NOT voice out their discomfort out of fear of being labeled as hateful, anti-LGBTQ, etc.\n\nFor some context: I was in the house comm from a local uni and a trans-woman was invited by some pro-LGBTQ girls to start using the female toilet in the dorm. There was a campaign and they asked all the girls if anyone objected, no one dared to say it. A month later, there was 6 different complaints made to us in private, about people being uncomfortable and the practice had to be stopped.', ""Now you're assuming it's overwhelming. Even if so (which I highly doubt) what about those who are not supportive? Cast them aside?\n\nEdit: LOL if you don't agree with me you honestly don't have to down vote me 😂😂😂"", 'Legal doesn’t always lead to social approval, where lesbians are a good example for that. Different institutions also have their own rules that can be stricter than Singapore law.\n\nFor trans issues there’s also a lot of ignorance involved, which has led to some of those inconsistencies. For example, the case where a trans woman and her legally wedded wife had their marriage annulled and their HDB flat taken away from them after she changed her legal sex, in direct opposition of Singapore law that says that the marriage of a couple that are legally male and female at the point of marriage is to be considered valid. That was written with trans people in mind, but it was meant to refer to trans people who transition and then marry someone of the opposite legal sex. The idea that some trans people are gay or lesbian and might get married *before* legal transition never crossed their minds.\n\nSimilarly, various statutes in Singapore law mention that for the purposes of the law, trans people who have undergone “a sex change procedure” will be considered the sex they have transitioned to, and that this trumps whatever their IC says. Which has created a whole host of problems where a trans person can be legally one sex but subject to laws for the other sex; for example, trans men who have medically transitioned to male can also be penalized under 377A, even if their IC still says female, while they cannot marry men or women because ROM goes by both IC and appearance.\n\nAnd that mess happened because the people who wrote those statutes wrongly assumed that trans people undergo only one “sex change procedure” - namely genital surgery, which would allow them to change their IC - rather than several as is often the case. Trans men for example would need multiple (expensive) surgeries before qualifying to change IC, and most just have one or two or just go on HRT.\n\nThe laws do not account for that, and is how we also ended up with that case of a trans man who raped a 13 year old several times (she did not know he was trans) and confessed to the crime but could not be charged, because the courts said he was still legally a woman on his IC and women cannot be charged for rape.', 'Your post has been automatically removed for preaching Christianity or other religious content.

The UPR will be a start - we've submitted our report collating the various issues facing trans people to be raised to the govt, along with several recommendations.\n\nWe hope to be able to work with the different ministries to discuss how to best implement those changes for the good of everyone, trans or not. It seems that sometimes people also forget that trans people aren't in isolation - we have families and are part of different communities, and things that hurt us have wider consequences in Singapore society. If a trans person drops out of school due to harassment and then can't find a job due to discrimination and lack of educational qualifications, they can't support their family, and relatives have to bear a higher financial burden. If they're alone and can't support themselves, there's the risk of them turning to crime to survive, and that's bad for everyone. Much of this could have been prevented with a more supportive school system, employers, and social environment.\n\nLikewise, reducing suicide, violence and abuse is always a good thing.\n\nHaving a better understanding of the variety in transition journeys would also hopefully lead to more reasonable criteria for changing legal sex, and that would solve a wide range of problems. As it is, slightly less than 10% of trans people in Singapore we surveyed had managed to change their legal sex, including about half of those who had been on HRT for more than 10 years. This was directly correlated to income level, because only the richest trans people could afford surgery. The poor ones get stuck in a cycle of being unable to get a job to earn money because their IC outs them as trans, but unable to change their IC because they can't afford surgery. \n\nI haven't kept up on the case.

LightBluely,ldd5d3,Still having trauma of bullying when i was in Primary School 11 years ago. Trying to get rid of it.,2021-02-06 02:05:34,singapore,378959,37,197,"How do i say this... As you read the title, yes i still have a trauma over 11 years ago. 

It all started in 2010 - 2011 when i was P5 where one student keeps bullying me for many reason: botak head, nerd, two hair center (my hair can create some sort of a mountain or wifi antenna) and really quiet boy.
That's not all, he push me, choke me, pinch me to the point i don't want to come to school. 

Before you said about asking parents or principles, tbh, i really don't know why. My memory is vivid but all i can remember was scared and coward. 

My parents and teacher did notice this and take action but guess what? It didn't do much. He did stop bullied me for like a few months but when things winded down, he did it again. 

I'm almost 22 now and doing okay but, for some reason that memory just dosen't seem to go away. When i first enlisted NS back in November 2019, i immediately had a trauma flashback after the barber cut my hair. I always covered my head because i was scared of being bullied again. Thankfully they didn't and they helped me calm down saying we all also botak and we can help one another. Shoutout to my platoon btw! 

Anyway, i believe they only way i can get rid of these trauma was confront my bully. I don't have his contact anymore and he moved a long time ago. So the only way was the school reunion. I just hope i can finally rest and stop this fuckin flashback.

My younger bro got bullied a lot in primary school, because he was more “guniang” while most of the other guys like to act gangster. On the outside it was just treated as typical “boys being boys” roughhousing until he finally fractured his arm from being slammed into a wall. \n\nSo the teachers took it seriously, scolded the guys, and they *only stopped doing it when the teachers were looking*. They continued bullying him even when he was literally wearing a cast to school because of them. He didn’t want to go to school anymore. \n\nSo my parents stepped in. My dad roared at the boys so badly in public that they cried. Right afterwards they came around back to bullying my brother again for the humiliation. They threatened that if he told his parents or the teachers again they’d do even worse things than breaking his arm. \n\nI saw snippets of it from the sidelines. I wasn’t supposed to engage in conflict - leave it to the adults right? I saw how it all didn’t work and only emboldened the bullies. I was also scared of them myself so I didn’t dare to step in. But my limit broke after seeing how my parents’ intervention backfired. \n\nSo one day I waited for the teachers to be gone. When they were teasing my brother again, I stepped in and did the same things to them. Grabbed and pushed them around a bit, threatened them a little, tried to act gangster. It was actually quite ridiculous how quickly and easily they got scared just from that. When the teachers came back, the bullies tried to tell on me for bullying them. The teacher scoffed and didn’t believe them since I never got into trouble before (& we were in a cctv blind spot so there was no record besides just the unreliable eye witnesses). \n\nThey didn’t dare to touch my brother again as far as I know, because unlike the teachers and my parents I was in the vicinity of my brother quite a lot more since we went to the same school, had similar timetables & were in the same CCA. I was also on amicable terms with some of the older boys which these bullies looked up to, so when they told their seniors that I intervened they were told to fuck off and to stop messing with my bro :/ (I overheard that convo lol) \n\nAt least I know my bro stopped losing his stationary and shit like in the past. There was also a new target in town so the bullies could change their target quickly - that one’s a whole other story. \n\nWas what I did right? No. I don’t feel proud of having manhandled and threatened someone in that fashion. But it turns out sometimes the dirty method may work better than the right methods, especially when they’ve been exhausted and have only made things worse. It doesn’t resolve the root cause, but at least one victim got away from their bully here. \n\nPsychological bullies... another issue altogether. I was a victim for this and imo it’s worse and way harder to deal with. \n\nAnyway I was just reminiscing.

>Somewhat interesting to note that the death toll was many times higher than the Maria Hertogh riots (18 dead) and the 1964 Race Riots (23 dead in the July riots, 13 in the September riots), two riots that are practically known by all Singaporeans, and which are given considerably more attention in the national curriculum (to demonstrate the fragility of race relations in our multiethnic society). It's quite bewildering to realise that (probably) the deadliest communal conflict that took place in our history involved two groups of people we can barely distinguish (or even care/know enough to do so) today.

My friends ZN (Teochew!) and D had not heard of this and wanted to read the article. Not knowing the best place to archive and share my transcription, I thought that r/singapore was a great place.

THE CHINESE RIOTS.

15 May 1854 

Since noon on Friday the 5th \[ines?\] the town of Singapore has been in a state of riot and disorder, threatened by thousands of the Chinese community; members of different Provinces, or rival Hueys noting hostilely towards each other, while a mass of miscreants avail of the general consternation and local disturbance to plunder the shops of the weak or the defenceless. The Press and Public have for many years requested the interference of the legislature to put down those monster combinations, but without effect: fostered and encouraged under the laissez faire policy of the local and imperial authorities, those fraternities have grown powerful and insolent; they hesitate not to threaten violence, and are known to act in defiance of the law, striking terror into the minds of all. Solicitation and intimidation are employed to swell out their ranks by enlistment of new members, and although originally confined to one class of the population, Chinese, they now include every description of the inhabitant, Europeans excepted--the members of each Huey being bound by a solemn oath to aid each other with money, &c, and if necessary, to sacrifice their lives.

We have witnessed many rows fomented and carried on by Chinese, but the present for boldness, daring character, outrage, and wide spread influence, exceeds all preceding ones. It was currently reported for more than only an occasion to disclose the real intentions and designs of the clamorous and plunder-bent ruffians. An occasion, trifling in itself, was siezed upon for a demonstration. On Friday morning a dispute commenced between some Chinese about a few catties of rice, and in the course of two hours the quarrel was espoused by thousands of the same class of the inhabitants. Apprehensive of a general riot the respectable traders closed their shops, Bands of Chinese, armed with bludgeons, and some with knives, were fighting in several streets of the town, while showers of stones and other missiles were flying in all directions. at 2 P.M. the police Superintendent confessed his inability to suppress the riot, in which at least four or five thousand men were engaged. The work of plunder hand commenced, and reinforcements of men landed from the junks. The military was called out, and paraded the principal thoroughfares were the rioters were most numerous, but the latter cautiously withdrew as soon as the bayonets were visible, and re-assembled as soon as the troops had passed. The Governor, Resident Councillor and the Magistrates walked through the disaffected parts of the town, the combatants retiring from each street before the above gentlemen entered.

&#x200B;

the comparatively deserted state of these thoroughfares and the temporary quiet of the bystanders, lulled the suspicions of the authorities -- the military returned to their barracks. 

&#x200B;

At daylight on Saturday fighting and plunder were resumed, Several defenceless traders' houses and shops were broken open and rifled of their contents. At one place, corner of Phillip Street, the inmates kept up a desultory fire upon the assailants for nearly a quarter of an hour. The police were unable to cope with their assailants, being pretty well fagged out by the exertions of the previous day, and during the night. Some valuable property was saved by the timely interference of a few Europeans. The military were again sent for, but from the humane and somewhat mistaken forbearance of the Executive, they were restricted to parading the principal thoroughfares--the fighting and plundering going on as soon as their backs were turned. At 10 A.M. a circular was sent around convening a meeting of the European inhabitants at noon in the News Room, and in the meantime a deputation waited on the Hon'ble the Governor. His Honor expressed his thanks for the proffered co-operation of the European members of the community, and assured them that the utmost pains would be exerted to suppress the tumult--by the aid of the Police and the Senior Naval Officer, he doubted not that quiet would be restored. The European inhabitants at noon assembled at the News Room, and at once resolved to proceed to volunteer their services as Special Constables : the forthwith preceded to the Police Office, and were there met by the Governor, Resident Councillor, and the Justices of the Peace. His Honor addressed the Europeans present and expressed his heartfelt thanks for the manner in which they had come forward to aid the civil authorities in preserving order; he felt confident that the existing disquietude would soon be removed and order re-assume its dominion. Between sixty and seventy gentlemen, including members of the Bar, the Medical Profession, and all the Merchants who were not Justices of the Peace, offered themselves and were sworn in as Special Constables. During the day more volunteers were sworn in, leaving only some half-dozen European residents who have not qualified. In the afternoon a large party of Marines was landed from the ships of war, and were \[justed?\] at points where their services could be best availed of.

&#x200B;

Saturday night passed without any extraordinary occurrence the troops remaining quarantined in the town, and parties of special constables accompanied by a magistrate patrolling the streets till midnight. The magistrates and special constables were formed in four divisions, each party patrolling in turn. various ugly rumors were afloat, but nothing of moment transpired, the Chinese not being disposed to riot or fight at night time. 

&#x200B;

At 4:00 o'clock on Sunday morning four magistrates and 40 special constables patrolled the streets in which the Chinese reside, but nothing transpired until daylight, when an attempt was made to plunder a house at the corner of circular Rd, which however was timeously prevented by the gentleman patrols. The manifest determination to plunder appears to have awakened the authorities to a full sense of the real character of the riot, and the necessity for more stringent an ultimate measures than had, up to that time, been pursued. The police force was almost prostrate from having been an active an irksome duty for 48 hours, \[and?\] the military tier unless actively employed. In two or three instances a marked resistance was shown to the volunteer patrols, trivial perhaps, except as indicative that the Chinese were disposed to use force with effect, had not judicious means been employed to disperse them promptly. At 6:00 o'clock the Marines were again landed, and took up commanding positions, whilst thereabouts of the ships of war pulled up and down the River, to render service whenever and wherever required. All \[pukats?\] and other Chinese boats--\[receptacles?\] for plunder and shelter for  the rioters--were removed from the river. it was generally reportted, and believed by the well disposed \[pact\] of the Chinese residents, that a determined attempt would be me to plunder the town, but if the idea was entertained the effective measure adopted must have frustrated the design. Most of the shops plundered belonged to persons who had none of their own tribe near, and received not the least help from their neighbours. Under these circumstances the gentlemen patrols removed to places of safety the property of the defenceless and appalled traders. During the day the utmost consternation prevailed. Scores of Chinese removed their property and deserted their swellings, apprehensive of death and rapine; it was sufficed \[…\] clear that they deemed the several localities in the utmost danger.

&#x200B;

In the afternoon of Sunday some Hokien coolies in the employ of Mr. Caldwell proceeded to town to purchase rice : on their return, and when the public road near Caldwell's Bridge, they were attacked and robbed by some Tsin-chew men, but some Hokien men arriving, the Tsin-chew men were worsted, and one of their number killed --some ten or eleven Tsin-chew mean are now in custody charged with highway robbery. After sunset a large party of armed Chinese made their appearance at Rochor, and challenged the Police to fight--they were preceded by a gong; on their refusing to disperse, Constable Berthier fired over their heads, and that having no effect, after due caution, he fired in the midst of them, and one man was shot dead. The night passed in comparative quiet, the Marines and Sepoys of the 43rd M.N.I remaining posted in the town, and gallant Colonel Cameron taking up his temporary quarters at the Police Office.

&#x200B;

On Monday morning many of the shops opened at day-light, and groups of persons were observed perusing a Proclamation posted throughout the town, issued under the direction of the Governor, plainly pointing out to the Chinese community the \[unlawfulness?\] ; of assembling in parties, or doing other acts to violate the public peace, and that such conduct would be met by vigorous measures, perilling their lives. In town, throughout the day, all was quiet, but the rural districts were disturbed. The Military, Marines, and Special Constables continued at their posts.

&#x200B;

Early on Monday information was received that wholesale murders and burning down of houses were going on in Chan Chu Kang district, whither Mr. Deputy Superintendent Cluff proceeded with a police party. The party under the Deputy Superintendent proceeded along Thompson's Road to the thannah at Chan Chu Kang, and on their way there met by a woman, who stated that her husband (the keeper of an opium shop) had been barbarously murdered before her eyes by Chinese, 3 of whom she pointed out; the latter were taken into custody. On their way to the above-mentioned thannah armed Chinese were observed, and increased in numbers as to venture to demand the surrender of the men in custody. The demand was of course refused, nd a rescue was attempted, but observing the abovementioned woman in a palankeen the Chinese endeavored to kill her : a furious assault was made on the palankeen which was literally smashed, Mr. Cluff, however, succeeded in lodging the unfortunate woman safely in the thannah, an attap building. Towards evening the most ugly rumours reached town that Mr. Cluff had been surrounded and ws in imminent danger, whereupon a party of sepoys and some Specials were sent to his assistance. In the meantime the Chinese had received vast \[assessions?\] to their number, and the odds were so great that it was found prudent to release the three men in custody. Mr. Cluff and his party reached town in safety. In other parts of the country scenes of disorder, murder, and robbery were being perpetuated by the Tsin-chew people on the Hokien and vice versa, just as one of the other of these tribes happened to be numerically strong. At Gaylang the village was saved by the timely interference of the Police Jamadar and his peons, who kept up a smart fire un the Chinese retreated. The rural districts were the appearance of the utmost disquietude. 

&#x200B;

On Tuesday, everything in town promised returning quiet. The shops generally were wholly or partially open--except the piece goods traders--and public attention was chiefly directed to the country, which had everywhere assumed a threatening character. Information was received of several robberies, and some murders. The military and the marines continued on their watch, ready to move at a moment's notice. The Magistrates and Specials assembled, and it was resolved, if practicable, to quell the disturbances in the interior. After nine A.M. rumours were current that several thousand Chinese were assembled, armed and ready to attack and pillage the town. The excitement at once increased, and the closing of shops commenced, but there was little cause for apprehensions in town. In the Tanglin district some murders were committed and several houses burned. Immense masses of Chinese, armed, were assembled in rear of Mr. Nicol's Hill, apparently moving towards town. On this day several hundred Malays were placed by the Tumongong under the orders of the executive, as being well adapted to jungle warfare. A number of armed Chinese secreted in a \[baugsall?\] at Tanglin were secured by a party of Specials, under a magistrate; the \[mame?\] party scoured the jungle and performed good service in capturing, killing, and dispersing armed bands. During the day the heat of the sun was most oppressive. One of the Specials, Mr. E Rohde--a German gentleman--was struck down by coup de soleil, and expired in the course of two hours : he was buried on the following day, the Governor and other officials, and all Specials, not on duty, accompanying his remains to the grave. At 9 A.M. a party of Hokien men proceeded to Mr. Davidson's plantation on the Bukit Timah road, and craved protection against a large body of armed men then about one mile distant, waving flags and beating gongs. Justice Davidson with a small party of Specials barricaded the bridge. The armed mass crossed the road into Cluny estate and commenced burning down the Hokien huts. Justice Davidson and party crossed the hill, and cut off the Chinese, who then retreated up the road, but finding the party a small one they halted and fired; the fire was returned and Justice Davidson drove them back as far as Ah Geet's house, where was so large a mass of armed people that Justice Davidson and party retired cautiously, until strengthened by a small police force under Constable Berthier. The attack was renewed, and about 20 men were shot dead ; the Chinese were again driven back to Ah Geet's house, which by the way was prepared for a stout defence. information was despatched to town. On the report reaching town that large masses of Chinese were moving in the direction of town from Bukit Timah, Special Simons and other with party of Malays proceeded thitherward on their way they \[…\] a large party of Specials and police, the later under Deputy Superintendent Cluff; the whole force proceeded to Napier's hill from whence the smoke of burning houses was again in the direction of Bukit Timah. The force separated into two divisions, one proceeding along th Bukit timah Road, an the other by a by-path by means of which the reached the rear of the Chinese force; when near 6 mile stone some of Chinese halted, and then bolted off into the jungle, but the main body moved on in front : the Specials and their party fired; several Chinese fell and their bodies were carried off. A junction was here formed with another party of Specials accompanied by Justices Guthrie and Davidson and Chinese merchant Euchin; a parley ensued, and further firing was desisted from. According to the representations of the Chinese, they, having heard that their friends near Singapore had been murdered, were going to assist their countrymen and to procure rice. After taking away their banners the Chinese were allowed to return to Johore. In the afternoon Special Simons, accompanies by 100 Malays, quitted Caldwell's Thannah and proceeded in the direction of Sirangoon; on their way in three Bangsalls were found the bodies of Chinese whose heads had been taken off. On reaching the big tree in Sirangoon a large party of Chinese was met, armed with muskets and other weapons, who soon scampered off on the force opening fire. The party burned down the village of Sirangoon and returned to town with seven or eight prisoners.

&#x200B;

The only occurrence of note in the town took place behind the Police Office at about 7 o'clock, in Church Street, where the Tsin-Chew and Hokien people reside at opposite sides. On the discharge of musketry being heard Mr. Dunman proceeded with a party of police, who being fired upon from the houses, he read the Riot Act. A party of the 43rd, M.N.I. fired into the houses, which were subsequently entered and arms and prisoners taken therefrom. Special \[Constable? ???\] lost part of his fore-finger by one of the \[…\] the houses. At Telok Ayer an attempt was made to fire the wooden houses in the neighbourhood, but the incendiaries were captured. In Circular Rd, at about 7 o'clock, a Hokien Chinese was picked up by the Specials patrols; his belly was ripped open and his bowels were protruding--this man was carried to Hospital and died shortly afterwards. Some desultory firing took place from some of the houses in town, but no casualty resulted.

&#x200B;

On Wednesday morning there was a meeting of the Magistrates and the leading members of the Tsin-chew and Hokien tribes. The magistrates explained their object in calling them together, and desired them as residents of a British settlement, to aid the Executive in upholding the authority of the law, and by their influence and example to put a stop to the disgraceful scenes which during the last few days had been witnessed. The leading Chinese present promised to exert themselves, and throughout the middle of the day a better feeling was displayed by the town residents. In the country there was much disorder. It was suggested to traverse the island in different directions, and with the view that steamer Hooghly was despatched to Changhae, landing parties at different points en route to act in unison with others who marched by land. One party proceeded to Gaylang, where they found houses had been destroyed and other swellings were being fired--the Chinese dispersed wherever the party appeared; they then proceeded in the direction of Buddoh, to where some stockades were reported to be erected. After crossing the jungle some Chinese were met, and a smart fire opened on them, by which about a dozen were killed and many more were wounded. the party under Colonet Cameron proceeded direct to Buddoh, and then marched two miles beyond that place, where they found a newly constructed stockade, on top of the hill, and placed across the road. the building was a large one, capable of containing at least 500 men; from its commanding position, if vigorously defended, there would have been great loss of life, but happily the miscreants had not time to complete the erection, and were on the point of taking their meals, when the sudden appearance of Colonel Cameron on horseback, at the head of his force, created the utmost consternation in the rebel camp. The Chinese were armed, but fled into the jungle. The troops fired; 2 men were observed crawling away, apparently, wounded, and four were made prisoners. At one corner of the stockade was a raised tower, for the purpose of a look-out. Subjoined is a contemporary description of the stockade in question :--

&#x200B;

""the place where the Chinese were found had a very large attap roof over it, apparently intended for a house which would hold some hundreds of people. Close to it was a new Chinese house made of wood, fiited up in a very neat style, with al the usual accompaniments of a Chinese dwelling, such as an alter, joss, &c. This, it is supposed, was the residence of the leader of the party. In a corner or the large building was found a kind of cage, consisting of two stories, and very strongly constructed, probably intended as a receptacle for the more valuable plunder. A large boiler was found full of rice, which was being cooked, and there was an abundance of fowls, pork, &c, besides two large barrels of \[..rrack?\]. A little further on, on the opposite side of the road, a new house was met with, surrounded by a strong stockade about twelve feet high, and from this and another hut near the number of Chinese were observed to flee into the jungle.""

&#x200B;

The stockade was destroyed, the whole of the building was fired, and no more Chinese being found in the neighbourhood the party returned to town.

&#x200B;

On Thursday the twon was settling down to its ordinary quiet. Many of the shops opened and artificers were seen employed at their several avocations. the party landed from the Hooghly at Changhae walked towards town, as did also the parties, landed at Sirangong and Kranjee without observing anything of much consequence. The latter division encountered a party of armed Chinese, some of whom were shot.

&#x200B;

There was a large party of armed Chinese in the Bukit Timah Road and at Ah Geet's house. A party of Military arrived, upon which the Chinese fled. Arms being found in the house, and its appearnace indicated that it was the Head-quarteres of the rioters in the district, the house was destroyed, and more than 20 prisoners were carried to the police.

&#x200B;

Such was the general impression of these disorders being nearly at an end, that in the afternoon of Thursday the Specials were informed that there services would not be required unless specifically called for, and the quiet state of the town fully warranted the opinion. In the evening, however, between six and seven o'clock, an affair took place which threatened to rekindle the expiring embers. A Bugis man ran amok in Boat Quay and this lower part of Circular Road, wounding no less than six Chinese--two, it is feared, mortally; he then jumped into the Canal and concealed himself under Purvis's Bridge. The consternation amongst the Chinese words fail us to describe, and it was some time before they could be persuaded to return to their homes, or satisfied that the amok was not got up to create disorder. The Bugis man was repeatedly called upon to surrender himself, but he refused, and said he would rather die than yield himself up: as was armed with a kris in each hand it was justly feared that if he reached the shore additional victims would fall by his hand. The police were then ordered to fire; many shots were fired but did not touch him; he then ran along the bed of the canal (in which there was not more than four feet of water at the time)as far as fronting Synagogue-street, where he was overpowered, and carried off to the Police Office dangerously wounded on the head, arms and body--he died about three hours afterwards. Before his death he repeatedly stated that he was induced to run amok as he believed that mean had been employed to kill him by one Inchee Bujal, to whom he owed $3. Inchee Bujal was sent for an confronted with the Bugis; the later repented what he had previously mentioned. Inchee Bujal stated that the man was in his employee, and had absconded, taking with him a sampan and spear; the man admitted this to be corrected but still persisted in expressing his belief that Inchee Bujal had ordered people to kill him, apparently for no other reason that because Inchee Bujal is the head of the Bugis people resident here.

&#x200B;

Arrangements were made and at once carried into execution to station a portion of the military, with a police party under a magistrate, at four commanding positions in the country; namely, at Siglap, Thompson's Road, Bukit Timah and Tangling. These points continue to be occupied up to the time of our going to press.

&#x200B;

On Friday morning, in town, the shops were not opened, and there was manifestly a bad feeling existing between the Tsin-chew and the Hokien people. It would appear that some ill-disposed persons industriously circulated reports connected with the amok of the previous evening, with the view of making it appear that the Bugis man had been employed by the Hokien tribe to kill those of the Tsin-chew—forgetting the improbability of a Bugis being able to distinguish one class frum the other. On inquiry, it turned out that men of both tribes were amongst the wounded. The leading men of each tribe were called together, and Mr Dunman explained the matter to them. As the day advanced there were evident signs of returning confidence amongst the trading classes, which is at all times satisfactory and progressive, inspiring others with feelings of security.

&#x200B;

In the country districts a few murders were committed; here and there bangsalls were plundered and destroyed, but these were confined to one or two quarters, At Siglap, all was quiet until one, p.m., when a large body of armed Chinese moved from Sirangoon in the direction of Siglap; on their way they killed three Malays who were peacefully employed in their own gardens, and this circumstance exasperated the feelings of the Malay population, causing the utmost excitement. Shots were soon heard, and some scouts reported that about 1,000 armed Chinese were close at hand, on their way to burn the Malay houses at Siglap. The troops were turned out and halted near the convict lines. About an hour after- wards an armed party oi Chinese passed in front of Dr. Little's (Arthur's Seat), with, it is believed, the design of firing the village: a party was sent in pursuit, but the Chinese fled into the jungle. 

&#x200B;

On Saturday the 13th, all was quiet in town, and the shop. open as usua1. More than 29 junks sailed away for China. At the rear of Government Hill the body of a Chinese was found on the road-side, literally hacked to pieces, reported to have been committed by some Hokien fishermen. Several isolated murders were commuted in the rural districts, and after mid-day five bangsalls at Tanglin were fired, and destroyed. Justice Harrison and a party proceeded t,) the spot In one house was concealed a number of Chinese and a quan- tity of arms and stolen property; twenty-three men wer taken into custody, and part of them, and some of the property found can be identified by the Towkays whose houses were destroyed. Later in the day a house near the end of the hill range at Mount Faber was set on fire, but the miscreants bolted off into the jungle before assistance arrived. At Siglap all remaining \[…\] is said that the three Malays killed on the previous \[…\] were engaged in aiding another party of Chinese at the time they were slain.

The Magistrates have addressed a letter to His \[…\] the Governor, expressing their convictions that the Straits Settlements to not received the military protection which their importance and the nature and description of the population require; they suggested two regiments are necessary, one of which ought to be stationed at Singapore, with some Artillerymen the proposed batteries.

Captain Rodgers, of the United States steamer, which vessel arrived here on Sunday the 7til instant, kindly offered an armed body 01 80 men to assist the executive in quelling the disturbances, or in promoting property.

 It will be satisfactory to parties at a distance to know that the large amount of property in the hands of our merchants, contained in godowns in Commercial-square, has not been, nor is it now in peril. The godowns of the merchants are well protected by the shipping, and are closely watched by men specially employed for the purpose. The Oriental Bank, since the 6th instant, has been guarded by a party of Sepoys of the 43rd M.N.I. The whole of our mercantile community, principals and subordinates, have been engaged either Magistrates or Special Constables, in suppressing disturbances.

It is next to impossible to estimate the number of persons killed and wounded during the disturbances. At leist one hundred Chinese have been shot dead or hacked to pieces: probably double that number have been assassinated. On one morning there were four bodies in the dead-house, next day nine more, until at length the numbers so increased that orders were given to inter the bodies wherever found. The Chinese rioters used their best exertions to carry off their killed and wounded. The Hospital was crowded with inmates wounded. Neither age nor sex have been excepted from the serial murders perpetrated in the broad noon-of-day.

&#x200B;

More than 500 person, are in custody charged with participation in one or more of the scenes we have described, and we believe there is an intention to proceed at once with a judicial inquiry, so as to dispose of the prisoners and relieve the jails, now overcrowded.

bakedrice133,nslxqv,PES status (pre-enlistee)What can I expect,2021-06-05 10:47:59,NationalServiceSG,11091,10,2,"Just completed my last appt and am waiting for PES status. Am curious about PES status.

So I just completed my last appt at the National Heart Centre (NHC) and the doctor told me that although my heart rate is >100 bpm and my blood pressure is at hypertension levels in the day, at night, heart rate slows down normally. 

Doc did say that i’m slightly unfit for my age group and I seem to be the kanchiong type so those aforementioned factors could explain the high heart rate (sinus tachycardia) in the day

Additionally, I had an IMH admission in 2012 for school related stress but the exact details I cannot recall. There was no diagnosis of any disorder tho.

Has anyone been a similar situation before?  Does an IMH appt from long ago have any bearing on ur PES status?

Also, I’m not sure if the high heart rate and high blood pressure due to unfit and anxiousness is going to be considered a ‘condition’ since doc has given my heart a clean bill of health

Would like to serve NS to the best I can but am concerned about these two vagaries in my health history

I was doing okay in life till I had to drop out of Poly for a very bad mental health episode, and then took a diploma from LASALLE and then got stuck in a pretty traumatising work experience to the point where I just wanted to go back to studying to avoid working. 

I currently feel stuck worrying I can't get into a degree, and I realised I'd be graduating relatively late, with not much income earned throughout the years. With my mental health conditions I just find it really hard to get a full-time job I can feel safe and stable in, and I'm not sure what work I could do to support myself without getting quickly overwhelmed. I feel trapped knowing how much stigma there is against the conditions I have and not feeling like I can safely disclose them without losing an opportunity for work.

Right now I want to take time off to focus on therapy but I feel like I'm a waste of space to just be spending up to a year just in therapy to work on myself while I'm seeing my friends get employed and move on with their lives.

i graduated from biomedical engineering with a gpa of 3.2. my first few years of poly were hard on me - i was struggling with mental and physical health issues and it significantly affected my gpa. well at least i did something about it, got help and got myself back together again but by then, it was too late. i had been scoring <3.0 for 3 whole semesters. i managed to pull my gpa back up in my final year though, with a 4.0 for my internship and a 3.6 for the 6th sem. nothing impressive but it was a massive feat for me. 

my gpa isn’t something i’m proud of especially since my a lot peers and classmates graduated with diplomas with merit. i think i was at a disadvantage and couldn’t perform my best; i was struggling with depression and was admitted to hospitals frequently, only to figure out i had a genetic disorder. i might have been able to do better if my circumstances were better but then again my gpa is my fault and my responsibility. nevertherless, i do want to try my best to secure a place in a local uni. 

i applied to sit’s diagnostic radiography and that’s where my interest and passion mainly lies. (also applied to ntu’s bioengineering but i knew that wasn’t possible anyway). unfortunately, no news from them. no interviews. nothing. 

at this point, i’ve considered that as a rejection as an interview now would be unlikely. 

i’m considering 4 options:

1) work for 1 year and reapply next year 
- im looking at jobs working with medical imaging equipment bc i heard that the more specific and relevant the work experience, the higher the chances of landing an interview

2) SAT exams/specialist diplomas
 - i do not know much about these, any info would be appreciated 

3) A-levels as a private candidate
- i think i’m in a better place mentally and physically to consider this option although i know it will be incredibly hard. ive looked through some of the syllabuses but im still unsure

4) a combination of 1&2

Lkxfm,dzzi47,Advice for dealing with an eating disorder,2019-11-22 19:03:12,singapore,378959,17,11,"I am 19 and just started university. Somehow, trying to eat healthy evolved into counting calories, which steadily became an obsession. I started to avoid fried foods and sugar first, and then stopped carbs altogether. My weight has plummeted from 46kg to 40kg. My menses has stopped. I was in denial about the situation until I weighed myself. I'm probably anorexic, but I don't have the time or energy to visit a psychiatrist for counselling (dealing with endless school work and exams).

I realised that I don't dare to eat more. I have this thought at the back of my mind that if I let myself eat more, I would not be able to stop and I would get fat. Please help. I'm scared and tired of being bullied by my brain.

Being in university also meant that a lot of socialising happens around food, which gives me even more anxiety. I'm afraid of confessing that I have an ED because that might make people look at me differently.

I would control my breathing, eat slowly and eat with friends then go to social settings that I fear the most like crowded hawker centre & restaurants. I felt that exercising helps with my fear.

I Guess it depends what issues you have or what you are upset about wrt your body.....\n\nYou could try diverting your energy to finding a sport or something that’s enjoyable.

I\'m going to eat healthy and exercise so I can be like her!) and the second is doing something because fear/paranoia of something (Can\'t eat this, can\'t eat that, scared later get diabetes/hbp etc etc). Trying to eat healthy from the latter attitude is like compensating for your anxiety (you lack an inner power, anxiously trying to stay healthy) through the outside by hawking your diet closely. However, it doesn’t really translate to good health, because the body is more responsive to your inner state than what you do externally. Don\'t focus so much on your food habits right now atm, instead you need to work on reducing the anxiety and obsessive thoughts surrounding your eating habits first by accepting them and letting those thoughts be without the need to get motivated into action by them (You have rightly identified that it\'s your brain doing the ""bullying"", you don\'t have to do everything it says now do you?).\n\nIMHO, your fear is just a symptom of a lack of power, you may notice this lack working in other areas of your life as well, for example, you might be a meek person who has a hard time standing up for yourself or find yourself compromising often.

i have avoidant personality disorder, and even the thought of interaction with unknown people makes me so afraid. therefore stuff like orientation is actual hell for me. 

dear ogls, i know its your job to engage the new students and help them interact with each other more, and honestly thank you for your hard work. but please, please please dont force people to join in on the interactions and stuff especially when they look uncomfortable. 

im crying right now bc one of my ogls got upset at me for being ""too quiet"", and when i reluctantly told them about my issue, they said its something normal that everyone goes through and that i just have to ""get through it"". 

my only request is for you guys to be a bit more understanding and leave the quiet people alone of the really look uncomfortable... give us some time please... this is a new env and we're nervous.

please be nice to the quiet ones too. please be more understanding.

I found these activities vacuous and self-serving for the mere sake of gaining popularity. I made some friends but my OGL disliked me till the day she graduated. \n\nWhen you leave college, your OG & JC activities don’t matter anymore. They love to put it down to having an attitude problem, being anti-social or some may be downright mean and ostracise you. It’s hard & overwhelming when you feel bullied like that but remember that it says more about them than you. All the popularity contests and team spirit cheers will and do eventually fall away in adulthood. Nobody will care about OGLs and the inflated sense of importance they bestow upon themselves when you are an adult. \n\nFocus on your positive traits. If you’re afraid to speak in groups, look for the kindest person in your OG & say hello or have a lil chat just to have an ally of sorts.

I’ve never forgotten her kindness in returning my smile & chatting with me in the OG. So it’s not about how many people you know but the quality of each individual. You will find a few who will share your personality and quirks. Cherish these. \n\nI’ve huddled in toilets to avoid obnoxious CCA seniors as well so I empathise with you. You’ll turn out wonderful so don’t let their words get to you. They will not matter once you leave JC. \n\nI’m now a seasoned educator & seeing students going through the same struggles I did in JC evokes sadness. \n\nThis is the prime of your youth & the time of your life. \nEnjoy happy moments. Let the bad ones exeunt stage left. You deserve sunshine & joy. Now the cubicle ain’t smelling too great so gotta get out of there soon, k?\n\n[ Edited slightly to include the fact that even highly extroverted people like myself are averse to orientation because of peer coercion.

I don't have the money to pay them back, and the SIT financial aid team didn't say anything, except that I might have to pay back the full amount.

I am at a dead end. I don't know what else to do, because I don't have the funds to pay for my full tuition at NTU now, and I can't find anyone willing to co sign on a student loan with me. (Parents are too old, and none of my friends are willing).

It's a huge struggle for me to manage without medication. I scrapped through university and always had to beg for extensions cause of brain fog. I feel I could have done better if I had medication.

Just_peeking8,ka3ra1,Struggling with Major Depression in NS,2020-12-10 07:50:24,askSingapore,44675,84,128,"To anyone reading, I’m hoping that someone can help me with my current situation. It’s long, but it explains everything. 

I nvr wanted to be in army, it’s honestly not for me, but I understand that every male has to do it so I’ve been trying my best to suck it up and do as best I can in the 2 years. But as the weeks go by, I feel myself cracking like glass (looking like I’m fine on the outside, but being a huge train wreck on the inside). Everyday I wake up like I’m in a nightmare and am constantly attacked by negative thoughts during PT and different parts of the day, to the point I start to consider taking my life to end all of it. The only thing that’s kept me alive is my faith and the effects my actions may have on the people around me, but it feels like I have to suffer just so people are spared off those feelings, so it’s like a continuous cycle that gets worse every time. 

But this problem didn’t occur only in NS. I actually experienced depression and suicidal thoughts when I was in poly before enlisting. I admittedly was too playful in my 1st yr and got mediocre grades, so I took that as a wake up call and put in more effort for my 2nd yr. But no matter how hard I tried, I got the same results. Everyone was telling me to stay positive, strive to do better and all that, I tried telling myself that as well, but it was very difficult to stay happy and positive. In the next project following that, I had no energy or mood to do work. I would just stare at my computer screen and think about what a failure I was and thinking about jumping off my school building. But I guess because I was studying something I really want to pursue as a career, it was slightly easier to overcome and get through my last yr following the disaster that was Yr 2. 

Anyways, I went to see a psychiatrist at both IMH and private, because I felt the IMH psychiatrist was quite condescending and dismissive, especially when I mentioned that I don’t want to do NS, despite me explaining multiple times that I am trying my best nonetheless. He also compared himself to me, saying that he was colorblind and couldn’t get a good vocation which he would have killed for. Maybe it’s a tactic they use to identify those trying to keng? I dunno. Both got memos, but idk what the IMH one says because they sealed the letter before I could read it. But the private memo states that I have Major Depressive disorder and that I want to down pes, so that I can at least get through the rest of the 2yrs more smoothly, while also having more time to in a sense fix myself.

When I informed my OC and OO, they both suggested not submitting the memo, in fear that it would ruin my future, which I can understand to an extent. But I also feel that I’m getting worse here and if I stay I might really decide to end my life. It’s not really the fault of anyone around me, it’s mostly mine.

I feel like my problems are affecting those around me, like my bunkmates who have been very helpful to me despite my situation, but I know that they have their own problems and I feel like I’m adding to that. For my superiors, they’ve been nothing but the best to me, showing concern for my wellbeing and helping me by arranging counselling appointments and talking to me about my problems, but the same as my bunkmates, they have to deal with me and all their own problems, which is the last thing I want others to feel, as I’ve been on the receiving end multiple times. For my parents, they have to worry about their son being a mental wreck and having to pay for my treatments and medications, especially my sis who I think feels neglected because all the attention is on me now. 

All this makes me feel really bad and that I’m burdening everyone around me, which is why I feel ending my life once and for all will end all this suffering that is attacking me.

Anyways, sorry for the long long story. If anyone whose been in a similar situation can advise me on how to go about all this and perhaps some words of advice and guidance would be much appreciated.

But alas, we had to make the best hand out of the cards we were dealt with as best as we can and maybe even win the game of life. When you mentioned dropping pes might be one of your thought process, I then assumed it was becos the physical training was too tough hence you should drop pes status? I would avoid dropping pes becos the army will post u to admin and/or mundane duties which will make the 2 years all the more torturous.\n\nSecondly, you seem to be aware of the people's feelings around you and place the burden on urself to not make them feel bad. I'm sure they love you as much as you love them and would want to see you get better. Don't believe everything that you tell yourself. You are already onto the road to recovery just by reaching out to various institutions and communities and maybe even talking to your loved ones.\n\nTo conclude, start with your small daily wins like thanking yourself for making it through yesterday every morning when you wake up. Be grateful for the meals provided for you in NS compared to the people who may not have a single meal in other parts of the world. Don't be too hard on yourself on having to impress anybody.

You are needed, you are appreciated. You are strong, you can get through this. You will emerge better and you can beat this. Sure, I'm just a stranger on the internet, but I believe in you nonetheless.  \n\n\nDo you have any interests? You can start there to see if perhaps there's something there to help you find something to look forward to, or find something to focus your attentions on. Or maybe you have something you've always been interested in, but have yet to actually try. Now may be a good time to explore.  This will help with the mood.   \n\n\nTake things one step at a time. One task at a time. Depression makes it difficult to even do the simplest things. If you got out of bed today and brushed your teeth, mark that as a win. If you managed to take a bath and keep yourself clean and hygienic, that's a win too. Remember, one step at a time, one task at a time. Don't focus too much on the bigger picture right now, because I'm sure it would seem all-too-big and looming. If you feel up for it, and since you're in NS, do some exercise. If you manage to, that's a win as well. Take the small victories.  \n\n\nSurround yourself with people who care, the people who at least have an inkling what you're really going through so they know how to handle it. Depression is a mental health issue that isn't talked about enough and hence sometimes people don't know the right way to deal with someone who is suffering from it. If you can find it in you, find someone you care about and are close to and talk to them to see how they can help you too. Your parents, your siblings,  your best friend, etc. Sometimes the way people talk to you about your depression does wonders, since most people are too easily dismissive of it.\n\n  \nOne last thing, I guess, although that's a thing of my own personal preference and recommendation. There's this web series I used to watch. It's about a whole group of professional voice actors playing Dungeons & Dragons. It's called Critical Role. That's a personal interest of mine, and it may not be for you, but I know for a fact that that show has helped me through some tough times, and it has helped a lot of others as well. Maybe give it a shot. Who knows? \n\n  \nYou got this.

There is of course no one-time fix to getting rid of unhealthy emotions and thoughts, but you can take small steps. It seems like you do have strong social support, which is crucial for improvement. \n\nIf you are willing to, I really do encourage you to seek help from a psychologist. Pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy go hand in hand when it comes to mental health. Psychiatrists prescribe medicine to treat any chemical imbalance in the brain while psychologists guide you to adapt behaviourally and cognitively. A good psychologist would not tell you how to feel or tell you how to act, but guide you to a more functional and healthy way of feeling and acting by equipping you with the skills that you need. You can search for private psychologists online (though sometimes it can be as expensive as SGD100-SGD200 per hour of session) or go through a local polyclinic - what you can do is see a GP first, tell them your symptoms, and they will refer you to a psychologist at the polyclinic. The downside to this may be that due to the covid season, consultations may be more infrequent at the polyclinic. Alternatively, if your psychiatrist is able to refer you to a psychologist, that would be ideal too. (PS. A psychologist is quite different from a councillor, it will be worthwhile to do a quick google search on the different professionals that you can seek help from - this will strongly depend on your goal ie do you want to seek advice? Do you want to change the way you think? Do you want to learn how to accept certain negativity?)', '\nIf you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please reach out.

I was given tasks, and list to do during my recovering period which i wasn\'t sure it will work at that point of times.\n\nI was asked to write down things that i do that makes me happy everyday.

Things like\nCycling, meet a friend, picnic, playing sports and the list goes on.

Same goes for leg injury or depression. It\'s not the person fault that he has this injury. I\'m not advocating that. Life sucks sometime.

You could tank that injury and have a healthy PES so future employees won\'t know about your ""hidden injury"" but thats up to personal choice.

The colour of the tie I wear into the interview matters more than whether someone is pes F or not especially in the private sector.

I worked in Recruit First (Recruit company) SIA (Singapore Airlines) and CAG (Changi Airport Group) and ALL of them require their potential employees to fill in their medical details. If you can get the job done but you have a mental illness which you declared in NS as compared to someone who can get the job done but is totally fine, who would the employee hire? Heck it's not even about NS. If you declare you had an illness that's long term or permanent even during secondary school or poly, it still affects you because it's a record. I only said NS because this is an NS thread. All I said were logical as I presented to you. To choose between 2 guys who can do the job but one has an illness and the other is perfectly fine. Who would the employee choose? That's why I said PES F people theoretically have a harder time to find a job. But it's not impossible and it also depends on situation. A Pes F guy can still be my boss if his smarter than me and the reason he was pes F in the first place doesn't affect his job. Like if he has a heart condition but his working in an office job then sure, his illness doesn't affect him. It's based on situation only. And I like how you assume I'm those salty guy. Likewise based on your post history, guess I can assume you are those guys who are under the downpes system for whatever reason? As I repeat multiple times, HEALTH > NS but it's a fact that there are indeed cons to downpes but that SHOULDN'T stop anyone from declaring their illness""]"
Empty-Fee2090,kx2hvi,[JC] CJC: MY EXPERIENCE AS A SCIENCE STREAM STUDENT,2021-01-14 17:36:09,SGExams,77716,27,67,"I've been seeing a lot of questions, opinions and facts about CJC and though I've not completed my journery there, I'd like to inform you of how my school life and some of my peers' school life has been like since joining the school. 
I came from a neighborhood sec school where the culture was actually quite comforting and the students studied a lot. My teachers in secondary would stay back for hours to tutor and guide me for Os. They'd even encourage me to ask more questions and engage with them more. However, when I came to CJC I experienced a sort of... shock. I take the science scream (BCME) and my biology teacher would greytick me, never reply my texts and put off consultations so much that I'd had given up. I wanted to ask another teacher to aid me but I had to ask my initial bio teacher if I could ask another teacher. Some other bio & many physics teachers did the same too for my peers. As for maths, it's one of my weaker subjects and unfortunately, the teachers never really helped me. The teachers don't push you. Some of them even seem cold at certain instances. I must say my chem teacher is okay, some of my other peers and seniors have incredible chem teachers so if you're lucky you'd get one too. However, I think the practical lessons are rather little for us to hone our skills at least. Don't even make me begin with the notes. They're okay but c'mon, I've seen JPJCs notes for bio and they're wayyy better imo. It definitely is outdated as we know it and rather wordy and can be hard to study with sometimes. You'll be wishing for other alternatives. My friends in ignite programme are doing okay but have the same qualms as I do and ignite teachers do teach non ignite classes. Some of my friends in the programme say it's actually a really good programme and that it's something they look forward to, others say it's rather overrated. I'm not in the programme so I can't say for sure but overall it doesn't seemtoo bad. Facilities wise, honestly it doesn't really impact the quality of education? The facitilites are good for an old building. There were some leaky aircons that would sometimes decide to work as heaters but I'm sure that's been fixed now. The toilets are vvvvvv clean to the point you can almost always smell the detergent. 
As for your social life, well you'll definitely make friends and have your fair share of fun and meet a lot of people. However, there is some truth to the toxic culture there and there's a clear hierarchy with A LOT of social climbers. It's very daunting to even go to school sometimes tbvh with all the drama that goes on and all they social issues, if you do choose to come here, choose your friends wisely. 
Teacher-parent communication kinda sucks, I have AA due to an anxiety disorder and most of the teachers were nonchalant about my condition and often forgot about me HAHAHAHA. My parents wanted to know a little more about the teachers to also calm themselves down about who my teachers are and if I'm safe there since CJC is an hour away from my home and my teachers didn't really seem so keen on talking to them it was as if they wanted it over with. 
Overall I had an okay experience in CJC, okay, I lie, my experience wasn't good. But I've tried to make the best out of it and am just going to study and utilize resources from my friends who study in other JCs as well as maximize what CJC has given me to do well for As.

hii, i know this may not be the best platform, but i dont know how to move on from here anymore.

as my depression has been consistently worsening, my parents have since been forcing me to religious rituals and abide to their religious practices. according to them, they think i have been possessed by bad spirits from my soft toys and also from my workplace. so they took me thru an exorcism process, during which i said i felt extremely uncomfortable as i started to have multiple panic attacks. but my parents forced me to bear it in, and the process took about 1.5 hours. subsequently, they threw all my soft toys away, quit my job without my consent. i argued with them and asked them why they'd force me through this. and they said they dont see any help in me going for therapy, so they rather use their own religious method, asking me to believe in them that this is the only way to cure my depression and anxiety - which obvly isnt true. basically they think that im possessed w spirits and dat is why im suffering from mdd and anxiety disorder. 

right now i am in severe danger as i feel so controlled by my parents to the point they are contacting every person in my contact list (which idk how they accessed to it), and also they still want me to abide to the religious practices (eg returning back b4 5pm otherwise i will get possessed by spirits, having a noise-free env). as a result, i have been self-harming myself every night.

my psychologist and psychiatrist recommended my parents to go for family counselling, but they refused. they feel that nth is wrong with their mindset. its just me who has a problem.

perhaps my parents have good intentions, but their way of helping me jus started out horribly. right now i feel so broken. it doesnt feel like a family, constantly tearing apart. every time im at home, i just harm myself. i have no suicidal intent, but rather i cut to relieve the emotional pain.

i went to fsc this morning, and they said they cant help me unless my parents are keen to join the counselling session. but again, the more controlling they get.

i dont know what to do anymore. neither do i want to go to IMH. i dont know whether a CPO is necessary, but its so extreme to the point all im being put through is religious stuff which i really feel uncomfortable about.

please, help me. ik im still under the charge of my parents, but idw to put myself through even more pain and trauma. idk what i shd do.

at the time of writing, i feel hopelessness and pain in life.

Ill get straight to the point. I’m going to JC soon. I’m insecure. Very insecure.
Some see me as the cool know it all girl. I’m not. I’m scared on the inside, scared of the judgements and for what? I don’t know. I’ve dealt with eating disorders for the past 2 years (or more) of my life. I started out as this “fat” girl, weighing no more than 75kg. Sure BMI matters, but for that fact, I was 167cm. Getting pushed by family members and relatives in general, I lost it. I was pushed over the edge. I lost weight while losing it, and am now 57 kg. Sure it’s enough for me to be categorised as an “acceptable” weight, but to me it was never enough. It still is not enough. But I still feel “fat”, insecure, low self esteemed. And for that fact (TMI) but I’ve never had stomach ache for the past 2 years of my life. Why? Because food never went down my system. Yes, I’m scared of dying because of this. I’m fearing for my life, my health, yet I can’t do anything more than feel like crap everyday.

If you have gone through this please help me.

To make matters worse, I\'ve been pretty much quite alone for my four years of  secondary school and sometimes i wondered if it was because of my appearance as I was fat. I also know how it feels like to have your own family members subtly shame you for being overweight. For me, my entire life, there were clothes I wanted but literally couldn\'t wear because my mom said I was too ""fat"" to wear it. In the end, I actually managed to make my weight drop to 68kg within sec 3 but in sec 4 it bounced back up a couple of kgs due to circuit breaker and also stress from o levels, as i started eating more. I\'m trying to reduce my weight again but why I\'m telling you this is because I actually can imagine how you feel. I always feel like im ""fat"" no matter how much weight I lose and I worry so much about what I eat it drives me insane. Sometimes i feel like if I\'ve exceeded a certain amount of food on a certain day the next day I would only eat like a little snack or literally nothing. I think about my weight every single day, minute and second , and I feel like no would like me unless I looked ""skinny"" or ""thin"".

She will return to court on June 25.\n\n> In a report dated April last year, the psychiatrist, Dr Ng Beng Yeong, noted that Chow became wary of strangers and developed a “tendency to react swiftly to sudden motion in the surroundings”, following an incident at a club around 2012 where she was “grabbed by a male stranger”.\n\n> In that incident, Chow claimed that she was frightened and fought back, but the man returned with a glass bottle. She stopped going to clubs after that.\n\n> Separately, she also started drinking alcohol to get over an incident in 2015, where she was allegedly cheated of a large sum of money by a business partner. She told Dr Ng that she would not remember what happened after she got intoxicated.\n\n> Chow’s lawyer Josephus Tan told the court on Tuesday that since her offences, Chow has quit drinking and passed her real estate exams.\n\n> Chow had pleaded guilty in April to one charge of committing riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour in public, and another charge of causing hurt to deter a public servant from performing his duty.\xa0\n\n> For riotous, disorderly or indecent behaviour in a public place, she could be fined up to S$2,000, jailed for up to six months, or both.\n\n> Separately, she could be jailed for up to seven years, fined, or both for causing hurt to deter a public servant from performing his duty.\n\n> While the prosecution is seeking three months’ jail and a S$1,000 fine, Mr Tan asked for a non-custodial sentence.\n\n> WHAT HAPPENED\n\n> The incidents took place at the car park of Parkroyal on Pickering hotel at about 5pm on Aug 13, 2017.\n\n> The court heard then that as soon as Chow was leaving the wedding, a security guard was called in to keep an eye on her, due to her dispute with some wedding guests.\n\n> Chow managed to get to her car at the hotel’s car park, located on the third floor. But when she was unable to find her way out, she got out of her car and started screaming. Her relatives who were present were unable to pacify her or stop her from doing so.\n\n> Unable to contain the accused, the security guard, Mr Muhammad Hairul Abdul Halim, called the police for help, stating that Chow had hit one of the cars at Parkroyal and that she was violent.\n\n> When the police arrived, Chow continued to cry and shout.\n\n> The police then proceeded to place her under arrest, but she struggled and kicked a uniformed police officer, 26-year-old Muhammad Taufiq Zainudin, on his right thigh.\n\n> The altercation was captured on video through a body-worn camera worn by another police officer.\n\n> \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'He was my doctor so yes I believe she has genuine problems', '[deleted]', ""The doctor is the expert witness ma.

owlcovesg,j59xj4,[Rant] Adam Khoo and his courses.,2020-10-05 08:37:51,SGExams,77716,104,855,"*TW: Suicide, mental illness, ASD references.*

A few years ago, I went for an Adam Khoo motivational course. The experience was exhilarating, and I found myself at the end of it all inspired to turn over a new leaf and to do extremely well; but as time went on I began to realise how *unhelpful* the lessons were. Not only were the lessons unhelpful, but they were also *damaging* to one's motivation and mental health.

The trainers, having no experience in psychology, didn't know anything about mental health. Yet, they spoke with confidence on how to deal with mental illnesses. Khoo himself has pseudoscientific and naive views of mental illness, claiming that ""if you believe that you are clinical (sic) depressed, that mere thought will stimulate chemicals in your brain that will continue to make you feel depressed."" (1) His brand of coaching relies on a pseudoscience called neuro-linguistic programming, (2) a psychotherapeutic methodology that has little evidence to support it. (3)

At the course, my first experience with people with mental illnesses came when I met an old classmate who had Autism. (a) Vaguely, I recall that the one of the student-trainers remarked that there was 'at least one every year.' My second experience came during a group-sharing session, where we had to share with our cohorts our personal issues in a sort of group-therapy. A girl (b) decided to share, and she talked about how she had self-harmed on some occasions. At one point, she was about to attempt suicide before a friend talked her out of it. (c)

Then, the trainer replied. First, he talked about suicide, calling it a 'stupid' and 'selfish' act. He talked about how she had family that loved her and how killing herself would hurt her family deeply. Second, he talked about self-harm. He shared about his experience with a student who regularly self-harmed, who often 'pretended' to hide their scars, who was obviously 'attention-seeking'. His advice on self-harm was to slice chicken instead of flesh. 

She laughed at the quips and the anecdotes. We all did. Looking back, however, the jokes didn't help her get over her suicidal ideation, and the anecdote on attention-seeking was dismissive and insulting. More importantly, she didn't *learn anything*, not a new technique to cope with their problems nor a reason to stop self-harming. Neither was she referred to other resources to help her with her problems. In the end, it all came down to a *joke*. (d)

\~

So far, I've only talked about Khoo's (and his trainers') approach towards mental health. To reiterate, Khoo and his trainers do not have any proper training in psychology but in a pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). To give you a sense of what NLP is, practitioners believe that they can tell if people are lying just by looking at their eyes. (They can't.) (4) This willingness to believe in pseudoscience transfers directly over to Khoo's teaching methodology. His advice on studying and motivation is either platitudinous or faulty.

For the most part, the advice is platitudinous. Even Dr Barbara Oakley, a professor in education, asks Khoo to ""go beyond platitudes and just go straight to what goes on in real everyday life"" in an interview. (5) If you want to know what a lesson by Khoo is like, a video on YouTube entitled 'Adam Khoo - How to Condense Information - learn how to read fast and effectively' is a good example. In thirteen minutes, Khoo ironically states what could be said in two-or-three minutes: longform text is not very good for revision as it contains a lot of descriptive language; making summary notes with diagrams is better. 

Some advice stands on shaky ground. Khoo believes in speed-reading, which has little empirical evidence to support its purported benefits. (7) He also promotes the idea of learning types (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile learners), which is again pseudoscientific and which has been criticised by Dr Oakley. (8) (9) .

Every piece of advice he gives, however dubious, is in his *I Am Gifted* book too, so there really is no need to spend thousands of dollars on the course.

\~

**TLDR: Don't go for Adam Khoo courses. They aren't helpful; they are bad.** If you want study tips, Drs Barbara Oakley and Terence Sejnowski have two online courses on them: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) and [Mindshift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift). If you want help with motivation or mood, Dr David Burns has a book on cognitive behavioural therapy, [Feeling Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good:_The_New_Mood_Therapy). And, if you want help with mental illness, you might want to consider psychiatry and/or psychotherapy.

\~

(a) I had known the classmate since primary school, and it was known that he had Autism at the time. Back then, the term Autism Spectrum Disorder was not in use, and I believe that Autism would have been the official diagnosis. I also note that some consider Autism to be a neurodevelopment disorder rather than a mental illness.

(b) I portrayed the actual person as a girl so I could refer to them with a feminine pronoun and to the trainer with a masculine pronoun. The gender used is not indicative of identity.

(c) Although I only met two people who had so-called mental illnesses or mental disorders, I suspect that many more students are sent to such courses. I realise now that some parents sent their children to Adam Khoo because they are afraid of acknowledging that their children might need help. That's why we have 'enrichment' centres—your child is being *enriche*d instead of being *helped*.

And in the anti-psychiatric society we live in, parents would rather spend thousands of dollars on pseudoscience than let their children seek psychiatry or psychotherapy. They're scared of thinking that there might be something wrong with them or their child. Khoo would never *label* your child with a mental illness. In his eyes, we are *gifted*, after all.

(d) Tony Robbins, incidentally, has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_YqsqJBUfw) where he 'saves' a suicidal man. Robbins doesn't actually save the man, nor does he help him in any real, tangible way. All he did was tell a joke and make a the man smile. Some may be inclined to believe that making a suicidal person smile, 'breaking their depressed state' can help them out of suicide, but it really doesn't. It doesn't teach them how to better cope with their problems in living, nor does it address their mental health, nor does it address any potentially organic causes of such a mood. Robbins is, incidentally, an NLP practitioner.

**Addendum: Adam Khoo and Health**

I've talked a lot about Khoo's pseudoscientific beliefs in mental health, which leads me to question his beliefs in other aspects of health. For instance, he believes that [cancer can be cured through ""the power of the mind.""](https://www.adam-khoo.com/91/congratulations-to-my-mum-for-getting-her-book-published/) Why then, was Khoo a [director of the Health Promotion Board from 2009-2011](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkhoo/)? And why did the Ministry of Education grant a [tender on sexual health education to his company in 2015 and 2017](https://opengovsg.com/corporate/200721495D)? One can only hope Khoo and his company are more scientific when it comes to other aspects of health.

Should ~~report~~ forward this to MOE_"", ""I absolutely agree with this post and it's contents. As a person who has been coerced to attend one of Adam Khoo's courses due to poor performance in school, I can testify to the accuracy of this statement. I was a mere 12 years old when I attended this programme, and reluctantly went for it as my parents believed it would benefit a childish adolescent who was scoring badly in school. Indeed, the course relied on various motivational speeches to excite the youths around me, and included cliche activities such as the ability to cross a suspended wooden plank whilst blindfolded because you 'believed in yourself'. \n\nAdam Khoo himself appeared once and gave an hour-long speech about how he once struggled in studies but rakes in millions today. After the talk, he never appeared during the remaining entirety of the programme except for the graduation, and this speaks volumes about how dedicated he is to the running of these lucrative programmes. Costing thousands of dollars just to sign a child up, the man himself only appeared once throughout the whole three-day programme. Doesn't this seem fishy? The rest of the instructors weren't particularly sincere or effective either.\n\nAdditionally, I was disgusted at certain activities and speeches during the event. One of the instructors hurled vulgarities during his speech/scolding in a half-hearted attempt to motivate a seminar room of 13-16 year olds, and forced us to hold a mirror in front of us while shouting at us to force us to literally reflect upon ourselves. I vividly remember the instructor shouting angrily at us to 'wake up' and to 'stop disappointing everyone around you'. I believe the scolding can be done at home, what was the point of this at all?\n\nI believe the programme was ineffective and an absolute waste of thousands of dollars. So this should serve as a precautionary message to any parents out there who may be thinking of enrolling their children into one of Adam Khoo's motivational courses in a bid to improve their studies. Just don't. Save the money for tuition instead, I believe it's definitely more effective. After all the onus is up to the child on whether or not he/she wants to study, if the child doesn't understand the importance of grades then why would a three-day camp miraculously inculcate such values in him/her?

Keep it up queen/ king.', 'Adam Khoo along is a modern day snakeoil salesman.', 'Looks like I\'m not the only one who thought Adam Khoo\'s courses are execrable.\n\nTl;dr Courses from Adam Khoo? No\n\nalso i just realised that some subreddits have understanding dudes, so I might as well get this out of my system. im takin o levels too xd\n\nBack when my classmates and I were sec 2, the would-be CCA leaders were sent to a \'leadership camp\', just to mentally prepare us to take over leadership roles (fuck you, whoever printed the form and didn\'t put the option to opt out).\n\nFirst day, trainers were already giving us an earful for having five different standards of \'neat\' because people from the same classes (5 classes, 2 express and 3 NA) sorted out the bags as a class. Looked well organised, but nope. Kena fucking tekan by the trainers. The head trainer was especially guai lan. Loudmouthed piece of shit. End of the day, \'lesson learned\'. Sort bags together as one group.\n\nSecond day, more or less the same. Third day, we were given a task of working together. Doesn\'t matter how long it took. If we finish it, we can go hone straight away.\n\nWe were split into three categories. Gladiators (doing tons of exercises for like, five to six hours straight? The only break given to them were the lunch break at 12 o\'clock), scholars (basically finding information within a stack of newspapers. For every answer we get correct, the gladiators run to where they think the puzzle pieces were. Find as many as they can within a set amout of time before we get to set them free again with a correct answer. I was in this group and the trainers there were guilt-tripping us because we were the reason those \'gladiators\' were still running around finding puzzle pieces.) and the debators (argue, argue and argue. after argue then they have to talk to the worst group member that was apparently giving the most negative vibes. Somehow I ended up being that asshat dragging everyone\'s mood down, so they gave me \'tips on how to be a better person\')\n\nAfter about five hours of solving 5 questions and being labelled with ignominy, I nearly lost my shit and told my teammates, of course within earshot of the head trainer, to ignore the trainers, as they weren\'t helping at all. First time in my secondary school years, I acted out a bit. good boy since primary 5. Head instructor came over. Lo and behold, scolding lor. Pulled the ""you not interested, get out lah"" card. Obviously sec 2 me was mortified, because I felt like I lost face in front of my group mates. Went to the toilet with my phone (no phones were allowed. They didn\'t know I had one with me because I didn\'t keep mine in my bag like everyone did. Idiots never did some sort of inventory check) and researched the last 5 answers to carry the group.\n\nEveryone went home happy, or so they thought xd. Half of us, who weren\'t looking for excuses to get out of the house, left feeling displeased. Obviously I was one of them. The only takeaway was that Adam Khoo programmes don\'t really help. I listened to what they had to offer, since we weren\'t gonna get out of the place for from 0730 to 1730, three days straight. Style of leadership I used as a CCA chairman worked better than what they tried to teach us.\n\nI kinda felt down because my precious time was wasted. Could\'ve studied for sec 3, ya know. Had another bullshit course at sec 4 on how to study, obviously paitao\'d it. Had enough of those stupid mindmaps and speed reading. Memorising isn\'t understanding. These certificates only prove to be useful in the Early Admission Exercise, where you show the interviewers how much you went through to get to the course.\n\n\nLooking back, as ironic as it may sound, it\'s one of the memorable moments in secondary school cuz we all hated the trainers. This school is probably one of the shittiest ones but I wanna leave it on a positive note. I\'m still not going back for teachers\' day though. I still hate secondary school.\n\nalso, i think i sound like a brat, but im grateful for being accepted into the education system of singapore. im a foreigner, so uh yeah. i get the \'if you dont like it here, go tf home\' message a lot if i complain even for a bit. i pay to study, not for a study trial that ill just abandon if im not satisfied with it.\n\nop, thanks for bringing this up.', 'I am still traumatised by that course back in school.', 'honestly the only memorable thing i remembered from his workshops was the mass gathering one where they said some emo stuff and told us to “imagine death” or something and made almost everyone cry - then the instructors were extremely pleased that we cried HAHHAHAA', 'Don’t know why Adam Khoo is so popular, have never enjoyed a single course from his company', 'Vaguely recall being made (along with my fellow P5 or P6 classmates) to imagine our parents dead...\n\nApparently that was supposed to help inspire us for the PSLE', 'You guys can check out James Jani\'s documentary called: ""The Toxic World of Self Help"".

He said that he is the captain of a boat that brings people to happiness not all can take the boat like you. Seriously this is so cult like ....', 'He lives off making people cry and making us feel guilty and shit lol', 'I\'ve got a few things to say.\n1.""The trainers, having no experience in psychology, didn\'t know anything about \nmental health. Yet, they spoke with confidence on how to deal with mental illnesses."" \n\nI mean, they aren\'t psychologists. I\'m sure the confidence came from the trainer personally, thinking that because he is older and NOT depressed, he knew better.\nMany people do it like that, it\'s how different people try to help others. It seems like the trainer has taken a more\n""aggressive"" approach in helping. I am diagnosed with depression,have self-harmed before, suicidal thoughts yada yada. And so in my desperate times of need, I confided in various people. \nDifferent people have responded differently. Their responses are either aggressive or passive, for the lack of better word(s). (Or neutral, meaning they don\'t care lol)\nPassive meaning ""Oh, why do you feel this way? Oh no I\'m so sorry for you. It\'s not your fault, things will get better!""\nAnd aggressive meaning ""Suicide is stupid. There are people who LOVE you. Think about that dude!"" I had always\nconfided in people who helped me ""passively"", somehow they made me feel ""comfortable"" being depressed. And so, I didn\'t\nreally improve all that much. But when I opened up to this friend,she shocked me with blunt tough words, \nbut I know she meant well. She told me things like ""Well if nobody\'s gonna love you you gotta love yourself"" or ""In this world\nthere isn\'t always going to be someone willing to help you all the time"" Yes, the words made me uncomfortable. But\nit shook me, it changed me. It made me think in a different way, and quite frankly those words were what kickstarted my recovery from depression.\n In my opinion, it\'s really personal. What works for someone may not work for someone else. I\'ve been to so many theraphy sessions and I came out the same. But that girl changed me with a few sentences.\nHowever, most people with depression are indeed in a very vulnerable state, so the most professional way to respond is passively, with care, like therapists/counsellors do. I am definitely not supporting you/people to \nhelp people with depression ""aggressively"" (unless you TRULY know how their personality, how they\'ll take it etc.)  \nI 100% agree that it was actually very unprofessional of him to respond in the way that he did. But I won\'t say that it is definitely damaging, as to be honest, it really depends on the individual.\n Although I am definitely not going to ignore the idea that he had actually hurt her more than he helped her. \n\n2. ""She laughed at the quips and the anecdotes. We all did. Looking back, however, the jokes didn\'t help her get \nover her suicidal ideation, and the anecdote on attention-seeking was dismissive and insulting. More importantly, \nshe didn\'t learn anything, not a new technique to cope with their problems nor a reason to stop self-harming.""\n \nI don\'t think he was supposed to/in the position to help her overcome her suicidal thoughts. The best any untrained (in pscyhology) person can do\nis provide you with personal advice,stories, and encourage you to seek professional help.\nI can kind of understand him making jokes, he\'s probably trying to lighten the situation. But he should have ended \nwith a conclusion that would actually \nhave helped her, such as encouraging her to speak with trusted adults or seek professional help.\n\n3. ""So far, I\'ve only talked about Khoo\'s (and his trainers\') approach towards mental health. To reiterate, Khoo\n and his trainers do not have any proper training in\n psychology but in a pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP)""\n \nI\'ve only ever attended one (1) adam khoo course thing, so I don\'t really know much about that. Correct me\nif I\'m wrong, but I don\'t think Khoo advertises his course as a psychology/counselling course or anything? It\'s a \nmotivational course. Please enlighten me on this one.\n\n4. ""(7) He also promotes the idea of learning types (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile learners), ""\n\nI don\'t know about you, but I DEFINITELY learn better with visuals, and I\'m sure many others do. I have\nADHD, so it\'s kinda hard for me to pay attention to things that are uninteresting, even if I wanted to. I have tore my hair out over trying to memorise basic stuff. \nNotes can be boring. Right? It\'s all just words. But pictures? Pictures ""stimulate"" \nme in a way, allowing me to focus better. I don\'t know about the science of it all and such, but I study way, way,\nbetter with pictures/depictions/visuals. I draw on my notes to help me study better sometimes. (not doodle, like draw a concept out)\n  It may just be a personal thing though.My friend who has aspergers studies better with tactile stimuli. I\'m sure it\nprobably doesn\'t only apply to neurodivergent people .\n\n5. ""TLDR: Don\'t go for Adam Khoo courses. They aren\'t helpful; they are bad.""\n\nI honestly believe that you should have included a ""IMO"" because the Adam khoo course actually DID help me and my friends who went. \nI saw many of them come out of the course more confident then they have been when they went in. Evidently, there are also people who did not benefit from his courses. \nIf there are more people that have not benefited than those that have, then I think a better word would be that the course is ""ineffective"" but not entirely unhelpful, or bad. \n\nI MUST STATE I perhaps got lucky, because my trainers were actually very nice. I even opened up to one of the trainers, telling him about my situation and my condition. He gave me kind words, giving some actually respectful advice, like\n""everyday, write down 1 thing that you are grateful for, in a book"". He then left off telling me that he believed in me. \n\nI may have made a few mistakes in my essay above as I\'m notoriously known for being careles amoungst my peers. Please tell me if any of my words seemed wrong, or if it looked like I was trying to defend the instructor/condemn depression etc.\n\nReply below if you wanna rebuttal any of my points of something. I\'m open to discussion/debates!\n\nComments:\nJust wanna say that I\'m reading Adam Khoo\'s ""How To Overcome My Clinical Depression?"" \nFirst off I just wanna say that I don\'t even know if that title/heading is even grammatically correct. Anyways, I can\'t deny the fact that he is VERY dismissive of depression in his article. Particularly \n\n""All of us get depressed from time to time…even I do. I bet anyone who is reading this blog feels depressed at times too. If you do, pls leave a comment and prove me right.""\n\nFeeling depressed and having depression is different...In his first paragraph he has already displayed his lack of understanding of Depression. Not even gonna mention the fact that this very statement is very dismissive as well. \nI\'m just gonna leave it at that, and say that the whole article presents a very old-fashioned/traditional idea of depression lol. That depression isn\'t a real disorder , and that\n "" Depression is a state that you CAN change IMMEDIATELY the moment you CHOOSE to MAKE IT A MUST."". But there are some truths in the article, such as ""If you are not happy with who you are today, then a billion dollars and a million fans will NOT make you happy.""\nI\'m going off tangent.

I appreciate your providing a counter-argument towards my post, but I still disagree with the practices employed at the course.\n\nTo elaborate on my experiences: the trainer at the time had explicitly encouraged us to share openly about our struggles, and that he would give his advice on how to overcome them. I have no doubt that students in similar situations have shared such experiences before, and yet the trainers still continue with such a practice. If the trainers knew that they were unqualified, and that suicidal people would share their experiences, they would have stopped such a 'group-therapy'. But they felt, even after years of similar experiences, that the sharing session *was* something helpful. Bear in mind that neuro-linguistic programmers believe in an alternative, harmful view of human behaviour, and that may lead to their false confidence in dealing with other people's problems.\n\nAnd on your point on Khoo's course not being marketed as a 'mental health' course, see my footnote on 'enrichment' courses. 'Mental health' and 'stress-reduction' courses are not as appealing as 'motivational' courses that reinforce a belief that 'I am gifted' (the actual name of the course). The fact of the matter is that many, many people with mental illnesses and/or neurodevelopmental disorders are sent to these camps but are treated with pseudoscientific and ineffective methods.

Sensitization^([6]) to (academic) failures^([7])\n\n###Some anecdotes about Adam Khoo's lessons\n\n> Then the trainer replied. First, he talked about suicide, calling it a 'stupid' and 'selfish' act…… Looking back, however, the jokes didn't help her get over her suicide ideation,……\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/\n\n> - Actual 'sob-session' involves the instructor narrating a story where a person (us) is a slob who takes everything for granted, but realises his parents are dying and he have done nothing with his life.\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0x28ib\n\n> Additionally, I was digested at certain activities and speeches during the event. One of the instructors hurled vulgarities during his speech/scolding in a half-hearted attempt to motivate a seminar of 13-16 year olds, and forced us to hold a mirror in front of us while scolding at us to force us to literally reflect upon ourselves. I vividly remember the instructor shouting angrily at us to 'wake up' and to 'stop disappointing everyone around you'. I believe the scolding can be done at home, what was the point of this at all?\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7r7dhe\n\n> being told that they should aim for JC or get a lower salary.\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rgvu1/\n\nTechnically, the techniques can be wildly effective if it works for the student,^([8]) but if it doesn't work, it can inflict a lot of psychological harm to the student. Even if it works, in the long-term, this isn't good for mental health as well.^([9]) Unless the facilitator knows the audience very well, using these techniques on unsuspecting participants is crazy.\n\nFirst, one of his techniques may include arousing guilt and feeling ashamed of your not-so-wonderful performance by scolding some of you with vulgarities with the aid of props like mirrors so you can look into the mirror and reflect upon yourself,^([10]) or he has a sobbing session so that you will be ashamed of your incompetence at the expense of your parents' hardwork.^([11])\n\nSecond, he always practices fearmongering or anticipated guilt^([11], [12], [13], [14], [15]) and one example is telling you things like aim for JC instead of Polytechnic because you are more successful if you go JC.^([11], [16])\n\nThese 2 practices result in sensitization towards failure. I'm not sure whether it is part of his bigger strategy or unintended consequence, but it is what it is.\n\n###The problems with these techniques\n\n**1) Ignores the contributing/other factors to the problem**\n\nLet's take suicide as an example. **You will never see a medical expert describing suicide as the following:** ^([17])\n\n- selfish\n- stupid\n- cowardly or weak\n- a choice\n- a sin\n\nThe reason is that most of the time, suicide is actually not a decision nor someone's free will. It is not a choice if you do not have an ability to make a rational decision due to intense emotional pain, hopelessness and a narrowed, negative view of the future interferes with balanced decision-making. They usually only can think of better choices when the crisis is resolved.^([18])\n\nWhen he makes such remarks, he is affirming to the suicidal person that indeed no one really cares about him/her^([19]) and the purpose of him/her existence is to please others. Even though he did talk about how it would impact the person's family, but the effectiveness is diluted by his insensitivity.\n\nFor academic performance, while the primary factor is typically up to the individual's mindset, there may also be other factors that results in the student not doing well academically. He got it right with suggesting a learning technique, the mind map,^([8], [20]) but learning is not all about mind map.^([11], [21], [22], [23])\n\nMaybe because pace of learning? The type of teacher? (Like too fierce so no one dare to ask too much?) The efficacy of the teaching? The helpfulness of the resources (like notes)? The student is not yet to mastered a particular topic results in he/she having difficulty understanding a higher level of the topic?\n\n**2) It is very destructive and/or traumatizing to the student if he/she fails to achieve the goal**\n\nAfter spending so much time fearmongering and creating anticipated guilt towards non-performing, the students will be shattered once he/she falls into the description he contrives. Idk, low salary? Shameful?\n\nIt will make the student feel like a degenerate, and depends on how immersed he/she is in his course, worst case scenario could consider suicidal.\n\n**3) Even if it works, it is very unhealthy mentally** ^([24], [25])\n\nAssuming that the student has good performance, motivation driven by fears will make the students lose touch with humanity to be over-focused on performance. Overzealousness is never good.\n\nStudying by itself is already stressful. Still have to be stressed over minimum expectations? That is double whammy.\n\nExcessive stress will give you another set of problems.\n\n**TL;DR:** These techniques may be very effective if it works, but whether it works or not, it is very harmful. It's very unpopular technique and you rarely see a professional use it this much. If they ever use, it's carefully planned and/or consensual usually on a case-by-case basis.\n\n---\n\nMotivational speakers should always be positive^([26], [27], [28]). That is the best they can do, unfortunately. However, they cannot be too fake and use too much exaggerations or too unrealistic scenarios/examples/expectations lest it's toxic positivity.^([29]) They have to be realistic. The goal of them is to motivate you.\n\nI hope motivational speakers can invest time to incorporate the talk with stress management since nowadays students are quite stressed. If you are mentally good, then you could perform better.\n\n[1]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/creative-synthesis/201501/shame-and-motivation-change\n[2]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268449831_Shame_and_motivation_to_change_the_self\n[3]: https://www.healthwriterhub.com/fear-mongering-in-the-media/\n[4]: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2005.tb00879.x\n[5]: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188781\n[6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization\n[7]: https://intuitivehaven.com/what-failures-taught-this-highly-sensitive-person-about-life/\n[8]: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0x1m4c/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[9]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rk7hq/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[10]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7r7dhe/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[11]: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0x28ib/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n[12]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7r4ksa/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[13]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7s0cy3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[14]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rq566/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[15]: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0xag0w/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[16]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rgvu1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[17]: https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/how-to-talk-about-suicide#Not-every-word-can-be-taken-back-easily-or-in-time-\n[18]: https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/700childrens/2019/11/suicide-is-not-a-choice\n[19]: https://www.elitefts.com/education/training/bodybuilding/its-time-to-stop-calling-suicide-selfish/\n[20]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7qrame/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[21]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rnsza/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[22]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7sgo5v/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[23]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7tndry/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[24]: https://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/1364/healthy-guilt-unhealthy-guilt.html\n[25]: https://www.nicabm.com/guilt-vs-shame/\n[26]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15250815/\n[27]: https://www.bestow.com/blog/toxic-positivity/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796715300814\n[28]: https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf\n[29]: https://www.bestow.com/blog/toxic-positivity/"", 'Hahaha, credits to OP (u/owlcovesg), he is the hardworking one to have researched it and linked a post with your comment.', 'To prove mind over matter or something, it is meant to be motivational after all.

Another two charges of causing a public nuisance were taken into consideration for his sentencing.\n\n> These include Lim uploading a post containing four photographs of him posing with and sniffing pink female underwear with the caption “Public panty sniffing”, and another post he uploaded onto the same account two photographs of a pink female underwear, with a caption “Block 356 Tampines Street 33”.\n\n> On another occasion last year, after coming across a pair of black shorts on a clothing rack, he masturbated and ejaculated on the shorts. On 14 August last year, he posted a picture of it on his Instagram account with the caption, “Public pcc onto black shorts.” The letters “pcc” referred to the sexual act in Hokkien.\n\n> Lim’s Instagram account could be viewed by the public at the time and caused a total of 38 police reports to be lodged against him on the “I-witness” platform alone.\n\n> He was diagnosed with Fetishistic Disorder involving a fetish for female clothing and a “predilection for female intimate wear”, according to an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist, who provided a report on 24 September last year.\n\n> The IMH report also found that Lim was not intellectually disabled and that he was not of unsound mind at the time.\n\n> Lim’s photos generated an outcry from other Instagram users and he soon deleted them.\n\n> Amongst the police reports lodged against him was one, made on 15 August last year, that stated, “This guy like sexually harassing ppl. He go take their clothing and c** on it or some s**t. He got come and harass ppl around the area I study in. Pls arrest him or something. I don’t want my friends to get harassed. Thank you."" The complaint included a screenshot of Lim’s Instagram profile.\n\n> On 16 August last year, Lim was arrested at his residence, which was searched. His mobile phone was sent for forensic examination and found to contain four obscene video files. Lim admitted to downloading them.\n\n> Deputy Public Prosecutor Sean Teh said that Lim’s Instagram profile was available for anyone to view and had caused significant public annoyance. He sought a fine of $5,000.\n\n> Lim’s lawyer David Nayar said that his client’s photos had “spread like wildfire” and it had not been his intention for them to be seen that way. He pointed out that a member of the public would have to search for his name in order to access the photos.\n\n> Lim, who used to be a Grab driver, was currently unemployed and undergoing psychiatric treatment under IMH, showing his intent to rid himself of his fetish, said the lawyer.\n\n> Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore\'s Telegram channel at http://t.me/YahooSingapore\n\n> Related story\n\n> Man who allegedly posted on Instagram of him sniffing panties further remanded for psychiatric observation\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'Lol', ""> He was diagnosed with Fetishistic Disorder involving a fetish for female clothing and a “predilection for female intimate wear”, according to an Institute of Mental Health psychiatrist, who provided a report on 24 September last year.

Inevitable_Homework,iqmrkz,diagnosing Adult ADHD in Singapore?,2020-09-11 16:40:20,singapore,378959,42,28,"**(edit 1/7/2021)** Hello again! Unfortunately due to personal reasons I had to postpone this appointment to around the end of this year. Just an update in case anyone is waiting!

—-

**(Edit 28/4/21)** Hello! I have been receiving PMs from many regarding how I'm doing now so I'm back with an update!

IMH ended up calling me 1-2 months after my first disappointing appointment with them and informed me an ADHD doctor has taken on my case and if I'd like to schedule with them. My next appointment will be in July 2021 - I'm still waiting on that SMS update!

It's going to be a session for the doc to put me through various tests and to determine if I truly do have ADHD. The cost this time will be around $200.

I will make an updated post when the time comes. Thank you all for still checking in with me, and stay safe!

\---

**(small edit):** Wow! Thank you for the response and discussion - I wasn’t expecting much when I posted here but I’m happy to see my fellow singaporeans with similar experiences. Will leave this post up in case anyone else in the future needs it

also, I’d like to say that someone working in IMH ward reached out to me and after reading their message + thinking about it, perhaps the nurse who told me about the “questionnaire” and how “their doc will get back to me if they find my case convincing enough” misspoke or couldn’t explain to me in the proper way regarding the process. And I’ll take into account of the current covid period slowing down everything

\---

**Original Post:**

I’m a working adult in my early 20s looking for a trustworthy doctor for an ADHD assessment. Went to IMH with polyclinic referral and after filling up my information + a mcq about why I suspect I have ADHD, they told me their specialists will get back to me about the assessment IF they find my case convincing enough. Hadn’t got back to me in months so I’m looking somewhere else.

Honestly I just wanted to check myself out (have symptoms from childhood to present that lines up with ADHD) as it took me 6 years to check for depression (and almost went through with suicide before I sought help too). If I have ADHD then I’ll seek treatment, if not then cool - one less thing to worry about

Money and fees aren’t the problem - I’m prepared to fork over $250+ for the consultation. But I would at least like to get a reliable doctor who won’t shirk on my assessment and take it seriously. I’ve read what little reviews, forums and first hand accounts about existing gov and private sg psychiatrist experiences (a lot of them are pretty negative) and there’s not enough info for me to make a decision.

So any recommendations on doctors(gov or private) about Adult ADHD?",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iqmrkz/diagnosing_adult_adhd_in_singapore/,"['Buy insurance first. There might be exclusions if you buy post diagnosis', 'Absolutely loved Dr Clarice Hong from Raffles Medical. She diagnosed me and has worked with many ADHD patients so she really gets them.

Very liberating to finally figure yourself out.', 'Hi there, my boyfriend who’s from the US has ADHD. He was prescribed Adderall there but it’s a Class 1 drug here (banned) so he went to a private doctor (Dr BL Lim) instead to get Ritalin. \n\nI just want to say I’m sorry that it took this long to diagnose you but I also want to say that the assistance they provide here for mental health is ridiculous. For him, he could get a prescription of Addy for $20 a month with 1-2 high dosage pill a day, but here he pays around $200-$400 per month on Ritalin (they don’t have high dosage here so he has to take 4 pills a day to be equivalent to 1 pill of addy), not including consultation fees. It legit breaks your bank. Right now he’s deciding to ask for a prescription script so that he can fill out at pharmacies like Watson’s etc, but soon he’s going to go to hospitals for a cheaper alternative. I would suggest private though, as it is definitely a faster way to get your diagnosis, and like you said, money doesn’t matter to you! \n\nWish you all the best! If you need any other help with diagnosing ADHD and how to cope with it, I’m sure my boyfriend can help.', 'I also admitted myself to IMH but they rejected my application', 'My experience with the polyclinic-IMH route was really different though.\n\nThe wait after the first appointment was quite long iirc, took like two months after the polyclinic consult, and a month after the initial IMH test. I expect it might be delayed even longer due to Covid-19? From what I recall, the ADHD specialist (Dr. Bhanu) was quite in-demand and the appointment queue to see him was quite long.\n\nAnyway, it was smooth sailing after that. Filled up the MCQ, then was told to bring my childhood report cards and the contacts of someone who knew me when I was young (parents, in my case) in a week. A week later, I was officially diagnosed and started testing dosages of the meds.', '1. Go private\n2. Go private\n3. NUH has more specialists in rarer conditions.

Thanks for sharing your experience here, although I\'m quite disappointed by their attitude. This ""we\'ll contact you in a few months if we believe you"" bs would never fly for any physical illnesses. Unfortunately, we live in a place like Singapore, and it\'s also probably why people like us manage to seek (and not 100% get) treatment for ADHD only in our 20s.\n\nBtw I couldn\'t find good info online regarding this- is it true that you can get subsidised fees once you have a referral from a Polyclinic?', 'Hey Dr BL Lim. His name was mentioned a couple of times during the time i was searching for a private psychiatrist. Do buffer twice the amount for first consultation and meds. Also might be worthwhile researching your company insurance. I got a referral from Raffles medical > raffles hospital. To my surprise it was completely covered. Privacy side of things tho, HR will be privy to quite a bit of details (in order for them to process those reimbursement/coverage)', 'Hello OP. first of all, thank you for starting this thread, this would be very helpful for other redditors in singapore who are considering to be assessed for suspected ADHD. \n\nMy experience with ADHD diagnosis as an adult is quite different from yours, quite smooth sailing i would say. I was diagnosed in 2017, in the beginning of yr 2 uni. Likewise, i also went by the “polyclinic referral to IMH” channel for my evaluation. While I can’t recall the wait time between that and my first consultation with the psychiatrist (Dr Chua Sze Ming), I was prescribed with concerta (the slow-release pill) on my first visit. Didn’t have to show any physical report cards etc. My subsequent visits to the psychiatrist, apart from stocking up on meds, are mostly to find out the dosage and frequency of medication intake that works best for me. Oh, I also got to try Ritalin and Medikinet, but went back to concerta eventually despite it being the most expensive out of the three. \n\nI can’t recommend any psychiatrists because i’ve only worked with that same psychiatrist, who diagnosed my ADHD, to optimise my medication intake. There isn’t any comparison which i can make to give you a recommendation. \n\nWell, with regards to how Covid has affected their operations.. What I heard during my recent visit (in july), was that psychiatrists are to stay in their designated clinic/healthcare facility, instead of the usual multiple-location posting in a typical week. This is one of the measures taken due to Covid. That might contribute to the delayed response from IMH side which you’re currently experiencing.', 'Got referred to imh through polyclinic and got my ritalin the first visit. I was super prepared though (had report books and incidents and stuff). Unfortunately, i do not believe there is a confirm test for ADHD. This [test](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/npr2.12106) comes close but it is not foolproof or recommended as a diagnostic tool. Also ADHD affects everyone quite differently, which makes it even harder to pinpoint an exact test to confirm the diagnosis, so if you want to use it the psy have to agree with it.\n\nIs your visit met by a psychologist or a psychiatrist? The former may not diagnose mental disorders while the latter can, and may prescribe drugs along with it.

And while i’m happy to see some people getting their treatment and medication i wish that everyone has the equal chance to be diagnosed as well\n\nAnd yes, you’ll get subsidies with a polyclinic referral. My experience went like this: I got an appointment with a local polyclinic, went in and told the doc about suspecting myself to have adhd and would like to get a referral for an assessment (you can tell the doc a particular hospital or imh. I told mine straight up IMH). Your polyclinic doc would probably ask you several questions and for you to describe your symptoms and history.\n\n(if you don’t tell the doc which place to go, i think they will recommend you to the one they think is for the best. but some i heard will get you to go for their in house psychiatrist if they have them - it’s a shoot or miss tbh. heard a lot of horror stories about the experience too so be careful, be sure to voice out your opinion)\n\n\nAfterwards, they’ll make you an appointment with the place you picked and give you a referral letter/form. DO NOT LOSE THAT PAPER - I gotta bring it with me to IMH and show it so I only pay the subsidised fee\n\nOh and also, you have to pay for the polyclinic consultation. Around $10, I believe \n\nthen I paid only $50 at IMH (just the consultation fee), whereas the full unsubsidised consultation fee is about $150-$250. Medication will cost you separately. I’m pretty sure medication can be subsidised as well but you gotta check\n\nalso i can only find little info about this but i think polyclinic referral only applies to Government hospitals/medical centres like IMH, NUS, CGH, etc and not private ones\n\nwishing you all the best!', "">throwapie\n\nSurprised to hear about insurance coverage.

I’m pretty sure my doc wasn’t experienced bc all she did was to skim through my report books before she called another doc into the room, then both asked if i need medication. then told me they’ll appoint me to their “specialist” for an assessment\n\ni still find it weird thinking about it', 'There is unfortunately no 100% cure for ADHD. Medication is only to help you get it under control via your brain/hormone chemicals - and it honestly depends on which Medication works for you. Hence, Doctor will usually give you small doses and get you to try out different ones to figure out which ones works, and which ones will give you side effects. It’s all trial and error.\n\nOther methods of coping with ADHD are probably daily habits or techniques to help you break down chores to manageable portions. You can look up ADHD coping techniques!', 'Hello! \n\nIMH actually got back to me just in Jan and I was reserved a consultation in July 21, and I am planning to make a follow up post after then.\n\nAs for private consultations, I unfortunately cannot give you an answer but would recommend you to take a look at the answers on this post as there are a few recommendations on private doctors.\n\nIt’s unfortunate for covid to affect this, but I would recommend waiting until it’s all over before trying again (if you’re in a rush, then you’d have to go private - but do note that will cost you at least around $300+)', '[removed]', 'I think he not diagnosed yet.', ""You're welcome~ Absolutely. Many had this perception that once you get diagnosed, it's all about justifying your issues. But I think diagnosis is more of being able to streamline and look up ADHD/ADD specific solutions for ADHD/ADD specific problems. I would also say ADHD/ADD medication, unlike SSRIs or lithium (which take so much trial and error as well as a very long adjustment period), drastically improves your lifestyle and self esteem by aiding you in achieving your potential without your brain sabotaging you. Google additudemag for resources if you get diagnosed for ADHD/ADD , very educational. Best of luck to you stranger!"", ""Hey OP, I don't usually talk about my experience with IMH but I just wanted to mention what it was like for me, an adult with ADHD who got diagnosed when I was 18.\n\nFor me, it was during my medical assesment for NS where i brought up that i might have Adhd, then i got a referral to IMH. I went for the appointment, and after several months, the doctor confirmed the diagnosis (I actually happened to ask before the appointment ended if he knew or not, and he pretty much confirmed it then and there).\n\nThe next few appointments were basically to figure out my prescription dosage and after that pretty much i had an appointment every 3 months to pick up more meds.\n\nSo, while it definitely took a while, the only real trouble i had was just that. It's been pretty painless since then. Also, just a note, the last time i had a call from them was to reschedule my appointment do to covid, and it seemed like they were pretty short-staffed."", 'Holyyy thank you so much for sharing in such detail (and words of encouragement)! I really appreciate this, and I feel better knowing what to expect tomorrow :-) All the best for your treatment too.', 'I see, I hope it goes well for you. The IMH doctor said they could not do anything until the ADHD part was reopened and said they had no idea when, and also tried to prescribe me anti-depressants despite me saying I did not have depression, so right now I am at a bit of a loss and looking for alternatives. Hopefully the ADHD clinic has reopened in July when you go to consult, thanks for your fast reply.', 'damn... the possibility of insurance purposely rejecting people with diagnosed mental health issues is so trashy', 'First time round? Did you eventually get to apply one successfully?', 'Hey man thank you for sharing. I really appreciated it and now I know what to anticipate for when going through for ADHD tests. I’m happy to hear that you got your diagnosis and having access to the proper medication \n\ntbh, I get the shortage of manpower + long waiting times, especially through covid. I’m just irked because of what the nurse told me after my appointment when she got me to fill up the form. “our doctors will get back to you if they decide that your case/mcq form is convincing enough” i know it’s not her fault but i was like wtf??? why are you determining a potential adhd person through a form and not even a face to face evaluation???\n\nbut eh, it be like that sometimes, nothing i can do but to search elsewhere', 'no problem haha! when i was researching about the process on getting adhd and depression diagnosis in sg i felt super lost due to the lack of information, so you can imagine how frustrating and terrifying it was for me to go through this by myself when i have no experience at all. i remember wishing that i could find a detailed account/step-by-step on what to expect so i won’t be so anxious \n\ni’m glad to hear that this helped you, and that anyone else who chances upon this reddit post in sg will feel better reading about my experience :-)', '[removed]', ""Thank you again for being such a wholesome human being :D Also, sorry but I have one more question to ask if you don't mind- will I have to confirm the date and time of my visit to IMH (or wherever) during the polyclinic consultation itself? Or can I decide that on a separate occasion myself and book with IMH separately?"", 'How Long ago was this? Can try again if it’s more than 2 years. \n\nFor financial planning CI payouts is to cover short term loss of income.

IMH did send me a confirmation SMS afterwards as well (even though I was told they would call me). I think it depends on your polyclinic but that’s all I can tell you - again, don’t be afraid to just ask your doc any questions regarding the process!', ""I just went today and got my referral! I requested to defer it by 4 months so I could get my insurance sorted out first, haha. Thank you for the info you shared.

So yeah, basically I have no one to talk to, which I'm fine with, but I recently am having more frequent ""anxiety attacks"" with increased intensity at school and stuff like that and well, my teachers want me to get help.

Isotopes: atoms of the same element with same number of protons and electrons, but different number of neutrons

Ionic Bond: the electrostatic force of attraction between 2 oppositely charged ions formed as a result of the complete transfer of one or more electrons from one atom to another.

Covalent Bond: the electrostatic force of attraction that two neighbouring nuclei have for a localised pair of electrons shared between them.

Metallic bond: the electrostatic force of attraction that two neighbouring metal ions have for the delocalised electrons between them.

Co-ordination number: the maximum number of atoms that can be placed around a central atom/ion.

Partial Pressure: the pressure that a gas would exert if it alone occupied the container.

Dalton’s Law: in a mixture of gases which do not react chemically, the total pressure is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of all the gases making up the mixture.

Arrhenius acid: a substance which dissociates in water to give hydrogen ions.

Arrhenius base: a substance which dissociates in water to give hydroxide ions.

Bronsted-Lowry acid: a species which donates proton to a base

Bronsted-Lowry base: a species which accepts proton from an acid

Standard enthalpy change of formation: the enthalpy change when one mole of the compound is formed from its elements under standard conditions

Standard enthalpy change of combustion: the enthalpy change when one mole of a substance is completely burnt in oxygen under standard conditions

Standard enthalpy change of hydration: the enthalpy change when one mole of a the gaseous ions is dissolved in a large amount of water under standard conditions

Standard enthalpy change of solution: the enthalpy change when one mole of substance dissolves in a large volume of solvent that addition of more solvent produces no further change under standard conditions

Standard enthalpy change of atomisation: The enthalpy change when an element or compound is converted into one mole of free gaseous atoms under standard conditions

Standard enthalpy change of neutralisation: the enthalpy change when one mole of water is formed in the neutralisation between an acid and an alkali, the reaction being carried out in aqueous solution under standard conditions

Lattice energy: the heat energy evolved when one mole of crystalline solid is formed from its separate gaseous ions under standard conditions

First electron affinity: The enthalpy change when an electron is added to each atom in a mole of gaseous atoms to form singly charged negative ions

Bond energy: The energy required to break one mole of a covalent bond between two atoms in the gaseous state.

Hess Law: The enthalpy change in a chemical reaction is the same whether the change is brought about in one stage or through intermediate stages.

Entropy: The measure of disorder in a system

Homogeneous catalysis: both catalyst and reactants are in the same physical state

Heterogeneous catalysis: the catalyst and reactants are in different physical states

Enzyme: a protein which has catalytic function and is highly specific in its catalytic activity

Rate of reaction: The change in concentration of reactants or products per unit time

Rate constant: a constant of proportionality in the rate equation

Order of reaction: the power to which the concentration of that reactant is raised to in the experimentally determined rate equation.

Half-life: The time taken for the concentration of a reactant to fall to half of its original value.

Buffer solution: a solution whose pH remains almost unchanged when small amounts of base or acid is added to it

Disproportination: a redox reaction in which both oxidation and reduction of the same element occurs

Standard cell potential: A measure of the tendency of electrons to flow through the external circuit under standard conditions of 25 C, 1 Bar and the 1.00mol dm\^3 concentration. It is the maximum potential difference between the electrodes.

Functional group: a group of atoms within a compound, who’s reactions dominate the chemistry of the molecule, and so gives the characteristic properties.

Nucleophile: species which contain a lone pair of electrons and are attracted to regions of positive charge or electron deficient sites.

Electrophile: electron deficient species which can accept electrons and are attracted to regions of negative charge or electron rich sites.

Dynamic Equilibrium: the rate of the forward reaction is equal to the rate of the backward reaction and there is no net formation of reactants or products

le chatelier's principle: states that when a system in dynamic eqm is subjected to change, the system will react in a way so as to partially offset the effect of the disturbance and re-establish a new eqm.

electronegativity: the ability of an element to attract a shared pair of electrons to itself in a covalent bond.

Radical (organic chem): A radical is an atom/group of atoms with at least 1 unpaired electron in its valence shell.

Though should this kind of thing happen again, you could look up for grounding techniques (the 54321 one) which I hope could help you tide through the episode.\nLast but not the least, don’t worry about the driving thing!

jojoyo1999,jugpfb,"College is hard, and these are my struggles in NUS",2020-11-15 13:22:07,nus,21233,14,213,"I am going to say it. College sucks. The reason? My deteriorating mental health. In my freshmen year, I was consistently stressed out and overwhelmed by the academic pressure. My anxiety and distress were perpetuated by a highly competitive school environment. My only haven on campus was my dorm room, where I could cry freely away from prying eyes. I would experience multiple mental breakdowns within a week and my only source of comfort was advice from online threads. I did share my struggles with family and friends. However, they could not empathize with me because they were in different phases of life. Having almost no friends in college made it difficult to share my struggles openly as well.

&#x200B;

(I originally posted this article on my website, but I thought I would share it here. I want to reach out to fellow students who may feel the same way as I do, but do not have people that empathize with them.)

&#x200B;

Over the year, I realized that my emotions are valid. I cannot discount them just because the people around me do not understand how I feel. It was the lack of support in my freshmen year that empowered me to start my website. I wanted to create a space for struggling students like myself and reassure them that they are not alone.  We all doubt ourselves privately but believe that we are alone in thinking this way. It is because no one else really voiced their doubts. This article is meant to detail my struggles and how these struggles defined my college life.

&#x200B;

## Suffering from Imposter Syndrome (Believing I Did Not Deserve A Place in College)

Do you feel that you are not smart enough to be in college? Do you consistently compare yourself with the people around you? Do you feel like the only person who does not have their shit together? I admit that I am very guilty of all the above. Enrolling into NUS was a game-changer as I grew up attending neighborhood schools. Here, I am competing with students from better ranking schools and are from the cream of the crop. They were better prepared at managing the academic rigor of higher education. They too were more resourceful and adjusted faster to university. Despite coming from the same education system as them, I felt intimidated and under-equipped to manage this tricky situation.

&#x200B;

My self-esteem plummeted throughout my freshman year. I was consistently comparing myself to my peers. Many students were on gifted or scholarship programs, excelling in professional networking, participating in academic competitions, or holding a high committee position. Meanwhile, I had no other achievements that could supplement my portfolio. The demanding curriculum made it difficult to take on extra commitments because I needed time to study. My lack of time caused me to question my intelligence. Was it because I am not smart enough to comprehend concepts quickly? Was it because I am not good enough to in NUS? Maybe I should just accept the fact that I am a failure compared to my classmates. With each passing day, my mind would continue to spiral with these negative thoughts.

&#x200B;

Upon enrollment, I realized I was younger than most of my peers. Many people within the cohort were older due to various reasons. To add to my anxiety, my frantic mind assumed that my young age was a disadvantage. I started to nitpick on my mistakes. After all, experience in life comes with age. If I made a wrong decision, was it because of my lack of maturity? If I said or did the wrong things, was it because I am ignorant? This mindset affected my ability to perform in school. It was difficult to voice my ideas and opinions in group projects because I believed that I lacked wisdom and judgment. I had concluded that perhaps I should not even be in college.

&#x200B;

Every day, I felt that I did not deserve my place in NUS. It seemed like there are way more qualified individuals than myself, and I was accepted because I was lucky. Even if I performed well on a task in school, I would attribute it to hard work instead of my intelligence. There was a nagging doubt that I did not earn my accomplishments using my intellect. Self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy would continue to plague me for the majority of my freshmen year.

&#x200B;

In hindsight, I was likely suffering from imposter syndrome. It is said to occur among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success. This experience is common among individuals who are starting a new and challenging position. Imposter phenomenon is not a mental disorder. Instead, it is a reaction to external stimuli or events. Imposter syndrome is having the feeling of phoniness and believing that you will be found as a fraud. Instead of acknowledging my abilities, I often attributed my successes to external forces. When I am around schoolmates, I often fear that they would uncover my lack of abilities and expose my incompetence. Despite obtaining decent grades in school, I continued to doubt my capabilities. It seemed as though no threshold would put these feelings to rest.

&#x200B;

## How Did I Manage Imposter Syndrome?

Now, I believe that the first step to solving any problem is recognizing that there is a problem. It was in semester 2 of my freshman year when I started to recognize my unhealthy thought patterns. I had placed a large emphasis on success and achievements and was constantly under tremendous pressure to perform. After all, I wanted to make up for the perceived lack of capability between me and my peers. Constant comparison between myself and them, me nitpicking my failures and my feelings of inadequacy perpetuated the problem. How did I recognize that I was suffering from imposter syndrome? My father reminded me that the pressure I was under was created by only myself. It then dawned on me that perhaps, I was being too hard on myself. Then, I still could not name what I was feeling. The term imposter syndrome was introduced when I was in Year 2.

&#x200B;

Acknowledging the limitations of my competence and capabilities improved my mental health significantly. Previously, I was caught up in chasing the goals and expectations others had set for themselves. Whenever I fell short of those expectations, I was reminded of my ineptness. Coming to terms with the fact that I am just not as intelligent, talented, or capable as others have relieved the pressure to perform on the same level. Why was I stuck in the cycle of chasing expectations that were determined by other people? Should not I be comparing my achievements to my expectations? This realization broke the chains of despair that had been holding me back for the entire academic year. My academic progress was on track with the goals I had set, and I did not fall short of my expectations. I had been so caught up in the rat race that I forgot to ask myself why I was in it.

Do gauge where you stand in the cohort within the first few weeks of school. From there, decide whether you want to join the crazy study grind or take things easy. Reaching this decision early can help you to deal with the overwhelming stress and competition in college better. In NUS, there are also counseling services at the university counseling center. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the academic pressure, talking to a counselor or therapist may help you to cope better. Do note that there is a long wait time (about one month) for services at the counseling center.

&#x200B;

Remember that you are not to be defined by any assignment, exam, or GPA. You are bigger than that. We want the effort we put into studying to be validated, but this validation does not have to come from grades. It hurts when we do not get what we work hard for, but it does not mean that we will not be successful in the future.

&#x200B;

## Feeling Lonely in University

If asked to describe college, the word lonely is an unlikely adjective. After all, college is meant to be fun and exhilarating and the media reinforces this concept continuously. Like everyone else, I was excited to enroll in college and have the best time of my life. I was ready to drink, party, and make lifelong friends. I am young, in my prime, and ready to have fun. What could go wrong?

&#x200B;

I joined several freshmen orientation camps and met numerous people. My contact list grew longer and my followers on Instagram increased significantly. As the academic year started, I was kept busy for the first few weeks as I attended school fairs and welcome events. Eager to partake in the robust co-curricular activities my school had to offer, I joined several clubs. Yet, the enthusiasm and keenness started faded away fairly quickly before recess week.

Although I enjoyed myself during orientation, I never saw some of my orientation mates again. I also stopped talking to the friends I made because they already had friend groups from high school. I did not move away from home to attend college and many students in my college were the same. Yet, none of my friends were in the same college as me so I was alone.

&#x200B;

Moreover, I felt that the friends I made in college did not put in the same effort as I did to maintain the friendship. I presume that it is because they already have friends from high school. Friends in college seem to just hang out to have fun and they have no interest to get to know one another better. Friendships formed from project groups feel transactional as well. It feels like the friendship purely serves to facilitate good teamwork.

&#x200B;

It is depressing and demoralizing to witness so many people having their closest friends with them. Together, they can create memories while they experience the ups and downs of college. I cannot help but feel alienated from the very community I am in. It is the feeling that nobody is there for me when I want to socialize or hang out with someone. I have friends outside of school but the situation I am in perpetuates the feeling of loneliness. Moreover, freshmen year can be a breeding ground for Instagram posts. I would open my app and see uploads of people having fun and enjoying themselves. Although the posts may not reflect the emotions others feel all the time, it is still difficult to dissociate the feeling that others are having fun, but I am not.

&#x200B;

## How do I Cope with Loneliness?

I am learning to be comfortable alone and it is difficult. However, I do realize the slew of benefits that comes with being alone and I am trying my best to focus on the good. FOMO is real but I do not have to let it control my life. Being alone has nothing to do with my personality, my ability to make friends, or loving myself.

&#x200B;

I used to consume mindless entertainment or spend my time with fair-weathered friends whenever I felt lonely. These temporary comforts brought nothing but emotional unfulfillment. In hindsight, I deprived myself of precious self-reflection time. Clear answers and true internal reflection can only happen during a period of solitude with no distractions. Being alone gives me the time to better understand my thought process, understand myself, and regulate my emotions. Meanwhile, I now have the opportunity to create meaningful work and it has injected purpose into my life. I can see my loneliness for what it is instead; that I simply have time for myself to do or create what I want.

&#x200B;

There may be an expectation to meet your best friends at orientation and start school with a large group of friends. It is highly unrealistic, and it is perfectly okay if you did not find people you would vibe with. Real friends are hard to come by. That is why when we meet people we click with; we recognize that it is special and will sincerely work on the relationship.

&#x200B;

## Conclusion:

Although I cannot banish these feelings completely, I believe that we can have open conversations about the challenges students face in college. With increasing awareness of how common these experiences are, perhaps we can feel freer to be frank about our feelings and build confidence in simple truths. I am capable, I deserve to be in college, and it is okay to be alone.

Before I entered the army I guess I’ve been kinda happy… I have many hobbies (photography, sim racing, cycling, etc) with barely any issues, though I am relatively introverted. I enlisted in around August (PTP batch) and integrated pretty well (I was enjoying waking up early and actually doing PT and stuff).

Sometime later, around the first week of BMT, I started getting anxiety issues. Nausea, light headedness and stuff that stays for the duration of the day, and sometimes even a day or two. OC said something about “sinking feeling every book in”, and I assumed it was that. A few weeks later, it started getting bad. I was breaking down, having anxiety attacks almost every weekend, and I hated it even more. I started to loathe notifications and alarms (I completely turn off everything when I get home on the weekend), and any message notifications get me super anxious and depressed (even though it may be someone else’s phone). I chalked it up to burnout, which I guess happens when an introvert is forced into communal living. Around my field camp week (1st week of November), things started going real bad real fast, and I started getting more and more anxiety attacks on the weekends, and started having constant headaches and backaches (that exist to this day). 

I RSO-ed for ARI for 3 days (for a bad cough and runny nose), and spent a day in camp the entire week. I didn’t feel any better mentally, and my headache was still there. When I booked back in the following week, I had to sit out of the 24K route march because of headache and back pain. I started getting moodier, pissed off at people, and around this time I also started getting more and more pissed at myself. My bunk mates would torment me and constantly call me chao-keng for having a headache, and wouldn’t help me with tasks because they “don’t talk to chao keng”. It got bad to the point that I carried my SOG with me as a reminder of what not to do.

Then came block leave, which was honestly even more miserable. I was constantly anxious about not meeting my schedules (I had lunch with a few close friends, and went on a photography trip), but I had to work around not having an alarm clock (hate alarms). I got anxious that I would be posted to command school and have to deal with more pressure and more toxic behaviour from people. When the posting finally came out, I was slightly relieved that i didn’t manage to get to command school, but I was also really depressed because I had been posted back to my mono unit. I decided to tahan until I reported into camp to report sick, and I reported sick for my backache and headache, and lo and behold I was given 2 days LD and painkillers (that hadn’t worked for any of the pain so far). I finished the course of the painkillers and there was no change. 

I constantly questioned myself whether something was truly wrong with me; why everyone was against me 24/7 and I couldn’t do anything about it. I informed my PC and Sec Comm about my anxiety issues and they chalked it up to adjustment disorder, and told me I have no choice but to suck it up and tahan the 2 years. Fast forward 1 week, and I had 3 anxiety attacks in 1 day, and had breathing difficulties and chest pain for the day. I asked permission to RSO, and they denied, asking me to report sick in camp. I dragged myself to camp, told myself I would have one night of rest before I can finally see the MO. The next day, I reported sick, and the sec comm told me I would go in the afternoon to see the MO. Sometime through the day, OC came to talk to me and told me that I was just having adjustment issues and that I seemed fine in training day to day, and told me he wasn’t going to let me see the MO. 

I do acknowledge that I have self esteem issues and struggle to fit in at times, but surely breaking down every weekend for 2 months, losing sleep over the weekend and choosing to stay at home is more than just adjustment issues. I find it hard to relax over the weekend because I’m constantly worried about overshooting the timing. I barely have sleep because I wake up every 15 minutes and dread the alarm clock. I’ve been trying to suck it up, telling myself that other people have it worse, but it makes me feel worse that I’m feeling bad about such  “trivial” matters.

It feels to me like living day to day for other people has become the new norm, and the only time that I’m alone is when its late at night. On the weekends I have to visit my grandparents, go out to buy things for camp.

Day to day life in camp has even been more depressing. I want to rest but I have to wash clothes. Showers take twice as long because I have to mentally prepare myself for the cold water. I wake up 1.5 hours before reveille so that I can ensure I wash up before the day. I barely have time to eat at meals, and I have to battle constant headaches and  backaches. 

I honestly don’t know what to do right now, I’m at the end of the line and have run out of ideas. RSO-ing without permission could land  me with an insubordination charge, but waiting for the chain of command/MO may delay so long that I fear I may end up being suicidal in a week or two. I honestly don’t have any motivations anymore as my long term goals have been derailed. The current phase of training will last until July 2021, and it’s basically BMT on steroids, and I’m seriously already burnt out. I’m missing important family activities, and now even holidays are being planned without me. Is it even worth pushing forward for another 2 years, yielding for yet another white lie? Bookouts are a pain, and I don’t even have the time to relax or do my hobbies anymore.

SINGAPORE: Unhappy at his son-in-law for cheating on his daughter and forcing him out of the company, a man took a knife to meet the younger man and stabbed him in broad daylight at a coffee shop, later telling passers-by not to help him but let him die.

Tan Nam Seng, now 72, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Aug 20) to one count of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by stabbing 38-year-old Spencer Tuppani at 121 Telok Ayer Street in July 2017.

Tan was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time, ruminating overwhelmingly about the well-being of his daughter and having his mental responsibility for the killing significantly impaired, the prosecution said.

The court heard that Tan was semi-retired at the time of the offence. He had founded a port management services company TNS Shipping in 1974 and expanded it over the years in a family-run business that saw his three daughters working for him.

After Mr Tuppani married Tan's eldest daughter in 2005, he began working for Tan as well in one of the companies. 

The company did not perform well for four years from 2012, and when business improved in 2016, Mr Tuppani suggested selling it to a bigger corporation. Tan left the sale to his son-in-law as he was contemplating retirement.

Leading up to the sale, Mr Tuppani persuaded some of the shareholders including his wife and the accused to assign their shares to him to boost his stake in the company, so the buyer of the company would not have control of it.

They agreed and the sale went through, with Mr Tuppani appointed CEO of the firm in December 2016. However, Tan was unhappy as he received only about S$450,000 from the sale of his shares.

**VICTIM HAD AFFAIR WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, HAD TWO KIDS WITH HER**

In early 2017, his daughter found out that Mr Tuppani had been having an affair with another woman and had two children from the affair. Mr Tuppani had three other kids with Tan's daughter.

They agreed to get a divorce, but still lived together in the same household as Tan, frequently quarrelling over issues linked to the split.

Subsequent events led Tan to believe that Mr Tuppani was planning to cheat him of his business, by divorcing his daughter after taking control of all the shares.

He began feeling miserable, ruminating excessively about his son-in-law's actions and was unable to sleep at night, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Jian Yi.

At around lunchtime on Jul 10, 2017, Tan went to the company's office at Cecil Court, and saw Mr Tuppani having a meal at a coffee shop at 121 Telok Ayer Street as he was driving past.

Angry that his son-in-law had been ignoring and avoiding his attempts to discuss business matters, which he considered disrespectful, Tan decided to confront the younger man.

He was shown in closed-circuit television footage, played in court on Thursday, entering the office and rummaging around in the pantry before retrieving a knife which he kept in his sling bag.

**THE STABBING**

He went to the coffee shop, where his son-in-law was having lunch with three friends. After Mr Tuppani greeted him, Tan confronted the younger man and said in Hokkien: ""You are too much.""

Tan swiftly took out the 22cm-long knife from his bag and stabbed Mr Tuppani three times in quick succession, as seen in clips played in court. His daughter was in the public gallery, dressed in black.

Mr Tuppani ran towards Boon Tat Street while pursued by his father-in-law. He was shown stumbling and getting up along a shop before collapsing.   


Tan appeared soon after and stood over him. He stopped employees of the restaurant where his son-in-law had collapsed in front of, from helping the victim.

He pushed them away, saying: ""This is my son-in-law, don't help him, let him die.""

The passers-by were shown walking away, and when other passers-by tried to help, Tan told them to ""stay away"", saying: ""He has come here to die"" and ""I wish to kill him"".

Tan was shown kicking his son-in-law's face twice as Mr Tuppani lay on the floor, before waiting for the police to arrive.

While waiting, he called his daughter and told her he had stabbed the younger man thrice.

He said: ""I can't sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don't cry. I am old already. I am not scared (of) going to jail.""

His daughter cried over the phone and told her father not to do anything, but Tan replied: ""What's done cannot be undone.""

**ACCUSED WAS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER** 

The police arrived shortly after the stabbing and found Tan sitting calmly on a chair outside the restaurant with a blood-stained knife on a tray nearby and the victim lying motionless on the floor.

Tan told the police where the knife was and pointed to the victim, and said he had used the weapon on his son-in-law.

The victim was taken to hospital and pronounced dead soon after. Tan told the police in the car that he was unhappy with how the victim had mistreated his daughter, and added that he had tried approaching the victim a few times to sort things out, but things had not changed.

An autopsy found three stab wounds on the victim's shoulder and chest, with the cause of death certified as a perforating stab wound.

Tan was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and found to be suffering from major depressive disorder. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a major depressive episode.

""The accused’s pervasive dysphoric state, diminished ability to concentrate, negative cognition of helplessness, as well as overwhelming ruminations and worries about the well-being of his daughters would have adversely affected his impulse control and judgment at the time of the alleged offence, and significantly impaired his mental responsibility for the alleged murder,"" said the IMH report.

Tan, who had lost a lot of weight since his charge for the original offence of murder three years ago, is represented by lawyer Wee Pan Lee.

The prosecution asked for an adjournment to prepare more submissions for sentencing, and was granted one.

Both sides will return at a later date for sentencing.

For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Tan could be jailed for life. He cannot be caned as he is above 50.

thefibrobee,hzi4sn,"If you are suicidal, please read this.",2020-07-29 00:48:28,singapore,378959,90,438,"I’ve noticed an increase in posts or comments on here of people who have mentioned thoughts of suicide, or generally feeling helpless and hopeless in their lives. With how the Covid-19 situation has turned everyone’s lives upside down, it is of no surprise that many find their mental health at an all-time low.

Thus I’ve decided to share this edited version of what I originally wrote as a comment reply to a comment in today’s daily thread.

May it be helpful for those of us who need to hear this. 💗🙆🏻‍♀️💗

While you’ve decided to end it all, just postponing it slightly won’t make much of a difference, since if either way you do it you’ll be equally dead, so why not give yourself one last happy moment.

Going on a trip is good cos it takes you out of your current situation and during the trip you may be able to see your usual day-to-day life from outside of it which allows you to view it more objectively. 

Since an overseas trip right now (or anytime soon) is out of the question, try a staycation or whatever you can think of that will be able to take you out of your daily life at least for a couple of days. 

Oftentimes when people do that, they realise that their lives are actually not that bad after all and still worth living and holding on to hope that things may get better soon.

Taking a vacation/staycation or just taking time to do something you truly enjoy( e.g. going to the park or nature reserve, a day at a nice cafe, treating yourself to a nice restaurant meal) also allows you to be taken out of your daily grind to treat yourself and do something you enjoy. Plus getting to see the world outside your daily seemingly hopeless and helpless situation. 

With that, you may then realise that there are still things you wanna do in life and places you wanna see and people you wanna meet after all and ending your life right now will take away all opportunities to do these things. Why not return and start doing these things now in your life so that you’ll be without regrets or what-ifs.

If there isn’t any such way you can think of, if you have a private Shield plan with rider, check with your insurer if they cover inpatient psychiatric treatment. I only know that Prudential does. If so, head down to IMH and tell them you are suicidal and want to self-admit to the Sayang Wellness ward (IMH’s private ward). 

You’ll be able to start yourself on psychological and psychiatric treatment as well as go stay in a conducive environment, and the ward has really nice and caring nurses plus food is also not bad. 

If finances are an issue but this idea sounds good to you, same thing, head down to IMH and ask to be self-admitted to the MDU ward (Mood Disorders Unit). It’s a subsidised ward, but they designed it to have less of a hospital feel and more like a dorm (?), with a large common area where everyone hangs around together for meals, group therapy and activities, play board games or watch TV during free time etc. 

You can also upgrade your food to A class (they’ll charge a few bucks as a top-up per meal, back then it was $7 iirc) cos the subsidised IMH food is pretty terrible. (unless they’ve since changed it, hopefully!)

Just see it as a staycation, not a hospital admission, and as a brief respite out of whatever situation you’re facing in your daily life.

Hope this was helpful! ❤️

I say all of the above as someone who benefited from a spontaneous trip I took when I was suicidal (following after advice I had found on a website for the suicidal; I won’t share the link here cos said website also contains explanations about various methods of suicide which may not be the best for thread-OP to read now).

I’m a two-time suicide survivor (2014 & 2015), and when I was suicidal the third time back in 2017, I had found this advice and decided to put it into practice since I had nothing to lose anyway if I was really gonna off myself.

So I spontaneously gave myself my first birthday trip which was also my first solo trip, for my 31st birthday. I wouldn’t suggest to empty all your savings to do it so as to give yourself money to fall back on. I just spent money I could afford but had thus far seen as being wasteful if I were to go by myself.

What was affordable to me then (flying budget, staying in hostels, eating cheap) would be a tight budget for anyone else as I had by then exhausted all my savings on medical bills in trying to treat my chronic illness or at least bring it to a manageable level so I could restart my life again after everything was gradually halted with the diagnosis between age 27-28.

But I did splurge on paragliding (cheaper version of skydiving that’s on my bucket list; if iFly @ Sentosa is open already it’s a good alternative; I’ve also tried it before, loved it and would gladly do it again) and it was fun! 

Flying/sleeping/eating budget also did not make the trip any less good. Going solo also allowed me to travel at my own pace, doing only what I want instead of my lifelong ways of pleasing others.

And doing all of that really help bring me out of the pit of depression and I didn’t wanna end my life anymore, cos I still wanna take more trips like that. 

It also helped me to realise that putting myself first and “acting selfishly without regard for others” (what my parents said) in the end didn’t cause any trouble to anyone and overall only produced positive results so putting myself first isn’t really bad at all and I could also start to do it in my everyday life bit by bit. (But not to the point of being selfish or self-entitled of course.)

I do sincerely hope and pray my little sharing will help someone in some way. If you would like a listening ear, feel free to DM me anytime. Doesn’t have to be now, whenever you wanna talk. Even if it’s weeks after this post.

(Disclaimer: I may not reply instantly (cos at times I may be resting or napping due to my chronic fatigue and pains) so if that happens please don’t feel like i ghosted you. I definitely will get back to you as soon as I can, yeah.)

Sending y’all some virtual hugs and much love 💗🙆🏻‍♀️💓

EDIT: Thanks all for your kind words and well-wishes! My mental health is definitely in a much better state now, and I’ll keep researching and trying ways to get my health/illnesses to a more manageable level so I can get back to some normalcy in my life. But even if it doesn’t happen, I’ll still be okay and just focus on helping myself feel better emotionally, mentally, physically, spiritually.

EDIT 2 to add: Below are the contacts of two good psychiatrists if anyone would like to see one but don’t know where to go:

- Dr Seng Kok Han (https://nobelmedicalgroup.com/nobel-psychological-wellness-centre/)

He was the very first psychiatrist I saw, I really was blessed to have landed a good doctor just from googling. Found out afterwards when I switched to IMH cos of finances that he’s really well-known among the nurses for his kindness and bedside manner. (He had left IMH for private practice not too long before I went to see him.)

- Dr Ang Yong Guan (https://paragonmedical.com.sg/practitioners_page/ang-yong-guan-psychiatry/)

His name may ring a bell cos he had stood for election under PSP for Marymount SMC. I’ve not seen him though he was the psychiatrist a friend recommended me when I was first looking for one. 

Why I didn’t go to him was cos his charges were a little over my budget. But from what I’ve heard - from that friend who was a student of Dr Ang, as well as someone else to whom I had recommended to see Dr Ang- he’s a really good psychiatrist with many years of experience which definitely helps in terms of psychiatry, as psychiatric meds require much more trial and error than meds for physical conditions, given that there are no visible signs and symptoms of the illness nor lab scans and blood tests, and it all boils down to the consultations with the doctor and him knowing what to ask to find out whether a med and its dosage is working or should things be adjusted.

- For subsidised healthcare, you’ll have to go to a Polyclinic to get a referral to a general hospital with a psychiatric dept. The two main govt hospitals for psychiatric care are IMH and NUH. So unless you’re going through a NUHS polyclinic, all others will refer you to IMH.

The other hospitals do have psych depts as well but are either privatised (eg at TTSH) or the depts are small and they can only see a limited number of patients and patients internally referred, such as if a patient gets admitted for another condition but the primary doc sees that the patient also needs psychiatric care. Things may have changed though in recent years, so don’t take my word for it.

EDIT 3 to add: Please note that Sayang ward (private) only accepts stable patients, MDU ward (subsidised) only accepts patients with mood disorders, namely major depression, dysthymia (chronic depression), anxiety, bipolar disorders, secondary mood disorder (due to a general medical condition), and substance-induced mood disorder. 

Also note that even if you meet the above, admission to MDU is dependent on review by MDU's doctors, where even though you've already seen the IMH MO after walking into IMH emergency room, you will need to undergo another consultation with a MDU doctor, after which you will be asked to wait a while for them to discuss your case before they tell you whether they can take you in, or send you back out to the IMH general wards.

EDIT 4: Also a caution on how many have said the IMH C class ward is often a traumatic experience in itself (I met patients who upgraded up to Sayang and were still reeling from their few days in C class wards). Which is so sad and ironic given that people go there to want to get better but in the end get worse cos they get triggered by the other patients and the overall depressing environment in the wards. So, if that is your only option, and if your insurance covers/your finances allow, getting warded at Mount E Orchard will def be better off than landing in a IMH C class ward. though.

In a way I was blessed to not have experienced having to be put in the C class wards before transferring. But my admissions to all the different psych wards were all between 2014-2016 so it’s already some time back.

Also, except for my MDU admission in 2015 - which was right when they first opened the ward so the whole place was empty and they filled up the beds on the male side with IMH lodgers; the real MDU patients were very little - all my other admissions I had gone to see Dr Seng at his clinic first (or called the clinic to ask what to do, after I woke up from my attempts) and I think he helped me a lot by writing a detailed referral memo and also contacting his ex-colleagues over at IMH side to smoothen the admission process for me cos he didn’t want me to get land in C class in the interim and get scared off by the unstable patients there.

Indeed, as u/OneImagination7 pointed our, mental health infrastructure is really too far behind the needs despite all the talk about many improvements and all. But I think some of the backbenchers and NMPs do consistently raise the mental health issue in parliament so let’s hope that it will improve. It HAS TO. Too many lives have been lost.

That's a good start. From here on, take a next step by seeing a professional, can be a counsellor or calling one of the helplines (see top comment). Or a bigger next step to make an appointment with a good psychiatrist or psychologist (I don't really have a good private one, and under IMH's system it's hard to choose your own psychologist).\n\nIf your financial situation allows for seeing a private doctor, try either of the doctors I recommended (not sponsored and neither doctor knows I'm posting this; this is purely out of wanting to ensure people who do step up to seek help don't end up feeling more defeated due to a bad unempathetic doctor). You can call in to ask about their current consultation rates, but typically each consult (with any private doc) would be at least $100. Dr Seng also has a clinic in AMK if Novena or Paragon is too out of the way for you.\n\nAnd yes though having a medical history of psychiatric treatment would most often lead to being rejected from insurance policies that require a medical underwriting, please do not let this stop you from getting treatment especially if you are already on the edge. \n\nAlso, other than medical insurance (i.e. Shield plan) and critical illness plans which no doubt require medical underwriting, there are now some insurers with whole life plans that do not require medical underwriting or declaration (I know Prudential has one, forgot the name. Just ask your agent for the plan without medical underwriting). They will just state in the policy docs clearly that there is no coverage for preexisting conditions. In your case, assuming you have no other medical history, you can be covered for death and permanent disability that are not caused by a psychiatric condition, for example.\n\nAnd please, do see a mental health professional or at least call one of the helplines, okay?

Especially when in your case your application is going through a recruiter. More parties involved cos the process is recruiter -> company in-house HR -> hiring manager(s), so give it more time. \n\nAnd from reading your comment, it appears that you have a tendency to overthink, I may be wrong of course, maybe you just happened to type it while you were in an angsty mood, which btw is normal yah.\n\nAnd hor, there’s a difference between “feeling hopeless about life and wishing I will die” vs “wanting to kill myself and thinking how to do it”. Usually in mental health definitions, what’s more concerning is the latter aka active suicidality. So if you aren’t doing that, you don’t have to worry. \n\nThough from reading what you wrote, I think you will benefit from therapy or at least counselling.

That’s not anything negative yeah. Many introverts tend to be more pessimistic, it’s just a personality trait. But there’s lots of good that can come out of it cos they are also naturally deep thinkers. You just have to speak to a counsellor or therapist and they can teach you techniques and give you tips to help you feel more positive about life and your job search.\n\nAlso, try not to let your job hunt be the only thing you are focusing on. With Covid, the employment market is inevitably worse esp since late last year unemployment in Sg was already at its highest for a decade or sth. \n\nPlease don’t let this cause you to be depressed but Covid will likely bring about a deep recession worldwide even after the pandemic ends, as the economic effects will ripple for a good while.\n\nSo give yourself more time, don’t keep comparing yourself to other friends who found jobs faster or blaming yourself for quitting your previous job etc. In the meantime, as another person suggested, take up some hobbies and discover new interests and things you are good at. \n\nAlso look into night courses (so that if you do get a job it won’t clash) to beef up your resume specs. Not sure which industry or profession you’re in, but as a general advice, a good course to do is python programming. Even if you don’t do anything IT-related, I’ve heard and read that it’s a very versatile computing language that can be applied in a lot of various usages outside of the typical software and web development. \n\nThings like in managing big data (this is also a big thing where there aren’t enough skilled people yet), data science (also another “hot” field now and will continue to be as more companies become aware of the benefits of it) data analytics.\n\nAlso get your Excel skills upgraded to an advanced level to be able to create macros for various uses plus pivot tables and writing formulas.\n\nMake use of the skillsfuture credits plus your free time now to improve your employability.\n\nAlso, work on improving the look of your CV - formatting works wonders! HR folks in recruitment go though hundreds of resumes a day and so we are def more likely to pay more attention to a well-formatted CV.\n\nI came across the post where someone shared Jamus Lim’s CV during the GE period which btw is a good example of an excellently formatted CV (I bookmarked it for when my health allows me to start job searching again) and I’ll put the link here for you: http://www.jamus.name/cv_lim.pdf\n\nAll the best yeah!', 'Copy pasting my reply to another comment to you cos it’s on the same topic:\n\nSo long as you don’t apply to govt sector jobs, there’s no way for an employer in the private sector to check your medical records and it’s also not illegal to not declare your psych medical history in your application.\n\nMany many people do this without any consequences so no worries, this is a hot topic that always comes up in group therapy sessions - I was a volunteer at one for some time.

Most of the newer govt hospitals don't have a psych ward (even if they have a psych dept which only sees outpatients). \n\nThe only private hospital in Sg which has a psych ward is Mount E Orchard. Note that it is a very small ward, so they may not always have capacity to take in patients. \n\nI didn't recommend Mount E Orchard in my post because I also have self-admitted there before, and in my experience, it totally did not aid in my recovery at all, except that I am under supervision to not do anything rash, and that I don't need to worry about my meals.\n\nOther than that, it's no different from a regular hospital admission. Your psychiatrist (and psychologist, if any) will come to your bedside to see you, and you just get the meds, and undergo whatever treatment or therapy one-to-one. Other than that, you are left to your own devices in the room so it was no different from when I was at home. \n\nActually it was worse in a way in my case, cos my parents came to visit me and brought their church friends along without letting me know beforehand, and all the conversations ended up triggering me.

If the ward happens to be at full capacity, I believe the common areas will likely be really packed and noisy at non-sleeping hours, and MDU’s rules are that patients can only go to the bed areas during nap time and after lights out.

Plus a continual effort to learn to practise self-love and putting myself first.\n\n[This was after a few misdiagnoses^ as various psychiatric conditions - the ultimate was being prescribed the “last resort” treatment to undergo ECT (electroconvulsive therapy) since I’ve gone through over two years of various classes of psych meds and therapy but my symptoms only worsened. Had more than ten sessions of done but to no avail and finally the IMH psychiatrist gave up and agreed to my request for a referral to a pain specialist.]\n\nI also realised that at the point of both my attempts, I actually did still want to live. What I really wanted was an escape from my pain and symptoms, and to get back my normal life. Which is common across most suicidal persons’ stories. They/we just want the pain to stop, be it emotional, mental, or physical.\n\nWhen I woke up from my first attempt, while my body was trying to detox me with endless puking, while sitting on the toilet floor hugging the WC, my first thought wasn’t any of the depressive thoughts but “OH SHIT WHAT HAVE I DONE! I don’t want to die!!”.\n\nAnd the words of the A&E doc after my second attempt is a key turning point in my mental health journey, “If you’re sure you didn’t hallucinate your attempt (I def didn’t), it’s a miracle you’re still alive and totally well (nothing could be found in my blood tests unlike the first time). Most likely somehow some of the stuff cancelled out each other but I still cannot believe it. You better thank whatever God you believe in and don’t do it again. You may not be so lucky next time.”\n\nThat made me think, “If God really had a hand in this and still has a place for me on earth despite my inabilities, then I’m not a burden after all.”\n\nFrom there I started making the firm but hard decisions to cut out the toxic triggers (for me the negative toxic messages come from my parents): I tried family therapy to no avail, then told them I needed to move out in order not to get triggered to make a third attempt.\n\nI also have periods when I block my parents on WhatsApp and sometimes even SMS and calls when they start with the blaming, gaslighting, guilt tripping talk again, or when they spam text me asking me to help her with this and that, at all hours of the day (my mum has a tendency to do this so to this day I’m still blocking her on WhatsApp so she can only call or SMS, which limits her from spamming).\n\n^ It’s unfortunately common to go through misdiagnoses first for fibromyalgia as it’s an “invisible illness” which has no scans or blood tests to show for it. It’s all dependent on whether you can find a doctor who believes you and doesn’t think “it’s all in your head” or like what IMH psychiatrist thinks “the depression manifesting as somatic symptoms do you should treat the depression and the physical symptoms will go away”.', '[deleted]', ""Yes, our environment really places a lot of emphasis on external validation.

Too bad."", '[deleted]', 'please don’t feel bad about it, mate! sometimes we all need a little bit of support, when we’re too lost to carry ourselves.\n\nand it’s completely okay to want to find out more about yourself and why you’re feeling the way you feel. I can appreciate that a diagnosis is scary, but know that there is a community here to support you every step of the way. Please also don’t feel discouraged even if you don’t end up receiving a diagnosis, or if it turns out to be nothing serious — in fact, being healthy is a good and blessed thing! Therapy and treatment can benefit anyone and everyone, no matter how big or how small the issue might turn out to be, okay? Even if it’s not depression or any other disorder, therapy can still teach you how to refine your focus and help you to understand the reasons behind lying behaviors, and work to find better habits that work for you. \n\nThe fact that you’re keen on wanting to figure yourself out and get rid of the emotional baggage that you’re carrying, is such a brave, courageous, self-aware step. I’m glad and proud, even, that you’re noticing some concerning behaviors in yourself and considering some help. \n\nI understand that you’re due for O’s this year, so I assume you’re in sec school. Would you be able to approach a school counsellor? Do you know if they have a reputation of being helpful or unhelpful? \n\nYou can seek your school counsellor out if they are known to be helpful, or see a counsellor outside of school (paid sessions, though). I would recommend JCU Psych Clinic or Care and Counselling Centre (at Hong Lim), or even visiting CHAT at SCAPE (first session is free, and they can help to refer you to an ACC wellness center where it’s most convenient for you). \n\nAlternatively, if you feel like you might need medicine, visit a polyclinic and get a referral. Some NHGP polyclinics have a psych department on-site. Otherwise, you can try a NUHS clinic if you prefer to get referred to NUH’s psych team instead of IMH. KKH also has a great psych team and might fit your demographic since you’re still below 18. \n\nmy inbox is open if you have any questions that you’d rather not put up here! rest assured that there’s no time wasted at all, we’re all here to support you and each other. x', ""What kind of writing do you do? I'm curious what kind of writing people do for a living."", 'Yes I share the same sentiment as you, and for awhile I had kept my social media set to public, on which I posted about my journey with mental health and chronic illness. \n\nBut since Dec last year my physical health got into a bad place again after having seen some improvements from Oct, and the disappointment I felt affected my mental health so I ended up taking a social media break cos going on the apps was triggering me too much, and I had no mood to post anything too. \n\nAnd since doing that, I realised that it was really beneficial for me, as it cut out a lot of the negative messages and triggers from seeing others post about their seemingly picture-perfect lives while my life has been on a halt for the last six years.\n\nAnd so I doubt I\'ll be going back to using social media as my platform to share my journey and about chronic illness and mental health. I actually started Reddit to try it as my new platform, and thus far I\'ve found it to be what I can manage. \n\nBut seeing your blog has encouraged me (thank you!) that I can start a blog too; previously I had thought ""no point, no one will read one la"", but the response to this post and my reddit comments on these matters seems to say otherwise. I shall try. Heh.', 'Yes, IMH and govt hospital and polyclinic psychiatric treatment will be in your MOH records.\n\nNo, for all other psychiatrists (all doctors in Sg have to be govt-registered to operate) aka private doctors, there will not be any record in your MOH health records. It will only be in the individual clinic’s records. So nobody nor any organisation (public or private or insurer) will be able to check unless they specifically know you are seeing a doc at that clinic. So you don’t have to declare and nobody will know anything. But don’t thereafter submit medical claim for those bills la haha (yes there are people who don’t think things through, from my HR days). \n\nAnd also don’t post publicly on your social media about this. You’ll be surprised how many companies these days check up their candidates’ social media profiles as a character reference. Cos it’s a really good look into the person outside of the interview.\n\nAnd actually, I have known of people who declared and still got the job. Even in the govt sector. (But yes generally govt sector sees lots of applicants so they only choose the best of the best, on paper anyway.) \n\nSo at the end of the day, it really depends on the organisation and your hiring manager and how forward-looking they are in terms of their views on mental health.\n\nGenerally MNCs and foreign companies fare better on that. They look mainly if you can fit into their company culture, whether you’ll be able to get the job done well. Our local companies still have lots to catch up to in many aspects, unfortunately. This pattern is typical across most Asian countries.', 'Awww I’m glad I was helpful! You are most welcome! Don’t need to be embarrassed la haha. You shared a very valid concern that many around the world are facing now. \n\nDo try some of my suggestions yah, starting with the CV formatting. If you have more job search related questions, feel free to PM me. Or just create a post on this sub, I’m sure there will be many others who will have good advice for you beyond what I’ve said. :)\n\nOnce again, all the best!', 'Yes group therapy is essentially a peer support group, where sessions are facilitated and moderated by trained peer support specialists (some are run by counsellors, case workers, etc).\n\nThere are hospital based ones, both inpatient and outpatient, which to join you need to be a patient there, and have your psychiatrist write a referral for you. \n\nNot sure about the other hospitals but IMH has many groups. MDU has it, both an inpatient and an outpatient group, the last I was in touch with things there.\n\nThere are also independent ones, though I’ll advise to only go for groups backed by a clinic or FSC or any org with trained psych professionals. \n\nI would highly recommend the groups run under Psaltcare: https://www.psaltcare.com/peer-support-services/. Though the organisation is started by a Christian doctor, it is run very professionally and independently of religion (except the Christian support group).\n\nTry the general DBSA (depression and bipolar support alliance; https://www.dbsalliance.org/) peer support groups. They are free, and also run using the internationally-recognised DBSA resources for peer support groups. \n\nPsaltcare groups have been meeting via zoom since CB, to join, apply using the form on their website, and they will contact you and add you to their WhatsApp announcement groupchat (only admins can post so don’t worry it’s not a chatting group where ppl can spam texts), where they will put up the upcoming sessions for the week, and how to join. They also introduced some zoom game sessions just to help members who may be feeling more alone with all the staying at home.\n\nNote: Group therapy/support groups are only helpful when they are well-facilitated/moderated. When it’s not, sometimes the effectiveness of a group can be brought down by just one or two perpetually negative folks who dominate or hog sessions and no matter how others try to encourage them they refuse to listen. \n\nI was ever in such a group, and actually it was the IMH MDU outpatient one, but that was back in its early days when it wasn’t very well-facilitated. The said “spoilsport” finally got banned from the group, but that was after at least a year of doing what he did, which cause many members to gradually stop attending, including me, cos instead of being helpful, I always came back from sessions feeling exhausted emotionally. Cos I usually tried to be an “encourager” to others even as a member of the group.\n\nHope this helps. All the best!', 'Yes I’ve heard how the IMH C class ward is a traumatic experience in itself (I met patients who upgraded up to Sayang and were still reeling from their few days in C class wards). Which is so sad and ironic given that people go there to want to get better but in the end get worse cos they get triggered by the other patients and the overall depressing environment in the wards. I’m sorry you had to go through that!\n\nIn a way I was blessed to not have experienced having to be put in the C class wards before transferring. But my admissions to all the different psych wards were all between 2014-2016 so it’s already some time back.\n\nAlso, except my MDU admission in 2015 - which was right when they first opened the ward so the whole place was empty and they filled up the beds on the male side with IMH lodgers; the real MDU patients were very little - all my other admissions I had gone to see Dr Seng at his clinic first (or called the clinic to ask what to do, after I woke up from my attempts) and I think he helped me a lot by writing a detailed referral memo and also contacting his ex-colleagues over at IMH side to smoothen the admission process for me cos he didn’t want me to get scared off by the unstable patients in the C class wards.\n\nAnd yes I think you are right in mentioning that getting warded at Mount E Orchard will still be better off than landing in IMH C class ward. I’ll add this bit in an edit. Thanks so much for pointing out all the things I overlooked!\n\nAnd yes I really do think mental health infrastructure is really too far behind the needs despite all the talk about many improvements and all. But I think some of the backbenchers and NMPs do consistently raise the mental health issue in parliament so let’s hope that it will improve. It HAS TO. Too many lives have been lost.\n\nI hope your mental health is in a better state now! ❤️', 'Hi there! Sorry for the long delay as I had been busy packing and then moving.

I would suggest you to start with that first, and if your psychologist thinks you need to see a psychiatrist to get started on meds as a two-pronged approach, then do so.\n\nReason being, that it can take a (possibly long) trial and error period before your doctor and you find the right meds and dosages that work for you. And the trial and error period can sometimes make you seem worse  than when you started out, cos of negative side effects. \n\nAnd once you're on meds, most also are hard to come off, requiring several months of very gradual tapering down to prevent withdrawal symptoms. \n\nI personally experienced several A&E visits due to withdrawal symptoms (crazy migraines, vomiting, dizziness, etc) back when I tried seeing a TCM and upon the physician's urging, I tried to quit my western meds.

They may be able to refer you to someone. If not, try trawling through the thread cos I clearly remember seeing someone’s comment including some psychologist/therapy clinic names.

My precious therapist facilitates at the JCU Psych Clinic. My sister’s therapist used to work with the criminal justice system and now lectures for universities. \n\nIt’s a steeper price but you pay for their expertise, but definitely only if you can afford it.\n\nIf you find like your current therapist in uni is good, you might want to ask them if they are practicing outside of campus, and if so, you can continue sessions with them there for continuity. Otherwise, do remember to ask for treatment notes / records if possible, so that you can pass them on to your next therapist for them to know what you’ve been working on — it’s easier than starting afresh, especially if your current treatment techniques are working well for you.', 'I see! I hope your hallucinations occur less now! I can’t imagine how terrifying it can be.\n\nI have a lawyer friend who had a period where he had episodes of schizophrenia that resulted in “hallucinations” in the form of sounds.

He only found out when more than one of his colleagues mentioned to him and when he thought they were pranking him, one of them took a video of one such “call” to show him and he finally believed. \n\nBut of course from there his world kinda crashed cos he was a super high achiever, NUS law degree and Masters in an Ivy League US uni, I can’t remember which one.\n\nThe cause or trigger for it was likely cos he was having a particularly stressful period at work, overworking too much, drinking endless amounts of coffee to keep up with his work, severe lack of sleep etc. And yes I personally also think my own similar experiences at a few of my jobs are also likely contributors to my mental and physical health challenges.\n\nHe is now well and returned to his lawyering profession (in a less demanding & competitive law firm), and he has also since gotten certified in counselling so as to help others with his experience.\n\nHopefully this little sharing encourages you if you’re still struggling with hallucinations and your mental health! \n\nMake it a priority to take good care of yourself. Grades, school performance and activities, building up the specs in your CV, etc., all of these are things that may seem like the be-all-end-all but when we zoom out to look at your life in its entirety, they are just one aspect of life. \n\nWorking on yourself will be something you can take with you through your whole lifetime whereas qualifications and career accomplishments won’t matter very much when one is on the death bed.

xYoshiyuki,js254w,Advice on Job Change,2020-11-11 13:21:34,singapore,378959,25,35," Hi,

I'm in a situation where I have a job offer from a company, I have accepted the offer but I am filled with anxiety and nervousness about the unknown and future. It is my first job change.

The anxiety that filled my mind is that I'd not be able to perform well in the new environment (a different job scope), and that it might not be as secure as my current job, (even though I have been unhappy at my job for 1.5years but fearing of quitting without any other jobs in line, and it is slowly chipping away at my mental health - decreased appetite, had a few breakdowns at work, and had to take off days to rest and recuperate, and the general dread of going to office.)

I accepted the current job offer as even though it's pretty far from my house (the other end of Singapore) , and hoping that a change of environment would be better for my mental health (I have general anxiety disorder).

But there is this constant anxiety of the ""what ifs"" that makes me want to cancel the offer and just stay in my current company. Due to familiarity, and being comfortable with it.

Also, the act of tendering just fills me with nervousness, like how do I go about bringing it up and all, without burning bridges, or offending anyone.

Would like to ask if anyone was in a similar situation before, and what are your suggestions to calm the anxiety and nervousness, and whether should I just reject the offer and stay at my current job despite how the situation is.",0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/js254w/advice_on_job_change/,"['We\'re trying out some new flairs, and ""Serious Discussion"" is one of them.

Must caveat I’m a first jobber on the lookout for my next move. \n\n**TLDR**: go ahead with the new job offer. \n\nThe anxiety around the uncertainty you’re experiencing that makes you reconsider proceeding with the new job offer **will occur** no matter where your next career move will be. This uncertainty can be minimised if you can network / connect with existing or recent employees in the company, or better yet, the precise team that you’re joining to get an inside scoop of things.\n\nOn the other hand, the push factors on your current job probably will likely remain unless you are willing and able to do something about it (eg. work out a resolution with your boss and relevant stakeholders, which can understandably be uncomfortable or inconvenient).\n\nPeople move all the time and you’re not legally obliged to explain why you want to move, although you could if you trust and are comfortable to share with your manager. \n\nDepending on the exit process typical for your company and industry, you probably want to initiate a conversation with your manager before tendering on system (if applicable).\n\nManagers typically are trained to handle both on boarding and off boarding of the employees, so let them worry about this. \n\nPrior to the conversation, make sure you’re ready to quit and know your rights, as well as what you’re giving up (eg. any outstanding or prorated bonuses? Can leave be encashed? Is your company insurance policy portable, if need be and worth it? Are you fine to lose immediate access to your work documents or workplace the moment you initiate that conversation, etc.)\n\nConversely, reneging on the new offer you accepted is definitely going to burn bridges with the new company and potentially any associated companies if HR shares that info. I hear some companies do that.\n\nMight be useful to also work out a backup plan, including alternative employers and even maintaining good relations with your existing company so you can potentially boomerang back in (not uncommon in good companies) in the off chance that the new company doesn’t work out for you.', ""Hey, you've already received plenty of replies so I'll try to keep mine short. I'm a fresh grad and have been working for about 2.7 years now. I just switched to my new job. I too had the same sentiments as you, about being able to perform in a new environment, meeting new colleagues, hoping your boss is good, etc. I was doing pretty well in my old company, had a good reputation, was on a 'prestigious' project, and from my interactions with upper management, they had a plan for me. \n\nBut yet, I was unhappy. I was not doing something that filled me with purpose and I couldn't stand wasting more years of my life being there. In my old department everyone joked about how they wanted to leave but 5-6 years on, they are still there. Stable, good salary, go home on time, good friends. I just couldnt see myself doing the same; in fact I was afraid that I would end up being like one of them. \n\nAs mentioned by another redditor, the unknown will always be an unknown. But what you are experiencing now will be a constant. If you aren't happy now, move. Take the leap. Yes, do take time to consider whether such a decision is prudent, and also observe where your feelings of frustration are stemming from. Do it carefully. Dont jump without thinking. Here are some questions I asked myself.\n\n\\- Will this new job offer me the opportunity to do something that I want in life? If not, will it push me further in that direction so that my next subsequent move will bring me even closer?\n\n\\- What do I value, stable job, 9-5, mon-fri, go home play games sleep rinse repeat for the next 30 years? Or improving my skills in the direction that i find fulfilling.\n\n\\- If my old job is a stable 9-5, do I think I can build my skillset after office hours? Compared to my new job (e.g. programming) There are many things that self taught environments are unable to provide.\n\nAnyway, I made the decision to switch. Did I make the right decision? Yes. My mental health speaks for itself. Was this new company everything that I envisioned it to be? No. It isn't. But in my opinion, thats okay. You make the best decision that you can with the information that you have, and sometimes, it still isn't enough. But I can tell you right now for sure that I'm still glad I made that move.\n\nDont worry too much about the conversations that you will have about leaving, you aren't the first person to leave the company. My conversations were kinda awkward, all were surprised, none were angry thankfully. \n\n&#x200B;\n\nFocus on what you want because I can tell you that the Company focuses on itself first."", ""Jack Sparrow : The only rules that really matter are these: what a man can do and what a man can't do.\n\nYou can't stay in your current company because its killing your mental health.

Job changes are growth, and growth means learning new things and moving out of your comfort zone. Naturally, that means it is not easy and feelings of anxiousness are normal. \n\nMy personal opinion is that you should never move to a job where you are 100% certain you will do a good job. If so, that means the job is not challenging you in terms of skills learnt and growth. You should be reasonably confident- like say 70-80% you can do he job- but a healthy amount of uncertainty is good to keep you on your toes. \n\nDon’t worry- no one is expecting you to be a superstar within your first week or even within your first month. Just make sure you do your best, remain humble and ask lots of questions and try to learn and you will be ok. \n\nAs to how to tender- there is no need to burn bridges or leave on a bad note.

I ended up tendering my resignation even before I managed to find a new job cause I just couldn't take it.\n\nFortunately, I managed to secure a new job during my notice period. In my case, I didn't really have a choice since I had already resigned from my first, but there was quite a bit of anxiety from the possibility of facing the same situation as my first job.\n\nFortunately, my bosses ended up being a lot better than my first job, mostly letting me learn on my own without micro-managing too much and also giving guidance/instructions where needed.

*think of your darkest hour, and all the beautiful rays of light or the happiness and peace and laughter in between then and now, when perhaps youre beginning to struggle again. you got through that, and dude trust me it’s not easy to struggle through these things. you are going to get through this, as you've done before. and you’re never alone. rooting for yall*

i remember preparing for Os this time last year, and feeling like consistently suicidal w/ my crippling anxiety and cyclical emotional fluctuations. was stressed that my grades were slipping, especially in a particular subject X i used to like ascertain my value as a person and self-worth. a lotta my friends were like level 800 muggers. i was ridiculously unmotivated because of a sheer lack of energy. now, i'm absolutely failing subject X again after Os lol. but basically i'm realising more and more how trivial grades are. of course this won't stop you from stressing about that upcoming exam. but as i hear stories of just how truly and wonderfully people can make a suitably happy and fruitful life for themselves without desperately clinging onto a set of grades, esp as society moves towards like a less traditional route in the erm job market, i'm beginning to see that there are so many more paths one can walk down in life. the academic system is no longer as narrow and elitist (i say this in like a career opportunities sense not a social stigma sense)- no one cares if you got one set of good grades and entered a particular school years ago. i suppose it's also counterproductive to push yourself until you break or lose your grip on... the beautiful person you are?? because of grades, which are so, so fleeting and temporary. Olvl six pointers failing JC vvv common, i'd know... IP kids, GEP kids, struggling to promote, also vvv common. we try so so hard but ultimately, at the end of it all, this is imo haha if u guys would agree; but isn’t it a little bit of a chasing after the wind? grades cannot be traded for worth; it’s not guaranteed no matter how hard we push ourselves, and yet we still jeopardise our mental health for it. it's a life lesson we come to grips with slowly; in the same way, i encourage you guys to tryy to take care of you, a deserving and wonderful and strong person. take care of your mental and physical health. you'll be a tiny bit more refreshed and calm as you tackle the intimidating mundaneness of your course content. and for what it's worth, i'll just say again that you are not your grades.

** i feel like there's increased awareness about mental health, but i've personally yet to see a reduction in stigma. as someone with anxiety disorder and attention deficit disorder, i just wanna say i have gone thru years of school carrying mental disorders on my shoulders and my heart aches for u guys. i've seen judgment and i've seen a severe lack of understanding from teachers and classmates about this kinda thing. :( i'm also here to say that if you have a mental condition that affects your ability to concentrate in any way, don't let judgment from peers hinder you from getting the help u need, applying for the extra time that you need. those who judge you will never make for bosom friends.**

BlissBlissBliss,jpvvic,Downward spiral,2020-11-08 02:54:18,nus,21233,18,55,"hey all. this isn't academic related and it's pretty sad so skip if you don't want your day to be ruined.

but if you want to read on I thank you a lot for reading this.

before uni, I had goals and dreams and aspirations. I was motivated and I was going to enter a really good course. in year 1, I had a great social life and a pretty good work-life balance. I was staying on campus and played in a band and played soccer for my hall. I studied constantly but with a study group and though it might have been really stressful sometimes I got by well. since I stayed on campus there was also ample opportunity for me to find a girl so I didn't worry about that as well.

but a problem I've had since I was in secondary school  is bipolar disorder. I wouldn't say I didn't struggle with in in y1 and y2, but i managed to cope somehow. the mania even helped me to pull long hours to study and finish assignments. I managed to get a really really good exchange, and was dating the girl of my dreams, but depression was always there like a nibbling itch that was asking to be scratched.

right now, I don't talk to most of my school friends anymore. I don't have any motivation to study anymore and I'd be lucky to not fail any mods this sem. i used to be really active in group projects but now I can't even contribute not because I don't want to but I don't even know half of the things the school teaches anymore. the fact that I'm in computing makes it practically impossible for me to plan any schedule (for example, I can't say I'm going to do this assignment for 4 hours because it usually takes 14 hours). 

my exchange got cancelled and I've been single for around 1.5years already with no clear hope of finding a partner. my social life is dismal. the few friends that still bother to pay me any attention either don't know how to help my depression or belittle my problems. I know I should probably get new better friends or something but that again isn't possible. 

I don't know whether bipolar, covid, my introversion, the fact that I burned out, or the fact that I think too much about life that caused all of this.

in sem2 last sem around March I nearly killed myself. I told myself to press on for the ppl around me to not disappoint them and that things would get better. they didn't. 

I should have killed myself when I had the courage to. fuck this school. fuck computing. fuck all of my ruined hopes and dreams.

but I have a new hope. I hope that after I write this and sleep I won't wake up.",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/jpvvic/downward_spiral/,"[""Life never goes the way you want it to, just like COVID, honestly don't think anyone expected 2020 to be such a piece of shit. I was kind of like you back when I was in Polytechnic. I started off pretty happy go lucky and Yolo. But my academics started to decline really bad, I skipped class for CCA and my schoolwork just started to snowball, I didn't feel like going for classes especially since I didn't do my work. And on days that I do make it to class, I don't even know what the lecturer is teaching. It got worst during the end of my Year 2 because I received multiple warnings for debarment and my parents had to go to school to meet the director. I was damn emo the entire school holidays and I shut myself out from everyone and my phone. When school started, it was a lot of mess because I was a committee member in my CCA and back then I did a lot of work and tied up a lot of loose ends. And because I was withdrawn during the holidays, all the open house prep was not done, my seniors stepped in to help settle the CCA in the end. I felt like a piece of shit. And coming to year 3, obviously, no one wants to group with me for FYP lol. My lecturers know that too, so they gave me a solo assignment which I was okay with. I started off pretty good but I started to procrastinate when I faced problems in my project, I was honest throughout the time though, I told my lecturers I procrastinated and I ended up not submitting ANYTHING for my FYP, not even a final report. I'm honestly surprised by how I even graduated. I did help another group out with a bit for their work though maybe that's why?\n\nFast forward now, I think I'm doing pretty okay.

I found a good internship and cca that I liked and I realised that life is alot more than just results. University is a time for you to expand your social circle and connections as well as get working experience. it's not just about purely grinding studies. if you find something that gives you purpose, results will seem alot less important.\n\n3. it's okay to be disappointed hard modules, shitty profs, shitty groupmates, bad luck during exams are disappointing, certainly. but we need to realise that disappointments are not anomalies or tragedies, but are inevitabilities in life. you're bound to face such disappointments and setbacks, alot of which we cannot take them too harshly, but rather make the best out of the situation. it might be hard to look on the bright side in moments like this, but please realise that sometimes it's not your fault, it's the bad circumstances you're put in!\n\n\\- \n\nOpportunities WILL come.

We’re just small people trying to live our lives in a big world and I doubt the people-up-there have so much energy to waste just ruining our one life. \nI hope you find people you can trust and who make the effort to understand you to keep you grounded and like you said, they’re the motivation to keep going. \nI need to add that I’m not actually in Uni yet and I think I’m probably younger than you and my views might be a bit idealistic/simple but from someone who’s struggling through A levels right now and having panic attacks every other day, i hope you keep going and one day you can look back and know that the worst is over! :> gonna keep sending you good vibes from the bottom of my heart', '\nPlease don’t think like that! I know exactly how you feel and i’ve thought of doing that  many times too but it’s just NEVER worth it, especially over school. Apply for LOA and take a break, just know that you’re not alone. I’ve stopped talking to my friends too and often it feels like i have no one to turn to and no one is going through what im going through but in reality someone always is. If you think professional help will benefit you, take the semester or next semester off from school and let yourself get better, you deserve it!\n\nP.S. sorry if this is incoherent its 4am and i havent slept in a long time 😭', 'Hi there. Sorry for being toxic here, but I believe this needs to be said, because you seem to come from a so much better environment and background but for some reason cannot seem to appreciate it.  I can’t judge too much but tbh I feel that it is a grave injustice that someone else above me in life can have so much to complain about.  The fact that you can even stay in hall, whereas for me I’ll probably have to take a loan in order to do so, just makes people in my shoes feel like absolute shit.\n\nSome personal background: I come from an extremely abusive household with a mother that manipulated me and faults me for everything trivial that I do, even if it is not a bad thing.  During my JC years I was unable to focus because of my mother, so I took a part time job and paid for rent at a house near my school.  I didn’t excel but I still managed to make it into NUS SOC.  My Teachers were absolute shit towards me, people were shit towards me because they blamed all my shortcomings on me and me alone (aka If I can do all my work then why can’t this guy? What’s so hard).  \n\nFast forward to NS.  I had to put up with extreme mental stress due to poor relations with my squad in HTA.  What’s worse was that every time I went home there was a ton of problems I always had to settle for my family, so there was no respite, and coming from a poor family I could not even enjoy a meal of sushi even during book out.  The worst thing of HTA was the FIs and the strictness and corporeal punishment of literally everything.  Yes, I am talking about you, LWJ and Y, fucking pieces of shit that made my life miserable during HTA and still go on to NUS as privileged fucks.  I hope  you are enjoying your hall life now.\n\nDuring my NS my family was so poor that they shut off the electricity and water.  My dad has nothing to eat for days because he had to use his salary to pay for loans incurred a decade ago.  He would go down to the Whampoa market to eat 25 cents porridge (to my memory?) just to save money.  My superior refused to help me appeal for permission to get external work, but implied that if I do it illegally he would close an eye.  Since I came from SPF I was able to serve NS for 2 days, then during my next 2 days off I worked around 14 hours a day.  Fast forward 1.5 years and I gave most of my savings to my family still, so barely left with much.  I am unable to apply for much bursaries and subsidies and even less so next year because my siblings earn so much but don’t contribute to the family.  So in order to pay for fees and food without taking loan (as well as the laptop I bought for studies) I’ll have to work around 2 full days every week.  While helping my dad because he is just a burden tbh.  Welp my grades are just going to suffer again this sem, and I’ll probably edge out as a mediocre student who will never get anywhere in life, a path that was determined the second I was born.  \n\nBtw, so sorry to hear your exchange got cancelled.  It must be so depressing.', ""thank you very much for sharing your experience with me, it seems very similar to mine and I'm very happy that you're doing better now. how did you get by your days after your poly?"", ""thank you so much! I try to talk to friends but to be honest going out with friends don't really interest me anymore. I just feel they don't understand me, and when we talk about life I feel much worse because I can see how happy they are right now while I'm here suffering. don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't want my friends to succeed, it's just that it makes me feel really crappy that I can't get even a single bit of happiness"", 'I was the one who wrote the comment that you copied..', ""thank you very much, I've been seeking professional help and have been on antidepressants, they don't go that much but I take them anyway.

I didn't mention any of the family problems I have above. Whether or not I have had everything handed to me is your assumption, which is a wrong assumption. I'm not going to speak any further about family problems and my past because I've struggled my whole life to get over those as well and I've finally succeeded to do so. Now I'm trying to deal with new problems in my life.\n\ni sincerely hope that the two of us are able to get by what we are going through. once again, i can’t possibly understand what you’re going through.\n\n3.

I don't know a lot about bipolar, but if the meds you're on right now sound like they aren't effective, and you're getting professional help, tell the therapist.\n\nAnd you're sooo young, please don't worry if you haven't found a partner.

OldProtectionism,j8jt52,Sharing my thoughts on mental health in Singapore,2020-10-10 20:42:00,singapore,378960,23,71,"In light of World Mental Health Day 2020, I thought I'd just share a few of my own thoughts on all things mental health in the Singapore context.

**Discussion and efforts to promote mental health awareness shouldn't just be limited to one day.** I feel that this happens too often with these commemorations, including other 'days' such as Teachers' Day and International Migrants Day. While the situation has improved over the years, mental health stigma is still awfully prevalent here in Singapore, and few are aware and sensitive of such issues.

Those who don't believe, just ask around. There'll still be folks out there who believe that ""it's all in your head"". The acronym ""IMH"" still elicits a certain response from some, as if seeking help there is the same as going to prison or something. So on, and so forth.

The fact that [one in seven people in Singapore have suffered from a mental disorder](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-people-singapore-have-experienced-mental-disorder-their-lifetime-study-finds), according to the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, suggests that mental health isn't a small or trivial issue. Students will agree with the [statistics indicating that Singaporean students are more likely to suffer from anxiety and stress from their peers](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3017171/singapores-stressed-schoolchildren-show-human-cost-city), given how competitive, rigorous, and unforgiving our education system is.

Our adults aren't much better. In 2019 Singapore was identified as the [second hardest-working city in the world](https://mothership.sg/2019/12/singaporeans-hours-per-week-work/), with adults working an average of 45 hours per week, only behind Tokyo. We are commonly referred to as a nation of workaholics, and rightly so.

The circumstances are so favourable in causing people to develop mental health conditions, or even to amplify existing ones. And the fact that we aren't talking and doing enough with regards to mental health makes this worse.

We should try to talk more about mental health, and also at the very least interact with those who may be going through conditions with empathy.

Cheers!

Coming from a Singapore that is much shittier than it is now, I cannot fault them for developing a mental shell to protect themselves, but it is honestly pretty frustrating when they fail to recognize the changing Singapore around them and be more open about seeking help about issues. \n\nHeck, there are still people who think that mental illness is a matter of being weak-willed and can be solved by sheer willpower alone. That is basically the same as someone willing their cancerous tumor away by sheer willpower.\n\nMental illness is especially tricky because anyone who is mentally healthy cannot fathom what mental illness feels like. It is the same way someone who is colour-blind cannot see certain colours, no matter how much he/she tries to imagine it. It is easy to trivialise mental illness when you only have caricatures of what it feels like.', ""I jus wish for the day I can get MC in a polyclinic and I could just say I am burnt out and need a day's off instead of pretending to have physical symptoms like headache, diarrhea to keng that MC. \n\nI am sick and tired of getting that MC when I clearly feel burnt out but i had to go through this because I still am physically okay. My girlfriend wishes she had a fracture on her arm or leg than she had depression because people understands the trauma of a fracture, but not the trauma of anxiety and depression.\n\nAnd thats what I wish for singaporeans: Give Mental Health the respect that it needs. We all see checks on when to check for heart or diabetes, but we never see the checks on when to take a break when you are feeling stressed, or when to see your psychiatrist if you are feeling suicidal etc. I also wish employers be more tolerant on medical leaves, dont keep thinking that we are all trying to keng that MC or such."", ""Isn't having one day to commemorate mental health a good step in the right direction? I do agree we shouldn't keep it to one day but I think there's a need to also see the progress that has been made so far. In the past, talking about mental health was taboo. Now, we have a dedicated day for it. In the future, we hope that this will be normalised. I see no harm in this initiative and I find your perspective overly cynical."", ""I get where OP is coming from, but I can see the contrast - no one's overlooking what teachers do outside of Teacher's Day. \n\nI hope with more awareness, the stigma of mental health can be eradicated - but that's a huge thing to wish for. HIV/AIDS was super taboo in the 80s (not sure what most people feel about it now tbh), and I'm sure people have heard falsehoods about it spreading through sharing of toilets, sharing of drinks and etc. Some of the similar falsehoods are prevalent in societal perceptions of mental health. \n\nDefinitely more conversations on mental health is needed. The catch about mental health is that some people have more predisposing factors, lesser protective factors and social resources. Combine such factors, and others who may not face similar circumstances may be lost on why they feel that way so I can see why a lack of empathetic response may be present in harmful overgeneralisations about mental illness."", 'My own framework to elucidate this issue has 3 dimensions:\n\n- mental illness\n- mental health/wellness\n- mental strength/will\n\n\nIt is not surprising to encounter people who see no difference.', 'Mental health issues are a pandemic and more needs to be done.', ""Don't think you should have undermined the efforts today with your second paragraph which could have been phrased nicer"", 'singapore is a good country and all ye ik but its the education system bruh.

Not that it\'s even possible to have a vested interest in all the social issues and causes here in Singapore, but the apparent virtue-signalling is something we can improve on.\n\nI have had more than one schoolmate parade on social media, championing a certain social cause, yet act the complete opposite way in real life. Being absolutely racist towards migrant workers, treating teachers like second-class humans, shunning peers with mental health conditions, the list goes on.\n\nAnd I have already acknowledged the progress Singapore has made in recent years.

It was just a general thought. Cheers.', ""What I mean is that only mental issues clinically diagnosed are authentic to me. \n\nIf we accept that these people who are sad and use the term depressed, it opens a slippery slope where everyone can claim they are depressed which reduces the gravity and significance of those who are actually clinically depressed. Hence, there should be a distinguishing factor between people who actually are depressed and those who are sad. \n\nHowever we should all still treat one another with kindness as it doesn't matter if they are sad or clinically depressed. I just take issue that the term mental issues is misused in the public and media."", ""Yeah sounds about right, agree with you there, kindness is necessary in the long run.

romaineaiko,ir6w6f,[A Levels] I sense a possible mental breakdown,2020-09-12 13:31:37,SGExams,77716,19,237,"J2 here, just wanted to rant a bit about my current situation. 

During sec sch I was always a last minute cramming kind of student and my mental health really suffered and even if by some miracle I got decent grades (A-C), I felt like I didn’t deserve such grades and would actually feel guilty, considering how some of my peers scored lower than me even when they studied much harder. 

When i entered jc, i decided to leave my last minute cramming behind, although i still last minute crammed for j1 myes, i started to become more consistent towards promos. I could see the improvements i was getting for my various subjects (BCM h1 geog) and was feeling hopeful for promos. Long story short, i fell into a downward spiral of super intense studying, developed an eating disorder and burned out the week before promos. I still remember during the math paper, within the first 10 mins I had a panic attack and felt so nauseous that I wanted to throw up. I couldn’t recover and got a subpass in the end. Ngl it felt awful to see your grades suffer not because you didnt study, but because your mental state couldn’t pull through during the exams.

I ended up seeing a psychologist who I’m very thankful for and continued to pick up my consistency, and discovered new studying methods that was still intensive but gave me ample time to rest my brain. I improved my math and got an A for mcts, and my other subjects either improved or remained the same around Bs. 

Now theres like 33 days or sth to start of As and i feel myself spiralling again. I don’t have much pressure from my parents to do well, but I’m terrified about what’s going to happen if I don’t. I personally don’t think that I’m falling behind in terms of studying, but I find myself struggling to rest properly when it’s time for me to rest. Food makes me nauseous, I’m having indigestion problems, it takes me close to 2 hours to fall asleep at night and I struggle to wake up the next morning (since I fall asleep around 3am) and end up feeling guilty for wasting half a day to sleep. There are nights where I’m just so scared of facing the next day that I just start crying for like 30 mins. I know I’m not alone in this situation but at the same time I feel so alone. 

I’m really scared of burning out or having a mental breakdown during prelims/ As just like how i did for promos last year. I really don’t want my efforts to go to waste but it’s so hard to suppress my emotions that are hindering me from doing well. 

To the other J2s who are about to face the hell hole that is A levels, I wish yall all the best and may we all survive this together!

Edit 1: Well didn’t expect this post to “blow up” LOL but thanks for the advice and encouraging words!! My main prelim papers officially start tmr and I’m kind of nervous but still surviving :) I think I’ll keep editing this post throughout prelims-As period just so I can look back on this post As and laugh AHAHAHAHA Thanks guys for the support!

Just a few hours ago, I had collapsed in a public place due to huge agitation from family issues. Coupled with other interpersonal issues, my body could not take it. This seems to be the case every time I get greatly impacted by things. I was looking very pale, and I felt extremely drained to the point it felt like I was about to go. Took Xanax but at the time of writing, I still feel as if my body got ""sucked up"".  


In addition, I could not control myself to self-harm since yesterday night. Strong suicidal thoughts, but no active plan to end things. More of feeling extremely depressed and in distress for the past 2 weeks.  


Kindly provide any advice or suggestion for me if I should seek hospitalisation. Was also wondering if anyone who works at SKGH (Sengkang General Hospital) knows if there are available beds in the psychiatric ward + whether there will be a psychiatry doctor stationed there 24/7. How long will I usually have to stay for admission as well? Went across all the other government hospitals (except IMH) but their psychiatric wards are full.

I know it has only been 3 days since i got posted to my unit but i feel my insomnia and anxiety is getting worse by the day and so i decided to seek help. I talked to my PC about it and he told me he to give him a reason as to why i have insomnia before arranging me to see a doctor. I have been holding it in for the better part of 3 months as i was afraid to get help. And when i decided to get help, i got told to give the reason as to why i am feeling this before i can get help as mentioned earlier.

There, maybe you can ask the doctor how to explain to your PC.

It's great that you decide not to hold it in anymore.

My friend isn't feeling too good about his mental health and he does not want to declare his condition to the MO as he has these concerns:

1. Is it possible to recover fully from mental disorder?

2. Will the record stay with him for life even after he recovers?

3. If the condition stabilizes and will not affect his work performance, does he need to declare it in the job application? - Govt Jobs VS Public Sector Jobs

Above are the doubts that stop him from consulting a specialist.

Hopefully, I can convince him to seek treatment early.

You will then be (officially) treated as such. If you were downpes’d for such disorders, getting it cleared can be grounds to reinstate combat-fit PES status, barring any other circumstances. \n2. Past records probably do exist, but if they’re sufficiently old they’re not likely to affect much (Can attest to this)\n3. This is sort of a grey area. IIRC you are required to declare any conditions you have/had, but mental health records are also confidential; Your specialist/institution cannot release details without your express approval.

audioinside,jabfl5,Diagnosis confirmed: Bipolar (Spectrum) and Personal Tips,2020-10-13 19:23:14,MentalHealthSG,656,9,16,"Hey everyone, hope you are doing alright. 


Well just want to share a milestone for me. Received a confirmation on my diagnosis which I have been suspecting for a while now. 

I first went to IMH 4 years ago following a recommendation by a Family Service Centre (FSC) counsellor who wrote me a referral. In the 4 years, I've seen 4 psychiatrists. My diagnosis went from adjustment mood disorder to depression to bipolar. 

Last year, I was on antidepressants and instead of helping me, it triggered my hypomania (an elevated state) resulting in poor life decisions. 

I am starting on a mood stabilizer today (epilim / sodium valproate). Currently also on psychotherapy for 5 continuous months now of weekly sessions. 

Ways I manage: 

1. Psychotherapy is under a charity, I'm unemployed now so they waived the charges


2. Bipolar is under the Chronic Disease Management Programme [CDMP](https://www.moh.gov.sg/policies-and-legislation/chronic-disease-management-programme-(cdmp)) , so I get to use up to $500 per year now covering 85% of the bills


3. Read, watch videos and listen to podcasts - find out as much as I can on the condition and the best ways to manage it but please ensure reasonably qualified sources 


4. Support - having my loving partner, a few close friends, my therapist and being on Reddit r/bipolar2 r/bipolar helps too 


5. Introspect - reflecting on my life pre-diagnosis / pre-realisation, and learning to accept the condition and embracing the life ahead


6. Try and try - I did meditation, journalling, mood charts, setting up routines, to-do lists and what nots - some worked better than others and still trying


7. Sharing - it is clearly not the end for me, honestly been through so much shit from broken relationships, financial woes and even legal issues, but I want to let anyone who found this know - there is still so much more life to live. 

my psychotherapist survived a ""terminal illness"" - and that reminder helps me to live on.

kjyingg,fjo23n,[O Levels] Helping a friend with suspected ED,2020-03-17 00:50:01,SGExams,77716,23,51,"i have a very big concern about one of my friends who is about to take Os. (will refer my friend as X in the story)

you see, X has been in and out of the hospital and many of the issues X faced was due to insufficient intake of food or insufficient nutrients.

ever since X came out from the hospital, one of X’s close friends had mentioned to me that she hasn’t really seen X sit down and eat a proper meal. plus, X has been taking a considerably long amount of time in the toilet which makes me scared of what the possibilities are. 

additionally, i have seen X after a few months and X looks extremely thin. X’s once healthy glow is gone, and now looks really dead. like X used to have energy, but now it just seems like X cant even properly function for a physical activity.

i really really want to help X, but i dont really know how. X has been extremely adamant about refusing food from friends, and sometimes even when food is brought to X for free, X refuses it. im really scared that X will end up back in the hospital, and possibly end up not taking Os (which will really crush X), worse still end up losing his/her life (which i really pray does not happen).

SnooWoofers316,jwerzp,DMY1401PSP (Peer Supporting Peer) as PL-Recognised Module? (FASS Psychology),2020-11-18 20:18:37,nus,21234,2,16,"Hello psych seniors! I was successful in an interview and have been offered a place in the Design-Your-Own Module (DYOM) called DMY1401PSP (Peer Supporting Peer) administered by the NUS Office of Student Affairs (OSA). This is basically a module on how to support peers in terms of mental health matters, and will prepare me to become a Peer Student Supporter (PSS). I'm wondering if I have a legitimate basis for requesting DMY1401PSP to be a PL-recognised module - i.e. count towards psych major requirements. Based on the the current list of PL-recognised modules [https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/honours-programme/](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/honours-programme/), DMY1401PSP is not a PL-recognised module. If you have experience appealing for a module to be a PL-recognised module, please let me know how it works!

Currently, all DYOMs are under the Unrestricted Elective Module (UEM) space. Based on my correspondence with FASS Dean's Office, DYOM modules will not count towards the calculation of the cumulative average point (CAP), and also will not be counted toward the limit stipulated on the number of Level-1000 modules.

Some basic information on DMY1401PSP can be found at [http://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-life/student-leadership/dyom](http://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-life/student-leadership/dyom) and [http://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-services/sw/peer-student-supporters](http://nus.edu.sg/osa/student-services/sw/peer-student-supporters)

The contents of the syllabus include  
\-Mental health literacy  
\-Understanding of mental health issues and disorders  
\-Supervision  
\-Basic peer helping skills and coping techniques  
\-Understanding of boundaries, confidentiality and ethical issues

DMY1401PSP seems like a pretty new module - or rather, the entire DYOM scheme only started recently in 2019 (see [http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/design-your-own-module](http://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/academic-information-policies/undergraduate-students/design-your-own-module)). Since the contents of DMY1401PSP seem pretty related to psychology (mental health literacy, mental health disorders etc.), I'm wondering if I have a legitimate basis for requesting it to be a PL-recognised module.

My context is that I am a full credit transfer student form another faculty in NUS to FASS, so I have maxed out all my UEs. So, it seems that DMY1401PSP will be an excess UEM in my transcript and not count towards my graduation requirements. I'm okay if it stays as such, since I am intrinsically motivated to learn about peer support and helping people going through difficulties in terms of mental and emotional health. But, I guess it will be a bonus for DMY1401PSP to be PL-recognised for me.

I'm prepared to email the Director of Undergraduate Studies at NUS Psychology (Prof Stuart Derbyshire) and the Deputy Director of Undergraduate Studies at NUS Psychology (Dr Nina Powell; also my PL1101E lecturer) about this if need be - probably after my exams. Don't think this is doxxing since their name and designation can be found online haha ([https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/faculty/](https://fass.nus.edu.sg/psy/faculty/))

As you see, I have done some research homework so I'm quite serious about this!! Any help and advice will be much appreciated. :)

1capstore,i16j4l,Urgently need help/advice- My mom abused benzodiazepines for over a year due to insomnia and stress and now everyone’s paying the price.,2020-07-31 20:19:14,askSingapore,44675,13,74,"Not really sure where to start this off but here it goes:

My mom is currently warded at IMH’s MDU(Mood Disorder Unit), she has been battling with minor to severe withdrawal symptoms from Benzo abuse for the past few months (even attempted suicide). It’s almost been a week since she was warded and there seem to be no or little improvement to her mood/condition. Me and my father have been visiting her on a daily basis.

I wished I could have stepped in or intervene earlier when I started noticing her taking doses of Benzos that was way above what she was pescribed by her doctor but I brushed it off, which may have led to her current condition. This was observed by me during the circuit breaker period.

Her list of withdrawal symptoms which I have recorded till date, most of the symptoms occur when she is having an “episode”.

Recurring:
1. Anxiety Attacks
2. Depression
3. Heartburn (Burning sensation in abdominal region)
4. Acid Reflux
5. Lost of interest/mood/appetite
6. Insomnia
7. Always in a daze
8. Difficulty in swallowing (Most recent)
9. Difficulty in urination

Previously/Uncommon:
1. Pins and needles in limbs
2. Cold Sweat
3. Dry Mouth
4. Hypersensitivity
5. Delirium

Her abuse was mainly on Apralozam(Xanax) and Zolpidem(Ambien). With Zolpidem being the main abuse.

Honestly I just hope someone that had similar experiences or someone that is in this field of expertise to share with me on how to cope this issue. Will my mom ever able to be rid of all these symptoms or will there be some permanent damage to her nervous system/cognitive ability. Is there other options or places to seek treatment that is focused on this (Benzodiazepines Withdrawal Syndrome)?.

She then instructed the girl to follow her to the bedroom but the latter did not heed her. This made the mother angrier, court documents said.\n\n> TODDLER WAS FORCEFULLY THROWN DOWN TWICE\n\n> The mother then pulled her daughter\'s hands and dragged her into the bedroom before lifting the girl up by her armpits and forcefully throwing her down on the floor.\n\n> The girl landed head first and cried louder than before.\n\n> Her mother then told her to clean up her toys in the living room. The girl walked slowly to the living room, appearing to be in pain.\n\n> As she was tidying her child\'s mattress, the mother noticed her daughter had stopped packing up her toys and was standing still, crying.\n\n> The woman then lifted her child again to above her shoulders and threw her on the floor with all her might.\n\n> The child landed on her back and her head hit the floor before she fell silent.\n\n> The woman said she noticed that the impact was ""very hard"" but was still furious so she kicked the girl forcefully on her side.\n\n> When she realised that her daughter was no longer moving, the woman grew alarmed and began to administer cardiopulmonary resuscitation on the girl.\n\n> She lied to her husband when he called on the phone, saying that their daughter was having a fit.\n\n> When her husband came home and saw that their daughter was ""not looking good"", he asked his wife to take the girl to the hospital.\n\n> As she did so, she noticed in the Grab car that the child was bleeding from her mouth, said Deputy Public Prosecutors Zhou Yihong and Han Ming Kuang.\n\n> HOSPITAL NOTIFIED POLICE, GIRL DIED ABOUT A WEEK LATER\n\n> KK Women\'s and Children\'s Hospital sent a fax message to the police about the case and police interviewed the girl\'s mother.\n\n> She told the authorities that she had woken up from her nap to find her child having a fit, claiming that the girl had fallen out of her hold and hit her back and ahead.\n\n> The child was found to have suffered skull fractures and bruising in the areas around her stomach, pancreas and spleen.\n\n> Her mother eventually admitted that she had thrown her daughter twice on the floor.\n\n> The girl was declared brain-dead on Apr 14 and died three days later on Apr 17, more than a week after the incident.\n\n> An autopsy certified her cause of death as head injury, with the forensic pathologist noting extensive fractures of the skull, consistent with blunt force trauma, that were enough to cause death.\n\n> HER MENTAL RESPONSIBILITY WAS IMPAIRED BY MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER\n\n> A psychiatric report from the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) found that the woman had major depressive disorder at the time of the incident, which substantially impaired her mental responsibility for her acts.\n\n> The doctor said the disorder had its onset before the death of one of the woman\'s children in February 2018, with the depressive symptoms persisting thereafter.\n\n> The prosecution had pushed for seven years\' jail, while defence lawyer Anand Nalachandran urged the court to give five years\' jail instead.\n\n> The prosecutors said the woman had vented her anger against the victim in such a violent way as to cause her death, calling her acts ""repugnant and inexcusable"".\n\n> They added that the girl was ""a mere toddler when her life was suddenly and callously taken away by the accused, whose very job was to care for and protect her"".\n\n> ""No doubt, the accused\'s major depressive disorder contributed to her causing D1’s death by substantially impairing her mental responsibility,"" said the prosecution.\n\n> ""However, there is no evidence that she lacked the capacity to comprehend her actions or to appreciate the wrongfulness of her conduct.""\n\n> They added that ""nothing justifies the use of gratuitous violence against a young child"".\n\n> SHE HAD LOST TWO CHILDREN TO ILLNESS, SUFFERED EMOTIONAL COLLAPSE\n\n> The defence said there was no planning and premeditation in this case, with an unexpected event triggering ""an emotional collapse that led to a spontaneous impulse"".\n\n> Just two months before the incident, the woman had borne a premature child who died two days after being discharged from hospital. Since then, she had been crying uncontrollably and dwelling on the past.\n\n> In 2011, she lost a four-month-old child to a viral infection. The woman ""spiralled and plummeted"" after this, suffering recurring insomnia, said the lawyer.\n\n> The woman developed major depressive disorder before February 2018 and suffered suicidal thoughts, but was not diagnosed until after the offence. Her medical history shows she may have suffered the condition since as early as 2007, when she was taken to hospital for slitting her wrists. In 2009, she was treated in IMH after attempting suicide.\n\n> On the day of the incident, she was ""overwhelmed"" and her daughter defecating on the towel was ""the proverbial final straw that broke the camel\'s back and led our client to do what she so deeply regrets"".\n\n> ""Plagued with undiagnosed major depressive disorder, insomnia and illness, our client was worn down carrying the weight of the family on her shoulders and she finally buckled to the unrelenting pressures of her life,"" said the lawyer.\n\n> ""She has no excuse - but her mind was compromised and her mental responsibility was substantially impaired.""\n\n> He added that the woman had ""desperately tried to resuscitate"" the toddler and taken her to hospital. When she realised the girl had died, ""she held her daughter tightly in her arms and apologised repeatedly, crying and saying that she did not intend for this to happen"".\n\n> She has since been diagnosed with the disorder and takes medication daily to manage her illness, seeing a psychiatrist regularly.\n\n> Judicial Commissioner Vincent Hoong said the case ""is deeply unfortunate"" and recognised that the mother was in a difficult situation, and that ""some punishment must already be felt on her part"".\n\n> While he noted that the woman\'s disorder substantially impaired her mental responsibility, he maintained that rehabilitation did not override deterrence and retribution, the dominant considerations in this case.\n\n> For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, the woman could have been jailed for life, or up to 20 years and fined.

At least he is at a better place now.', 'Guessed correctly.', ""> # Couple who killed 5-year-old son through horrific abuse get 27 years' jail, caning\n\n> SINGAPORE — A couple who made headlines for committing horrific acts on their five-year-old son, including confining him in a cage meant for cats and burning him with boiling hot water, were sentenced to 27 years’ jail each on Monday (13 July).\n\n> Azlin Arujunah will get an additional 12 months’ jail in lieu of caning while Ridzuan Mega Abdul Rahman will receive 24 strokes of the cane. Both individuals, who are 28, had claimed trial to a charge of murder with common intention, for causing bodily injury sufficient to cause death.\n\n> They were cleared of this charge earlier this year after Justice Valerie Thean ruled that “common intention” had to be formed before the offence was committed. She added that she could not infer such an intention from the medical evidence, which showed only a “collective injury”.\n\n> The judge also cleared Ridzuan of his charge of causing hurt by means of heated substance by burning his son’s palm with a heated metal spoon around September 2016, while his wife was acquitted of abetting him in the offence.\n\n> The couple were later convicted of the amended charge of voluntarily causing grievous hurt, endangering the child’s life, and other charges, including ill treating their child and voluntarily causing hurt.\n\n> Azlin had handed the boy to a close friend to foster in March 2011 when he was one month old. She was unable to care for him then, but took him back in May 2015, when he was four. The victim then shared a one-room rental flat with three siblings and his parents.\n\n> The boy was subjected to his parents’ brutal torture in their one-room Toa Payoh rental flat over a three-month period in 2016. They assaulted him with a broom, cigarette ash and pliers, causing him to suffer from a misaligned kneecap, a broken nose, bruises and cuts over his head and face.\n\n> After his parents scalded him with hot water on at least four occasions, the boy, then five years and nine months old, collapsed and never recovered. His parents, who have five other young children, brought him to the hospital more than six hours later, as they feared being arrested. The boy died on 23 October 2016 and the couple was arrested within the next two days.\n\n> He had suffered second to third-degree burns over two-thirds of his body from being scalded with hot water.\n\n> On Monday, the prosecution asked for life imprisonment for Azlin and Ridzuan.\n\n> Delivering the sentence, Justice Thean said that abuse had become a “joint action” for the couple, adding that living under challenging circumstances was not an excuse for their actions.\n\n> “The duty of a parent subsists regardless of economic and social circumstances. In this particular case, in any case, and even more inexcusably, help was available,” said the judge, noting that the parents were able to get help if needed.\n\n> During their trial, the court was told that Ridzuan had a troubled childhood and was suffering from intermittent explosive disorder, and hypnotic use disorder, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.\n\n> A defence psychiatrist testified that Azlin took drugs to cope with the stress of taking care of her children. She also suffered from an adjustment disorder with depressed mood at the time of the offences.\n\n> However, the judge did not give any mitigating weight to the couple’s psychiatric conditions. Azlin’s conditions did not cause substantial impairment of her self control, and there was insufficient evidence to show that Ridzwan suffered from intermittent explosive disorder, hypnotic use disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, said the judge.\n\n> While the psychiatrists accepted that Ridzuan was suffering from anti-social personality disorder, one of them expressed certainty that it did not affect his impulse control or diminish his mental responsibility for the offences, noted Justice Thean.\n\n> On whether one parent ought to be found more culpable than the other, Judge Thean said that there was no clear indication that one was more responsible than the other, as both had joint and equal responsibility for the well being of their child.\n\n> While the prosecution had argued that Azlin was more culpable as she had initiated two instances of violence, Ridzuan was the one who introduced the culture of family violence and initiated the abuse on their son in July, said the judge.\n\n> Being the stronger parent, Ridzuan’s use of force would have added greater injury, and his participation in the incidents would have led directly to the outcome, noted the judge.\n\n> The prosecution said it has filed appeals against the murder acquittals of both Azlin and Ridzuan.\n\n> Stay in the know on-the-go: Join Yahoo Singapore's Telegram channel at\xa0http://t.me/YahooSingapore\n\n> Related stories\n\n> Couple accused of abusing, killing 5-year-old son cleared of murder with common intention\n\n> Couple on trial for 'horrific and tragic' murder of five-year-old son\n\n> Man on trial for scalding son to death once strangled pregnant sister, court heard\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)""]"

Hello everyone, I have seen a couple of posts here and in the sg reddit on where to/how to seek help.   

I would recommend going to a polyclinic for a consultation to get a referral. (This is what I did)

For the first visit, just get a GP consultation. You should tell the GP about your issues and request for a referral to see a psychologist. 

The appointment date will depend on the severity of your case. For me, I only waited for 1 week to see the doctor and psychologist at the polyclinic's health&mind clinic.

During your first visit, your psychologist will get to know you and understand your issues to come up with an appropriate treatment plan. So don't worry, he/she is there to help you. If you feel uncomfortable at anytime during the session, do voice out. You can even request for another psychologist.

As for the consultation with your doctor, they will determine your severity and if theres a need for medication. 

The follow up session should be a week or two after your first session.

The cost of each consultation will vary, as it depends on short/long consultation and types of medication.
For me, it costs about $60 (including govt subsidises) for both my psychologist long session, doctor's consultation and medication.

A little background of myself:
I had been diagnosed with Depression, Social Anxiety and Panic disorder by my psychologist at polyclinic and psychiatrist at IMH.
I have been on prozac since Sep/Nov 2019 and still going for my psychotherapy sessions at my polyclinic.

I'm in PES B1 according to the checkup I did last year (though I do have thalassemia minor as a blood disorder which I've declared, as well as a foot arch problem that they do not know of), and my enlistment date for the Tekong military camp is on this Wednesday, 12 August.

I haven't told MINDEF or any counselors or therapists in fear that such a condition marked on my name would close up all chances of a career path from me. I'm also aware of the stigmitisation that most people in Singapore have against people with mental illnesses such as this, that scares me...making this post scares me, I haven't been here long enough to know whether you guys are just like them..

I've been trying to open my mind up to NS, which has helped to a certain extent, but these worries still cloud over me. Will NS finally set me off, causing me to have mental breakdowns like some or even worse, acting on my self-harming urges? If I speak out, will my superiors come after and start giving me hell? Will they think I'm faking it even though it's genuine? What if I don't click well with my mates, will they bully for fun just like in high school?

Cavani85,gxnjsf,RI students’ blackface apology & Education Minister Ong Ye Kung’s response - a discussion,2020-06-06 17:02:03,singapore,378960,17,19,"(Edited context for clarity) I got this note from a friend who is responding to OYK’s comments wrt the RI blackface apology. My friend prefers to be anonymous hence I’m posting on behalf. Here goes: 

Friend - I thought that the RI students issued a really decent apology. It showed maturity, sensitivity, and the willingness to change. I can only wish that our government would display the same attitude when confronted by criticism. 

In fact, there was no real obligation for the minister to wade in to this, but in doing so, he gives a plug for the government's commitment to ""guarding against systemic racism"". 

Let's see how that track record holds up.

OYK says:

""Thrust into independence in 1965, Singapore, as a young country was founded as a multi-racial country regardless of race, language or religion""

Friend’s response - I don't think so. In saying this, aren't you erasing the indigeneity of Malays (or some would be more specific to say, the Org Laut) and forgetting that one major reason we have multiple ethnic groups in Singapore is the immigration laws under British rule to facilitate their colonial project of divide and rule? It wasn't just ""founded"" this way- it was constructed as such- by design. It was an attempt by the British to undermine the power of the then-Malay majority, a very common colonial tactic continued by neo-colonialists around the world. We need to understand and accept this political history if we want to work on ""guarding against systemic racism"", as you said. 

OYK- “That is not to say racial differences do not exist simply by decree. Tribal instincts are part of human nature"". 

Friend’s response- Saying this sets us backwards. Scholarship has long advanced to the level we can agree on racism and racial discrimination being heavily socially constructed, and not just down to human nature. It's a lazy way of deflecting any responsibility.

OYK- “Hence, we implemented many policies over the years, and enacted laws such as the Maintenance of Religious Harmony Act, and established the Presidential Council of Minority Rights to guard against systemic racism.""

Friend’s response- Yes, but you can't whitewash the fact that our ruling politicians held racist views themselves. Here's a non-exhaustive little history:

""Three women were brought to the Singapore General Hospital, each in the same condition and each needing a blood transfusion. The first, a Southeast Asian was given the transfusion but died a few hours later. The second, a South Asian was also given a transfusion but died a few days later. The third, an East Asian, was given a transfusion and survived. That is the X factor in development."" (Lee Kuan Yew, 1967)

""I have said this on many a previous occasion: that had the mix in Singapore been different, had it been 75% Indians, 15% Malays and the rest Chinese, it would not have worked. Because they believe in the politics of contention, of opposition. But because the culture was such that the populace sought a practical way out of their difficulties, therefore it has worked.” (Lee Kuan Yew, 1985)

""It was pitch dark but not because there was no light, but because there were too many Indians around"" (MP Choo Wee Khiang, 1992)

“I have said openly that if we were 100 per cent Chinese, we would do better. But we are not and never will be, so we live with what we have.” (Lee Kuan Yew, 1998)

“I think we were progressing very nicely until the surge of Islam came. And if you asked me for my observations, the other communities have easier integration — friends, inter-marriages and so on — than Muslims ... I would say, today, we can integrate all religions and races except Islam.” (Lee later retracted this comment. Lee Kuan Yew, 2011)

""Pre-riot crowds have returned to Little India. Congregations of such high density are walking time-bombs and public disorder incidents waiting to happen. It is important that we do not take our eyes off this matter lest we want history to repeat itself."" (Denyse Phua, 2013)

But one might argue that these quotes (mostly from the most powerful person in Singapore in life and death) are just gaffes. Denyse Phua apologised for her statement, although I don't think Lee Kuan Yew ever did so until the day he died. But since the minister cited interventionist policies aimed at ""guarding against systemic racism"", what about other policies that one could argue have already contributed in enabling systemic racism?

To name a few, SAP Schools, Malays disallowed from sections of the military, and the combination of the Ethnic Integration Policy (for public housing) and the GRC system. To quote our ruling elites, the implementation of the EIP and GRC system had the following effects:

""Today with resettlement, every constituency is racially integrated. PKMS [a former Malay political party] can no longer win anywhere in Singapore"" - Lee Kuan Yew's press secretary James Fu 

""If we were less skilful, a Malay opposition party would have emerged... I know we didn’t win more than fifty percent of the Malay votes; we never did... but had there been a Malay group that emerged, and they would have emerged easily if we had proportional representation and not first-past-the-post in each constituency, you consider the polarization that would take place”- Lee Kuan Yew.

To paraphrase the two quotes in the context of the EIP and GRC in 1988, it was a way of diluting Malay electoral clout with politicians citing their open distrust of the Malay community as the reason. According to Clammer, the PAP blamed its narrow wins in certain constituencies in earlier re-elections on the Malay vote. For example, in the 1988 elections (1 year prior the implementation of the EIP), the PAP won only 50.9% of votes in Eunos and 54.9% in Bedok; both constituencies which have disproportionately large Malay populations. This contrasted against the 63.2% of votes garnered by the PAP at the national level. As a result, some analysts interpret the call for racial dispersal in public housing (as implemented in the EIP) as an attempt to undercut the perceived growth and consolidation of Malay anti-PAP votes in existing Malay ‘enclaves’ and to prevent the emergence of new centres of Malay resistance (Chih, 2002).

Things are obviously not as bad as it is for Black people in the USA. But let's not erase the fact that we have elements of a racially unequal system that is in several ways maintained by state policies and racist beliefs held by ruling elites. This post does not even cut 5% of it. Can we just admit that and work with each other to improve this instead of deflecting it all...to human nature?

And if anyone might have forgotten, this is not the first time black face was ""performed"" in RI. 

""In 1897, Lim Boon Keng founded the Chinese Philomathic Society with the intention of studying English literature, Western music, and the Chinese language. It was a Philomathic Society concert just a few years later where a Song Ong Joo was praised for giving a “particularly successful impersonation of a negro minstrel.

In 1925, a Raffles Institution student put on a performance, singing and dancing as a “n***** minstrel” during a school concert. Famous alumni who would’ve been students at RI at that time include Yusof Ishak (our first president, 1959), David Marshall (our first chief minister, 1955), Choor Singh Sidhu (Supreme Court judge, 1963) and Lim Bo Seng.""

Racism is deep, structurally embedded, and rooted in history. We must educate ourselves about it and call it out. No matter the extent, racism is racism. We must work on eradicating all forms of it in our lives. 

I don't claim expertise in how to be an anti-racist in Singapore, but this is how I see it:

Step 1: Accept that racism exists and that it is enabled by structural factors such as government policies, ideology, and social norms. 

Step 2: Call out racism in whatever form it may exist in. If you are complicit in racism, and get called out for it, listen to find out why you were called a racist (or what you did was racist), and learn how to be better. The onus is on the racist, not the people you were racist to.  

Step 3: Contribute to organizations that do good work in advocating for the elimination of racism. I don't know many organisations in Singapore that explicitly do this kind of work, but https://beyondhijab.sg/ comes to mind. They're amazing. Alternatively, set up your own spaces to organise anti-racist efforts. 

Step 4: Repeat!

The societal norms at the time were to be racist and there were actual laws enforcing it. We\'re talking about 1925 here.

We can\'t expect people in 1925 to follow norms from a 100 years later. \n\nAnd just because those chaps were students at RI doesn\'t mean they approved of the racism.

The keyword he was focusing on would then be the ""100 per cent"" and not the word ""Chinese"". That a 100 percent (insert any race here) society would do better (reasons such as stronger identity, sense of unity, etc).\n\nOf course, he could still be a racist and meant that 100% Chinese societies are better. **But my point here is please don\'t take soundbite headlines or quotations at face-value and do a source check.**', '> Step 1: Accept that racism exists and that it is enabled by structural factors such as government policies, ideology, and social norms.\n\nDifferent people have a different views on whether each policy is racist.

The ""racially unequal system"" also includes special treatment and concessions to different groups in the name of preserving a good working relationship between everyone. Litigating the past or insisting on a strictly race-blind model will unearth certain inconvenient truths and divisions that will likely be counterproductive.\n\nOverall, as time passes people are becoming more conscious of what they do and say.

I would recommend that this lockdown/quarantine period is a great time to remove all the external baggage that we have assumed in this business-centric, consumerist society, one by one and rediscover your own self-worth and value. At least that is my personal belief towards true happiness.\n\nTake a break from the world, dive into yourself!"", ""More of my friends have been doing video calls or streaming together. It's a nice way to hang out and get socialization! :)"", ""Keep up the exercising. Can get a skipping rope and aim to skip as lightly and as long as possible. Set a target like doing 20 continuous (uninterrupted) skips at first if you aren't so good. Then increase the number everyday.\n\nPractice singing. Memorise the lyrics. And set aside time for singing everyday.\n\nBody-scanning meditation - it can be done seated/standing/lying-down. Scan through your body from head to toes. Identify which part of the muscle is tight and tensed. 'Breathe' gently into the tightness and relax. If you don't know how to relax that tightness yet through 'breathing', can try to contract that muscle part while breathing in, then releasing the contraction while breathing out. Repeat several times.\n\nSupplement your online reading with more positive materials. Go get some books or find sites that host good stories.

He simply replied:\n\n>“Who knows if it’s bad luck.”\n\n>The next day, the horse returned, bringing several wild horses back with it. Hearing the news, the nosy neighbours came congratulating Sai Ong, “Wow, so good luck!” But Sai Ong was unmoved. He simply replied:\n\n>“Who knows if it’s good luck.”\n\n>And the next next day when Sai Ong’s son tried to ride one of these wild horses, he was thrown off and thus broke his leg. Again the nosy neighbours gathered to offer their sympathy, “Wow, so bad luck!” But Sai Ong was unmoved. He simply replied:\n\n>“Who knows if it’s bad luck.”\n\n>Not long after, the country was invaded. Many soldiers died in the war. In the name of National Service, conscription officers came drafting boys of suitable age to fight the invaders. But because Sai Ong’s son had a broken leg, the officers exempted him.

In my opinion, dropping H2 chemistry or H2 physics is better as the science practical is indeed a big burden. \nAlso to take note, if you’re running out of time, just give up your H1 subject, solely focus on 3 H2s, as you can redo H1 subject next year in a single sitting to replace your this year H1 grade (do confirm this info with your teacher) \n\n\nAll the best, there’s still time to make a difference.', 'Hey can U pm me?\n\nMy dm option is not working']"

Loud-Relationship111,ilqxmz,Pre-enlistee with Bipolar Diagnosis,2020-09-03 18:31:55,NationalServiceSG,11091,4,6,"Hello.

I was supposed to enlist in mid-August as a PES C2 (due to homosexuality I presume), but after reading the enlistment letter sent to me in mid-July, I experienced acute anxiety and depression (I know it sounds stupid, but it really really affected me and I couldn't function for days) and referred myself to IMH which gotten myself diagnosed as having Adjustment Disorder and temporarily PES D again.

During my next appointment at IMH a few weeks later, the doctor diagnosed me as emerging Bipolar Disorder and put me on medications (which are surely working for me). From the sources I've read and seen around Reddit, I am aware that those sources described that bipolar is a straight route to PES F.

However, when I took the IMH psychiatrist's memo for an appointment that was booked for me for another interview with the SAF psychiatrist, the SAF psychiatrist used language and phrases that strongly suggested that I wouldn't be exempted; and after the interview, the SAF psychiatrist said that my PES was still undetermined and that they would get a full medical report from IMH to finalize my PES; which made me worried because what I experienced was different from the sources I read describing bipolar as a straight route to PES F.

I would like to ask for opinions (or experiences/anecdotes) and I know at this point it's purely speculations, but all this waiting is making me worried as I am extremely terrified of being enlisted and fear for my mental health.

Familiar_Marzipan_92,i2admw,Mental Health in Family member,2020-08-02 19:09:27,MentalHealthSG,656,6,7,"Just creating this post to see if anyone knows of/has been through such situation and what are the usual steps? From my basic understanding, it seems that unless there's an intent to hurt oneself/others, one would not be physically detained/admitted.

Long story but the gist of it is my mother (approaching 60s) started accusing my dad of infidelity about 2 years ago (mid 2018). Now, she's always been the type to overthink and be 'paranoid' but this was different. Her accusations would also not be sound ones - like she would say she 'knows' that my dad is secretly calling his other woman during work. Or that his 'whatsapp' last online was 5 mins of the woman's

Went on and off on and off. Sometimes it would be once a month, other times a few times.

So this year - start of the year - nothing happened because my dad had an operation and was just recovering.. All was well till recently. I noticed that her accusations have 'evolved' from infidelity to now straight up running the gamut of my dad badmouthing her to his colleagues/relatives to now even me. When I bring up some things I want to do/eat, she would almost immediately ask me if I'm doing that because my dad told me to (or planted idea in my head).

So this is because I brought up to her yesterday that I was thinking of doing a masters in another field - am currently working in the engineering (civil) sector in SG and what with covid + the engineering industry, it's been on my mind a while now to change fields. So naturally, she thinks it's my dad that egged me on.

And they just had a huge argument (taking into account from 2018 to now) where all the accusations are thrown about & even ridiculous ones that she's just bringing in to fit her narrative (like how my dad planted the idea but wants me to do it in xx Uni because it's a 1 year course and a 2 year course would be expensive etc etc). So the argument was bad, lots of shouting, things got thrown about. Thankfully, no one was physically hurt.

But this got me thinking. I don't know when the next one would be& how bad it might be. Aside from calling the IMH hotline to ask for advice - which I plan to do so tomorrow at work - is there anything else that can/should be done?

Mom and Dad visited our GP once (we are familiar with them because they've seen me since I were a kid so about 20 years) - back in 2018 and then the GP told my mom she's more concerned with my mom's mental health than my dad's, which my mom - back at home - accused my dad of planting the idea in the doctor's head/painting a bad image of her.

I've done really preliminary research/google - not too much since Idk much about all these and google results tend to indicate anything and everything - but it seems to be a bit of a delusional disorder? seems like a mix between jealousy and persecutory.

The salary of a fresh doctor graduate is around 3.8-4.2k  according to my friend. 
Furthermore, a doctor work hours in a week (according to guidelines) should not exceed 80hrs a week, yet many doctors worked beyond that (there was a straits timr articles on this). To put things into context, if I'm not wrong, my friend has been working day for day since sunday. My friend have clocked 2 'on-call duty' (one on call is 36hrs, a normal shift is 12hrs) this week, no rest days. Yes, doctors can't just leave at the end of the shift as patients might still need them. But isn't it contrary if doctors can't be healthy (work until exhaustion)?

It’s not about pay to me, but about all the factors regarding the occupation (as was mentioned by OP).

For context, I have a learning disability (ADD) and anxiety disorders that I normally had under control with medication. Pre-HBL, I was confident that I would be pretty much fine until Covid had to strike and I'm terrified about my grades as I'm taking O's this year after repeating Sec Three.

With ADD, it's already difficult for me to concentrate in class, let alone at home because of my family members constantly making noise or asking me to do errands and I tend to lose focus quickly even after putting myself in an empty room to study and deleting most of my social media just to complete a short practice paper. I've tried multiple approaches to studying such as the Pomodoro method, and even making notes or re-doing practice papers but it's still difficult to even retain information. 

Medication only works to a certain extent because the ones I take have side effects such as hyperfocus that would affect my studies even more.

I'm seriously running out of ideas on how to stay focused on studies because I really want to pass my O's. Whenever I see my neurotypical classmates study and focus while on HBL, it just makes me feel dejected because it seems so easy to them.

After all, he fucked up his own suicide and now the State have to do the dirty work for him.', '> # Woodlands double murder: ‘Don’t be scared, papa is here’, accused told daughter before killing her\n\n> SINGAPORE — Teo Ghim Heng was determined to make sure his pregnant wife and daughter were dead, which showed he was in control of his actions and made a conscious decision to end their lives, a psychiatrist testified on Thursday (July 4).\n\n> Teo had urged his wife not to struggle, and told the four-year-old girl before strangling her to death: “Don’t be scared, papa is here.”\n\n> While Teo also tried to kill himself ""on his own terms"", he told the psychiatrist, Dr Derrick Yeo, that he did not succeed because many of the attempts were ""either too painful or too difficult"".\n\n> New details of the killings emerged on the third day of Teo’s murder trial on Thursday. The 43-year-old has admitted to the murders but his lawyers will seek to prove that he had a major depressive disorder at the time of the offences.\n\n> Dr Yeo, a prosecution witness and consultant psychiatrist from the Institute of Mental Health, opined that Teo was not suffering from any mental disorder on Jan 20, 2017 when he killed his wife, Choong Pei Shan, and their young daughter. Dr Yeo, who interviewed Teo after the murders, instead diagnosed him with an adjustment disorder following the killings.\n\n> For a week, Teo stayed in the flat with the two bodies. He also claimed to have tried to take his own life by setting fire to the bodies and lying next to them on the bed in the master bedroom, but later felt the fire was too hot and left the flat.\n\n> Police officers discovered the charred bodies on Jan 28, 2017 — the first day of Chinese New Year — and arrested him.\n\n> ‘YOU’VE GOT TO LET GO ALREADY’\n\n> On Thursday, Deputy Public Prosecutor (DPP) Han Ming Kuang took Dr Yeo through the reports he made while interviewing Teo, as part of a forensic clinical evaluation.\n\n> Dr Yeo explained that determining an accused person’s mental state at the time helps to establish criminal responsibility, and whether a mental disorder contributed to the offences.\n\n> The psychiatrist noted that Teo had no past psychiatric history and did not misuse substances. He had financial difficulties, and told Dr Yeo about the “high expenditures he incurred on a monthly basis to maintain his lifestyle and support his wife and child”.\n\n> On that fateful morning, Teo said he deliberately removed the girl’s preschool uniform and put her in home clothes again. An argument then broke out between him and Choong.\n\n> It was previously revealed that Choong called him “useless” in front of the girl, which Teo said angered him so much that he strangled her with a towel.\n\n> Teo had told Dr Yeo that he felt Choong would be “hounded” by the people he owed money to, and “made the unilateral decision as father and head of the household to end all their lives together”.\n\n> When Teo noticed his wife kicking her legs on the bed as she tried to resist him, he said he told her in Mandarin: “Shan, you’ve got to let go already. I owe a lot of money. If you struggle, you will suffer because I owe outside a lot of money.”\n\n> After killing his wife, Teo turned to his daughter and assured her: “Don’t be scared, papa is here.” He also decided to kill himself “to reunite the family”.\n\n> Dr Yeo noted: “It clearly reflects his goal-orientedness and how his actions were premeditated in that he was following the plan to end the lives of everyone in the family.”\n\n> As Teo looped the towel around the girl’s neck, Teo recalled telling her in Mandarin: “Go find your mummy first, papa will come soon.” About five minutes later, he used his hands to finish the job on his daughter.\n\n> When the psychiatrist asked him why he took the girl’s life as well, he said that he felt his family members would not be able to adequately care for her.\n\n> Dr Yeo also considered Teo’s actions in the week following the murders. He had lied to his work supervisors about why he could not report for work, and used Choong’s mobile phone to give excuses to his family about why they could not attend Chinese New Year festivities.\n\n> “He was able to go back to watching television, driving out to buy food, all while he was researching feasible ways of ending his life. The accused also told me he tried various methods to try to end his life but he was unsuccessful. He apparently wanted to die on his own terms but many of the attempts he tried were either too painful, too difficult or not successful for him.”\n\n> This clearly meant that he was not of unsound mind, and “his behaviour showed that he was in full cognitive control and volitive control” of his actions, Dr Yeo added.\n\n> DPP Han also took him through four handwritten suicide notes that were most likely written by Teo. He had signed one of them off with his wife’s name.\n\n> One in particular — addressed to Teo’s and Choong’s parents — told them to split their house, car and Central Provident Fund monies between both sets of parents.\n\n> Dr Yeo said this showed that he had the “presence of mind” to make such due considerations, and was “cognisant that these are big items that would be of help to his elderly parents”.\n\n> NO REGRETS\n\n> Earlier on Thursday, another medical expert, Dr Melonie Sriranganathan from Changi General Hospital, took the stand.\n\n> During cross-examination by Teo’s lawyer Eugene Thuraisingam, she testified that in the days following Teo’s arrest, he told psychiatrists in the hospital that “he had no regrets”.\n\n> The only regret he had was that he had to take the life of his innocent young daughter, she added, while reading from clinical notes that her colleague Dr Ong Pui Sim had taken.\n\n> The results of his liver function test were also consistent with a drug overdose. He had claimed to have tried to kill himself by swallowing more than 100 tablets of Panadol (paracetamol).\n\n> The trial continues on Friday.\n\n> \n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'This sickens me to the core.', 'death sentence for this fucker is too mediocre punishment. this guy needs to be burned perpetually. he needs to fucking burn! fuck this guy!

I get batshit nervous, shortness of breath, can't form proper sentences and my speaking vocab becomes nonexistent  while for ADHD (which I suspect I have) has made it difficult for me to focus during meetings and talks between colleagues such that I forget whatever that was mentioned. I have written them down but yet my supervisor always points out missing info in my emails which he has mentioned to me before.

First of all, sorry you've been feeling really down and unwell.\n\nIt sounds like you need focused medical help for your mental health. There are many ways to go about getting help, but one easy step is going to the polyclinic and asking for a referral to mental health specialists. Make sure you're very clear about what you want to get out of your polyclinic visit (don't let them invalidate how you feel, or dismiss your experience). You would then be able to see a mental health professional at IMH or any of the new mental health clinics (tied to polyclinics) around the country, depending on what's most geographically convenient for you. It would be subsidised!\n\nEspecially since you mentioned ADHD, social anxiety, and depression, you may need more support than just CBT, so I'd let the professionals decide for you. When you do see the doctor though, consider if you're open to the option of medication, or are you only open to treatment options that do not involve medication. This will help you negotiate a treatment plan.\n\nAs for depression, there are many options that are available that can be affordable - including FSCs, NGOs like AWARE (particularly for ladies), TOUCH Community Services, Shan You, and so on.\n\nYou can also explore free CBT resources online and try learning the methods yourself.\n\nHope this helps :)"", 'I have anxiety disorder.

All along I knew something was up with me but all thru primary to uni, my counsellors never once suggested I go for a psychiatric assessment. I decided to take matters into my own hands and went to a polyclinic months ago for an IMH referral to see if I hav ADHD because of my poor work performance. Turns out I have PDD (persistent depressive disorder), and was finally diagnosed after struggling with my low mood, regular crying, anxiety and self-harm for the past 12 years (am 24).

I was prescribed Sertraline. I've been taking it for 2 days now. I'm feeling more anxious and the chest tightness (do other fellow depressive mood disorder sufferers feel this too?) and anxiety happens over a longer period than it usually does. Even as I type I'm feeling it.

Not sure if it's the meds, but I'm sure that the diagnosis has added on to my stress. I don't know what to think about this diagnosis. Nothing's changed really, I've just gotten a label to my behaviour. As of now I don't see the diagnosis as an answer. I don't know even know if I can trust that good things will come from this diagnosis. I also don't have anyone to speak to except my SO because I don't know how this will affect my relationships with my family and friends. I don't want them to think I'm using it as an excuse for my poor ability to keep up conversations. 

Please advise on how to cope with this new diagnosis.

Edit:

I misinterpreted the article and CSM's post. The linked lyrics aren't going to be banned. You can watch [Shanmugan's speech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySWiheMpPRs) for the full picture on ""offensive speech"". He uses the lyrics as an example of ""offensive speech"", then elaborates on how they decide what ""offensive speech"" to ban.

Also, he didn't actually propose any changes to existing laws. His speech was mostly justifying/explaining the approach toward hate speech, explaining the Watain ban in the process.

-----

From the article ""[Ariana Grande, Lady Gaga lyrics listed as 'offensive' in Parliament handout](https://sg.news.yahoo.com/ariana-grande-lady-gaga-lyrics-listed-offensive-parliament-handout-135538741.html)"":

> The minister also said that offensive speech can lead to “**dehumanisation**” and create an environment “**conducive to discrimination and eventually violence**”. Offensive speech, which can imply that its targets lack **morality, intelligence or dignity**, is “even more insidious” than hate speech, he added.

Lawrence Khong, FCBC Pastor, February 19 2014:

> The greatest fallacy of the LGBT argument is: I have no choice. I am born this way. Therefore, I can't help it. I've tried so hard to change. So give me my space. It is my right. Don't oppress me.""
>
> As a pastor of more than 36 years, I've heard this again and again from different people, even well-educated and successful people, on so many different destructive behaviours.
>
> This is exactly what drug addicts have told me. ""I have no choice. I can't help it. I've tried so hard to change. I've gone in and out of DRC. Everytime I come out, I am determined to change. But before I can get home after my release, I'm back on drugs. So I'm born this way. This is my fate, my lot. Give me my space. It is my right. Don't oppress me.""
>
> A husband said to me, ""I can't help it. When I am attracted to a woman, I have to pursue her until I can have her. I love my wife. But I can't help it. I am made this way.""
>
> **I hear the same from wife beaters, gamblers, kleptomaniacs, pedophiles, homosexuals, lesbians and so on**. Now, in putting them on a linear list like this, I risk being misunderstood as comparing the LGBTs, for example, with drug addicts, wife beaters and so forth. Hey, in no way am I saying that. Not at all.
>
> So, as a pastor, I make time to hear them out. I have seen them crying profusely in my office about their struggles. They are so genuine, so honest with their feelings, so sincere, and **yet SO WRONG**.
>
> I counsel them to act against their own passions. I confront them with their wrongs—because even if it is a case of compulsive disorder or pre-disposition as some would claim, they cannot use that as a final criteria for what is right and wrong, and justify themselves. In fact, being pre-disposed in a certain way does not mean that the person has to give in to those predispositions. So, I help them not to make excuses. I teach them to take personal responsibility and not to blame others. And above all, as a pastor, I help them to encounter God and His power.
>
> I've seen many change over the years. But there are also many who harden their hearts. Some get angry at me for calling **what they do as sin**. For example, pornography, drug abuse, molestation, **homosexuality**, adultery, etc. Sadly, just because I don't accept their excuses, they walk away saying that I don't understand. They think I despise them when **I insist that what they’re doing is wrong**. However, like a physician, the most cruel thing to do is to tell a patient that his cancer is ok. Everything is fine.
>
> This is the deception I see occurring around the world in regard to morality. If the gay who practises anal sex says ""I am born this way, so give me my rights,"" why can't the pedophile and all those who **practise incest, necrophilia and beastiality say the same thing**.
>
> What if one day we discover the existence of a violent gene. Do we then relax or abolish laws against murder? The difference between man and animal is this: as human beings, we don't have to yield to our primal instincts. We cannot just do whatever we feel like doing, however we please. We have the freedom of choice and the capacity to do what is best for humanity, for our nation and for civilisation.

In 2016, a Christian, Bryan Lim, threatened to [""open-fire"" on LGBTs](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/bryan-lim-charged-threatening-open-fire-lgbt-community-singapore):

> I am a Singaporean citizen. I am a NSman. I am a father. And I swore to protect my nation. Give me the permission to open fire. I would like to see these £@€$^*s die for their causes...

Perhaps Minister Shanmugam has a point about ""offensive speech"". It can plausibly ""create an environment conducive to discrimination and eventually violence"".  

I wonder whether our laws will protect all targets or only select groups.

-----

Edit:  

Some would say we've been closer to Religion-inspired violence against LGBTs than we've been to Ariana-Grande-inspired violence against Christians. If ""offensive speech"" like Ariana's lyrics are deemed illegal, some would say it follows that anti-LGBT speech like Lawrence Khong's must also be illegal.

I am not a lawyer. What do you guys think, will there be a *legal* case against anti-LGBT speech like Lawrence Khong's if ""offensive speech"" is banned and performers with histories of ""offensive speech"" are banned?

-----

Edit: 

Update from Shanmugan's FB:

> My Parliamentary colleague Mr Chen Show Mao enclosed a list of songs. I gave the list in Parliament (see below).
> 
> People who did not listen to the speech may misunderstand that the list contains songs which have been banned (!) or are going to be banned (!)
> 
> All of that is untrue.
> 
> I made the point that people may find many things offensive. And gave the list as an illustration.
> 
> Doesn’t mean that it can all get banned, just because some people find it offensive. That is also a point I made in the speech.

Last year I enrolled into college but I had to quit halfway because of some personal issues I was having, but my form tutor promised me that they would allow me to rejoin as a freshman. These issues actually got worse in the 7ish months I was gone, and of course I hit my limit when I was told I would have to join back the school as a retainee rather than a freshman. I didn't know anyone there and felt isolated. I didn't understand the subject content they were teaching us and when I told them plain and simple I don't know, the tutors got quite upset at me when I wasn't even in school when these were taught. After that, I just felt like an idiot and began skipping the classes planned for us since I didnt even have the subject notes to refer back to.

So, orientation rolls around. I fall sick and miss half of it, missing the chance to bond with the actual freshmen. Now I'm stuck with debilitating anxiety, little friends and my family thinks I just want to skip school because I'm lazy but really I just can't bear to go out there and face everyone. I'm honestly this close to committing suicide because I just can't click with the freshmen and all my J2 friends are settled in with their own clique where I'm constantly left out. I even tried to switch my CCA because i didn't actually like it, but the CCA HOD is a pos and told me to stay in my current one since I already have background in it, and told me off when I said I would apply for auditions later on when the freshmen come in. In the end, I achieved nothing in the month I've been in college. 

Has anyone been in a similar situation, does it get better? Should I persevere and just stick to trying to finish the two years in college and try to approach my tutors about this, or should I just give up?

tryinbutdying,f7nbbi,[Rant] Anyone else with such severe mental health issues as I do? Sharing my story here,2020-02-22 12:08:15,SGExams,77716,11,31,"Okay this gonna be a long rant

 but yeah I noticed that many people have posted questions regarding mental health issues and as a mental health patient myself since 2014, I just wanted to rant about having mental illnesses. 

(I have a long medical history of mental health struggles with several types of anxiety disorder, panic disorder and depression.)

Sometimes I really wished I was normal. I wished I didn't have an overly anxious and ambitious personality, didn't feel so much academic stress and fear over doing maths and sciences, didn't have to go through primary school to JC (am in Uni now) putting pressure on myself to do well academically bcos I'm the only child and I feel I have a moral obligation to provide for my parents financially in the future cos if not whose gonna take care of them and

 I wish I didn't try to attempt suicide thinking that there is no harm jumping down the 2nd floor of my primary school building in Primary 5,leading to many in the school knowing and making jokes about it and this carried on to secondary school (lower secondary) and i was bullied all the way to upper secondary despite having different classmates as we were divided into classes based on our subject combination (some were from the same class in lower sec)

and I had these group of boys in my class who just really hated me and there was this guy called V(I don't want to put his full name as I don't want to doxx) who threw a chair and it hit my left arm. He didn't hit my right arm and I was told he realized I was a right hander and he didn't want to affect my future. And I was cyberbullied and told to die so many times and one time in chemistry class I felt like cutting myself because of their bullying and I didn't have a penknife with me but only a plastic ruler and so I used that and they laughed when I cried as I used the ruler over my wrist and told me to cut myself with ""the real thing"" rather than the ruler which did not harm me anyway.

 They even ganged up on me on our class whatsapp group and stalked and harrassed and threatened to hurt me further as well as disturbed me during lessons and I was socially excluded and didn't have any friends in the class and this made my social anxiety worse and I could only go from school to home and home to school.  I developed Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) from my upper sec experience, which is an anxiety disorder based on traumatic flashbacks of the past and this worsened my panic attacks and generalized anxiety disorder. I was encouraged by my teachers to ignore the bullies and focus on my studies and they had punished them but the bullies continued bullying me. I was so stressed with academics especially with E and A maths to the point I had a very bad panic attack and mental breakdown at the end of year exam in Sec3. The school referred me to a psychiatrist and I was diagnosed with anxiety and depression and in early 2015, I started taking psychiatric medication for all the anxiety disorders I suffer from as well as depression. 

I went on to JC to escape the bullies who are bent on going Poly and also bcos I felt JC is an easier route to University and I liked the humanities subjects offered by JC and my first year was a challenge as I struggled with JC1 stress (I took h2 maths cos I thought I met the bare requirements for arts stream students to take:B3 for a maths) along with H1 Project Work and Chinese and had to have increased dosage of medications due to the panic attacks affecting my concentration in classes and missing lessons to see the psychiatrist and psychologist. 

I failed h2 maths and was given a chance to repeat JC1 following a talk with the vice principal in my JC  and changed my subject combination to H1 maths and moved my china studies in english from H1 to H2. JC1 2017 started out with me being older than my new classmates and I was known by many as a retainee (our JC called us Kairos and we were in Kairos programme) and they eventually had their own cliques and I felt left out from the class and we had a very strict co form teacher who gave us a lot of pressure in our studies and there were a few classmates and schoolmates who started spreading really ridiculous rumours about how the teacher is my mother when she wasn't and her bullying me when she didn't and she was harsh to a lot of people, not just me.  This continued to J2 and this classmate she went around spreading rumours that the teacher hit me when she didn't and of me being abused which WASN'T true and it affected my reputation in JC and made a lot of ppl hate me as they believed in the rumours and thought that what I shared on Instagram (of loving parents and family) wasn't true. 

Fast forward, now I am in Year 1 Sem 2 of Uni and am still dealing with anxiety issues caused by stress and haters. However,  I am glad I made it so far because of my family (my parents), my teachers from primary to JC, professors, deans, lecturers, and teaching assistants in Uni as well as tuition teachers, the few close friends I have, the school counsellors, the student support managers and disability support managers in Uni, seniors and juniors from my cca and from secondary and JC, as well as the school principals, other school staff including the friendly canteen staff who gave me encouragement to continue with my studies, the security guards who are always very nice, as well as other acquaintances who I have met in my life whether currently or in the past, 

And they are the reason why I want to stay strong and will myself to continue living. 

My family loves me and they spent at least at least ten thousand dollars on my psychologist and psychiatrist visits, therapy and medications. 
I really want to get better but I'm just still struggling and taking more medications (more types of medications and old medications increased in dosage) and I feel so constantly anxious in Uni for no reason.Recently, I was referred to the Uni UHC psychiatrist with the help of my faculty support manager bcos of a panic attack incident that led to me feeling suicidal and the vice dean and my student support manager reached out to me and shared with me the available resources in the event I need help. 

I am managing so far and am doing okay but I just feel so exhausted with all my mental health struggles and sometimes, I really wish to be normal. I mean normal people do feel anxiety and sadness but the extent is different. Furthermore, my medications made me really drowsy throughout the day and I feel super unproductive in my studies. 

Sometimes I feel I would have done WAY better in my studies if I were normal and felt I missed out a lot of opportunities bcos of my mental health issues.  I keep willing myself to go on and stay strong bcos I know I don't want to disappoint those who love me and bcos I am very close to my family and my family loves me a lot and is behind me, supporting me emotionally other than financially. (both my mum and dad) 


Anyone else going through anxiety, panic disorder/ panic attacks and/or depression as well?  Was thinking of forming a support group that could also provide academic help.

SIGHS I just want to be normal without having anxiety, panic disorder and depression UGHS:(

TLDR: Sorry for the lengthy rant but yeah man, I hope sharing my story will let me find more people who are going through mental health issues, especially the constant panic attacks that make u feel like dying and can't breathe, nauseous and heart racing to the point you think you are going crazy, as well as to let me know that I am not alone in all these struggles man. 


And I wouldn't wish anxiety or depression or both on any of my haters I swear cos going thru all these is really bad and I can't imagine another person suffering from all these anxiety, depressive thoughts and panic attacks.",0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7nbbi/rant_anyone_else_with_such_severe_mental_health/,"['[deleted]', ""You're not alone. I suffered from social anxiety since pri sch days (so nearly 2 decades and counting) and major depression since JC. I can totally understand how you feel. Uni is such a bad environment for people like us because of both the social and academic stress. People around us seem to be so well-adjusted and look forward to everyday, and you feel a lot of pressure to be like them. People are also more self-centred so you can't really seek help from your peers and they're unforgiving if you commit a social faux pas because you're awkward.\n\n>(our JC called us Kairos and we were in Kairos programme)\n\nPioneer JC?\n\n>Was thinking of forming a support group that could also provide academic help.\n\nI've always thought about doing this but was unsure of how it'll be received. I guess it's a good start knowing someone else out there has the same idea."", 'Hi I’m doing o levels private candidate now( I’m supposed to be Sec 4 this year) \nAnyways I’ve always had social anxiety but just assumed I was extra shy but in primary six I noticed I was depressed and extremely suicidal by the end of the year. In primary five and six I actually attended sch like 2-3/5 days a week but managed to score 250 for PSLE ( everybody knew me as mc queen though)\nThen i got accepted into YTSS but I only went for the first day of school and had a panic Attack pretty much throughout the entire day and didn’t attend sch at all the rest of the year. My parents were pissed and wanted to send me to an all girls home ( no offence but the girls are there cause of smoking , drugs , teen pregnancy etc) and I’m just a scaredy cat goody two shoes. Because I wouldn’t tell them why I wasn’t going to school but it’s cause my anxiety was so bad I couldn’t even talk to my parents. The school got the social worker to talk to me and I thought - i already knew I had social anxiety and depression at this point cause it was so severe - I could manoeuvre my way to let them know I had anxiety without actually saying it but the social worker just wrote it off as typical new school anxiety even though I insisted it wasn’t and kept saying ANXIETY ANXIETY. Thankfully later in the year I had a medical appt at kkh and the doctor found out I wasn’t in sch and referred me to an adolescent specialist and then later to a psychologist where I got officially diagnosed with anxiety and went through therapy. Anyways up till last year , two years later, I enrolled in a private school at Sec 2 ( supposed to be Sec 3 but cause I missed Sec 1 basics) which cost my family $10000 but I only attended for a few months cause the curriculum was too slow and basic I mean it felt like I was learning primary sch stuff except for the maths. The principal actually said when I was enrolling that if I can cope I can skip a year which means I go to Sec 3 ( this was a huge reason why I decided to enrol in the first place) but then when I wanted to the school kept making excuses cause I think they would have lost out a years worth of school fees ($10000) . So I withdrew and started doing private tuition last August at Sec 3 syllabus and managed to complete it by December. Crazy right?!??!? I’ve stopped going to therapy cause my anxiety has gotten tremendously better after it. Before I couldn’t even go down to the void deck alone and now I can go meet my sister in town by myself! but I still felt extremely bad cause $10000 + 2 years worth of $45 therapy sessions once a week + $1100 every month since August up till this year o levels and my family isn’t rich in any way. People think I’m lazy and just entitled but if didn’t have anxiety I would go to government school. My family makes do but my parents have some debts to other family members over the years. So now I’m currently doing just Sec 4 amath and pure bio finished the pure chem and emath syllabus already. I’m Glad my anxiety has gotten better despite all the horrible moments before but I’m still nervous about amath help! I’m very much a perfectionist to an extreme level (even my therapist said so) but in primary school I always didn’t study and managed to get a star for everything (except chinese) so struggling with amath now feels like a worst case scenario ( I know I’m overreacting but that’s how I genuinely feel) I Guess I’ve always had it easy with academics even emath is extremely simple to me and I only started it last August from Sec 1 -4 in a few months. I fear amath will pull my grades down ( I want to go to acjc but cause I got no bonus points everything must score I need 5A1 1B3 or like 4A1 2A2) I think I can get A1 for everything else except mother tongue but I won’t use that for my l1r5. Honestly throughout these four years my end goal has always been just to complete my o levels even though I’m already planning for uni. But recently I’ve been having second thoughts about whether I’m ready cause I’m terrified and I think the exam centre is my previous Sec sch and I have primary sch friends there so awkward and embarrassing and I fear that the school environment and the fact I was supposed to go there will give me a panic Attack and then I’ll breakdown and it’ll affect my abilities during the exam.  But I’m hoping everything will be okay still got time right?!?!!?!?!?! Tbh ytss didn’t do much for checking in on me except asking if I will go back to sch. When they completed the official withdrawal so that I could go private sch they just wrote that I didn’t attend sch at all ( in a manner that seemed like I just couldn’t be bothered to when I was really struggling) \nAny tips for staying calm during exam and amath advice?', 'I relate!!', ""Thank you for sharing your experience and let's jiayous and stay strong!!❤💪"", 'Yea I was from PJC last batch HAHA. Were u from my JC as well?', ""breathing exercises would help. jiayous for o's this year okk !! <3"", 'Omg thanks!! Do u struggle with all these too?❤', 'Yeah. PJC was known for retaining people hahaha. I was from kairos also. My year had 120+ retainees.', 'Thank you so much!!!', 'Ooh what year were you in PJC?', '2012 to 2014']"
CaptBriyani,gy7hy9,The line between abuse and discipline,2020-06-07 14:46:13,MentalHealthSG,656,3,12,"Inspired by another thread on this subreddit, I wonder what many think of the parenting style some Singaporean parents seem to adopt which uses abuse as a way in order to solve any sort of problems.

Growing up I had a single mother whose parenting methods were not ideal to say the least in ny eyes. She constantly took out all her anger and fustrations on me and my older brother. Didn't make a bed cause I had to rush for tution immediately after class and really didn't have time? I come home to see her slamming all the doors in anger? Failed a test? Instant barrage of slaps and silent treatment from her for atleast a week as well as threats to put me in boys home on my birthday if I didn't do well for PSLE. Couldn't do some questions on an assessment book? Instantly slapped a number of times well as a barrage of verbal abuse.  One time i was slapped and hit by my mom just because I didn't put curry( or as indians call it dhal) on my plate
Constantly telling a 12 year old boy that he was the reason that his mother developed cancer and looked so ugly. And many many more cases.
All her constant internal anger and hatred for everyone around her led to her developing colorectal cancer and passing away in 2014
My brother and I have speculated that my mother had some form of mental illnesses as she showed symptoms of borderline personality disorder as well as bipolar disorder but never sought help for it as she did not want to lose face.

It wasn't until a few years later that I realized that her behaviour was downright abusive and that it wasn't how parents are suppoused to treat their kids. Asian cultures seem to encourage using abusive behaviours as a form of discipline regardless of the effect it has on a child and I wonder what people think about it and where the line between abuse and discipline is drawn.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSG/comments/gy7hy9/the_line_between_abuse_and_discipline/,"['Hi, I have to say I feel you on this.\n\nMuch like I’ve mentioned in my comment on the other post I presume you came from, some parents in the Asian culture believe that punishment is the way to go, to teach their children. However, punishment can range from reprimanding to hitting. \n\nI never saw it as abuse. I always saw it as “oh this is how my parents are teaching me”. I didn’t realise it was an issue until I talked to me friends about it and they were shocked. I didn’t realise it until I was punishing myself using self-harm, etc. It really sticks with us.\n\nMore research, such as this one about [childhood trauma and its relation to chronic depression in adulthood](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4677006/), is starting to show that abuse does indeed increase your risks of developing mental health issues in the long run.\n\nI must say, thank you for speaking up. Not a lot of people understand that these do leave imprints on you as you grow older. It’s trauma, and we still have to heal from it.', ""I think there is a balance somewhere;\n\ne.g. for a hot pan and a parent is trying to stop and protect child\n\n1-guides the child to touch a safe part without burning hand, and inform child about safety (most ideal)\n\n2-allows the child to touch it and prepares to pull the child away if its too much (maybe ok for older kids aka learn the hard way)\n\n3-beats the hand lightly and say 'do not touch it' (safe but IMO child doesn't really learn anything)\n\nI think anything beyond these 3 is considered abuse?\n\nI think partly why Asian cultures do this is because they see the pain of discipline in academics is worth paying for as compared to the pain of failure later in life. While I agree with this notion, I see discipline as a value that is influenced and not 'beaten into'. \n\nI do observed the fear of being beaten or abuse may drive someone to some level of success, but surely there must be better ways of motivation. Maybe once or twice it somehow works; think O levels and PSLE, which actually serves as very bad examples to us, but maybe not parents POV. Especially if their focus is academic success 'at any cost'. \n\nOverall I still see this is not healthy in the long run and has a certain ceiling towards real success in life."", '>Asian cultures seem to encourage using abusive behaviours as a form of discipline\n\nThere is an extremely fine line between discipline and punishment. The difference that separates the two is that discipline focuses on the behaviour, while punishment focuses on the person himself. \n\nFuthermore, our Asian culture views physical actions (especially caning, hitting on the buttocks/open palm) as acceptable, while in Western countries, such actions are seen as barbaric and they prefer ""softer"" measures to discipline their children, e.g. grounding, taking away pocket money, giving extra household chores.\n\nA lot of parents (particularly Gen X) simply use the way they themselves were parented in the 1960s-1970s by the Boomer generation. Displays of affection were seen as spoiling their children, especially for boys, so parenting in those days was simply ideas like feed the children, send them to school, don\'t let them die, and hopefully they will get a good job to help support the family. Naughty kids were caned to ""set them straight"" without much regard for the impact that the punishment had on the them, beyond the physical pain. \n\nFast forward to now, where we understand that physically punishing children leaves life-long impact on them. The bodily wounds will heal but the emotional ones take far, far longer.\n\nAnd of course, there are many other forms of abuse that often go along with physical punishment. All of which are just as devastating.']"
wakkawakkaaaa,dx23pa,Help: my sister is mentally unstable,2019-11-16 12:18:39,singapore,378960,15,99,"I suspect my sister has a case of borderline personality disorder. And she's turned to alcohol which makes her even more unstable with elements of violence and abusiveness. Spoke to her about getting help but she's not responsive. 

Last night she was mildly intoxicated and tried to make a scene at her boyfriend's home. We had to physically restrain her until the police came. And it's not the first time she's caused such a scene and my family has been putting up with such behaviour from her for almost a year. There's other incidents where she assaulted and hurt someone which almost led to civil suit (settled before court), slept outdoor on the boyfriend's car, turned up unannounced at night to disturb me and my family's tenants and more. She plans to pursue legal action against me and her boyfriend for causing hurt to her. She also alleged rape from the boyfriend with out of context WhatsApp conversations. 

She's a single mother and has been living with my family with her son (8yo). Now she's planning on moving out, bringing my nephew with her, dismissing her domestic helper and threatening neglect on the kid. She asked my family to give her 10k for custody of the kid. All these just to get to my mom who loves the nephew for getting me involved and escalating last night incident. 

She strangled me briefly last night for trying to stop her but was stopped by my mother. I suffered multiple scratches from that and from her struggling when restrained. My injuries were documented by the police with camera but my statement wasn't taken. Was asked if I wanna pursue a case and I declined. Just spoke to MSF child protection service regarding the potential child neglect as she is very likely  of unsound mind and waiting on them to get back to me.

I have been lurking around to see if anyone has posted this question in the past. apparently not, so I'm posting; a little background of myself, late 20s and working in the science industry for more than 5 years, (histotechnician before, orthopaedic product specialist currently). went poly and have a B.S in medical bioscience in a private uni (UK). As per subject, I would like to do a career switch to psychology/counselling. my idea is to help/counsel traumatic client (ie. maybe teenagers/kids) or any mental disorder. 

I understand that I need to get a master degree in clinical psychology in order to practice. and I know how competitive the program offered in NUS and JCU are. I do not want to put my hopes here bc my chance of getting it rather small with regarding to zero experience in this field. not shutting down this idea tho. Also, I saw SUSS offering master in counselling and I'm waiting for their application to be open. but let's say I didn't get in. I would like to see what others options do I have on the table. I saw that College of Allied Educators is offering courses but, I'm slightly sceptical with the qualification as to be a counsellor. 

I'm not sure what other ways to go about doing this, and I sincerely hope anyone could have input in this or any kind soul actually had a career switch psychology/counselling at my age.

This would also help give you some insight on whether this is something you really want to do and invest your time in.', ""To answer your questions quickly.\n\n1) You're not likely to be admitted into the Masters of Psychology (Clinical). The prerequisite is a 4-year degree in Psychology with Honours (2nd Lower + Relevant work experience as an Associate Psychologist OR 2nd Upper OR First Class). This is for JCU\n\n2) Alternative entry for you would be the Masters of Guidance and Counselling (JCU) or Masters of Counselling (Monash - Kaplan) (For now). These 2 are part-time degrees and do not require (to my knowledge) a degree in Psychology or Counselling or Social Science. I have seen Engineers taking these courses as well. \n\n3) To verify if your degree is recognised for Counselling, please take a look at the [recognised programmes by the Singapore Association of Counsellors.](https://sacsingapore.org/career-course-recognition/recognised-programme/).\n\nSource: Am JCU Psych Hons Graduate"", 'Based on your interest to help clients with trauma or mental disorders, clinical psychology is the more suitable option. However, you will need to get a bachelors in psychology first and then compete with the hordes of psychology grads for the very limited masters in clinical psychology positions in uni.\n\nSince you do not want to get another bachelors, the other option would be going for a masters of counselling degree. It is not uncommon for second career folks to go from a bachelors in an unrelated field to a masters in counselling. There are a number of institutions in Singapore who offer this course, such as unis, private colleges and bible schools.\n\nMy advice is for you to volunteer in an organization who is currently serving the population that you are interested in. Without relevant skills, you will not be able to do direct clinical work as a volunteer. However, you can at least be exposed to the work in some way before you decide if you really want to make the jump to that industry.', ""In Singapore context, psychologists can do assessments and refer / recommend for treatment for mental issues. (Psychiatrists are the ones who can diagnose mental illnesses.) Counsellors usually only come into the picture for therapy, (e.g. talking to patients, helping with managing their issues).\n\nBut all of them would require at least a Bachelor's in related fields, and then post-grad (Masters, PhD) in the specific field.\n\nBut... some courses may accept applicants with experience in related fields. Volunteering is not enough, really. So you could switch jobs to work in the field (family service centres, youth homes etc). Some jobs don't require related degree qualifications. \n\nBased on the times now, do whatever that will help you keep your job in a crisis."", 'yep - several agencies work with youth would hire Youth Workers or Programme Executives. You can consider that, and maybe get your studies sponsored. If not in Psych, there are other areas you can work with to work with youths in the field of mental health as well.']"

She also attacked two other public transport workers.\n\n> At the State Courts last Thursday (21 June), Nur Ellyna was sentenced to five weeks’ jail along with a $3,000 fine. She pleaded guilty to causing hurt, using insulting words and a separate charge of disorderly behaviour.\n\n> The assault on the other two staff were considered in sentencing.\n\n> She is out on bail pending an appeal against her sentence.\n\n> At about 6pm on 16 January last year, SMRT service ambassador Sapiie Katib and an assistant station manager were attending to a passenger to process her train ticket refund at the passenger service centre.\n\n> Next in line was Nur Ellyna, who was waiting to top up her EZ-Link card. She grew impatient and started shouting “faster faster” at the SMRT staff to hurry up.\n\n> Sapiie told her to wait as the passenger ahead of her was still being served.\n\n> But Nur Ellyna replied, “Yah, I cannot wait, you got a problem is it?” She also used vulgarities in Malay, saying “sial” and “konek”, which means “jinx” and “penis”.\n\n> She then used her left hand and hit Sapiie’s right cheek twice before trying to leave.\n\n> When Sapiie tried to stop her from leaving, she hit him thrice on the forehead and on the back of his head. Nur Ellyna was subsequently detained by passers-by.\n\n> Separately, on 9 December last year, policemen arrested Nur Ellyna at about 4am at the void deck of an HDB block in Ang Mo Kio Avenue 6 for disorderly behaviour. She was shouting at the top of her voice after a dispute with her then boyfriend and did not calm down despite several warnings. She also put up a violent struggle during arrest.\n\n> In written grounds released on Thursday (27 June), District Judge Tan Jen Tse said Nur Ellyna’s attack on a public transport worker warranted a deterrent sentence and a minimum sentence of four weeks’ jail.\n\n> Her assault was also aggravated as Sapiie, who was fairly elderly, was repeatedly attacked and Nur Ellyna tried to flee the scene. The offence was also committed during the evening rush hour and would have caused a public disturbance, the judge noted.\n\n> In sentencing, the judge took into account that Nur Ellyna has a history of major depression and was in a state of remission at the time of the offence. He also noted that she is six months’ pregnant.\n\n> For causing hurt, Nur Ellyna could have been jailed for up to two years and fined $5,000.\n\n> She could have been fined up to $5,000 and also jailed for a year for using insulting words on a public service worker.\n\n> The maximum punishment for disorderly behaviour is a fine of up to $2,000 along with a jail term of up to six months for a first conviction.\n\n> Other Singapore stories:\n\n> 6 taken to hospital after lorries collide along Tanah Merah Coast Road\n\n> Ex-Deliveroo rider on e-scooter admits to colliding into 3-year-old boy in Nex\n\n> Student gets probation for filming upskirt videos of 2 secondary school teachers\n\n> Indonesian tour guide who falsely accused Tuas Checkpoint officer of asking for bribe jailed\n\n> 2 men arrested, 1.2kg of 'mushroom' drug seized by CNB\n\n---\n1.0.1 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"", ""How did she even hurt the staff?

To share my struggles, I have asd ( autism spectrum disorder) and i struggled a lot growing up, at one point in my life I was a shut-in for 2 years. But I managed to overcome it after finding inspiration from someone and worked hard to secure a good career. 

Currently, I am working full time as a software developer and even though I am stable now with my career, I feel that I become more empty and distant from my current relationships with people as I spend too much attention worrying and trying to improve myself in my career which has make me more dull as a person.

Despite my best effort trying to socialize, my relationship with people ends up being short term due to poor time commitment or failing to connect with others. So here I am trying again, hoping to meet more like-minded people here.

pxndxv,b2im8k,How supportive are you of the implementation of Four Days work week?,2019-03-18 21:16:24,singapore,378960,98,158,"Forget opinions on the internet. I've read enough articles for and against a four-days work week. I strongly believe that having more work life balance boosts employees morale and helps them become more efficient at work. This would also help the nation's crisis of low birth rate, since we will spend more time with our partners. It will also greatly reduce stress levels, helping chemical rebalance in our systems from long hours indoors, lack of rest and lower risks of diabetes, heart disease and rates of mental disorders such as anxiety and depression. However, it is bad for employers, since the week is shorter and less is done (economically speaking it's bad for the country) which is why people are trying to ignore the benefits outweigh the cons of having shorter work weeks. With ageing population and increasing retirement ages (unfortunately), it is also essential for older people to get more breaks to reduce health risks from work stress.

I may be wrong, if you disagree, please share your opinion. I know nothing would change from this discussion but I do find it an interesting subject to talk about. 

Edit: oh, one more thing. More rest = less work risks! Especially for workers in the construction field who are prone to severe work injuries ",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/b2im8k/how_supportive_are_you_of_the_implementation_of/,"[""A four-day work week is unusual even in the most relaxed European countries.\n\nWe should perhaps first try to make the 40-hour work week a normal thing in Singapore.\n\nIt's not necessarily true though that shorter working hours would mean that less is done. Most workers in Singapore are incredibly unproductive and waste a lot of time (see e.g. this [recent Reddit post on slacking at work](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/avl8vl/slacking_at_work_how_many_hours_do_you_really_work/)). So although the average Singaporean worker is technically at work for 40+ hours per week, she could probably get all the work she does now in under 40 hours."", 'Culturally, its not feasible here. There\'s too much of an ingrained face time.\n\nFrom the employer\'s POV: ""I hire and pay you for your salaries. You should be eternally grateful to me for your job.

It forces them to actually be efficient and focused at work. If you haven\'t already noticed, Singaporeans tend to spend inordinate amount time having long lunches, chit chatting and doing pretend work in the office.\n\nBased on my observations, young graduates seem to have this misplaced sense of bravado when it comes to working long hours and staying late in the office. From personal experience, I have seen colleagues who are actually proud of being the last person to leave the office etc. Its really pathetic and sad because I know they\'re highly inefficient. I could do both their work and my work, and leave the office much earlier than them, because I\'m far more efficient than they are.', 'I had 4 day work week before as an intern here. I can say it makes you feel more enthusiastic about your work because you actually have time for reflection and self development ', 'For anyone who said ""it\'s not our culture"" or ""it cannot be done"", the issue is you\'re fixated on hours and not objectives. This does not apply to every job, especially those in the service sector or where productivity is by the hour. \n\nBut for most white-collar knowledge workers, staying an extra hour in the office does not mean that you will produce anything meaningful. \n\nIn order to reduce the work hours, management has to: \n\n* Transition to paying for value instead of presence. \n\n* Manage their staff by workload and objectives instead of hours. \n\n\nYou hire staff based on their qualifications and what they can contribute to your company. Why manage them in a way that values their contribution not by achievement but by the hours they put in?\n\nSwitching to objective based management allows you to get the value you need from staff and gives them the quality of having a work-life balance. What you do not get is the opportunity to squeeze out your dollar\'s worth and doesn\'t give you the upper hand in the arrangement. \n\nNow if you think I\'m dreaming, let me tell you that I know a few people who have managed to work a 3 or 4 day week in Singapore. Some have even managed to do that without a pay cut. \n\nI\'m one of them.

Would school hours simply get extended to account for there being one less day of school? This would also mean less time for teachers to mark, meaning that all this outside-of-school-hours work simply gets pushed to our off days, meaning we still get the same amount of work. \n\nI guess shops would still be open 7 days a week. \n\nWould this mean that companies simply rush their employees to try and complete 5 days worth of work in 4 days?

The downside is, there is next to no trust from employers who want to monitor the work that employees do. \n\nShowing up for work does not imply that one actually does meaningful or productive work. \n\nAs some have said, employers and most Singaporeans are stuck in the traditional mindset of work itself. We\'re not that productive as we think. \n\nMany manual tasks can be automated or made simpler to cut down time on processes.

', 'If it increases office productivity and more family time, why not right?', 'The main question is: ""How do you enforce it on people who don\'t only work during work hours?""\n\nI know many people work even when they have supposedly knocked off.\n\nOn one hand, you have the professionals, who prep before official work hours, and follow up with their work after work hours. This includes occupation like teachers, consultants, programmers etc.\n\nOn the other hand, you have bosses expecting employees to work harder. They expect you to take mandatory OT, be on standby, or purposely do not charge the extra work into your normal work hours. Occupations like computer technicians, sales, project managers, etc.\n\nOf course, not all companies are like that. But many are. Due to the fact that customers expect high quality, fast response service but at the same time not willing to pay too much, the bosses tend to turn their company into high man hours low wage workhouses as they compete with each other for market share. Similarly, due to the nature of clients, employees who are in charge of clients (i.e. insurance) tend to have to put in more hours for customer care.\n\nI for one welcome a four day work week.

If they don\'t even *get* the reason why observing normal working hours is a good thing, you can trust that the 4 day workweek will be subverted somehow, just like the ""other duties as assigned"" clause in your employment agreement. \n', 'One of the causes of low productivity is actually workplace culture. It is common for people in the workplace to wait for the knock-off/""panggang"" time to go home, or even wait until their bosses leave first.

However, depending on how the policy is implemented it may also have drawbacks (e.g. a lazy worker may end up doing less work because of the new entitlement).\n\nAlternatively, superiors should  incentivise productive workers by recognising their contributions, and also increase the level of flexibility in work hours as long as the required work can be completed.', 'Workforce productivity = real economic output / labour hours. \n\nAssume we work the same hours each day, and that most of us would be equally (un)productive or even more productive.

tryinbutdying,fgerrk,[Uni] How does one cope with overwhelming anxiety and panic attacks as well as depression all while managing academic stress?,2020-03-10 22:36:42,SGExams,77716,5,23,"Currently the semester has been going okay so far but now that most lectures and tutorials have moved online bcos of COVID 19, I have to be disciplined and watch the webcasted lectures and all.

I keep struggling daily with anxiety and panic attacks since sec sch and O's and I easily get them when I am stressed. Life in secondary and JC was quite stressful which triggered the onset of panic disorder and numerous panic attacks that lead me to hyperventilate and cry and think I am dying and all. And in the Uni setting,it is hard to struggle with a panic attack without scaring your peers and like freak people out or draw unwanted attention to yourself!!I am already on medication and even had increased both the dosage and types of medication taken but the anxiety is still there and the panic attacks happen without reason and sometimes out of the blue.

I cried on the MRT from panic attacks on several occasions, with people looking at me strangely. I was all teary and my face was red and sweating and I was shaking all over. I have mentioned this to the student support managers in my faculty and the faculty is well aware of my conditions. The Deanery and UHC counsellors and psychiatrists as well as the Pitstop counsellors are helping me with weekly counselling sessions and I am trying my best to manage:(

Throughout sec sch to JC, alot has happened with sec sch experiencing bullying issues that made the anxiety worse and JC was very academically stressful and repeating a year in JC1 meant that I had to face the label of being a JC1 retainee by the new J1s and also a lot of rumour spreading and mean comments about me,both online on my JC's confession page and offline (in person)

Is there anyone else going through all these panic attacks which are so bad that I can't get through them without crying?😭😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥

Sometimes I feel like I will never recover from all these mental health issues and its like I'm gonna be stuck with all these struggles forever😥 And I am struggling to manage my mental health especially with all the module deadlines and groupwork and I have fallen behind and have been unable to catch up on my work in the sense I have not viewed many weeks of webcasts since the Uni introduced e-lectures bcos of COVID 19.

How does one cope with all these panic attacks? And any safe places that people can recommend within NUS which I can cry and rest during a panic attack episode?
I really don't want people to think that I am losing my mind when they see me crying!! It is so difficult to deal with all these in school,public and crowded areas and the anxiety is so so overwhelming!! 😥


P.S: The suggestion to take a break from school is not something I would find helpful.

Edit:My family has been supportive of me and they love me a lot and I always try to not think of suicide because if I really do suicide, they will be devastated and I am an only child so I wonder who would take care of my parents if I really attempted and died successfully? 

I have sought professional help since 2014. Am also seeing the school counsellors apart form the psychologist and psychiatrist. My Uni has been giving a lot of support to me in different forms... 

Okay confiding here isn't the best idea ever...
But yeah I have a history of several mental illnesses including anxiety, depression and panic disorder. And even though I searched through reddit SGExams, there are only several people struggling with both anxiety and depression and to such an extent. I feel like I'm doing very badly and quite alone in this and would like to reach out to more people going through all this. :(

I am a year 1 student trying my best to succeed academically in university. I am still in my first semester and just finished week 11. If you guys read through this and think you might know who is it in real life that posted this, please do not say it out. You can PM me but please respect my privacy. This is all very personal stuff and I'm only asking for tips to survive Uni bcos I really don't want to get to the point of attempting suicide... 

Feeling so tired and drained out and yet I don't want my peers who see me around Uni to know I am actually struggling a lot and have thoughts of suicide so I try to look normal and as happy as I can as I want to spread only positivity and not negativity. Furthermore, many of my friends are stressed as Finals are coming up soon in a month's time so I don't want to confide in most of them and I know things have been quite hard for them to manage as well. 

I have been receiving a lot of help in Uni but it makes me feel like I am a very needy student that can't be independent and strong enough to cope with Uni life and I hate myself for that. I wish I didn't need to live anymore...

My history of depression and anxiety came from my personality as I am naturally anxious and get easily upset. I am very sensitive too.

But it was worsened due to bullying in primary school and academic stress as well as in secondary school. My ex classmates would avoid me, laugh and mock me and even my suicide attempt in primary school and made something called a ""virus"" where people don't want to be in contact with me.

Secondary school was even worse and I had been told to commit suicide, cut myself and even got physically hurt by a guy who threw a chair and it hit my left arm. Psychologically, it brought on a lot of trauma and stress and I developed PTSD from it that until now I have recurrent nightmares and flashbacks relating to school. 

JC was better in the sense it was just rumour spreading and unwarranted hate but the students in my jc didn't dare to do much.

All along, i have been struggling with the support of school, family and mental health professionals. 
I am also taking medications to cope with the mental illnesses that never seem to go away. 

The anxiety I face in Uni continues and gets worse as Uni module contents are very heavy and the workload is a lot, more so than JC. I am just lucky that I am taking a course and modules that I like and am passionate about or it might have been far more difficult for me... I feel suicidal out of the blue and the sudden anxiety and panic attacks come, apart from the constant anxiety, apprehension, fear, uneasiness and stress and its affecting my sleep. I sleep very late at night as the insomnia is damn bad and I wake up exhausted too. Sometimes I feel sad even when I feel happy a minute ago and when things are going well, I feel sad for no reason and ready to die. 

Has anyone felt this way? I hope that I'm not the only person struggling now...

There are still other ways to do well in life, tho it might not be as easy and luck is usually involved. Unfortunate thing in Sg is that success is generally placed around academic success. I’m taking As this year, in fact GP is just 1 more day away and the stress and uncertainty of decent grades scares me every day but I try to believe that As is not the end point as there will be many more checkpoints in life that will allow me to succeed that don’t necessarily include academics. \n\nI also can’t relate to your depression and suicidal thoughts probably because I’m scared of killing myself and idk if it’s depression or just anxiety coupled with stress of Alevels.

In fact, it shows that you’re willing to seek help and improve your mental health. We cope better when we share our problems and receive emotional support.

Surround yourself with good company \n3. Do things u like\n4. Rest\n5. Pen down your problems and how u intend to overcome them\n6. Plan your day, week or month\n7. Exercise \n8.

I realise they\'re free to do what they want, and it seems they\'ve found some happiness in each other, but the way the article is written seems dangerously close to glorifying physical abuse (or the acceptance and ""forgiveness"" thereof).', 'SINGAPORE - Even on their wedding night, he had beaten her up.\n\nUnhappy that they could not get a hotel room at short notice as all were fully booked, David shoved Susie (not their real names) to the ground and trodded all over her back.\n\nShe did not get angry.\n\n""I always forgive him because I understand that he has borderline personality disorder (BPD). He does things not because he wants to. He is not a criminal but a sick person,"" said Susie, 53. She herself has depression and schizophrenia while David has bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, besides BPD.\n\nThey are a rarity in Singapore: two persons with complex mental illnesses who chose to get married to each other and build a life together, however unstable that arrangement may be.\n\nEvery other night, police would come knocking on their doors as David, 39, has a habit of calling the police to tell them that he wants to kill himself when he is stressed.\n\nSuch incidents have become so frequent that Susie does not bat an eyelid when police officers come by. She would continue sleeping, watching television or reading a book.\n\nLast year, however, she felt compelled to take out a Personal Protection Order (PPO) against her own husband as he was getting aggressive. She used it to have him locked up in a police cell overnight when he punched her ear a few months ago.\n\nSusie and David have an unusual love story. They met and fell in love while both were patients at the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) 11 years ago.\n\nShe was smoking in the common area and David and another patient had walked up to her to ask for cigarettes.\n\n""He is my dream guy. Hip, modern and funny, and mad. But I just ignore the mad,"" said Susie, who did not want to disclose her identity because she fears getting fired by her company and clients.\n\nDavid, who used to be a musician and had worked in a tech firm but now does not work, likes that she is intelligent.\n\n""She is smart and educated and I am able to converse and express my ideas with her,"" he said.\n\nSo he moved in into Susie\'s HDB flat after both of them were discharged from IMH and two years later, he went on bended knee to ask her to marry him.\n\nShe agreed after thinking it through for a day.\n\n""I was happy that he wanted to marry me,"" said Susie, who ignored the objections of all her family members and friends who advised her against marrying another person with mental health issues.\n\nLove, they cautioned the couple, would not be able to sustain a marriage if both of them are struggling with their own private hell of debilitating mental illness.\n\n## THOSE WITH MENTAL ILLNESSES TEND TO PAIR UP\n\nThere are no official figures in Singapore for such unions where both parties are mentally ill.\n\nHowever, social workers said that such couples will grow in number as the prevalence of mental illnesses rise.\n\nFindings from the Singapore Mental Health Study 2016, released late last year, found that one in seven people in Singapore have had a mental disorder in their lifetime, an increase from roughly one in eight found in the previous study in 2010.\n\nMental health non-profit organisation Silver Ribbon said it has seen around 10 such couples in the last few years, compared to five years ago when it did not know of any.\n\n""There are many more who are staying together but do not register for marriage because their family and friends do not support it,"" said Silver Ribbon\'s executive director Porsche Poh.\n\n""We will be seeing more couples with mental health issues as they have the tendency of sticking to their own community to have a sense of belonging and feel accepted,"" she added.\n\nResearch has shown that those with mental disorders do seek out partners with similar conditions in marriage.\n\nIn a 2016 study published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, researchers analysed the records of 700,000 individuals in Sweden who were diagnosed with mental disorders such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, depression, anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder. They evaluated how often these diagnoses correlated with the psychiatric health of that person\'s spouse or partner.\n\nThey found that people with mental disorders were two to three times more likely than the general population to have a romantic partner with any mental disorder.\n\nSome illnesses see an even higher correlation. People with ADHD or schizophrenia, for example, were seven times more likely to partner with someone with the same condition.\n\nSuch findings have implications for social workers and society which would then have to examine whether support structures for such couples or families are adequate, say those interviewed.\n\nThey also have important implications if these couples decide to have children as many psychiatric conditions are shaped, to some extent, by genes, so their children may have an increased risk of inheriting their condition.\n\nPrincipal counsellor at Care Corner Counselling Centre Jonathan Siew finds that it is not uncommon here for both spouses to have depression and anxiety, or for one to suffer from a complex form of mental illness and the other to have depression and anxiety. It is more rare that both have the same type of complex psychiatric problems such as schizophrenia.\n\nSaid Mr Siew: ""Currently, there are limited professional support for these couples, as the field has limited expertise in helping them.""\n\nMs Poh said mentally ill couples who have good knowledge of their conditions and have the manifold support of treatment, family and friends can cope well and build a life together.\n\n""Some of them have children. Those with mild-moderate conditions can take care of their children on their own or with the help of their family and friends,"" said Ms Poh.\n\n""Everyone has the right to marry and start a family. With or without mental health issues, couples should assess their readiness to face challenges before signing the marriage certificate,"" she added.\n\nThese challenges include management of each other\'s condition, relapses and side effects of medication, finances and acceptance of their union from family and friends.\n\nOne key difficulty would be when both have relapses at the same time, or when one acts up and that propels the other to do so too.\n\n""If both spouses have similar difficulty in emotional functioning, unhelpful behavioural interaction can easily take place and in turn that can lead to more unpleasant experiences,"" said Mr Siew.\n\nMental health organisations said there are workshops to help these people identify early warning signs of relapse, care for themselves, and find ways to de-escalate potential triggers.\n\nIMH principal medical social worker Goh Min Hui said that because it is more common for one spouse to develop a mental health condition after caring for their mentally ill partner rather than both having such conditions from the start, attending caregiver workshops is important.\n\nThese workshops will teach them how to set boundaries and manage the illness without burning out. For those who desire more help, couple and family therapy is available to help with aspects like emotional regulation or communication patterns as these couples are often stuck in an unhealthy cycle of interaction.', 'Yeah, no. this is fucked up.', 'The last few words in the headline (""when the mentally ill marry"") are idiotic and help to perpetuate old stereotypes about mental illness.\n\nNo, it is NOT generally the case that the [insert any group of people here] beat up their spouses on their wedding nights. There is nonetheless a small subset of that group of people that might for whatever reasons do so.\n\nLikewise, it is NOT generally the case that the ""mentally ill"" beat up their spouses on their wedding nights. ""Mentally ill"" is an incredibly broad category, including even those suffering from mild cases of depression or anxiety. A tiny subset of the ""mentally ill"" (such as this guy here) might beat up their spouses on their wedding nights, but they are not typical among the ""mentally ill"".', 'This is sad, i hope they receive more help', ""I'm glad the article legitimizes certain aspects of mental illnesses that people are often ignorant about, like the fact that with a little help they can still integrate into the society. Also, there's the fact it's not a choice, because it can be passed on genetically.\n\nBut I agree with you they really used the wrong case study. It's doesn't just seem like the article was trying to normalize abuse, but also that it portrayed mental illness sufferers as violent people."", '## REGRETS, BUT ALSO NO REGRETS\n\nTwo years ago, personal assistant Juliana Chia, 46, stepped into Susie and David\'s two-room flat in Toa Payoh to see how she could help, after hearing about their situation from their mutual friend, general practitioner Judy Chen.\n\nMs Chia was in for a rude shock. Almost empty packets of chicken rice were shoved under the bed and cockroaches scampered out when they were taken out to be thrown.\n\nShe and her friends filled four black garbage bags of trash after cleaning up the flat that day.\n\nSince then, Ms Chia and Dr Chen have a WhatsApp chat group with Susie and they check on her health and whereabouts every day.\n\n""Her mental condition has improved a lot since we reconnected one and a half years ago. She used to be isolated and interacted only with her unstable husband but now she has more support,"" said Dr Chen, who is also Susie\'s secondary school friend.\n\nSusie is not in contact with her three brothers but has since reconciled with her sister and mother. She goes to church and is in a cell group. A neighbour, who also used to have a mental illness, also checks in on them regularly and runs errands for them.\n\nDavid, however, has no friends. He hardly has contact with his family, though his father pays for his daily expenses. Some of the money goes to fund his substance abuse habit; he goes to Geylang regularly to buy cough syrup and sleeping pills. Susie finds it too stressful to stop him from abusing substances.\n\nDavid has tried to take his life several times, including slitting his wrists and jumping down from their six-storey flat.\n\nThe latest happened two months ago while he was warded in IMH, when he used glass from a shattered light bulb to slash his wrist. Before he went into IMH, Susie had threatened to divorce him if he did not behave and he was affected by the threat.\n\nHung on the back of their door is a handwritten agreement signed by both Susie and David that reads: ""I, David, will not take my dear wife\'s belongings, especially her handphone, without asking for permission. I will not harass her and also shout at her. Otherwise she will exercise her PPO against me.""\n\nSaid Dr Chan, whose clinic is in Bendeemer: ""I think it\'s not good for a mental patient to marry another.\n\n""Her condition is stable on medication, with occasional relapses. She cannot recover completely as he is unstable and pulls her down.""\n\nOn Friday night, David was arrested again after he bought codeine and walked on an expressway as he did not have money to take a taxi back home. His wife went to bail him out the next day.\n\nAnd so Susie partly agrees with Dr Chen’s stance about her marriage. \n\n""I do have some regrets about marrying him. I went through a lot of suffering and I would advise other couples against it. It will not work unless you have tremendous love and forgiveness.""\n\n""But I also don\'t have regrets most of the time as I am happy with him. He is a nice and funny guy.""\n\nSusie appreciates that David still does little things like bringing water and insulin jabs to her. Both of them are at home most of the time as Susie does freelance work from home.\n\nShe summed up the dynamics of their relationship succinctly: ""Both of us have illnesses, so we understand and take care of each other.""\n\nWhen asked what he felt about what his wife said, David replied in a resolute manner: ""Same, I feel the same way.""', ""Yeah, I really agree with this. It's definitely a good thing to show how mentally ill people are still people who can have independent lives with some support (and it was nice that most of the article was from their perspectives and in their voices). However, the focus on violence was rather off-putting, especially putting it in the headline and at the start of the article as some kind of romantic anecdote. It seems to depict accepting physical abuse as something romantic, and you're right that it seems to portray mentally ill people as violent (and their relationships as abusive, which doesn't really help people accept the idea that they should have the agency to determine their own lives and relationships). \n\nIf this case study really had to be used, I think the physical violence should probably have been put in the middle of the article and dealt with in a much more sober way, rather than being used to attract attention like this.""]"

By 20, Clare was an alcoholic and on the way to drinking herself to death.\n\n> “Right from the beginning, I knew I drank differently from other people. It wasn’t your regular social drinking. I was chasing an effect, but the more I drank, the more that effect eluded me. It was a mental obsession and I could not stop it,” said the wellness coach, now 35, who requested that her full name not be used.\n\n> At 25, she suffered a major heat stroke related to excessive drinking. A few years later, she hit rock bottom.\n\n> “Your body tells you when it is breaking down,” said Clare.\n\n> “I knew I was at the bottom – the dehydration was severe, the numbness, the shakes and the anxiety that came if I wasn’t drinking constantly. The way I was going, I was going to end my life anyway so I decided to give Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) Singapore a shot.”\n\n> What Clare had thought was a long shot saved her life. Through AA’s 12-step recovery programme, as well as support from her husband and AA members, Clare eventually ended her longstanding drinking addiction, and turned her life and her husband’s sanity around.\n\n> “I told myself to give it a week, then it became a month, a year… Eventually, I didn’t want to kill myself anymore. I started showing up for life,” she said.\n\n> April is Alcohol Awareness Month. By sharing her experience, Clare hopes to raise awareness on alcohol abuse among women, which is a growing problem in Singapore.\n\n> Alcohol abuse is the second-most common mental disorder in Singapore among the other conditions assessed, and it is on the rise, according to the Singapore Mental Health Study conducted in 2010 and 2016.\n\n> ME TOO: MORE WOMEN DRINKING HEAVILY AND DANGEROUSLY\n\n> Among Singapore women, the lifetime prevalence of alcohol abuse increased from 1.2 per cent of the population in 2010 to 1.7 per cent in 2016, according to the studies.\n\n> The uptrend has also been documented in earlier studies.\n\n> According to a local study on alcohol consumption trends between 1992 and 2004, an increase in frequent drinking was found to be most pronounced among Singapore women aged 18 to 29. The study was published in the journal Alcohol and Alcoholism in 2007.\n\n> At the Institute of Mental Health’s National Addictions Management Service (Nams), the number of new patients with alcohol use disorders has\xa0gone up.\n\n> Women make up 15 per cent of new patients with alcohol use disorders, said Dr Guo Song, a senior consultant at Nams.\n\n> Nams’ youngest female patient was only 13 years old when she sought treatment – a sobering reminder that alcohol use disorders can hit underaged drinkers.\n\n> “The patients we see at Nams for alcohol use disorders, whether men or women, usually have a chronic history of heavy alcohol consumption. Often, they are unable to control their alcohol use despite having encountered negative consequences,” said Dr Guo.\n\n> \n\n> WOMEN ALCOHOLICS LESS LIKELY TO SEEK HELP\n\n> A representative of AA Singapore, which has women-only sessions, estimated that about 30 per cent of alcoholics seeking help are women. However, he said the figure is likely an underestimate as women are less likely to come forward to seek help for their drinking problems.\n\n> “I don’t think fewer women have the problem than men. In Singapore, there are lots of cultural reasons why people don’t turn up for (AA) meetings. It can be particularly hard for women – they may be judged more harshly by society for their drinking problem,” said AA Singapore’s representative.\n\n> Their spouses may be victims of their addiction, but may also be less willing to come forward to seek help.\n\n> “I know several men who have been subjected to abuse by their spouses who have been drinking. You can’t tell anyone, so what do you do?” said AA Singapore’s representative.\n\n> While Ms Eleanor Ong, a psychotherapist at The Relational Counselling Studio, sees more male alcoholics, this could be because women are more likely to seek out support elsewhere – through friends or informal support groups, for example – rather than go down the healthcare route, she said.\n\n> Many alcohol abusers also tend to be “high-functioning”, which makes it easier for them to hide or deny having a drinking problem in the early years. Despite her heavy drinking, Clare said she was somehow able to continue with her job and everyday life.\n\n> “I didn’t lose my husband, my job, my home. It was so easy to just go on drinking,” she said.\n\n> \n\n> WOMEN ALCOHOLICS GET IT WORSE\n\n> A health crisis awaits when excessive drinking in women remains an under-recognised and under-detected problem.\n\n> While there is no difference in the diagnostic criteria for alcohol use disorders in men and women, women are generally more vulnerable to the adverse effects of alcohol than men and find it harder to quit, said Dr Guo.\n\n> Adverse effects can be physical or psychosocial, such as liver problems or sexual or physical abuse.\n\n> Women get drunk more easily than men when they drink the same amount of alcohol, due to differences in body structures and hormones.\n\n> “Generally, women weigh less and have less water in their bodies. As alcohol tends to disperse more in body water, this means that a woman’s blood alcohol concentration will tend to be higher than a man’s, putting her at a greater risk of harm,” Dr Guo explained.\n\n> According to him, some neuroscience studies indicate that the development of addiction in women is faster than in men. Their physical and psychosocial functioning also deteriorate faster.\n\n> Studies suggest that women who are addicted to alcohol have a higher prevalence of concurrent psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety or borderline personality disorder, said Dr Guo.\n\n> “These comorbid disorders may make women vulnerable to alcohol addiction, where they use alcohol to cope with their emotions. However, this may in fact render them susceptible to developing drinking problems or alcohol addiction,” he said.\n\n> People may start abusing alcohol for various reasons. Along with income growth and social interactions, there are more chances to consume alcohol, which many view as a recreational beverage, said Dr Guo.\n\n> Other reasons why alcohol dependence may start include poor coping skills, peer influence and easy availability of alcohol.\n\n> Studies show that people with immediate family members with addictive disorders have a higher chance of developing alcohol addiction, he added.\n\n> At its core, however, alcohol addiction is the same as any form of addiction and “a bigger problem than just a matter of willpower”, said Ms Ong.\n\n> “In addiction, the prefrontal cortex (the part of the brain that enables rational decisions) somehow goes a bit offline. The logical part of the brain that tells you, ‘If I continue drinking, my husband is going to leave me’ no longer really works,” said Ms Ong.\n\n> ROUTES TO SOBRIETY\n\n> Anyone who develops an addiction would find it hard to quit and professional help is often warranted, said Dr Guo.\n\n> “Although we see fewer women seeking treatment for alcohol use disorders than men, treatment is equally effective for men and women,” he said.\n\n> At Nams, treatment for alcohol use disorders consists of the use of pharmaceutical drugs and psychosocial support by a multidisciplinary team.\n\n> Patients who are chronically dependent on alcohol may need inpatient treatment for detoxification and rehabilitation, said Dr Guo. They will also need post-discharge follow-up to prevent a relapse.\n\n> Treatment is a highly individualised process, and there is no particular correct way to treat an alcohol addiction, said Ms Ong.\n\n> Support groups can help. “Support groups such as AA have been proven to help many people, which is why it is available in so many countries. However, while some people feel that it works, others don’t. The goal we have for our clients with alcohol addiction is that they eventually find support beyond therapy,” said Ms Ong.\n\n> In cases where the alcoholic herself is in denial or not ready to seek help, her loved ones may have to seek professional help on how to do it, said Ms Ong.\n\n> “As the addict progresses in her addiction, often, the loved ones also progress in their level of rescuing, enabling and protecting from consequences. Until someone breaks the cycle, both are on the trajectory of going downhill,” she said.\n\n> Today, Clare has broken that vicious cycle. She has not consumed a single drop of alcohol in the last six years, and now has a one-and-a-half year-old daughter who occasionally accompanies her to AA meetings.\n\n> Encouraging other alcoholics to seek help, Clare said: “There is a solution out there. You are not alone.”\n\n> \n\n---\n0.5.0-beta | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', '[deleted]', 'If you or someone you know is contemplating suicide, please do not hesitate to talk to someone.\n\n**US:**\n\nCall 1-800-273-8255 or text HOME to 741-741\n\n**Non-US:**\n\n[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_suicide_crisis_lines)\n \n --- \n \n^^I ^^am ^^a ^^bot.  ^^Feedback ^^appreciated.', ""The existence of underage alcohol drinkers right now would suggest that isn't useful.""]"

Specialised fields of psychiatry off the top of my head include clinical neuropsychiatry (brain stuff), addiction psychiatry, and concentrations in neurodegenerative disorders (such as dementia).\n\nIf you're looking to become a psychologist dealing with mental health, then there's a few branches you can look at. Generally, most people begin their specialisations after they obtain a bachelors in psych and carry on into their masters:\n\n1. Clinical psychology: the most competitive and fiercest psych program to get into post-graduate; focus is mostly on treating the mental disorders through psychological approaches, mostly integrates with\n\n2. Counselling psychology: subfield which mainly focuses on talk therapy (psychotherapy) and has a little less focus on targeted treatment of mental disorders, moreso focusing on helping promote the well-being of generally stable individuals. \n\nmore info here:\nhttps://singaporepsychologicalsociety.org/psychologists-in-singapore-who-are-they-what-do-they-do/\nhttps://www.healthprofessionals.gov.sg/sab/specialist-accreditation\n\nHowever, I'd strongly encourage you to explore further in the field of psychology. Many people seem to come into psych with the idea that it's mostly concerned with mental health and disorders when there are entire fields of study that also critically concern our daily lives (decision making, problem solving, intergroup relations, human factors, cognitive development, applied human resources, intelligence, etc.). Psych is also a heavily science-y subject, with critical emphasis on empirical findings and research which of course calls for a good background in statistics and a strong research foundation, which means it's rarely just pure theorizing and simple testing. An easy way to investigate is just to look at the different modules that each of the degrees have to offer - they provide good background on what's in the field, and how it's being run."", 'There is clinical psychology but I’m not sure if they’re allowed to prescribe medications (probably limited even if they were allowed to). Like you, I once had to consider the differences between psychology and psychiatry. The thing about psychiatry is that it’s a specialisation under medicine, which means that you’ll have to study everything in the broad field of medicine and try out all specialisations (which you may not be interested in) for a few years before being able to specialise in psychiatry. If you really want to pursue psychiatry and treat neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsons and dementia, you could consider applying to Duke-NUS for post-graduate medicine. However, seeing that you are interested in treating mental disorders, psychology will allow you to do so.', 'Psychologists of any sorts are not allowed to prescribe medication .

TaxesHurtMyHeart,b633ey,"18+ y/o, somewhat enquiring about the NS PES system",2019-03-27 19:03:51,singapore,378960,39,8,"Hi, I am a 18+ year old Singaporean Male who will be enlisting in the later half of 2020. 

I have not yet gone for a checkup to confirm these but I might suffer from epilepsy and mental health conditions (major depression and general anxiety/panic disorder). In the case that I do have both of the conditions that I have stated above, is it still quite likely that I can serve my NS in PES E/above?

 I’m not sure how the PES system works especially for PES C-F like the conditions you have to fulfill to be classified into the different PES categories since the website is pretty vague when it comes to this. So I hope that someone here can help clear my doubts or at least make it slightly clearer for me. Thank you in advance. 

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have went for my pre-enlistment health checkup and am waiting for my appointments for these matters. My main purpose for this post was to seek help from more knowledgeable people to find out if I could still serve my NS in the case that I am diagnosed with epilepsy and mental health conditions and not really about what I should do.

Then get some sort of medical report or memo from the specialist, and bring it on the day of the pre-enlistment health check.', 'Epilepsy probably pes E', 'According to what I remember from HC-28 (Health Classification Directive) from the OSN (SAF\'s intranet), MOs use the PULHEEMS to determine your PES. \n\nPhysique\nUpper limbs\nLower limbs (or \'Locomotion\', as this includes the back)\nHearing (right)\nHearing (left)\nEyesight right (corrected / uncorrected)\nEyesight left (corrected / uncorrected)\nMental function\nStability (emotional)\n\nThey give a score from 1 to 5 to each of the sections. Example my knee ligament torn, so my L is given a score of 3, whereas the rest of my sections are a 1. Your PES is then based on your ""worst"" score. To be PES A, your worst score must be a 1. B1 is 2, B2,3,4 is 3, C2, C9 is 4, E1, E9 is 5. (F I not sure). So since my ACL torn, L is score of 3, so I enlisted as PES B4. If they determine your body can recover, they will temporarily score and award you your PES accordingly. So I temp PES B4\n\nFor PES E, if your left eye is a 5, right eye isn\'t a 5, (or vice versa) everything else also not 5, you won\'t get PES E. Need both eyes to be 5 then PES E.\n\nHowever, the scoring system isn\'t all there is. Still got basis on other excuses, such as excuse firing range, etc. Some PES can\'t get certain permanent excuses, some PES can\'t get certain temp excuses. PES A cannot temp excuse IPPT, so they will temp downpes to B1, while getting their excuse. PES B4 cannot perm excuse firing range, but if you really got a problem that determines you need to be permanently excused from the range, YET that problem doesn\'t cause any of your scores to go above a 3, the MO will still drop your PES from B4 to C2 (because C2 can be perm excused range). There\'s also some weird differentiation between B2, 3, 4 despite them having the same score requirements, between C2 and C9, and between E1 and E9. Also, got some weird rule B4 + C9 = E1 so YMMV.\n\nLastly, due to my skin being hardcore irritated by sweat, I\'m excused physical activity. But none of scores are a 5. Nevermind, the classification for E9 clearly states that PES E9 ""soldiers"" (lmao still soldier meh) can\'t do any physical exertion whatsoever, whereas the classification for B4 said can have some physical exertion relevant to the soldier\'s vocation. So I downpes to E9 lor, despite my scores being a 3, not a 5.\n\nAnyway, basically score yourself from 1 to 5 for each section, see which one is the worst, then find out your PES from there.

Other than intervention from friends, family, neighbors and school, not much else can be done without being excessively intrusive into private lives."", 'You know what else is a disorder? Overstress from working long hours and little breaks in between\n\nLook at how little companies cares about those doe', 'It wouldn’t really affect professional gamers who are the ones most probably sacrificing sleep or proper eating habits for gaming sessions because they earn a lot through prize winnings, streaming, brand deals, etc. On the other hand, it may affect individuals who are trying to study (or have parents that force them to) and yet are horribly addicted to games, but that’s only if they seek help for it and have to declare it to their employers. If they are really that addicted, they wouldn’t be able to stay employed long-term anyway so the classification of it as a disorder doesn’t do much harm. There also shouldn’t be much impact to the gaming industry because majority of the profit comes from people who have work/school and can spare the money to spend in-game.', 'Other than being more conscious about the amount of time spent on gaming, there is really not much changes to what I’m currently doing. \n\nI think one way of seeing gaming addiction would just to see it as any other addiction. Too much of anything is a bad thing. It is as real as say drugs, smoking and gambling as addictions and considering the world’s movement into more immersive gaming such as VRs and ARs, this declaration of gaming as an addictive behaviour is one that is much needed. Furthermore, gaming is a normalised behaviour in our times (No one is gonna fault you for gaming, nor mention one’s behaviour to be out of the ordinary), especially since gaming has so many perceived benefits when engaging in it (Friends, better reflexes, networking, socialising, destressing). As such, I believe it is a good call for WHO to declare this as of now. \n\nAlthough, I think that games themselves have little to no fault in drawing in players. The onus falls upon players themselves to practice controlled gaming. While these may mean certain consequences for gaming companies, these may be negligent to none at all. \n\nHowever, just some food for thought, there is a very difficult line to draw on what is considered gaming addiction and what is not. I think this is one of the special points to consider when we are analysing this particular addiction. What makes it special is in 2 points: \n1) Professional gamers. As someone who spends most of their days gaming and training, their behaviour definitely fits the criteria, but do we consider them addicts? \n2) How are we going to tackle this in therapy? Gaming (Especially online gaming) is an aspect in many people’s lives that it is almost impossible to practice abstinence (Versus smoking? Drugs?). What is this the aim? Controlled gaming? Abstinence? Steps to achieve that.\n\nIn all, it’s smth to think about and perhaps as what one other Redditor said, work addiction among Singaporean IS a real problem especially due to the work life balance. And while gaming addiction has its place in our society, there are many other addictions such as work and social media addiction that can be equally as damaging and have been under the radar for too long. Not to underplay it, but the impact on Singapore I believe may be much smaller than that of the other addictions.', ""As a gamer (though not hardcore), I don't see nor care about the declaration as it has no impact on me or the society (I think)."", 'I believe that in the midst of defending gaming, it is important to remember that addiction is indeed a disorder that requires attention, and this is not exclusive to gaming. \n\n\nThe challenge is in identifying this disorder, something many within the older generation struggle to do.

I am currently 186 cm with a weight of 72 kg, meaning my BMI is at 20.8. For most of my life I have been underweight (eating disorder) and have never been even close to being overweight. 

Some additional background: I was also called in for additional NS medical checkups for my heart, but in the end was cleared by the doctor.

I have heard that going in with PES BP means a significantly longer NS.

Is PES BP exclusively for overweight men or is it normal for underweight/average weight guys to also go in? Could CMPB have made a mistake?",0.43,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cs0j6j/ns_assigned_pes_bp_with_average_weight/,"['Call in and request a review - you definitely shouldn’t be attending the BP program if your BMI is that low.', ""From what I know, BP is for those with BMI >27ish. I'm not sure why you're assigned BP. Were you heavier when you went for the medical checkup a few months back? If that's the case, that might be the reason why you might have been assigned BP.  \n\nBP doesn't mean significantly longer NS. It means longer BMT. You serve the full 2 years exactly. Those who fail IPPT and have to head in for PTP-BMT will have like 2 weeks less of BMT compared to you, but they also serve the 2 full years exactly. Only those who pass their IPPT get to shave 2 months off their 2 years. They go in later, and finish (ORD) about the same time as their PTP-BMT counterparts.  \n\nIf you're intending to take and pass IPPT, you can call them up for a reassignment of Pes. But just to let you know, I knew a guy who managed to lose weight between his medical checkup and actual enlistment date, and he converted from BP to enhanced batch (save 2 months).

You want 2 more months of freedom or 2 more months of depressing Tekong life up to you.\n\nIF OP is already almost underweight the BMT BP's emphasis on weight loss is rather pointless for him."", 'If want to go OCS how. By the time commission then how many months left to serve only must extend NS.', 'Depending on their weight, yes, but they still serve two years, not two years and three months.', 'If OP manages to pull off a switch, it would almost certainly be with a later intake. Better to go in and “enjoy” 2 months of easy NS than to wait for another intake (or 2, if you’re unlucky)\n\nEdit: TLDR; if all you care about is when you ORD, taking PTP is better than being moved to a later intake and ORDing later.', ""I'm sorry Tekong was depressing for you.

I have been through PTP-BMT, and I went through a similar (although less dramatic) progression as you described above.\n\n*But this is not the case here* \\- OP is very clearly not obese, and the purpose of serving the 2 extra months is non-existent.   There\'s not much point asking him to make the best out of the situation, when it is wholly unnecessary and can probably be rectified with a call / visit to CMPB.   It\'s like telling someone to voluntarily extend his NS service, and then asking him to ""make the best of it"".\n\nUnless OP is ridiculously unfit, a daily jog and some simple static exercises will suffice for physical conditioning.

I don\'t think so. My parents were not very well off when they first started their lives together and so they both had to work. I am fortunate enough to have a very very close knit family so when both my parents had to go back to work after I was born, my aunt (mum\'s older sister) took me in from Monday to Friday and I went home on the weekend. I gained an older ""brother"" from her, and then a younger ""sister"" when this same aunt took my other cousin in when another sister had to go work overseas. I was lucky to have this village you speak of.\n\nMy parents were not destitute but with the cost of living in Singapore, we definitely needed a two income household. This is true for many other families. But not every other family is as close knit as mine or even if close, not willing to take in their sibling\'s kid for the week. Or the parents aren\'t willing to do what my parents did and not see the kid for a week - understandable. They might even be completely on their own because parents have passed on or something. FDWs are always going to be a thing. Other countries have them too, they are just called nannies or au pairs and don\'t clean the house.', ""Both parents work, both grandparents work, or too old, both great-grandparents (if still around) probably too old as well. \n\nWho's going to take care of the kid then? And this is just one kid. Because it's already not easy to raise 1 kid, a lot of parents decided to limit to 1, maybe 2, usually not more than 3, kids. Thus your birth rate issues. \n\nThis is where FDWs can come in to help out. The only way we can reduce reliance on FDWs is to encourage more fathers/mothers to become full-time parent, which is practically inconceivable for the majority of the workforce. Otherwise, we'll have to convince more of the grandparents to retire earlier, which the government with their CPF policies, doesn't seem too keen to encourage too. \n\nThus, unless one parent can take in at least 5-figures every month, chances are both parents have to work. Then again when one is taking in 5-figures, why do all the hard work when you can now hire a FDW?\n\nTo summarise, no, we are not likely to reduce our reliance on FDWs anytime soon."", 'You need to combine that with the hours that SG workers put in, and our relatively higher property prices - so dual income families with full time jobs are the norm + kids and parents to take care of, may be difficult.', ""Yup as one comment put it, Japan and Korea don't really have a low wage migrant worker force, hence they don't even have the concept of FDWs. \nThe closest they have to that are child minders, but that is highly regulated and requires strict qualifications.\nI guess Singapore and hk is unique compared to Japan plus South Korea with our low cost migrant workforce, which enables fdw industry"", 'Becoming less and less feasible with many single child families and even cousins not being close knit as in the past.', 'Tell this to dual income families with children in Tokyo, HK, Seoul or Melb/Sydney... do you see them relying on live in maids as much as we do?', 'Other countries use day care to take care of their kids while both parents are working. It’s the reality that most households are dual income in the rest of the developed world. It’s not a uniquely Singaporean thing.', 'Not common in Shanghai, Seoul or inner Tokyo either. Countries with similar city income and family profiles as ours. \n\nHong Kong fdws are not entirely\nlive-in, a mix of both.', ""Property prices are actually higher is many major western cities. An entire generation of millenials are renting,  with home ownership only realistic starting in the late 30s\n\nI think one other angle is the sheer income/economic differential between sending and receiving countries driving the migration of foreign labour\n\nIn the Europe, the gulf between poorer eastern Europe or North Africa vs rich western and north Europe is not as great as the gulf between say poorer Indonesia vs rich Singapore or HK. But it doesn't explain why millions of American households aren't employing many Mexican girls as au pairs"", 'I feel it’s a matter of culture. But that said, there are many families who do not want live-in help as well, just that we don’t hear of them a lot in the media. \n\nMany people I know can afford even multiple helpers, but they want their children to be independent and make them do chores for allowance instead, and hire adhoc daily help for larger housekeeping needs like gardening. \n\nWe don’t want strangers living amongst us, and it feels like encouraging servitude to be frank, not to mention losing the chance to teach children how to be independent and not be reliant on help to wait on them.', 'There’s not many countries in the world where you can even bring in FDWs on a legal work visa. I don’t think such concept exists in western countries and places like Korea/Japan. Which means that you need to employ a local employee - and you need to pay them at least minimum wage. It’s substantially more expensive than FDWs in Singapore. Imagine if FDWs cost 4-5 times the current market rate (minimum wage in Japan/Korea/US/EU). Will there be a market for them? How about if no work visa is given for FDWs, who is going to be working in these roles? This is the reality for almost all other developed countries.']"

I have two degrees and 12 years post-university work experience for global companies (17 years total work experience) and have worked with teams in the US, Europe and Middle East. A number of DP holders will be degree-holders and/or have work experience in a range of locations and fields, i.e. arts, sciences etc. My husband was offered an opportunity with his company to work in Singapore; the purpose of his role was to develop local leaders and hand over the reins to them (we’ll be moving back in the next 12-18 months because that’s when the leadership team should be ready to take over) It’s not often you get a chance to live in a different country and we were excited to take that opportunity knowing it would be temporary.\n\nI came over as DP with the intention of finding a job once I arrived. I have always worked and didn’t want to stop. I have been working for an international tech company in a role that is similar to my previous ones and stayed on my DP. I stayed on it because there was no real need to move over to EP - I didn’t need it in order to work. There will be lots of DPs who stayed on theirs for the same reason. It’s not because they aren’t qualified for an EP necessarily - it’s that it wasn’t necessary for their job.\n\nI understand the background to the government changing the way it processes DP holders who want to work and it makes sense. It will be much easier to administer than LOC but as some people have commented this will be a challenge for foreign couples who are both invested in their careers. If a spouse can’t get a job, then the person being approached might not move over and they will both stay in their other country. This could hinder some companies’ plans to grow here if they find they can’t develop the talent they need for the long term. \n\nWhen people don’t move here, it also impacts cross-cultural exchange which hasn’t been talked about much here. I’m very grateful to have lived and worked in Singapore - it has taught me so much. When I go back to my home country, I believe I will be a better employee for any company having lived here because I will understand much better how to work with people who are from here.

Of course, if they ask recruiters about their views, they will not be too keen. This move effectively narrows recruiters' supply pool.  If they ask founders, of course, they will be unhappy. More money to pay employee, less money for themselves and growth. \n\nIMO, this may be even better for our local start-ups to get the fuck out of their comfort zone and find out how to be competitive in the region.\n\nThe problem with Singaporean start-up founders and why we are not competitive is because everyone is way too comfy in SG and fight too long in this tiny market. Then they bemoan the high cost and all kinda shit. Costs to do a startup in US are much higher and even in places like Japan. But the Japanese fricking hallow out their apartments and make it into their office, live a miserable life until they have enough traction/funding to rent an office. I know this start-up in Japan which raised millions, but still work out of an apartment with his team (so they can sleep there after work if they choose to) and live very frugally. When I went to his office, he rented out the apartment next door too as the team was getting big. I also know this founder in China who even after exiting his last start-up making at least 50 million for himself, sold all his possession (including cars and house) and move into a small apartment, then pour all his $$$ into his next endeavour. He made it into a unicorn. \n\nOn the other hand, I've seen so many Singaporean start-up founders, once they raise a bit of money, they then rent a fancy co-working space, start paying themselves first, live a plush life, etc. Seen few times in SG, fucking founders in Singapore driving continental cars or wearing 20K+ watches to ask for early-stage fundings. \n\nGood if they have to face this now.

Degrees are irrelevant IMHO, but I state this as a proxy for being 'tech' co-founders. The problem we face is that beyond the first 2-3 engineers/devs (not counting the founders), we need about 3x more junior team members while still maintaining cash-flow. This is where you compensate lower salaries with potentially huge stock options. However, in the Singaporean context, this just isn't possible - because you can only offer this to Singaporeans who have almost zero risk tolerance - non Singaporeans can't choose to accept it because they wouldn't get a work Visa to begin with.

I did address your question. Convincing the best talents to join your startup is the job of the founding team. Be it their experience so people want to work under them or their charisma, without those, the money will be the only lure. Without charisma, it's hard to see how the founding team can raise funding to scale quickly. This is important to workers if stock option plays a huge part of their salary. It's also the job of the founding team to raise funding to meet staffing and growth requirements. \n\nI have seen a number of startups in SG that have some members of their engineering team based overseas, some with even their CTO or one part of the founding team moving overseas to manage said teams. So having to hire them in Singapore is not the only option. One of my portco set up an office in SG to hire their AI team as the cost in their home country is too high for such talents, so it works the other way round. I have seen founders in a bid to build their own name to attract talents, started writing more, being more engaged and visible with the local community, and started offering to give talks in schools/events/etc, not just posting for vacancies on job boards. \n\nWe recently invested in a frontier tech company where the founder went to the top university in his country and convinced the top prof in the field to invest and be an advisor in his company. He was also a student under the prof previously. In return, many research students under the prof work directly with the company and join them. In fact, 80% of his engineering staff are from that research lab, and all of them have PhD and Masters in their field due to what they are building. He had at least 12 engineers before he was first funded, so they were all lowly paid until funding came in. Due to the founder's experience, he also secured 3 MOUs and 1 successful launch with 3 different nation's government (all outside of his home country). All that before we came in as their first external investor. I cannot disclose which country the startup is from, but it is a developed country with a high cost too. I'm not implying this is applicable to SG or your situation, but this is an example on how exceptional founders hustle to secure talents even with weak initial monetary lure. \n\nI'm quite curious, do all your engineers and staff need to come in with EP if you cannot meet the salary threshold?"", ""You weren't literally stating anything apart from your meaning of the word unemployment and an obvious attempt to belittle."", ""My challenge/question isn't how do I get people to join me - it is that government policies like these make it impossible for willing parties to engage. If I offer a DP holder 3k + sizeable equity given that they can only contribute 3 days a week, and they accept the offer - I still can't go ahead because of these new policies.\n\nAnd all tech 'startup' - which are basically 10-year-old, 1000+ employee companies with billion-dollar valuations - are clamoring over local hires because they need a 'Singaporean core'. And if they offer 10,20 or 40% higher salaries, I can still compete but when the numbers are like 6.5k for a 1-year fresh grad who I had to teach how to paginate Django APIs, it really doesn't make sense.\n\nBetween the double minimum salary raise during a pandemic and now this, plus the MOM's snail pace of visa approvals right now - the talent pool available to actual startups has all but evaporated.\n\nI run a start-up with 25 employees (20 tech), 21 Enterprise Clients, and about 3M USD funding. Half my tech-team is local, and everyone other than that (except 2 S-Passes) needs to meet EP criteria (4.5k on paper, but more like 6k when you do MOM SAT). But I have to fight off offers from Grab, Gojek, Shopee, Lazada, Facebook, Google, Zoom, TikTok, and whatever new 'start-up' wants to expand into Singapore every day. Nevermind the general risk-aversion of our society at large.\n\nAnd then people complain about why there aren't any 'real' Singaporean startups.""]"

Nothing in statute actually obliges the Law minister to keep briefing NGOs on it invocations of the ISA, but they do so anyway.\n\n(This is in contrast with Western jurisprudential innovation through executives interpreting existing statutes in stretched ways that then do or do not survive a review - in Singapore the executive prefers to pre-empt any notion of limited government and instead guard its discretion)\n\nin contrast Beijing has plenty of precedent to suggest that it intends to fully leverage the expansive language of Article 22..."", '♫ [*deng-deng deng-deng deng-deng deng-deng*](https://youtu.be/fV4DiAyExN0?t=16) ♫', 'For collecting my Tracetogether token, can I still go and collect it from a CC after 6pm?', 'Where can legally live stream Wimbledon these 2 weeks?', 'Lol watching Cindy (Vivian Lai) get shocked at 12% drop of the Dow.

Not financially independent yet, so honestly just focus on studying. You feel that parents are restricting. And it is not a bad thing. \n\nYou have not really stepped into society to see the real world. It\'s a bit wild to say this, but Asian parents being restrictive can be helpful to some of us, for young people who might simply go astray if not kept under control. You think you have seen the world and want full control of your life, and so you might work towards trying to achieve that independence. Do be wary of a ton of traps that could lie along the way. (Examples: If trying to find a job, you don\'t know what you might end up doing and can get conned and what not. There are lots of things to elaborate on, but basically the simple answer is, as much as you are 18++, it doesn\'t mean reaching legal age means being actually responsible of all your decisions.) There could be predators ready to pounce on your naivety, just laying that fact out there for you.\n\nI am not judging you on what you do, but I want you to know that the important aspects of a relationship is both short term and long term. Do not lose focus of the long term just to focus on things like simple carnal pleasure. I don\'t know what your parents are controlling about, but some things are perfectly normal. Perhaps you find that going home at 10pm or 11pm is early while they feel that it is late, due to your comparisons with your group of friends / boyfriend, whatnot. You feel that you are old enough to deal with ""all this sht"" already. But the simple truth is, ""touch wood"" some unexpected things come your way, and you would have hoped that you would have been at home, listening to your parents. \n\n> "" issue is i wish they can understand im old enough to make my own decisions but they perpetually see me as a child and im sick of that. im also sick of the lack of control in my life hence my decision to do something for myself for once and take full responsibility for it. ""\n\nIf you get pregnant for example, just think about how your boyfriend will be able to take care of you. NS? Okay gone case, he\'s gonna have to work without finishing studying. You, same thing, how to raise kid without finishing studying? That\'s the practicality of life that you think you can handle, but when the sht hits the fan, sorry, I don\'t know how you want to handle it, and I don\'t want to see that happening to you.\n\nI am not saying everything your parents say is right, but rather, if they do care about you, they are doing things albeit in a way you might not like it. The truth is what it is. You can choose to listen, or learn some lessons the hard way. \n\nIf you want a future with your current boyfriend, think more about the long term, which I know, it\'s pretty hard to think about at this age. Just think about what kind of future you want both of you to have. Do you want that dream to just pop like a bubble because of silly young things you (or both of you) are doing? \n\nYou probably didn\'t expect this kind of reply, I know. All I can offer is a piece of advice, sometimes advice don\'t sound nice because it isn\'t what you wanna see, what you wanna hear. But, know that sometimes, some things need to be approached with a logical mindset, not something run based on emotions. I know that it is hard to say the same given that I don\'t know what you actually experienced (don\'t tell me, no intention to Dox). But trust me, if you think you are an adult responsible for adult life, you probably are not ready for it (the so-called adult aspects you think about - work life what not). And you would probably prefer to have you both finished schooling, and at least have a stable job before you actually settle down.\n\nI don\'t know what else to say, other than wishing you good luck.

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries.\n\n2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it may eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.\n\n3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.\n\n4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a political revolution.

It continued on Tuesday in a courtroom filled to capacity with onlookers, subject to safe distancing measures, as Mr Lim cross-examined PM Lee.\n\n> The Prime Minister is suing Mr Xu for alleged libel over an article published on TOC in August last year. The article was titled “PM Lee’s wife Ho Ching weirdly shares article on cutting ties with family members”.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Since 2017, PM Lee has been embroiled in a dispute with his siblings - Dr Lee Wei Ling and Mr Lee Hsien Yang - over the fate of their family home at 38 Oxley Road after the death of their father, who was Singapore’s founding prime minister.\n\n> The TOC article, PM Lee’s lawyers have said, contains false allegations repeated from his siblings that gravely injure his character and reputation.\n\n> ""POLITICALLY UNTENABLE""\n\n> During a three-hour hearing on Tuesday morning, PM Lee reiterated his stance on 38 Oxley Road - that it was “politically untenable” for him to profit from redeveloping it.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> If he wanted to carry out his father’s wishes and do this, he “would do ill to Singapore”, he said.\n\n> PM Lee had previously explained that he had recused himself from the Government’s handling of the property and sold the property to his brother.\n\n> Part of his case for defamation is that those who read the TOC article would think that PM Lee misled his father into thinking that the Government would gazette the house and that it was futile for the late Mr Lee to maintain his position that it should be demolished.\n\n> The house has never been gazetted.\n\n> On the other hand, Mr Xu’s case is that between Dec 27 in 2011, when Mr Lee wrote to the Cabinet about the house, and Sept 6 in 2012, when he said in an email that it had been gazetted as a heritage house, he had been misled into thinking it had been gazetted.\n\n> Mr Lee thus removed the demolition clause in his fifth will in October 2012, Mr Xu argues.\n\n> Mr Lee had signed six wills over 15 months between August 2011 and November 2012. He signed a final one, with the demolition clause re-inserted, in December 2013.\n\n> NO FREEDOM OF ACTION\n\n> Earlier, PM Lee testified that many members of the public, newspaper editors, as well as members of the Cabinet wanted the house to be preserved. Mr Lee wanted it demolished.\n\n> On Tuesday, in a bid to establish the proposition that the late Mr Lee thought the house would be gazetted, Mr Lim took PM Lee through numerous emails between him, his father, Madam Ho and his siblings.\n\n> On Aug 11, 2011, Dr Lee had responded to an email from their father. She said that she would prefer to continue living at the Oxley Road property but that he “called the shots”.\n\n> The late Mr Lee replied: “I cannot call the shots. Loong as PM has the final word.”\n\n> In another email shortly after, he also said: “Even if I knock it down while I’m alive, the PM can gazette it as a heritage site and stop the demolition.”\n\n> Mr Lim told PM Lee in court: “The reality of the matter is that you as PM, the most powerful person in Singapore politically - you had the final word. Not editors, not the Cabinet, the public.”\n\n> PM Lee replied: “That’s what my father said, but I explained to him what I would do if I were the decision maker. In other words, I really did not have freedom of action.”\n\n> ""SINGAPOREANS KNOW ME""\n\n> Mr Lim then suggested that Mr Lee was “distraught” after meeting the Cabinet in July 2011. PM Lee replied: “That is wrong.”\n\n> The lawyer also suggested that it was “convenient” for PM Lee to say there was pressure from others to preserve the house when his father knew that he, PM Lee, called the shots.\n\n> “I reject that totally and I have explained why,” the Prime Minister responded.\n\n> “Your siblings are correct when they said you wanted to keep the house to inherit Lee Kuan Yew’s credibility?” the lawyer asked. PM Lee said he thought this was “rubbish”.\n\n> Mr Lim then asked: “The PM residing at Oxley, will it remind the public of your father?”\n\n> ""Maybe for better, maybe for worse,” PM Lee replied.\n\n> “Are you saying that Singaporeans have a terrible impression of your father?” the lawyer asked.\n\n> “I’m saying that Singaporeans know me … I’ve been a politician for 36 years, PM for 16 years. If I still depend on living in the house to exude a magic aura and impress the population, I think I would be in a very sad state and Singapore would be in a very sad state,” he responded.\n\n> GAZETTING NOT EVEN RELEVANT: PM\n\n> Among the emails that Mr Lim went through was one that the late Mr Lee sent to Mdm Ho, copied to PM Lee.\n\n> He had said: “Yes, but Loong as PM has indicated he would declare it a heritage site that will put an end to any rebuilding.”\n\n> In his evidence, PM Lee explained that they had discussed the matter repeatedly afterwards and that his father knew on Dec 27, 2011, when he wrote to the Cabinet, that the house would not be gazetted.\n\n> Mr Lim produced another email from the late Mr Lee dated Sep 6, 2012 where he wrote: “Although it has been gazetted as a heritage house, it is still mine as owner.”\n\n> PM Lee accepted that based on the email, his father believed the house had been gazetted at that point. However, he said that he did not discuss the matter with Mr Lee beyond May 2012.\n\n> The lawyer pointed to another email dated Nov 30, 2013 sent to Mr Lee by his usual lawyer, Ms Kwa Kim Li. It stated: “Last night, you raised the possibility that Oxley may one day be de-gazetted after your passing.”\n\n> PM Lee again stressed that he had not discussed gazetting the property with his father.\n\n> When his own lawyer, Senior Counsel Davinder Singh, asked if gazetting was even a relevant point, he responded: “No. Even if it was not gazetted and I, after inheriting the house, would be allowed to redevelop and profit from it, I think it would have been a humongous stink.

Your experience will never be mine and vice versa, so I don\'t claim I\'d know what yours is like. My own experience largely formed in (ironically self-chosen) 18 hour job for 4 years that burned the ever-living sh*t out of me, but at least paid back somewhat in career and money. I first slept through every weekend, then adapted somewhat to the stresses and went nuts on the weekends. It was necessary, though not sustainable. Luckily I didn\'t get a side-dish of parental nagging ... otherwise that would have had to be masterfully blocked out. Because it is sometimes necessary to go beyond ""you"" to find what matters in life. (Your mom either found herself already or never will... Of course it makes no sense to her)\n\nI realised both that a weekend that was ""rich"" in experience would re-energize me more than a weekend of sleeping and eventually realised that I\'d rather live a little more and earn a little less. While having good times my head got new energy, but I was still burning my body up in triple speed. I know that it was a luxury to be able to cut back a little. After 4 years I first used up all my holidays and then noped out.\nThere again, it helped that I was doing my career for me, not for my parents. And thats why I think its important to not do it for them. I seriously don\'t quit easy, but when it gets necessary is a choice for me to make. I don\'t owe anyone but myself. \n\nLuckily the dull feeling of not knowing what passions could make sense wasn\'t natural to me, but a few years of working like a donkey made me forget who I was and what I liked. Hobbies were all gone. I honestly latched onto other people then. People who were burning for things. Just getting inspired by conversation and energy. Going nuts initially meant party, then it transformed to less party, less alcohol, more cherishing of brief human moments. It takes a while to find people that have something to say. If you can, mix with some foreign influence, whatever that means for you. \n\nThe friendships of that transformative time don\'t have to stay, but the moments will.

After uni, my friends went on grad trips, while I took a loan from my friend to buy enough work wear for my first job. I did not go for a overseas holiday in the first 3 years of my post-grad as I wanted to repay my loan asap and saved up a buffer. \n\nAll these for a fucking single goal of never being poor again in my life. I had an extremely hard time convincing myself that my efforts are worth it when I was grinding it.

But, I learned that there are circumstances one can’t change and a person can only change themselves.

I sympathize how they try to normalize their self-loathing and self-pity. And how they think the system is out to get them.

nGS_Official,nm4ad0,Save the hawkers,2021-05-27 18:18:44,singapore,378960,91,1628,"**Motivation**

The heightened alert including the no dine-in rule has affected many hawkers, especially elderly hawkers who fall off the technological grid. Some of the elderly hawkers are making a loss everyday, but insist on continuing with their business using their personal savings.

&#x200B;

**Problem I have observed:**

* Elderly hawkers could not keep up with new technology. Some of them are using old Nokia phone
* Some elderly hawkers cannot read or write
* Lack of delivery service
* Convenience benefits by Food delivery services outweighs ""dabaoing"" from hawkers.
* Lack of manpower to manage food delivery

**Solution I believe can help our elderly hawkers:**

Introducing '@SaveTheHawkersBot', a telegram bot to solve the above mentioned problems. The purpose of the bot is help match people that are going to dabao with people looking for delivery together via their telegram username.

How it works? Person A and person B stays in the same block. Person A have decided to go down to the hawker to buy some delicious chicken rice. Person A will tell SaveTheHawlersBot his/her postal code and food he/she is buying.

Person B wants to eat chicken rice but is too lazy to dabao or pay markup price from food delivery services. Person B ask SaveTheHawlersBot if there is anyone going to dabao in his block.

Person B will be shown a list of people going to dabao chicken rice near his postal code . Person B can then DM Person A. Person A can choose to charge Person B a small fee($1? $1.50? depends on Person A) for his/her effort to dabao.

**How does the telegram bot help?**

* The person going to dabao gets an incentive for ""dabaoing""
* The person asking for people to dabao pays a smaller delivery fee (up to the person dabaoing)
* There will be more bulk orders at the hawkers
* Elderly hawkers do not need to have the knowledge of how to use the bot
* Elderly hawkers do not need to hire anymore manpower to manage delivery service
* Minimizes people going to the hawker to prevent overcrowding (purpose of covid restrictions)
* Offers cheaper delivery fee than many food delivery services

**How to use?**

/helptobuy followed by typing in your postal code and food. This will save your username, postal code and food you are buying to the bot's database, letting other users know you are willing to help dabao in your block.

The bot will automatically delete your entry after 30 minutes or you can choose to be deleted immediately with /donebuying.

/asktobuy will show you all the usernames and food respective users are buying near your postal code. You can choose which username to DM then negotiate your delivery fee and meeting place to collect your food/drinks.

**Some final words:**

SaveTheHawkersBot is a non profitable project intend to help the hawkers, especially the elderly hawkers.

I believe together, we can help the hawkers. SaveTheHawkersBot acts as a medium for the community to unite and support our local hawkers.

I look forward to your feedback on how the bot can be further improved.

You can send your feedback to me on telegram, '@CScookie'

growthnerd,o12jhm,Toxic Family Victims Resource List,2021-06-16 19:21:11,singapore,378960,45,411,"Hi everyone.

I’m a victim of a toxic family. The toxicity comes in the form of verbal and emotional abuse. The Police have come to our house multiple times. But since no physical abuse or violence is involved, they can’t do anything or place arrests. 

Managed to survive CB and COVID by staying long hours at the office and using co-working spaces, only going home to sleep. When I start Uni, I’ll be applying to stay in Hall, work while studying to earn money, then move out upon graduation.

The effects of a toxic family member doesn’t end the moment you move out. You are still affected. Your self-esteem is low, you struggle with making friends or building relationships. 

You can seek therapy, but anyone who has gone through therapy will tell you that the bulk of it requires you to put in the work yourself. Your therapist is not a magic fix-all that cures you from your past on your first session.

Fixing yourself is a long process. As a victim, it isn’t easy to rebuild yourself. At times, it’s difficult to know where to turn to or what resources you can use.

I know I’m not alone in this. So I’ve decided to put together a list of resources for victims of toxic families to know what options they have to do something about their situation. 

I intend to compile this as a list of URLs to professional help, resources and service providers, depending on which life stage the victims are at.

I am not a therapist, nor do I want to be one. I am not a mental health professional either. I just want to collect links showing other victims like myself that there are options we could take to get out of our situation. 

See the [resource list here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13QS4GWu58a7jeF6fuW0COkxGYxJMgnK_EhJN-fM9uIs/edit?usp=sharing). 

This is still on a Google Doc because I’d just started very recently. But I’d love to hear the subreddit’s input on what else I can add, or if there are any sections the victims of toxic family members could find helpful. 

If you’d like to be updated about my progress or be a part of this journey, feel free to DM me. Feel free to ask any questions you might have.

Most of us will usually not opt for the former unless it is life threatening because we are talking about family after all.

I myself had to explain to my husband a few times why I do things sometimes in a certain way or why am I anxious about certain things - because I have lived in rentals + only had one meal a day growing up and am sometimes fearful. \n\nYour husband may have also misunderstood your intentions and felt that he is your very very least priority compared to your parents as he is not nominated at all.\n\nYes, he may be able to take care of himself (and his family would be too) in the event of any unfortunate circumstances, but deep down inside, he wishes to be acknowledged as an equally (or more) important person to you as compared to your parents.

The comment about his parents could be him lashing out his feelings of being neglected under the guise of ""everything should be equal"". I\'m sure he knows nothing is equal in a relationship.\n\nI think both of you really need to communicate this through.

But I promise to give as much as I can to him as a partner (love, support etc as always) - after all, we both already know that we definitely have class and privilege differences going into the marriage. I also pity my husband sometimes... I\'m not as capable and well-to-do as his exes, so he has to really pay a lot more for me e.g. go on holidays etc instead of the 50-50 situations he used to be in. He also paid alot more for the renovation + housing loan.

In BMT the only reason i got through it was because of my peers, my fellow BMT mates who laughed and suffered along with me throughout the 4 months. 

Now in the navy, there's so little NSF's. In my unit, there's only a handful while the rest are regulars. What's more is that the handful of NSF's just aren't really my ""type"" of friends, if that makes sense. I'm sure they're great people but i just don't really get along with them. This makes me extremely sad considering i'm going to be in this position for another 1.5 years. I appreciate the ""change your mentality/mindset"" kind of advice but is there any practical solution to this?",0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/oa1l19/in_the_navy_and_dont_like_it_here/,"['Suck thumb , can’t do much unless u get post out', 'Navy is good and if ur sup is good, ur ns is good. \n\nGot people tio infantry, so u want change to infantry?', 'Make friends with the regulars?

Sorry but its National Service, not National Cohesion.', 'Boat A?', ""Don't you get a lot of off days due to sailing and other activities? Maybe that is something to look forward to. If not, you really need to try and make friends (especially if you are stay in). If you are stayout, search for activities you can look forward to after LP.   \n\nUsually I hate relating NS to work, but in the future, your colleagues may not be the type of people you like either.

Better food, less regimentation, cool job.', ""I emphathise with the sentiment (didn't click amazingly with anyone in unit, and Navy routine can make it more difficult to meet up with non-Navy people depending on schedule), but to be brutally honest, you're probably stuck. Sounds like you're already in unit, so I'm assuming out of IMOS/NMI. The lack of other NSFs is the norm except in maybe a few units where the high churn/turnover of NSFs matters less. That said, superficial relationships with other NSFs are fine, and I really don't see the problem with getting to know the regulars? At least one of the guys I befriended is now an ex-regular. At the entry/working level, the age gap and interests are probably closer too (compared to with sup/chief/officers/etc.).\n\nFor now, probably depends on what phase of unit life you're in. If you're still in OJT, yeah, that's just going to suck, because people are going to be actively testing/scrutinising you to see if you can perform or not. It gets better after that though. That's also why trying to malinger out at this phase, should you attempt to do so, is a bad idea - it's more likely to get more shit thrown your way instead; sure, if you keep it up, maybe they'll decide you're a lost cause and get rid of you, but 90% chance it'll be a prolonged, miserable experience for everyone involved regardless.\n\nIf you're already post-OJT, well, still kind of hard, but it also comes down to your supervisor and CO. About a decade ago, my understudy posted over because he was having a rough time in his unit and his CO and supervisor cared enough to rotate him out. But that's pretty rare and depends on your relationship with them and their personalities.\n\nYou could still play the malingering game, but be prepared for it to potentially get unpleasant; post-OJT, people are going to trust you a lot more with responsibilities, especially if you're in a more active vocation, and being a deadweight is probably the fastest way to get everyone else in the department to hate you (speaking from personal experience dealing with an incompetent individual). This is tangential, but thing about the Navy, as my sup once told me, is that it's small; duties are split between a smaller pool of people, and everyone knows everyone. Once you have a reputation, people will know. Even more so when the majority are regulars who have been around a while. Hard to say whether or not you'll get out (if they decide you're really a lost cause, probably), but again 90% chance it'll be miserable as long as you remain there."", 'Sounds hard but count ur blessings.

Rather than ""break leg"" (which is extremely intelligent I must say, would love to see you try that if/when you\'re in a similar predicament in the future), just malinger your way out of navy? Mate it\'s so simple and it\'s a much better solution as well, rather than purposely injuring yourself. If you\'re gonna suggest something like ""break leg"" then why not just shoot yourself with a live round? That way, he doesn\'t even have to serve at all.\n\n\nThis man said ""Practical solution"" and ""only viable solution"" btw. Didn\'t know the only way to down pes is to break limps or other body parts. Bro they\'re so many examples around you literally showing you how to go about doing it.

Combat unit life just sucks hahaha', 'SA/ ASA\n\nPros: Depending on where you get posted: SU (Guards & Commando: you’re staying in with the rest of the boys. Combat units: roughly the same except some you get to stay out, going home everyday after 6pm) if you’re posted to HQ (e.g. MINDEF, 2PDF, CSSCOM…) you’re basically as good as a free man. Depending on your division some might be in red zone, in which case, you’re unable to bring phone/ camera phone inside office.\n\nCons: literally mindless work like timetable planning, helping your DXOs’ to run errands & print stuff. A lot of them out there will tell you it’s easy, but trust me seating down in your seat for 2 years really can drive you insane.', 'SA/Supply Assistant/Storeman/Saikang warrior/包山包海\n\npro: your 2 years can finish the whole netflix catalogue and theres alot of downtime. one thing that holds true for storemans is that when youre busy youre really fucking busy and when youre free you can sleep throughout the day with no one disturbing you\n\n\ncon: if you are combat fit/pes a/b then gl to you, you get posted to coyline and usually have to get attached to combat units and follow them during outfield on top of guard duties. lots of item movement and theres always that one fucker who loses something\n\nif you are combat service/css/aka crippled/pes c or e then enjoy your stayout life 8-5 guard duty/amber duty usually once a month, usually you do more admin work than store work', 'Current combat engineer. \n\nIt’s kinda split into many groups, EOD and CBRD, Bridging engineers (M3G and assault boat), Division Engineers (Field and Plant) and Armour Engineers. \n\nEOD and CBRD pros is that you’ll get an additional $300 combat pay which means you can actually earn 1k as a man.

It largely depends on where you get posted to but this is probably as close as you can get to a normal civilian life (8-5, usually i 3pm finish lunch zao liao). Especially with the current covid situation, cohorting gives you the perfect non-army life. As some other people mentioned, no one really cares about you so you can really do what you want all day. I struck lottery with mine, have my own office *ROOM* and no one ever disturbs me without early notice so i can pretty much stay in civi whole day (except for lunch)unless i know someone is coming. Perfect for you to really invest in yourself, read books, learn a new language, stuff like that.\n\nCons: its really lonely, you don’t really get too many opportunities to talk to people unless you go out of your way to. Also I don’t have a bunk, but for me no big diff since i just stack the chairs and sleep on it but for most offices they give more fucks and don't let their ASA do that so i imagine they just have to endure the whole day doing nothing.

Still can't get enough of them lmao\n\nCons:\n\ni) Rough sea conditions, especially during monsoon seasons. Even people who aren't easily seasick become Merlion during such rough weather (like yours truly :/)\n\nii) Many elements of possible dangers (God forbid): Boat fires, boat sinking, falling overboard (MOB), threats posed by armed criminals/suspects like sea robbers or pirates (but these are hella² rare)\n\niii) Ngl, maritime policing is much tougher than at Land Div (the sea is a totally different domain from dry land duh, and we gotta prepare for a lot more threats and dangers to not only our life and limb, but also of those we seek to protect and go after\n\niv) While you don't see so much crazy on mainland SG, one thing you cannot escape from is corpse retrieval (again, very extremely rare). These corpses, more often than not extremely decayed or rotten, usually drift into SG waters from nearby countries (thank God I never had to do this duty in my entire tenure with PCG)\n\nv) Communication problems: As many of the people at sea are usually foreigners (e.g. Indons on tugboats or non-English-speaking angmohs on container ships or pleasure craft), you may face some challenge trying to converse with them as you perform routine or necessary checks on them and their boats\n\nSummary:\n\nMaybe the cons seem like a lot, this I agree. But they are generally few and far between. So perhaps now it seems like the pros still outweigh the cons\n\nPersonally speaking, this vocation offered a myriad of opportunities to challenge myself and do my best in NS, and I have no regrets in choosing it as first choice. 2 years since ORD and am still proud af to have served with PCG \n\n#hormatspf"", 'Bro I was really really hoping to get this job!

Okay...is this the  singapore version of “pull yourself up by your bootstraps”', '> # Social safety nets must be strengthened, but cannot become shackles that create dependency: Heng Swee Keat\n\n> There have been many ideas proposed to help Singaporean workers and keep inequality in check, such as a minimum wage, universal basic income, and unemployment insurance, Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat stated in Parliament on August 31.\n\n> Hence, while the government is not closed to these proposals, it is necessary to recognise that each have their merits and trade-offs and that the country must be clear about the appropriate solution for the current context.\n\n> Heng was speaking during the debate on the Motion of Thanks to the President\'s Address. He highlighted that if Singaporeans want greater social spending, either taxes will go up, or more will be spent at the expense of future generations, such as an increase in debt.\n\n> He added, ""We must never forget that we have provided almost S$100 billion of support for our people and business this year, without incurring a single cent of debt, because we were able to fund over half of this using past reserves.""\n\n> Jobs are still the best form of welfare and social safety nets must reflect that\n\n> Quoting the Labour Movement, Heng further stated that jobs are still the ""best form of welfare"" for Singaporeans and that the government will continue to invest in people so as to ""keep social mobility alive.""\n\n> He added that Singapore\'s social safety nets must also be strengthened, but it must reinforce and not undermine an individual\'s efforts.\n\n> Heng elaborated:\n\n> ""Indeed, a social safety net cannot become a set of shackles. It should not hold down those who started with less. It should not create dependency, such that people who get fish for today, never learn how to fish for food tomorrow. It should not breed an entitled class who ask: “What more can you do for me?”\n\n> Rather, a ""well-designed"" social safety net protects the vulnerable in Singapore, invests in both human and societal capital, and provides a means for those who have fallen to pick themselves back up.\n\n> Heng added, ""It supports every generation to have aspirations and dreams, and for everyone to ask, \'What more can we do for one another?\'\'""\n\n> The government has heard the people\'s voices\n\n> The Finance Minister further stated that the government had ""heard the voices of the people"".\n\n> Acknowledging that there had been unhappiness and concerns raised, he stated:\n\n> ""As the world, and our society changes, there will be a greater divergence of views. We will continue to understand your concerns and improve your lives. We will have to adapt to these changes but stay true to our values.""\n\n> With regards to Parliament, he noted that its duty was to ""articulate and debate policy options, to build a better life for our people, and to advance Singapore’s place in the world,""as mandated by Singaporeans.\n\n> In declaring that Covid-19 was possibly the most severe test for Singapore by far, he said, ""We can navigate this period of great uncertainty and change, but our policies must set the right tone for the rest of society.""\n\n> Thanking Goh Chok Tong for leading Singapore through previous crises\n\n> Heng also took time to thank Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong for leading Singapore through the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997 and the outbreak of SARS.\n\n> In describing his experience of working closely with Goh through several years, he noted the ""wise counsel and support"" that Goh had provided him with during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis, when the government had to seek approval from the President for a S$150 billion guarantee on all bank deposits, backed up by past reserves.\n\n> ""After I entered politics in 2011, Emeritus Senior Minister (ESM) Goh continued to be a good mentor, with his signature mix of wisdom and humour. Mr Goh has left an indelible mark on many Singaporeans, especially those of us in this House.""\n\n> Heng also paid tribute to other retired MPs, such as Khaw Boon Wan, Lim Hng Kiang and Yaacob Ibrahim.

1. Roughly how many ml of the 3-in-1 shampoo should i bring for confinement period? (I am scared that it will run out)

2. Are prickly heat powder neccessary?

3. Do I need to bring a toiletries basket?

4. How often is it recommended for me to wash my clothes? I am in PES A Enhanced batch if it helps!

5. How much admin time do the enhanced batch have usually? Is it also true that sometimes (esp the first day) there won't be any time to shower?

6. How often are swimming lessons given covid restrictions now?

7. Do I still need to buy an anti-blister spray if I already bought anti-blister plasters?

8. I am not very comfortable with being shirtless. Will I be judged by my bunk mates? I saw a thread which says that we should head to the toilet shirtless to be faster? (not sure how true is that tho) I understand that we will be doing PTs shirtless but other than that is it possible not to be shirtless and not be judged?

9. Are there any tips to get along well with my section mates?

10. Just a random question but will everyone who enlist at the same timeslot as me be in my platoon?

11. Do share with me any other tips for BMT if u have! I would really appreciate it

Hope these aren't stupid questions because I am really nervous about BMT and it would really help if you can share with me any tips you have about BMT.

Trust me nobody is gonna judge you for being shirtless because in reality you guys will barely have time for yourselves even more so since you are enhanced batch where you\'ll have less admin time compared to PTP batch which I was from.

BMT will be one of the most fun and carefree time in your army life before you eventually go to command school or unit where you have much more responsibilities. For me personally, I am quite built but I ended up in PTP because there was some cock up in my PES status and I ended up not clearing my ippt in time. Being in ptp meant majority of my platoon mates were people who were obviously not that fit and had trouble passing ippt and you can imagine they don\'t have the most built physiques but I can tell you I never judged any of them when we were all shirtless and I\'m sure they didn\'t judge me because for some reason the sun shines brighter in Tekong and it\'s hot as fuck so we knew it\'s for a practical and not a vain reason.

The powder is also good to get rid of bugs like flies and mosquitoes\n3. for your convenience, yes. Just dump all your toiletries into a small basket and just carry the basket with one hand.\n4. If you can't stand the smell of your sweat, best is to wash once every 2-3 days and prepare a spare one in case you are in the midst of drying your previous shirts. Your washing frequency will get slower as the time goes by. I started with washing once every 2 days to once every 5 days as I bring them home to wash it properly.\n5. If you are enlisting as direct BMT (non-ptp), admin time will be very minimal as each week you will have things like BCCT/Route March and at least 1 high key event.

Don't buy first, monitor your blisters condition first, if it is bad, then you get blister cream\n8. it is up to you to be shirtless or not while in bunk. yes, it is much more convenient as you wont be wasting time changing into your clothes while occupying the cubicle especially on rush hour periods.

IngelSoong,nsn238,[A Level] Why is A Level Chemistry So Hard?,2021-06-05 11:54:56,SGExams,77716,64,264,"# Why is A Level Chemistry So Hard?

If you are taking A Level Chemistry, you will probably agree, like most students, that A Level H2 Chemistry is difficult and you have good reasons to do so.

The concepts are complex and involve much memory work.

There is a steep increase in the learning curve.

This is only natural.

Having now graduated from the top 20% of the O Level cohort, the syllabus is now made much tougher to further differentiate among all of you.

# Much Memory Work is Required

Chapters with many explanations to do include chemical bonding, all that organic chemistry reactions, the periodic table, and more.

What’s worse is that you often need to rely on your memory work to even answer the first question among a chain of others.

If you don’t get the first question right, you often end up throwing the marks for the remaining questions away.

Such as:

# Organic chemistry

Nothing can be worse than that.

Not knowing ALL the chemical reactions linking one functional group to another makes the whole study process much more frustrating.

Questions such as deductive types easily trip you if you miss out remembering the reagents or conditions for one or more reactions.

What’s more, reagents and conditions that can work for one reaction may not work for another.

# Specialized reagents

Think of KMnO4, or NaBH4.

And you certainly need to know what ticks so that you could use them to distinguish one compound from another.

Speaking of madness.

And you wish if only your parents are reading this.

# Polar molecules

And what about learning polar molecules must contain polar bonds and yet finding out later on not all molecules containing polar bonds have to be polar.

And the reason is that the dipole moments for all the covalent bonds will cancel and end up having zero net dipole moments.

This concept can be hard for students who have not studied vectors to appreciate.

I’m sure studying polar bears will be more interesting after this.

Here are 8 tips to deal with memory work.

# Contradicting Explanations

Not only you are faced with tons of explanations to remember; more often than not, you will see them seemingly contradicting each other.

# Nuclear charge and screening effect

Because moving across a period increases both the number of protons and electrons, nuclear charge and screening effect will increase1.

However, you will earn that because the nuclear charge increases to a larger extent compared to the screening effect, the increase in nuclear charge outweighs that of screening effect, and the net nuclear charge increases.

Therefore, the size of an atom decreases across a period.

Yet down a group we have it differently.

This time, the size of an atom increases down a group because the screening effect due to an increase in the number of electrons or electronic shells greatly outweighs that of nuclear charge due to an increase in protons.

Confusing huh.

# School Notes Can Be Confusing

Throughout my years of teaching, I have seen how JCs can sometimes de-emphasize important concepts while loading with irrelevant not-to-be-tested content.

# Electrochemistry

It also doesn’t help when they choose to define anode to be positive while cathode to be negative2.

These associations change depending on whether we have a galvanic cell or electrolytic cell.

Instead, students will remember better if you define anode as the electrode where oxidation occurs.

Likewise cathode is the electrode where reduction occurs.

This set of definitions is fixed whether you have a galvanic cell or an electrolytic cell.

# Comparing instantaneous dipole-induced dipole attractions against permanent dipole-permanent dipole attractions

Often in notes if a compound has permanent dipole-permanent dipole (pd-pd) attractions it will omit to mention its instantaneous dipole-induced dipole (id-id) attractions to explain differences in boiling points.

Turn out that some students did not realize that all covalent compounds have id-id attractions by virtue of the electron cloud each molecule must possess.

Purely because the school lecture notes made no mention about it.

The fact that compounds possessing pd-pd attractions having highly boiling points than compounds having id-id attractions are only valid — if they have similar Mr, is not often mentioned.

That is why sometimes heavier non-polar molecules can having higher boiling points compared to polar molecules.

# Handling Exceptions and Anomalies

Yet all the trends you have been painstakingly studying for so long is not always smooth and nice.

Exceptions are abundant in A Level Chemistry and all the theories and models don’t always work out well 100% of the time.

When that happens, scientists have to understand the anomalies and account for the kinks.

# Electronic Configuration

For example, one would expect the electronic configuration 3d orbitals to be filled before 4s.

But it turns out we have to fill in electrons for 4s before 3d.

“Okay, I can put up with that,” you said.

Except you start grabbing your hair after finding that you should be filling 3d5 4s1 instead of 3d4 4s2 for Cr and 3d10 4s1 instead of 3d9 4s2 for Cu.

No surprise students are complaining.

# First ionization energies

The trend of first ionization energy (I.E.) is also not smooth sailing.

You are taught that 1st I.E. trends higher with a smaller atomic radius, as when you move across a period.

Yet in period 2, you have Be and O throwing spanner in the works.

Each carries different explanations for defying the trend, giving the poor student more things to remember — and frustrations3.

# Covalent characteristics in ionic compounds and vice versa

You have been learning that metals and non-metals will form ionic compounds.

Then suddenly, AlCl3 and BeCl2 appear out of nowhere and you are supposed to know that they are covalent than ionic!

Such exceptions are more common than not.

No wonder students are complaining.

# Deviation from O Level

Due to the need to introduce chemistry to the masses, certain concepts in O Level can be overly simplified or at worst misleading.

# Shapes of molecules and dot-and-cross diagrams

In O Level, you are learned to draw dot and cross diagram, where pairs of electrons are drawn in fixed positions.

The concept of attaining a full octet structure also confuses A Level students when they are exposed to elements with the ability to expand their octet structure and accept more than eight electrons.

Furthermore, the notion of s, p, and d orbitals with their respective 3D shapes also doesn’t sit well with 2D fixed electron dot and cross diagram.

In A Level, students are also exposed to the Valence Shell Electronic Pair Repulsion (VSEPR) theory to determine the shape of the molecules.

What complicates matters is that due to lone pair-lone pair repulsion > lone pair-bond pair repulsion > bond pair-bond pair repulsion, the bond angle is not always consistent.

If you have been studying diligently you will know what I mean.

# Acids and bases

Instead, now you found that the definition of acids learned in O Level is very limited. Why are compounds such as NH3 a base when no OH- is emitted is also not explained?

It is also the most outdated among all three definitions.

Arrhenius theory, the one you learned in O Level is formulated in 1884!

While both the Brønsted-Lowry theory and Lewis theory are proposed in 1923.

# P. S.

If you do want your parents to know your pain in understanding Chemistry, make sure they read this.

Notes:  
1. Some schools will indicate that the screening effect is approximately constant.  
2. For electrolytic cells. For galvanic cells the polarities are reversed.  
3. The electron is to be removed from the 2p orbital in B and is further away than the 2s orbital in Be. Therefore lower energy is required to remove the electron from B. For O. due to inter-electronic repulsion, it is easier to remove an electron from here as opposed to the 2p orbital of N which has only one electron.",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nsn238/a_level_why_is_a_level_chemistry_so_hard/,"['Damn A level graduates will probably get ptsd reading this', ""When you enjoy a subject, you don't find it difficult XD.\n\nI've always been a Chem nerd to the core, especially Organic Chemistry, all those cute hexagons.

Thus, this leads to an increase in the atomic radius of elements down a group.\n\nThe fundamental concepts for Chemistry that are taught at A levels are **simply a continuum of what you have been taught at O level Chemistry**, **albeit at greater depth and breadth**.

However, a common misperception is that it also gives the order of the energy levels of the orbitals in an atom, which is not the case.\n\nIf we were to have a Sc nucleus, and start to build the atom by filling in the electrons, the first 18 electrons do go in the order 1s2, 2s2, 2p6, 3s2, 3p6. However, the 19th electron is actually added to the 3d orbital (because it has a lower energy), not the 4s like what is erroneously taught. The 20th and 21st electrons are then added to the 4s orbital, which is higher in energy. This also explains why the 4s electrons are lost before the 3d.\n\nHence, the Madelung law helps you derive the electronic configuration of Sc: [Ar] 4s2 3d1, but it doesn’t actually give you the order of the orbitals in terms of energy, not does it show the order the electrons will fill the orbitals.', 'bio > chem for me tho', 'At least there is consistency with sciences... although for chem there are conflicting ones', 'Cannot find it.', ""Why aren't the 20th and 21st electrons added to the 3d orbital, in that case?

Why does it have two electrons in the 4s orbital, but none in the 3d orbital?"", 'Computing > Chemistry', 'OP deleted it for some reason', 'To put it simply, it is more energetically favourable for Sc to adopt an \\[Ar\\] 3d¹ 4s² configuration than \\[Ar\\] 3d³ 4s⁰. I know it does not really explain the ""why"", but the factors to consider requires knowledge that goes way beyond the scope of H2 Chemistry.  \n\n\nI will offer one explanation though: the 3d orbital is closer to the nucleus than the 4s orbital is. Any electron added to the 3d orbital will experience repulsion due to the \\[Ar\\] core electrons. As such, **the overall energy of the atom is reduced** if the 20th and 21st electrons are promoted to the 4s orbital.  \n\n\nIt is a common mistake to assume that occupying the lowest possible energy orbitals will always result in the most stable electronic configuration. That is not the case and we should consider the overall energy of the atom instead. This also accounts for the presence of high and low spin states for transition metal complexes (GCE A levels 2011 P3Q5(c)).  \n\n\nThe interplay of nuclear charge, repulsion, orbital energies and other factors are not easily explained and it may be futile to try to find a simplified rule we can use to account for the electronic configuration. We can still use the Madelung\'s law to determine the electronic configuration, just be careful not to equate it to the actual order. *We do not get a Sc atom by adding one proton and one electron to a Ca atom*, but by starting off with a Sc nucleus and then adding 21 electrons.  \n\n\nSimilarly, for K and Ca, it is more energetically favourable for the 4s orbital to be occupied than the 3d ones. Again, the overall effect is different compared to the discussion for the transition metals because the effective nuclear charges of the various species are not the same. Some will argue that the 4s orbitals are lower in energy compared to the 3d ones, while there are those who propose the 4s orbital is always higher in energy compared to 3d.  \n\n\nAgain, the interactions are complex, and it is best not to oversimplify and look for a one-size-fits-all solution.  \n\n\nFor further reading, you can check out the articles by Eric Scerri, Eugen Schwarz, and Frank Pilar.', 'Fascinating stuff, thanks for your detailed explanation!', 'Actually, may I ask what you mean by building up an atom?

Feel free to not reply if you\'re busy!', '""*...aren\'t we usually more concerned the order of removal?*""  \n\n\nExactly that. And therefore, we would expect the ""addition"" of electrons to mirror that of the removal of electrons. Since the 4s electrons are removed first, they must be ""added"" last if we were to reverse the process.  \n\n\n""*...Actually, may I ask what you mean by building up an atom? (ref. to ""*We do not get a Sc atom by adding one proton and one electron to a Ca atom, but by starting off with a Sc nucleus and then adding 21 electrons*."")*  \n*Is this a physical process that happens in reality? What\'s the significance of the order in which electrons are added to an atom*""  \n\n\nMaybe ""building"" was not such a good term to use after all, and I could have been clearer. The point I wanted to get across was students (and teachers) often apply the Madelung rule and assume that electrons (and protons) are added to ""make"" the atom.\n\n  \nFor example, because the electronic configuration of Mg is \\[Ne\\] 3s², that for Al must be \\[Ne\\] 3s² 3p¹ because the next orbital to be occupied after the 3s is the 3p. Or in the case of Ca and Sc, the electronic configuration of Sc is \\[Ar\\] 4s² 3d¹ and the 3d is occupied next after the 4s, because Ca has a doubly occupied 4s orbital.  \n\n\nHowever, the electronic configuration of Ca should have no bearing on that of Sc since they have different effective nuclear charge after all. Ca having an \\[Ar\\] 4s² should not imply that it is so for Sc^(+).  \n\n\nUltimately, my original comment was to correct what OP said:  \n\n\n>For example, one would expect the electronic configuration 3d orbitals to be filled before 4s.  \nBut it turns out we have to fill in electrons for 4s before 3d.\n\n  \nIf we are talking about ""fill in"", then we should be doing so by considering the Sc nucleus and add in the electrons. Not by starting with a Ca atom and then introducing an electron (fill in 4s before 3d).  \n\n\nSorry for taking up so much of your time. Feel free to not reply if you\'re busy!  \n\n\nNot at all.

phenomenonenology,o08gsw,An Appeal for Active Listening,2021-06-15 15:22:03,singapore,378960,47,107,"For a country that prides itself for its ‘racial harmony,’ our discussions and responses to dialogue on racism are strangely inconsistent. But one of the concerning prevailing features is a lack of empathy displayed in many conversations concerning recent incidences.

Time and time again, we have heard many accounts from people that clearly demonstrate racism has always persisted in Singaporean society. Some incidents attract straightforward outrage, while others are more polarising. There seems to be a misconception that there is a certain ‘threshold’ that actions and words have to meet in order to be considered firmly as racism. As if the line between what is ‘racist’ and not is set in stone. This dangerously ignores more subtle, and arguably more insidious, forms of racism – whether it is discriminatory attitudes in the workplace or school under the guise of procedure, or in throwaway or backhanded comments. 

Racism is also not a homogenous collective experience. It is experienced differently across the board, not just based solely on race or ethnicity. It varies depending on an individual’s socioeconomic background, physical appearance, age, gender identity, and other aspects (i.e. it is intersectional). The policing of what is categorically racist (and what is not) shows: one, an inability to conceptualise nuance; and two, an unwillingness to listen to those that are subjected to it.

When defending occurrences that are not so clear-cut, a common counter-argument that is raised is that no individual can know of all cultural details and knowledge, so actions stemmed from ignorance may be insensitive, but not racist. Ignorance may not be a crime nor ill-intended, but it is a breeding ground for toxic and narrow-minded attitudes that can escalate. We must hold ourselves and each other accountable for our ignorance and work against it. To counter ignorance, one has to proactively listen and be receptive to the unfamiliar, while accepting one’s own  limitations. It is not a specific epiphany or about getting it right that one time, it is a continuous journey of listening and learning.

That is why occurrences as recent as People’s Association's response (re: wedding photo-Hari Raya incident) or Amrin Amin’s ‘snowflake’ comment are so frustrating: it is an institutional refusal to listen. Preoccupied with whether they are in the ‘right’ or ‘wrong,’ they have failed to respect procedures that enable community engagement and feedback. They have accepted their own version of events, and are moving forward with it without any deference for the communities and people they are supposed to serve. (And these circumstances have repeated themselves in many other contexts.) It is a poor example of civic-minded behaviour and allows frustrations to dangerously fester in the long term.

TLDR; or in conclusion: To be circumstantially tolerant is not the same as acceptance. Downplaying and rejecting incidences as not-racist-enough perpetuates a harmful cycle of selective deafness. Don’t wave around “a listening ear and a willing heart” and not actually do it. We should be challenging ourselves to proactively listening and learning, and fostering an environment of trust and receptiveness that can only contribute to our community’s resilience.

DISCLAIMER: I am generally a silent observer on this subreddit, being both introverted and anxious in general. But I too am still learning. I think it is important for us to remember that choosing to listen is an action in itself, and can only bolster our capacity for effective action and support.

You seem to suggest that a 'threshold' implies that certain forms of racism will no longer be accepted as racism. This does not follow. Obviously, 'subtle, more insidious' forms of racism can still be considered to be racism, and so, by definition, falls within the threshold.\n2. You seem to suggest that racism should be defined based on the individual's experience. This must not be the case. Racism is a serious accusation with significant implications. There must be a generally accepted standard for racism. If I ask a sheltered kid to start managing their own laundry or live with dirty clothes/ no clothes, and the kid thinks that I am literally torturing them, does that make me a torturer? If a person feels that their modesty has been insulted because another person compliments their attire, does that make the person who gave the compliment some sort of sexual offender? Of course, these examples are fairly exaggerated, but they illustrates the point that certain categorisations should not be defined based on each individual's opinion, no matter how much the individual believes them to be true, but rather on commonly accepted metrics.\n3.

You should realise that this is false. Their initial 'unreserved apology' and immediate removal of a standee are clear examples of direct responses to public feedback. However, what could be said about the PA is that they have set a limit to communication, and are not open to unlimited conversation. This is certainly a situation worthy of discussion and potentially problematic. However, this is an entirely different issue from being absolutely unresponsive. Don't make false accusations.\n\nMy Thoughts:\n\nI think that the content of the PA and Amin's statements are generally correct. In other words, I don't agree with those claiming that they are being 'gaslit' or statements to that effect. However, I do think that the PA and Amin have both made significant mistakes, in that their approach focused excessively on the fact that they were right, and did not effectively defuse a tense and heated situation.

May I say first that I am glad you have this care and curiosity for learning more, and you have accumulated such sensitivities towards different 'cultures'. It is an attitude I always trying to cultivate within myself. I don't think I have a straightforward answer to your comments, but I will try my best. \n\nCulture is such a loaded term, and means differently from anyone. Even if you read up, collect your own observations of specific behaviours associated with respective cultural groups, chat with your neighbours and friends – that will never be representative. Sure there are shared conceptions of what each cultural group has in common, but there will always be additional laters of nuance. Whether because of time (i.e. culture evolves), space (i.e. regional variations), or just differing household or personal relationships with their cultural identity (and what even constitutes that) – more often  intersections of all three (or more) dimensions.\n\nSo when I say one can never know, I guess what I am trying to say is that categorical definitions of cultural groups do not reflect the nuanced realities that we may each get to know, whether as participants or as observers. Even within large umbrella groups there are so many layers of differentiation: dialect groups, state identities, migrants or diaspora, so on. And reading up is no substitute of lived experiences and connections, which take time (and space) to live through/experience. Not a very helpful definition for policy or organisational action, yes I know. I am also cautious as it is easy to slip into judging specific forms of cultural knowledge as more representative and 'true', for it encourages gatekeeping of cultural practices –  some supposedly being more authentic than others. \n\nIt is a complex and difficult reality to face, even in Singapore for all its established platforms and multiculturalism that makes it easier than most places. While Singaporean residents are fortunate in that respect, I think it is important (and healthy) to acknowledge it is a complex and difficult journey! \n\nConcerning wilful ignorance, I think the only deplorable attitudes are in ignoring these nuances, denying ownership of their ignorance, and using one's incomplete knowledge to fuel bigotry and harmful actions. I think I have more to add to that, but this reply is getting rather long so I am going to stop."", ""It's called being defensive and it is a psychological response"", '> If your very first response to this post is to try and gatekeep racism or explain away how very tired you are of people talking about this very issue, then perhaps you are the “white moderate” that MLK is talking about.\n\nI disagree with this conclusion and I think it is a misreading of MLK.\n\nThe ""white moderate"" would be someone who agrees that a racist act took place, but refuses to take action in favour of peace.\n\nWe should, I think, allow discourse on whether or not a materially racist act happened in the first place or not.

isparavanje,ni3r47,A nowcast model of covid-19 spread in Singapore,2021-05-22 05:47:07,singapore,378960,64,692,"The reproductive number of a disease outbreak is a good way to track how well current measures are doing to slow the spread of a disease. It is essentially a measure of how many people each infected individual is expected to spread said disease to. Thus, a value of <1 means the disease will quickly burn out in the community, and that current measures are more than enough to halt the spread, whereas a value of >1 means that current measures are not enough. This is often tracked as a function of time, denoted as R(t).


In the US, there exist websites like https://covidactnow.org/?s=1853770, which attempt to provide a near-realtime estimate of the R(t), or reproductive number. In other countries, like Germany, government agencies like the Robert Koch Institute routinely publish the inferred R(t). Unfortunately for us, we don't seem to have that level of government transparency, and civil society isn't vibrant enough to really fill in the gap, so y'all are stuck with me. Some websites do publish reproduction number estimates for Singapore, such as [here](https://epiforecasts.io/covid/posts/national/singapore/); however, as Singapore's covid-19 dynamics are relatively unique, they don't paint a good picture. I will elaborate what I do different in a bit.


I am not an epidemiologist, so take my work with a grain of salt. On the other hand:

 * Data is data, and I like to think I know what I'm doing when it comes to data analysis and modelling. My primary work is in physics.
 * I am standing on the shoulders of giants, specifically adapting the model from [here](https://github.com/ResearchLuxembourg/covid-19_reproductionNumber/blob/master/src/estimation_R_eff.ipynb) and [here](https://github.com/k-sys/covid-19/blob/master/Realtime%20R0.ipynb) 
 * For now, I'm the 'civil society' y'all got, so what choice do you have? I'll be happy to hand over my kludgy code if someone with more domain-specific expertise wishes to take over, and I'd be happy to stop wasting my time if MOH releases something equivalent but better, but till then...I intend to post updates every few days till the current wave dies down, but not on weekends.


**The model**


The details of the model can be found in the links above. I make a few modifications. You can ignore this section if you don't care.

1. Instead of the matrix multiplication implemented in the linked models, I use convolution. I believe this is equivalent, but I worked it out mentally without pen and paper so I might be wrong. It looks correct though; we get consistent numbers. The reason why I implemented it differently is purely because this is more straightforward to me, and I wanted to do it with minimal effort. 

2. Instead of using total case numbers, I use community case numbers; in addition, I add 2 parameters to the model: probability of each imported case leaking into the community, and time delay for the discovery of community cases stemming from such a leak. The reason why there is a delay parameter is because presumably imported cases are tested much more frequently, causing a mismatch in discovery time. This is the biggest deviation from established models. Models which do not take this into account do not seem to do a good job for Singapore, as much of the variation in R(t) that those models see are actually due to variations in imported cases, and thus is a better reflection of R(t) in the countries that travellers hail from.

3. I did not find the optimal value for the sigma parameter, as it appears I have too many parameters for me to do a hierarchical model or max likelihood fit with the little data that exists. Instead, I just use the values that they found. This shouldn't matter too much as it really just affects the responsiveness of the plot, and at worst should make things lag for a few days.

PM me if you would like my code, it is a jupyter notebook. I'm opting to not share it on github because I keep my reddit identity separate from my work identity, and I guess I didn't want to create another github just for this.


**Results**


I find that the best fit leakage probability is 1.7%, with a best fit time delay of 16 days. Using these best fit parameters, the 5 latest inferred values of R(t) are:

Date | R(t) | lower bound (1 sigma HDI) | upper bound (1 sigma HDI)
:--|:--|:--|:--
18/05/21 | 1.32 | 0.94 | 1.72
19/05/21 | 1.24 | 0.86 | 1.62
20/05/21 | 1.14 | 0.76 | 1.50
21/05/21 | 1.14 | 0.76 | 1.50
22/05/21 | 1.08 | 0.70 | 1.44

Plot of R(t) over time: https://i.imgur.com/zImdjZ4.png


**Interpretation (caution: not an epidemiologist)**


**The values now are actually consistent with R<1, though the best-fit is still above 1. As such, we appear to be on the cusp of breaking the chain of transmission.** Note that inferred R(t) values have to be delayed by the average time it takes to discover each case of covid. As such, the values now might be just starting to reflect the measures from last week; the next few days will tell us if the measures are enough. There is a steady downward trend, however, which is a good sign.

A leakage probability of 1.7% looks realistic to my untrained eye. It appears that even with all the current measures in place to secure borders, the leakage probability is significant, and as such the transmission coefficient must be kept low enough or sporadic bouts of community spread are inevitable unless borders are completely sealed, as even a trickle of citizens moving in and out won't be negligible with such a high probability. This also reflects the experiences of South Korea and HK, I think. I did not model for a time-varying leakage probability; while that might better reflect the reality of new variants, I don't think it is possible to add that much complexity to the model with the relatively sparse data that exists in a small country like Singapore.

**TL;DR: I made a model to determine if current measures are enough to halt covid. The answer right now is a strong 'maybe', though data from the next few days should clear up the picture more.**

**Edit: The code is here!** There have been so many messages for the code that I realised that I can't respond to every one, especially on the weekends. I plopped the whole thing into pastebin instead; it is just a ipynb file that you run in jupyter.

So dI/dt has the same interpretation as Rt, except it is centered around 0, instead of 1.\n\nThen, you can approximate dI/dt using the central difference equation (It+1 - It-1)/2 for your smoothed incidence curve (slope of the incidence curve). This is basically the ""speed of spread"" for new confirmed cases, to borrow an analogy from Newtonian physics of motion.\n\nKey advantage to this approach is that it only depends on knowing the incidence curve and doesn\'t require a generation interval distribution assumption. Also, the ""speed"" concept can be applied to any metric, like hospitalizations, ICU admits, or deaths.

As you may have already heard from various rumors, there is the good, and of course the bad, that is associated to this discipline of study - which I will review to the best of my knowledge as a student currently undertaking the course at present.

Let me just say that Architecture students are rather known to be the bunch of “no life students with no time” on the campus. Unless you have godly time management skills or incredible stamina to pull through the semester with little sleep, the typical Architecture student will not have much time to commit to sports or club activities. In certain electives with group work involved, there are actually students who shun grouping with architecture students not because they are “slackers who do not contribute”, but rather because they have “no time to contribute quality work”. Many people have little to no idea as to what we actually do in school, and depending on your circle of friends, you might actually be mocked at rather often. “Drawing only what”, “Make models ah, build tower I also can”, “Designing your next jenga ah” - I myself, frankly, was quite insulted by these little comments, made by close friends even, in the beginning. Over time you’ll learn how to laugh it off, but you’ll somehow still feel a little dissed for sure. I think the first thing I want to make clear is, yes, to be honest these chiding comments are not entirely wrong. But it’s also just the tip of the iceberg as to what we commit to, fret and stress about for the entirety of 13 weeks, for the 8 MC (which just means it counts as 2 normal modules) Design Studio Module.

Our main core module, the 8 MC Design Studio, is the most important priority of any NUS Architecture student regardless of the semester. On paper, it only takes up one day of the timetable: from 9 -6pm, it’s the one day where you get to meet your tutor (which are mostly outsourced to practitioners) for feedbacks regarding your design. Conceptually however, it actually demands the entire week’s time for preparation and presentation. Because that one day is mainly for studio consultations, you don’t actually learn much unless you ask your tutors the right questions. And to know what to ask, that’s where you have to find time in the week to hit the books, research, and you might be surprised that it takes up quite a substantial amount of time before even the ideation phase, followed up by the production phase which is most well known by others as the “drawing” and “making models”. The importance of this core module is real, because it can only be taken once a year - if you fail it, you’ll have to wait an entire year to re-take it. And the importance of pulling through it will be drilled indirectly into you by the tutors starting from the first year. “Don’t spend so much time on your electives, they are not important”. “Your production this week is quite lagging behind others. Are you spending too much time on your CCA?”. “In Archi, the only important thing is studio”. It is not surprising that as a result, most architecture students (in my opinions) are always in search for that “easy-to-get-A elective” module, and those involving essay writings are especially loathed. Ironically, I feel this is one of the reasons why many a times, we feel so stressed when we have an idea block and end up “producing nonsense” sometimes. Innovation and creativity demanded by the curriculum, ironically, is many a times unearthed in the exploration of fields not even related to architecture at all.

About the highly competitive environment…I think it’s something that varies according to what kind of batch mates you have, but it’s true. Frankly, I have even lost people whom I thought were close friends over grades. There were people who stopped talking to me after the grade for a certain group project turned out terrible, but I think this’s a niche extreme example. But when we talk about competitive, it’s a really toxic culture that not only exists between students, but even between tutors as well. Sometimes I feel that the friends you have in Archi are nice people to laugh and joke with during the holidays, but when the semester starts, they immediately become your fiercest rivals. Depending on the rigorous nature of the tutor’s studio, each week become a continuous cycle of outdoing one another in terms of graphical aesthetics, quantity of models or drawings produced…sometimes it’s really tiring and it makes me wonder what true learning really is, you know. If you are someone especially who suck at softwares and graphical production, you’re in for hell! And there’ll be tutors that will compare their studios’ work. “My studio’s site model is made of acrylic, your one…cardboard?” Even stuff like that you know. It’s a brewing toxic culture which makes one believe that the more you do, the better the architect you are becoming to be, and in turn the better your grades when it comes to the end of it all. And that brings me to my next point, the mental health of architecture students in NUS.

Architecture school, regardless of whatever country you’re in, is known to be not only mentally but also physically tiring as well. Unlike other disciplines of study, it’s not like we have textbooks to refer to, you know. And because there’s no “fixed syllabus”, tutors don’t really teach - they only “teach” through answering what you are interested to find out about each week, so the mental rigor lies in the 100% self initiated and driven research which you have to do (ie hardcore google). This also applies to first year students - so for those who are coming in, you better know clearly what plans and sections are because the tutors here will not babysit you. As for the physical, assembling the model is just one half of it. The other half, is actually producing your work in time so that you can print out your drawings, or laser cut your model parts etc. Up the years, the things you have to print increases in size to A0 - A1s, and there are not really a lot of printing shops that specialises in this which are wallet friendly. And laser cutting takes time too depending on the quantity and quality, so you really have to juggle your time well and work backwards to factor in all this to make it in time for the studio consult day. If you have a unreasonable tutor who’s the kind that believe that “studio is the only module you are taking in NUS”, you’re in for pure hell. I’ve had one such tutor in my second year, and in my studio of 12 students, 4 ended up with depression by the seventh week, including myself. 2 went for UHC counselling, and 1 of them almost committed suicide. I think that was really a wake up call for myself at least, and it was bad to the point that I actually had to tell my tutor about it before he “suddenly became all nice and friendly” towards the end. Extremely disgusting. Substantial number of students drop out each semester too, I think about 6 took leaves of absence to take care of their mental health just this semester. But that aside, I think the mental health of NUS architecture students are swirling at rock bottom. In your first two years, you’ll be that fool that will be like, “How many all-nighters you pulled for this?”, “I stayed up again to do this drawing”. Come the third year, suddenly the fatigue of sleep deprivation just starts to sink in and there come a point of time you realize how sluggish you’ve become. The work only increases in difficulty and demands up the years, so let me just be frank and say there will be no escape from the occasional sleeping late and all nighters, though lesser if you have good time management. In response to the depression situation in year 2, an established tutor actually came to speak with our studio and spent half the time bragging about how her achievements were attributed to good time management and how she have never pulled an all nighter. Seriously, bitch please, which era did you study in? Back in your days, softwares wasn’t that developed, and so was design. Times have changed at the present, and anyone with your mindset is headed for sure doom and a repeat semester. Even the poly students, which are known to be the “Gods” for their skillsets, are visibly struggling. Sometimes, I wish the department would stop spewing such bullshit and be more real and less delusional about the mental health of their students. It’s so easy to say stuff like “get more sleep” and brush it off, but you know that isn't the case. In this aspect, I wish the department would really be more serious about it if they truly care. We're not just workhorses for the ever-going supplementing of jaw-dropping graphics for your instagram feed you know. We're humans too. So, treat us like one instead of iterating things like how ""it's not gonna be any better in the working world"".

At this stage, I would like to say that architecture is not 100% just about bad stuff like the toxic slit throat culture, poor physical and mental health, and the non existent social work life balance. Because if it really was, no one with a rational train of thought would be taking it. As much as I hate these aspects of architecture in NUS, there are things which still fascinates me and sustain my passion, though reduced to embers over the years. I hate to say that your experience in NUS architecture will really be dependent on which tutor you get, but that is the truth that many of my friends can surely agree with. A terrible tutor will stress the hell out of you unreasonably or be too dumb to help you, but a good tutor will really inspire you and show you the world. Regardless, I felt that Architecture have really made me open my eyes and see the world, quite literally, in a new lens. Through your research, there will be times you have to dig into history, and that’s really one of the most amazing things you can empower yourself with in a world that’s ever-changing. It will make you want to travel to new places, and also the old places you’ve been to once again, to see the things with the new gained thoughts and perspectives gained in academia. And I think one of the best things about architecture, is that you’ll come to know a little bit of every field of study - like psychology, medicine, law, engineering, or even seemingly unrelated stuff like astrology or life science even - because these are the things that give you the ideas to be creative and break new grounds. The weekly consults will also imbue in you presentation and pitching skills, as well as the pre-mentioned time management skills to ensure all goes smoothly. Most importantly, I think Design Thinking in itself is one of the greatest takeaways you can ever receive. You’ll build up the courage to explore and repeat in pursue of success, and be hardened and open to even the harshest criticisms. These are soft skills which will accompany you far in life, even if you choose to leave the profession in the end. At the end of it all, I cannot guarantee that you will be that one shining starchitect ( a term used for world famous architects), but I can assure you that you will become courageous and easily adaptable to whatever the world out there throws out to you. Nonetheless, this is the pot of gold that lies at the end, though your path won’t be that of a rainbow but will instead be one cracking with flaming coals. Ultimately, it’s really about discovering what’s your calling ( so cliche, urgh!), and for those who already know, to challenge yourself to how far you can go. If you are in doubt, I think the worst thing that you can do is to not even try. A lifetime of looking back and “What if?” is truly sorrowful and real shameful, I think. To pull through it all requires strong conviction, but to leave it halfway is also by no means shameful nor disgraceful at all. My answer to those who are unsure - just jump in! Even if it’s not for you and eventually “waste one semester or two”, it’s not going to matter in the long scheme of things when you think about how long you actually have ahead of you. At the end of the day, it’s what you’ve learnt that really matters and not so much about the rat race. 

I actually intend to flame the curriculum more, but I think proceeding further would scare off all the architects-wanna-be, so I think I’ll hold back for now. Maybe, in another post. All in all, I hope the “real-ness” in this post is of benefit to whoever who is intending to pursue architecture in NUS, and at the same time, a ray of hope for a more enjoyable learning experience for my fellow friends struggling in this challenging course. Stay woke!",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/nxme9p/nus_archi_a_reflection/,"['Not an archi student, but this has been an interesting and honest exposé.  Your perseverance and takeaways are worth applauding. Respect!', 'Transferred out of archi aft y1 and it was honestly one of the best decisions I’ve ever made. Nevertheless, I don’t consider it as a year “wasted”, but rather a trial-and-error process that allowed me to explore a path that I thought I was seriously passionate about. I did learn a lot about the discipline and achieved personal growth through many unexpected instances along the way.', ""NUS archi alumni here. Personally, I'm kinda glad this post is getting a lot of traction since the toxic parts of work-life culture in archi is quite overpowering. So far, I've been on the three sides of being a student, working in practice and being a researcher/educator, so hopefully I can weigh in a bit to your post:\n\nNUS prepares students to enter the workforce and from experience, whatever you are facing now is a fraction of what is to come when you start practicing archi. It's definitely not a healthy environment, especially since you can't choose your colleagues, consultants or even clients. And I know many friends and peers who have moved to academia or govt authorities (e.g. URA, HDB, LTA) with better work-life balance, jumped to another design-related profession (e.g. theatre design, graphic design, art teacher) or have left the industry as a whole (e.g. fitness instructor, restaurant owner). \n\nPersonally, I feel that the problem stems from the nature of architecture design, where outputs can be evaluated both objectively and subjectively at the same time. For example, experienced professors can tell that a circulation layout is right/wrong on first glance, but will have split opinions on how they like/dislike the way a spatial environment is designed. Thus, as a student, it is easy to get confused on how tutors perceive your work, especially if they do not relay it clearly. \n\nThis confusion is propagated by how it is possible to constantly make design changes till the very last moment. This is particularly dangerous when coupled with a competitive culture (i.e. seeing your peers works and wanting to one-up them). I've seen peers getting depressed, undergo meltdowns etc. during studio because they're just not satisfied with what they produce...and ultimately don't show up for final crit or drop out because of it. \n\nWhat's worse is that students accept this culture for what it is and pass it down to future generations. From talking to other overseas students, practitioners, some nihilistic ones have chosen to accept it while the more jaded ones prefer to temper their expectations to dedicate more time to their friends/partners/family instead. \n\nFrankly, I feel that while it is good to push yourself as a student to learn and experience more,  this needs to be done in moderation and not go overboard. Archi education, to me, was like a 5 year long marathon with periodic 3-4 months of sprints. There will be times where you'll feel like dropping out, but just hang in there since it is quite the achievement of getting through. Some other pointers I want to share are:\n\n**(1) Work smart, not hard:**  \nDesign is never-ending and there's always room for exploration. But at the same time, plan what you want first before putting it on paper/computer. This will save you a lot of time in getting your designs out.\n\n**(2) If the tutor isn't being clear, take another approach:**  \nTutors sometimes flip-flop on what they expect to see. But ultimately, it is your design and how you choose to execute it. If you have a strong enough conviction as to why a design should be as such, let the tutor know and lead the conversation. Gaining this confidence early will help in convincing your clients/consultants/teammates in the future.  The last thing profs want to hear in a review is 'oh, my tutor told me to do so.' /facepalm\n\n**(3) Don't be stuck in the competition:**  \nIf your peers want to compare your model base material, fuck them. You do what you like and you do what you can...unless it's in a group work setting, then see point (4).\n\n**(4) Make it clear for group work:**  \nIf you're working with others, I find that it's best to highlight job scopes and decide on the design early. It's better to solve design-related issues earlier than waiting till the last moment during the model-making phase. Worst thing is to have you tanking the whole assignment at the final hour. \n\nWhile there are many more pointers, I think I'll stop here since the post is long enough already. Nonetheless, if you ever need someone to talk to about archi stuff, do let me know. Cheers and good luck!"", ""Hi OP! Haha I'm probably your batch mate and I'm taking a break while waiting for my repeat year after not completing design this year. I hope you are doing OK! I think my close friend is amongst the 4 friends you had in your y2 studio and though that friend probably wasn't the hardest hit and is much better now, the effects of that semester are definitely still felt. But yeah I loved how aptly you were able to put a lot of my sentiments towards the department into words. It's really sad that so many of us have had to deal with this or see those around us like this. \n\nIn my case it was strange because my depression and anxiety hit when stressful school work coincided with a difficult family situation. So I was never sure how much of what has happened to me can be attributed to school, though the very unforgiving pace and stressful environment definitely contributed to my detiororating mental health. This much I can say because I actually rediscovered my love for making things and designing only after taking this break from school and being able to do what I love at my own time in my own space... your reflection has helped me understand myself and my situation a little better... On why this part of me always I hated design school despite the joys I found in designing. For that, thank you.\n\nAlso, for those out there who are struggling, don't be afraid to seek help, repeat a year or even just do something else entirely. What's the point of finding success at the cost of being able to be happy? And what's w the rush to go out and work? Delaying grad isn't a bad thing given our covid economy too lol... And like in some of the other comments... Don't see repeated years or changing of courses as wasted time but rather see it as a process of self discovery. Better to waste a few years than to waste decades and wake up when you are 40 or 50 realising that you've wasted so much of your life away slogging for something you can't care less about.\n\nIf you however, are passionate about designing things... Stay happy and true to yourself! Trust your gut and make work/ buildings/ drawings that make the designer in you happy and proud... Even if its at the cost of making your tutor or crit board frown. Better to be in touch with your intuition and your own voice than to kill it for that short term recognition (don't be like me, I hated so many of my works and models that I destroyed them after each crit session - Drawings too). At the end of the day, grades aren't important to archi students or any design students anyways. They only look at your portfolio,the grades are only just a number. For that matter, any student... University is a place to go to to train your mind, to think, to write, to meet/ challenge and learn from other people. Go do that module that interests you to learn what you can and then just S/U them.\n\nI am quite proud to say that in my 3 years I managed to have quite a fun/ social/non-phantom life w my friends from various faculties despite being an archi student. It cost me a lot to maintain that tension of making time to hone my craft while stubbornly fighting and intentionally refusing to give up my life to studio at every turn... (quite a bit of grades, my portfolio, my reputation in the batch, many archi friends who stayed away because they may have thought I was wasting too much time goofing off - or cos most of the time I leave studio right after consult... , gave up sleep on some days where I started working only after coming back from spending time with my friends...). Do I regret any of these? Not really. In fact I was kind of happy I did things my way instead of being swept up in what I felt was an unhealthy culture. Was it worth it? Yeah it was to me, the memories, relationships, friendships, things I've learnt from my different friends and experiences I wouldnt have had if I sold my soul to studio... How can I call myself a designer if I can't even design and arrange the kind of life I want to live? We set the pattern for our working adult life in university. And the industry, economy, internship places, school, tutors (not all, some were q solid), culture at large will pressure you into a certain mould, so they can get you to be what they need you to be... A workhorse, a CADmonkey, free labour, etc etc... If nothing is done to lean against these forces, you'll only be dragged into the rat race. I'm writing these things down here in a public space so that I can keep myself Accountable when I return to school.... That despite the pressure faced and drudgery of Design school, I'll be able to keep my head up high and not get sucked back into this unhealthily competitive/cut throat culture. To become a designer that doesn't give up his ability to design his own life, even if it means going against the grain, sticking out etc... . I pray my recovery will give me the mental tenacity to do that and be that kind of person :)\n\nWishing you atb OP! Thanks so much once again for sharing your reflection... Its helped me in mine :)"", '[deleted]', ""Based on my observations and interactions with friends, this pretty much reflects the general sentiments of NUS archi students. Coming from poly background, I have to admit that the learning curve for non-poly students is very steep and it takes a lot of rigour to keep up with the production demand of studio, especially in upper years.\n\nThe culture of working long hours also need to be addressed, not only in academia but in the industry. Learning to work efficiently takes a lot of effort to reflect on your workflow and learning from others. Most students spend painfully long hours doing a particular task that could be efficiently done with the same results in lesser time. I have friends who do amazing work and still maintain a consistent sleep schedule, and I learn a lot from the way they work. \n\nI personally find healthy competition help to drive my projects further, especially among my circle of friends. It is not the toxic kind of competition where we hide things from each other but we strive to do our best for our project and also share tips, tricks and knowledge among each other, working as a collective, criticising/supporting each other's ideas, which further contributes to the learning. I can't speak of toxic tutors as I've been lucky enough not to encounter any so far, but I know of friends who have such tutors and it does have an impact on their mental and emotional well-being for the semester.\n\nMental health is definitely a growing issue, and what I see is that it is mostly attributed to tutors and worry over weekly production/grades. This sem however I had a very supportive & patient tutor, yet I still had studio mate who suffered from anxiety attack because they had difficulty in keeping up with producing the work needed every week especially at the level that was expected of an upper year student. More support can definitely be given by the department in this regard, but maintaining a close group of friends that you can talk to about your projects, and looking out for each other's well-being also helps.\n\nGiven that the grade system, toxic tutors, studio culture & pedagogy is likely to not change any time soon, can improvement to the learning environment be initiated by us to make studios and learning more conducive to overall mental/emotional/physical well being, to make the best out of our creative pursuits?"", 'finally someone who summarises my exact sentiments well. thank u.', 'Let’s just say I feel u bro - from jesus.', 'Good info mate, which is why I’m personally pursuing a route in stock and forex trading on the side whilst continuing my archi course.

But from what I know, I think industrial design is more wholesome...? Like in their curriculum I heard they actually get to learn softwares like rhino as a full length semester project, but for us archi kids we had to learn everything ourselves so that adds to the stress too. Maybe my fellow friends from ID can chip in? Haha"", ""I think this is more the case for design courses like Industrial Design (ID) and Architecture. While my friends in Real Estate (RE) and Project Facilities management (PFM) will by no means say their courses are a piece of cake, the type and nature of stresses they face is very different and very much more like other more typical courses you'd find in NUS that involve more examinations than projects. ID and Archi are almost 100% project/ presentation based courses which makes them q different. Idk much about ID but I do know that they have a much smaller cohort size and each person works on something quite different altogether (not for every semester... Correct me if I'm wrong) so that does change a bit of the studio culture in that direct competition is hard. Also, they work on several small projects together while architecture kids (if they haven't changed the syllabus, which they keep doing since SUTD came up), tend to work mainly on 1 to 2 big ones. From our discussions, we've agreed that the result of that is that the baseline stress of ID from week 0 to 13 is higher than Archi but it stays relatively stable throughout the week and semester , whereas in Archi it is characterized by rly high stress points followed by small dips before rising again... It stress and workload usually gets exponentially higher before each consult and even crazier in the recess week to final week period. Another thing my ID friend raised was that when it comes to employment, Architecture students worry about stiff competition from one another cos there're so many strong portfolios out there (it's so oversaturated) fighting for more or less the same role, ID students on the other hand are stressed because they need to pitch and sell themselves to companies that v often don't have a specific role for them. So the type of stress is quite different. For a while there was the UI/UX thing and there's also always product design but yeah beyond that... For a lot of companies aesthetics and good design isn't one of their main priorities so ID grads can at times find it hard to convince these stakeholders of their value-adding skills in the same way most designers do but to a higher degree due to the lack of a specified role. School culture wise, like OP said, they seem very wholesome and cooperative.

I already considered dropping out in Y1S1 but somehow lasted another 5 semesters. (tho in taking a gap Yr rn).\n\nI'd say a few things:\n1. Architecture major doesn't equal to architect.\n- working in an architectural firm will help you to realise that it's very different from school.\n- It may be more helpful to see NUS Archi as a design course in general and a stepping stone to help you learn more about what kind of design you like (if you decide you still like designing things in general). You are right when you say that there are many design-related fields out there. Don't limit your career path to just being an architect. \n\n2. The salary isn't great, especially given the hours you have to put in. Throw that consideration out of the window now. It will not be enough to sustain you through the grind. \n- While there are some professions that are more stable is no such thing as a 100% safe profession. It is subject to the free market forces of demand and supply. If you don't like design at all then just do something else. \n- Many years ago, Singapore was promoting life sciences but then eventually changed paths, leaving many who just followed the national narrative struggling in what they soon found to be a sunset industry. Law and med used to be so called safe... But with recent changes like oversaturation/ old specialist professionals not retiring, they are losing their edge to computing majors. A while ago UI/UX was booming but now its also oversaturated alr in most of the developed world. \n- With the uncertainty and ever-increasing disruption that is to come, it is better to not hedge your bets on what you think will pay well but rather what you are good at and what makes you happy. Something as subjective as design is especially affected.\n\n3. If you like design, ask yourself what kind of design you like to do and find yourself a mentor. That'll probably help you make a more informed and nuance decision. Many older people in the different fields are very willing and keen to help out younger ones if you are teachable, sincere and reach out. Not all, but quite a lot are... Especially if you connect with them at events or school presentations etc etc. Not all, but quite a lot. Especially if you participate/help out/ show genuine interest through any other means. Especially as a university student. Just note that they are busy, working professionals so be eager to learn but just try not to be too clingy. Once you lose your status as a student and become and employee, a lot of this changes. So make full use of your being a student to learn not just in school but from these places who for now see you as such and not as a competitor."", ""hello! \n\nFor considerations, work-life balance is definitely one of the key priorities. It's quite problematic when you see yourself earning less than your friends in other jobs but spending significantly more time than them. This is more so when you're planning to start a family. Other aspects also include leaving a toxic work environment (e.g. can't leave until the boss leaves and boss leaves at 12mn.) or not getting enough fulfilment from the job. \n\nFor preparations, I would say it's not so much of an issue getting a job after graduation as there are opportunities around. Legally, archi is a profession that is not allowed to advertise, which might be one of the reasons why people in practice go back to schools to teach. Being noticed by your tutor (who has his/her own firm), makes it easier to be recruited into his/her firm after graduation, especially if you make a positive impression. \n\nGlad you're taking into account all these before you make a choice. For me, even though the education was tough, I find archi to be quite beneficial to personal development. It's less about memorising equations but more about observing, finding and applying new ways to tackle real-life problems."", 'Almost all RE mods have projects too on top of exams but its definitely less stressful than archi.', 'Are you from archi?

FruitCrisps,ng4413,Regarding provision of pay slips to prospective employers…,2021-05-19 20:11:36,askSingapore,44675,48,115,"This is a follow up to an earlier post… 
 
TLDR:
1. Interviews went well (multiple rounds done but more to go)
2. Recruiter asked for 3 year payslip when I asked to fast track the process (not sure if the employer needed it or the request came from the recruiter himself)
3. I refused
4. Recruiter called on separate occasions to convince / guilt trip me to provide 
5. I refused 
6. Interviews completed 
7. Conditional offer came in today. Don’t think the figure will be as high if I provided my slips. 

Just want to say thanks to those who provided inputs earlier. 

And don’t spoil employers and the labour market by obediently providing pay slips.

Plus, it is probably more efficient for them to close your case and move on to the next candidate. 2 times slightly lower commission is still higher than one slightly higher commission.\n\nUs candidates will have to be aware that recruiters are fundamentally salespersons.

It could be possible but I think it is a bit counterproductive for the employer. Most employers who use recruiters want to find the right candidate, and are not likely to just go for the cheapest candidate. Plus they can already control the process by not offering a higher salary."", 'That’s insightful. Thanks.\n\n15%-20%… that’s a lot man.

Mikeferdy,mpcl0o,"Just a reminder National Service is not just for ""2 years"", technically, NS obligation is up to the age of 50.",2021-04-12 20:15:18,singapore,378960,434,705,"A recent thread have bring to light that not many people understand the true nature of National Service obligations, brushing it as ""just 2 years only"". Obviously those posts got a lot of downvote. It kinda show that there is a demographic on r/sg that don't know the true extent of NS obligations. The 2 years full time NS is simply the tip of the iceberg. There is more to come.

I am not an expert on this but I will try to highlight everything I know so far. If anyone find anything wrong with this, feel free to point them out coz things keep changing internally without it being a widely publicized knowledge. I served with SPF so I have some blind spots on SCDF and SAF practices.

&#x200B;

After an NSF completes his 2 years of full time National Service, he has reached is ORD (Operationally Ready Date) and has transition from an NSF to an Operationally Ready National Serviceman (ORNS or NSmen).

[https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/site/mindef/prepare-for-orns/info?filter=mindef-nsf](https://www.ns.sg/nsp/portal/site/mindef/prepare-for-orns/info?filter=mindef-nsf)

Upon reaching ORD, you are NOT to discard your uniform or equipment because you will still need them to complete your ORNS obligations for [10 Financial year](https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/orns/overview-orns/orns-training-cycle) (depending on SAF, SPF or SCDF). For SPF, a financial year starts on 1st of April and ends on the 31st of March. For the FY, you are to complete the following ORNS obligations:-

1. [In Camp Training](https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/orns/overview-orns/types-orns-activities) (ICT - at least 7 High Key). A high key ICT refers to 7 or more days of ICT and a low key ICT refers to 6 days or less. For SPF, it usually means either 2 weeks of patrol duty or 3 weeks of office hours duty.
2. Your Annual Shoot. You are to complete AND pass your Annual Shooting Test. For SPF, you will be recalled to HTA for 1 day on a weekday for your shooting test. If you passed, you have completed your shooting obligation for the FY. If you get marksman, you will receive an additional $200 bonus. If you fail, depending on your division, you can either be barred from arms or you will be recalled again for another shooting test which means another recall on another weekday. Further failure might mean attending a shooting clinic where they will try to get you to pass, again all on a weekday so you are incentivize to pass on your first try to avoid clashing with your working day.
3. Your Individual Physical Proficiency Test [IPPT](https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/ippt-nsfit/ippt/overview-ippt/format). You are to complete and pass your IPPT to complete your ORNS obligation. IPPT consists of 3 stations, Push ups, Sit ups and a 2.4km run. You will need a minimum 51 points to pass your IPPT. You can refer to [this sheet](https://www.ns.sg/nsp/wcm/connect/9e1e31dc-cc14-46f1-83b2-3246fe2f8bbf/New+IPPT+Format+and+Scoring+System+for+Hometeam.pdf?MOD=AJPERES) for a break down of the point system. If you cannot pass your IPPT, you are to complete 20 Remedial Training or the new 10 NS FIT program.
4. Other recalls. Officially, your unit can recall you for **UP TO 40 DAYS** per financial year. For SPF, this usually mean recalls for Major events like National Day or similar large events. Others could mean recalls for ""training courses"" which your unit will require your attendance for.

Other responsibilities include:

1. Updating your unit of changes to your contact details, handphone number, email address and home address. Every time you change your handphone number, you MUST update your unit, either by calling them up, emailing them or through NSportal.
2. Apply for an [exit permit](https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/overseastravel/article/duration-6-months-or-more/applying-for-exit-permit) if you are leaving Singapore for more than 6 months AND wait for their approval.
3. Up keep your equipment, making sure your uniform are in good condition and any missing equipment must be bought from emart or indent from your NS department PRIOR to any recall.

Now this is important. FAILURE to turn up for any of these recall is AWOL which is a chargeable offence. Even if you did turn up, FAILING to complete IPPT/RT or Shooting is considered disobedience of order which is a chargeable offence. FAILING to upkeep your uniform and turning up to recall with missing equipment is considered disobedience of order which is a chargeable offence. FAILING to update your unit on any updates to your contact is a chargeable offence. Leaving Singapore for more than 6 months, eg: working/studying/staying overseas without an approved exit permit is a chargeable offence.

All offence matters will be referred to the Provost unit which are empowered by the [Criminal Procedure Code](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010#pr1-). Upon committing a chargeable offence the Provost Officer may ORDER you to turn up for investigation under [Section 21](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010?ProvIds=P1IV-#pr21-) of the CPC, usually on a weekday on office hours. Though very unlikely, failure to turn up may lead to a warrant of arrest. If you have some sort of excuse like for medical reason or work related matter, the Provost Officer can ORDER you to produce the supporting document under [Section 20](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CPC2010?ProvIds=P1IV-#pr20-) of the CPC and you are to bore any costs of producing said documents under Subsection 6 of the same code. Provost Officers also have the power to turn up at your place of residence or even at your place of employment to look for you if you are a no show. Just imagine working in your office when suddenly Provost Officers turn up at your office. If you are overseas without an exit permit, if the provost unit sent a warrant for your arrest, you may be arrested upon returning to Singapore.

Basically, even though this is technically not a criminal offence, they have the power to treat you like a criminal.

Punishment for any of the above may include demotion in rank, reduction in payout, fines and of course, time in the detention barracks. None of these are considered criminal records.

In short, you are held to a lot of strict SAF, SPF and SCDF standards for the next 10 Financial Year.

&#x200B;

Now after completing 10 FY of ORNS obligations, you will be [phasing to MR](https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/orns/completion-of-orns/phasing-into-mr) or ROD. Most people would be over 30 years old by this time. Upon reach MR or ROD, you are basically placed in a reserved pool where you will no longer be called up for IPPT and complete any ORNS obligations.

HOWEVER, you are still considered still serving your National Service and by right need to apply for exit permit when leaving Singapore for more than 6 months. While in reality, no one will be looking for you after you ROD, you are still legally considered a reserved NSmen and may be called up if the stars, moons and planets align.

&#x200B;

You are finally considered an Ex-NSmen upon reaching the [age of 50 and 40 for Officer and WOSE respectively](https://www.ns.sg/web/portal/nsmen/home/nstopics/orns/article/completion-of-orns/reaching-statutory-age) where you can finally officially dispose all of your equipment and uniform.

There is never any threat about getting charged for falling out during IPPT and leaving your test incomplete. In fact, now instructors actively **encourage** you to fall out if you think are unfit. They don\'t want anyone collapsing and dying. They get it that some people are just turning up to take attendance, and not complete the test. \n\nNS is a burden, but complaining about it 10 years after you served full time NS (as with the other thread) is just toxic and a bad mindset to have.

hodlnautwallet,nait09,A 'How To' Guide on Cryptocurrency in Singapore: For beginners looking to invest in Crypto,2021-05-12 15:15:57,singaporefi,19171,120,278,"I see several questions on this subreddit with regards to **Cryptocurrency** being asked at least once every day. These questions pertain to the topics of:

* Where and how to buy Crypto?
* Which platforms to use?
* Why some platforms have only so few coins? How like that?!
* How to transfer Crypto?
* Why are transaction fees for BTC/ETH so high, **how do I avoid it?**
* What are some investing strategies?
* Got risk a not? Are my funds safe?
* How to detect and sniff out scams and also secure your crypto? - impersonation, phishing, 'giveaways'
* How to earn more from my crypto?

Questions are not ranked according to the order of importance nor are they ranked to which is asked the most. It is just from observations and my experience answering questions this past month. I hope to provide an ELI5 guide to help beginners who are coming into this new world of Cryptocurrency and to hopefully make it a less painful experience for you.

**1. Where and how to buy Crypto?**

Firstly, before we get into knowing 'Where and how to buy Crypto', you need to understand that Cryptocurrency comes in many different tokens, just like fiat comes in USD, SGD, MYR, GBP, etc. Bitcoin is used loosely to describe Cryptocurrency because it was the first digital currency to come into existence. There are several other currencies like Ethereum, Cardano, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash... But I will not go into details.

So, where and how do you buy Crypto?

For beginner's sake, I will be focusing mainly on platforms readily available here because that is the easiest way to obtain Cryptocurrency. Below are some of the exchanges/platforms that are widely used in Singapore and are very beginner-friendly (with guides, FAQs and the like). Note that **you need to pass KYC** for a majority of these exchanges before you are allowed to purchase due to compliance and regulatory laws - sometimes not of Singapore's nature. This is the where:

* Binance Singapore
* Coinhako
* Crypto.com
* Gemini
* Binance (Worldwide)
* Kucoin
* Coinbase
* Kraken exchange

Now, you noticed that there are 2 Binance listed on top, I will go into further detail later.

The how is below (methods are pretty much the same across all platforms, please correct if I am wrong and I am happy to make edits)

* Bank direct deposit/transfer
* SWIFT Remit
* Credit/debit card
* Using crypto to buy crypto
* P2P (won't be covered here)

**2. Which platform to use for us Singaporeans, and how to deposit + fees involved? (not inclusive of debit/credit card cause high fees)**

NOTE: Do take note on the regulation on Xfers with regards to withdrawal limits, by MAS [here](https://xfershelp.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360038312651-New-Limits-to-your-Xfers-Wallet-starting-from-22nd-Jan-2020-under-the-new-Payment-Services-Act).

From my personal experiences, these are the platforms below that support direct bank deposit with SGD and/or **Xfers:**

* Binance Singapore (Xfers with bank deposit)

Advantages: Temasek got invest lor, so can trust our gahmen's foresight. Lower fees than Coinhako. Simple UI/UX. 0.6% buying/selling fee considered one of the lowest. Established company.

Disadvantages: Very few coin offerings. No app. KYC is very troublesome. Only buying and selling, no integration with main Binance

* Coinhako (Xfers and bank deposit)

Advantages: 1% buying/selling fee, can be reduced with reward points to 0.75-0.8%. Does their best to bring new coin offerings every now and then. Can use reward points to redeem free crypto (but you need to make a trade during the last 30 days to do so)

Disadvantages: deposit with Xfers, 0.55% fee charged on deposit, use bank deposit free, but only processed at 10 AM and 4 PM on business days. Almost non-existent customer service team. Tends to crash during major news events.

* Crypto.com (Xfers direct deposit)

Advantages: More than 100+ coins that you trade. Have a crypto cashback card. Have a DeFi wallet ([what is this?](https://crypto.com/defi-wallet)). Launched mainnet 2 months ago. ([what is this?](https://coincentral.com/what-is-a-mainnet/)). Have an exchange to do trading. Have staking options to earn interest on your crypto. Solid app interface.

Disadvantages: SG onboarding is stopped at the moment. Many have experienced high spread here. Customer service is very slow, but they do their best to reply - so can be an advantage? Tends to crash during major news.

* Gemini (Xfers direct deposit)

Advantages:  Gemini now has sgd eth / BTC pairing and with 10 free withdrawals. Also, all I know is that KYC was a breeze because it is integrated with SingPass, and they have passed a majority of MAS's digital payment services license even though they are in Singapore shorter than Coinhako is. Solid and simple app interface as well. Users have stated to use Active Trader instead due to 'acceptable' fees. Other Redditors, feel free to contribute!

Disadvantages:  High fees for small value purchases. e.g, buying $100 worth of BTC incurs $4 fees. Other than that, low liquidity on coin pairings resulting in the high spread.

Then, this begs the question: But I want to trade meme coins like SHIBA! I want to do mining! I want to be able to do much more! How like that?! What other platforms?

* Binance (Worldwide), the biggest exchange/trading platform in the world that offers a multitude of services you can utilize, with close to 1000 coin pairs offered.
* There are many other exchanges/platforms out there like Binance, but I will just focus on Binance for newbies today.

This brings us to the next question...

**3. How to transfer Crypto to exchanges like Binance?**

My favourite, low-fee but a little bit arduous method that I always preach and that be done within one hour:

* Depositing:

\- Deposit through [Binance.sg](http://binance.sg/)/Coinhako/Gemini/Crypto.com through bank/xfers

\- Buy XRP/XLM/TRON/LTC/BCH or NEO (0% fees!) and send it over to [Binance.com](http://binance.com/). The coins listed have transaction fees lower than $5 and are almost instantaneous.

\- Sell XRP for USDT and then buy whatever coins I want. Why? If you are not looking to trade immediately, USDT is a stablecoin ([what is this?](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stablecoin.asp)) that offers stability in the volatility of the crypto market.

* Withdrawing:

Reverse engineer the method above.

You will be questioning then: ""Why must do this? SOOOOO TROUBLESOME! Why can't I send BTC/ETH straight away?!"" or ""Just buy using card la! Or use SWIFT REMIT!"". Bringing us to the next question.

**4. Why are transaction fees for BTC/ETH so high, how do I avoid it?**

You can, no problem. But remember that this is a guide for newbies and we are making it a less painful experience for you.

BTC/ETH are subject to high miners' fees at the moment. Sending $10 worth of BTC over, you would need to pay close to $50 in miners' fees. Same fees for larger transactions. For ETH, you need to pay $20-25 per txn depending on the time of day. Paying $20 to send $20 is ridiculous don't you think?

Also, SWIFT REMIT and purchases through card are subject to foreign exchange fees, remit fees and even card fees which would bring an initial $1000 deposit down to $950, do you want that? - EDIT 3: A user has pointed out DBS Swift fees to be $0. However, funds take 2-3 days to be in! Trade-off is time in a very volatile market.

**5. What are some investing strategies in Crypto for beginners?**

For beginners, I always like to use the DCA method. You can always reference a guide to investing as well - don't have to be solely focused on Crypto. I have a handy guide [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n94lms/i_am_scared_as_a_nonshitcoin_investor/gxm6ccc/?context=3) which I posted on r/CryptoCurrency which you can refer to.

**6. Got risk a not? Are my funds safe?**

As with all others, there is always a risk to investing. Low risk is also risk. You have to determine your risk profile to understand how ready you are to invest in crypto.

>As always quoted in the crypto community: ""Not your keys, not your crypto!"".

To mitigate risk, remember to diversify your funds and not keep everything in one place. I can't guarantee a platform is 100% safe because even the government is subject to data breaches. You can keep yourself safe by staying knowledgeable and understanding the industry through DYOR, DYOR, DYOR!

**7. How to detect and sniff out scams and also secure your crypto?**

FIRST RULE OF THUMB - DO NOT RECEIVE OR RESPOND TO ANY DMs FROM STRANGERS!

Keep your wallet/seed phrase only to yourself, and keep checking and validating that a site is legit before connecting any wallets to the site, like Metamask! There are a lot of scams promoting 'giveaways'. If it is too good to be true, it usually is.

Remember! 2FA is extremely important to secure your accounts! Google Authenticator, Authy and/or a hardware security key are important to secure your crypto assets.

**8. How to earn more from my crypto?**

Now comes the juicy part. Besides buying and selling crypto, there are a variety of options where you can increase your crypto stack and even earn a 'passive income' from. These options are:

* Interest earning platforms like Gemini, Blockfi, Nexo and Hodlnaut (yes us! Join our subreddit at r/hodlnaut) where you deposit your crypto with these platforms, they lend out/invest these assets like a bank, and give you a favourable interest rate after taking profits
* Staking to validate transactions. Coins like ETH require you to stake your assets to validate transactions on the network, and you get paid a percentage of the fees to do so. There is the main ETH network where if you have [32 ETH and above](https://ethereum.org/en/eth2/staking/), you can contribute to a node.
* DeFi Protocols. These are crazy mechanisms that can see you hitting more than 100-200% APY on your funds invested. However, they are extremely subjective to this term called '[Impermanent loss](https://finematics.com/impermanent-loss-explained/)' and also always under the scrutiny of hackers.
* There are many other ways that you can earn from, but these are some of the most widely known methods currently

To conclude, I hope that this nifty guide goes a long way to helping people new to crypto understand questions that are asked again and again in this subreddit. I am open to making any edits if I have made any mistakes in my post above, so do leave a comment below if you spot it.

Additionally, if you have additional information you would like to contribute, let me know too!

Is this normal?"", '[removed]', ""Just mentioning that the suggested method of transferring crypto to Binance.com/other exchanges by buying XRP/XLM/TRON/LTC/BCH, transferring it for low fees and selling it for stablecoins after is also not without its own risks, as the transaction will still take some time, and these coins tend to be much more volatile than BTC or ETH. If the price decides to go down while you are still waiting for the transaction to go through, you are essentially making a losing trade that could lose you more than if you transferred via BTC/ETH and just ate the bigger transfer fees.\n\nThere is a improvement for this process though, if you already have some capital on the other exchange. For example, lets say you are sending from [Binance.sg](https://Binance.sg) to [Binance.com](https://Binance.com):\n\n1. Buy XRP/XLM/TRON/LTC/BCH on [Binance.sg](https://Binance.sg)\n2. Using existing USDT on [Binance.com](https://Binance.com) as collateral, immediately margin sell the same amount of that coin there.\n3. Transfer your coins from .sg to .com and pay off your margin debt\n\nThis way you can minimise the amount of time you are exposed to the volatile coin. In fact, since the prices on .sg and .com are not always exactly in sync, you might even be able to pick up a little arbitrage profit.\n\nAlso, you can do step 2 with leverage so that you don't need nearly as much USDT collateral for the same transfer amount, but be careful you don't liquidate."", ""If I wish to buy altcoins on Binance, is there a difference between using Gemini ActiveTrader to transfer to Binance, and using Binance SG to transfer to Binance?

tom48480,o653ph,Seeking advice on signing on,2021-06-23 12:02:25,NationalServiceSG,11091,10,12,"Hi, I am currently an NSF here to seek some advice regarding signing on. Due to my father’s old age, I hope to earn an income way earlier than people my age, so to support him in some ways, down the road. Furthermore, the financial situation in the family is not really fantastic. Despite the fact that I don’t think I will fit the regimental lifestyle well, I am pretty firm on signing on.

My original plan is to get posted to OCS, and sign on normally under the enhanced officer scheme and see how from there. Unfortunately, I am now posted to OES, ordnance engineering school, which is really not my cup of tea. I need the officer rank in order to get officer pay which is much higher compared to a spec, so I feel forced to sign on under the military expert scheme, in order to get the officer pay. I am an art stream A level grad. I really want to re-vocate to either CBRD or EOD or to the RSAF, to have more pay and a more chill life. I am asking whether is it possible to revocate completely now? Or must I wait till after I sign on? And can I still qualify for OCS and wait to see how things turn out from there?",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/o653ph/seeking_advice_on_signing_on/,"['yes it’s actually possible. when you first request to sign on, they’ll offer every single choice possible, so even now, you can still sign on as an officer. but do take note that EOD and CBRD is under combat engineer and you won’t get full choice on which you go', 'Just to understand, did you qualify for command school aft bmt? Im not sure if its still possible for you to qualify for OCS rn. Also if regimentation isn’t a good fit for you, I would recommend not to sign on even though you’re pretty firm on signing on as over the long run, you may face certain situations due to the nature of the organisation. \n\nAlso there’s no chill life as a working adult like it or not. Your career progression will highly depend on your performance and ippt etc. \n\nAlso, I think its only possible to revocate after your ord. Had a fellow MP spec who signed on as pilot trainee during his NS and he only went to OCS towards the end of his 2 years.', ""Depending on your past BMT performance, and also your A level result, and whether you have already secured a place in local or overseas university, and your PES status.  \n\nYou should talk to the people at Mndef career center, and if they think you meet prerequisite, then I believe you can re-BMT to make your way into OCS.  But with a risk, as in case if you still don't make it, then you're back to where you are.  as contract will only be offered if you qualify, but then, can get revoked if you don't commissioned.  Hence, you should ask about all the fine print.\n\nFor good salary, but not sure about chill life which can be very subjective depending on individual, you can explore MDES with the C4x which pays up to $5K+ for starting salary, but that is provided you have or will be taking up relevant degree courses, ie, computer science, Engineering etc.."", 'I am trying to understand your motivations for signing on. So you want to earn more than your peers whilst having a ""more chill life""? If you have this kind of mindset, you won\'t get far in the army. I worked with tons of regulars in HQ and in a training institute. You need passion, long term effort and a very strong will to be a regular in the army. Unless of course you wanna hentak kaki as a CPT until you are in your early 40s. Just like any other job, there are responsibilities and the annual performance review.\n\nIf you wanna make big bucks right now, i could point you in the direction of my uni coursemate. He makes big bucks selling muscle worship vids on onlyfans. Paid his fees fully and could even afford a merc to drive around. Of course it isn\'t as simple as filming yourself. You gotta workout to get huge. It takes effort too.', ""As a regular who has been in service for quite a while, I feel that you need more to convince others and ultimately yourself that this career is gonna be worthwhile for you. I've seen countless officers and specialists ER (early release) during the various stages in their career for various reasons. Right now, I sense that you're hoping to have an early headstart compared to your peers in terms of career and financial freedom. Nothing wrong with that I would say, however I don't find those reasons *desperate* enough for you to be firm on signing on. Especially when you mentioned that you're not so inclined towards a regimented lifestyle. Another point that I would like you to consider is the expectations of being an officer. Of course there's officer postings which are relatively more lepak in the sense, but most postings would require long hours, weekend burnt, and the necessary sacrifices. Furthermore, the 9 months in OCS would take a toil on you if you're just hoping to earn your keep with the bare minimum effort. If you're hoping to just be another brain dead regular who's just there to receive your pay on the 10th of every month, do the bare minimum just for the band 3- performance review to stay in the force, and ultimately maybe get a MAJ rank if you're lucky by the time you retire, I would not say anymore.

But do keep in mind that university courses require different subject requisites so do keep a look out on the websites under course prerequisites or subject prerequisites. e.g. NUS Med requires H2 Chem+(H2 Phy or H2Bio) or NTU Physics required H2 Math AND H2 Physics.\n\n1. Always have H2 Math if not H1 Math as Math is pretty much a prerequisite for a lot of courses, excluding Arts.\n\n2. Take H2 Physics is a good idea but do note, you need to pair H2 Physics with H2 Math. Also, if you hate practicals, would recommend taking H1 Physics(putting it here since you seem like you want to take an arts combi. Just note that a lot of engineering courses would require Physics but some would prefer just having H1 Physics or O level Physics so it really depends.)\n\n3. Since you like Lit and Chinese, I would recommend H2 CLL(Chinese Language and Literature) P.s. only got H2 no H1.\n\nPutting this one since H2 Translation requires BOTH English and Chinese AND it is a back up plan in case you cannot enter NYJC and you enter a JC which doesn't offer translation(but to be fair JPJC has translation from what I have heard) whereas CLL requires you to fully use Chinese.\n\n4. GP and H1 GSC. Yea I don't really know the details of this one but basically it is like GP but in Chinese.\n\nSo if I were to list it out, it would be PMTL but if let's say you want to drop to 3H2, then it would be MTLp or PMTl either one could suit you. And if translation cannot, would recommend CLL.\n\nBUT do not take my word for it, this is just a suggestion. Do look out for the uni course requisites as mentioned earlier as well as the JC website to look at the requirements to take that subject. \n\nAs for whether each subject is easy or hard, well... that depends on the person taking it."", '>(that’s if my l1r5 can make it to JC)  \n>  \n>im hoping to be able to go to NYJC\n\nNYJC is the third hardest JC to get into (fourth if you include ACS IB).\n\n>\\- I used to hate both sciences but I’m starting to like physics so im considering to take h2 phy (I heard the curriculum is hard tho)!

Then check the subject pre-requisites for the respective courses.\n\nSounds like you would like a hybrid combination: H2 Physics, H2 Maths, H2 Economics and H2 Literature.

I did not calculate any of my sciences into my L1R5 so I got a single digit L1R5 in the end.

I can attest to the other comment here because I was one of those students coming as early and staying as late as the grad students (7pm) esp coming near to the end of my project. I did my project during covid sem when NUS suddenly turned online and zoom lectures were not established yet so I had the advantage of rearranging my revision and lecture videos ie I would use Mondays to start off my long expts so all my Mon lectures were watched on some other free days, lectures that were released on wednsday will be watched on the weekends etc etc. I made it a point to consistently stick to the schedule too so that helped me to manage 4 mods and UROPs.\n\nWith that, I believe that 5 mods and urops is manageable depending on the nature of the mod, your timetable planning, your lab schedule and your willpower.

However, if any of the 5 mods are particularly heavy workload ie CS type, then it is def not advisable. LSM mods wise, you have to be wary about the assessment requirements esp for lab based mods. all the best!"", ""Hi! Am currently a Y4 life sciences student doing FYP. I've done UROPS in the past and the above advices are all true - please don't torture yourself by doing 5 mods + UROPS. I've had a friend who did that and he basically has very little time for lab and ended up staying till 2am once to rush out assays nearing the end of his project, so my advice is really to organize your schedule properly! Take 4 mods, and ensure you at least have 1 free day (best case scenario) to plan for multiple experiments on the day. As an undergrad you won't be allowed to the lab on weekends, so planning out your experiments is important! When I did UROPS, I did a 2-sem long one and I took 4 mods in both sems and it really helped with scheduling and doing experiments. \n\nUltimately, if you want to do FYP or research in the future, being able to do well for research projects and getting a good grade is very helpful, hence why you should spend more time in lab during your UROPS. No point sacrificing your results and quality of data in order to do more mods imo. \n\nHave fun! UROPS is challenging but an invaluable experience. Any other lab mod you do will basically be a cakewalk after you're done (not shaming any mods or anything haha)."", 'Is anyone taking lsm2233 cell biology this semester?

Because I’m trying to clear my minor requirements as well that needs 3k mods.', 'ah i dont want to sound like a doomer but lab for me was like having a FT job (based on the time i spent in lab) + juggling modules together ;_; \n\nlooking at the list of the modules u have stated under another comment, i feel that lsm2233 and sp1541 are quite time consuming (in terms of the regular commitment required over the sem) while lsm2191 is quite heavy during the report submission season. i rly dont want to sound discouraging but it seems like q a heavy workload to me. \n\nbut yes, as the other comment as stated, discipline is important (and i am admittedly not the most disciplined person ahaha) so 5 mods + urops might be manageable for u if u are disciplined. or maybe u can consider trying this combi out first, with plans to drop one mod in case u find that the workload gets too heavy over the sem? :"")', 'CBIS. may I know what specialisation r u in? And at which lab r u doing ur fyp??', ""I did my UROPS in Y1S2-Y2S1. It depends on the 3k mods that you're taking. In general, I feel that the workload for LSM3k and 4k mods arent as heavy as the 1k and 2k mods (doesn't apply for all mods, depending on which mods you're taking) but in general imo thats the case. I assume you're doing the 3k UROPS? In such a case then I think its still fine if you plan your schedule in such a way where you can maximize your time in lab. Usually if you're doing a 2-sem UROPS, starting in sem 2 is always the go-to because you can use your 3-month break in summer to gather additional data, optimize experiments, etc. But since you're going to Y3 that's not possible too. \n\nAnyways tl;dr is imo its fine as long as you can maximize the amount of time you can spend in lab and handle your workload."", 'lemme pm u!']"
peachytafffy,o7lbi2,Cat advice needed,2021-06-25 18:53:07,askSingapore,44675,8,10,"Thinking of adopting a cat (stray) but have some questions in mind. Cat owners, would appreciate your advice please! 

1) What is the average first time vet cost?
2) Cat is a little dirty, is it ok to give it a shower? Else, how do you handle it?
3) How much do you spend monthly on cat items (food, litter etc)?
4) Any food and litter brand recommendations?
5) What do you guys do when you travel? (Besides family and friends)",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/o7lbi2/cat_advice_needed/,"['1. Vet costs can vary widely. Certain vets, such as Clinic for Pets near Paya Lebar, are much cheaper but only provide basic care. \n\n2. Cats don’t usually like baths and do self-cleaning, but if she looks dirty, she may need one with a cat-safe shampoo. You can also get pet wipes (don’t use baby wipes) and might avoid the trauma of the bath.\n\nI’ve been feeding mine Zealandia canned food and Iams dry food. You can get iams from Amazon for a lot less than in pet stores. I give canned food in the morning and at night.\n\nI usually have my flatmates watch my cats while I’m away. You can hire pet sitters. Cats don’t like being boarded, but there are places offering it', ""1. Depends, if it's just check up or sterilization cost. What's the gender of your pet cat? Cost more to sterilized a female cat due to being under anesthesia and pet stay a day or two, even more if there's complications. You can try SPCA clinic but you might need to make an appointment and will be under review, but it's lower pricing.\n2. You're allowed to shower your cat, just buy proper feline shampoos from any pet shop or supermarket nearby. Don't shower them unnecessarily, they usually self groom.\n3. I've three felines,  oldest one is 15years old, so I'd usually buy in bulk that last me 3 months plus. Dry food ( biscuits )cost me around $140 ( 10kg ), that last for 3 months plus. Also purchase wet canned food, set aside $20- $30 monthly for that. A bag of litter around $8 x 4 bags = $32 ( monthly )\n4. Royal Canin ( Dry biscuits ), also depends what type of breed of feline you've. Short hair tabby or long fur persian etc.. Wet food, Friskies. Angel Pure Premium Cat Litter ( sand for litterbox )\n5. If or when I travel for two weeks or a month ++, I'd hire cat sitter that I know personally well for years, treat her like a part of my family. She works at the vet and I trust she knows the well being of my pets aka love ones if they are sick etc. I'm secure to give her my home keys, she visits each day, feed them twice a day, clean litterbox, play with them after her work over for couple of hours. Yes, she's paid for all those hard work.\n\nHope these helps. Remember adoption is lifetime, meaning 15years or more of their precious lives. Before you adopt, make sure you're ready and able to commit... ;)"", ""1) What are you looking for? Vaccinations? Or just a routine check-up? I'd set aside $100-200. \n\n2) I shower my cat once in a few months. Maybe you want to do one shower when you bring him back. Suggest to trim nails and maybe build up some rapport first as they usually do not like water. \n\n3) About $50 a month for food and litter. Buy in bulk then spread it out. \n\n4) I use Taste of the Wild for dry food, and a variety of different wet food cause my cat is picky but it's about $1.50 - $2.00 per 80g can. My cat is small (3kg) so 1 can is good for 2 feeds. \n\n5) Cat hotel. Not cheap I must say. I think it was about $35 a day."", ""Cats will self groom so you don't actually need to shower them often, maybe once a month or every 2/3months will do\n\nRoyal Canon or kit cat, etc but try out small quantities first to see if the cat likes it\n\nTravelling you mean with cat or without"", ""Hi, I'm a cat owner of 12 years. Here's some tips based on my experience.  \n\n\n1. First time vet costs? It depends on what you're going into the vet for. Usually a consultation costs $35 roughly (based off a vet in Yishun) & above. Vets who are higher skilled and in higher demand will cost more, can be 2 to 3 times of that. A visit to the vet can cost $100-200 plus with medication added in. If there's diagnostic done, like x-ray / blood test, it will be additional $200. So it really depends on what you're going in for. You can check online rates or give the clinic a call to find out their rates. Best to keep your cat as healthy as possible to avoid frequent vet visits. It all boils down to food diet, which will hugely determine the health of your cat.  \n\n2. It's totally ok to give cats showers. I shower mine once every month. Depends on how dirty the cat becomes after awhile and whether you can tolerate it. Cats do self groom but I don't think grooming alone is enough. Because I'm kind of a clean freak and prefer my cat to be clean. You can buy a bottle of pet shampoo from the pet store or order online (less than $10 to $20, depending on brand).\n3. For food, I spend about $100-150 per month. Depends on what kind of food you feed your cat. You'll have to do research on the kind of food diet you'll place your cat on. It's gonna be extensive but this is necessary to be a good and responsible cat owner. There's different grade in cat food. You have to start reading the food ingredients list and do research on what is good/bad for your cat. Avoid: Meat by products (you don't know the source of the meat), Corn/ soy / grains / chemical preservatives & colours & etc. A rule of thumb: First 5 ingredients to be meat. Cats are carnivores and have no need for vegetables & etc. As cats drink little water, it's always best to feed them wet food (can food). Brands that are known to be healthy & of high quality: Ziwi Peak (expensive - $4.50 - 9 per can), Zealandia ($5-6). From personal experience, best to feed as much home cooked meat as you can. Like boiled chicken/fish/pork. It's also way cheaper. I spend around $8 per week on fresh chicken and pork. Last usually around 5 days to 1 week. From wet market for extra freshness.\n4. I save on litter cost as my cat is toilet trained. He'll run into the bathroom and pees on the drain. He'll shit near the drain too. So it depends on your cat. If you end up getting a litter (most likely you will), get pine wood litter as it will disintegrate into dust when it comes into contact with water. Use a sifting tray so the dust will sift through to the bottom pan. It's easier to clean up this way. Example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRL-C1byrp4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRL-C1byrp4)\n5. Get a friend to take care of your cat temporarily. This friend must know how to care for cats. Or get a cat fosterer to help look after your cat. Can be found on Facebook cat groups, e.g: Cat Lovers Singapore.\n\nOther resources that might be helpful to you: [https://www.catwelfare.org/responsible-cat-ownership/](https://www.catwelfare.org/responsible-cat-ownership/)\n\nDo consider meshing your door and windows. There has been many cases of cats falling out of windows or escaping from doors. Most die from the impact or become disabled. Not only will the cat suffer, it's gonna burn a huge hole in your pocket to care for the cat for the rest of your life.\n\nIf you have any more questions, feel free to PM me."", ""1. For my neighbor hood Pet Clinic, consultant cost $55 + medicine or IV = $100-150. More medicine more $$\n2. 1st time shower is ok. My indoor short hair cat only shower once a year.\n3. My cat is a toilet trained, so no litter to buy. Food: a small can cost $1++, 12 cans for $13, 2 cans per day = $55~~~ If your cat likes dry food, 1 2kg bag per month is more than enough = $30-50 depending on brands.\n4. Can't recommend, different cat different stomach. Royal Canin typically recommend for Dry food. But high price range. Wet food is tricky. Cats have preference on types of fish. Mine don't like salmon.\n5. Can't help you with this, never tavel full family before. Someone is always at home to take care."", 'Just want to add that not all cats dislike bath. My colleague has a super heck-it-all cat. He would just sit there while my colleague pours water on his head (one-off occurance, NOT animal abuse lol)', 'I find this cat handbook useful: https://drive.google.com/file/d/14L71UUnN1DoMPZSm7HDTzKmeIytJ-mdK/view\n\nHave you informed the community cat caregiver that you plan to adopt this community cat? It’s good to give them a heads up or they’ll get worried if the cat goes “missing” one day. \n\n1. Depends on the procedures done on the cat. Vaccinations? Sterilization? Microchipping? Prepare $200 at least. \n\n2. I’ve never bathe my cat, cats are self-grooming. But if the fur is very matted and dirty, a professional pet groomer like [petpat](https://www.petpatsg.com) can get the job done. \n\n3. I buy in bulk and it lasts for months. For example, I buy 10kg worth (2kg x 5 bags) of food, it costs $100+ and lasts for half a year. Same with litter, my 6 packs of 7L litter is $42 and can last for months. \n\n4. Depends on how picky your cat is... There are many kinds of food and litter. You’ll have to trial and error. Shelters usually say to avoid pet food sold in the supermarket as they might not be as nutritious. As I adopted mine from a shelter, I continued to feed my cat with the food she’s used to from the shelter. Litter wise, if you don’t want your cat kicking up a dust storm, maybe can try tofu litter. Dry food I use [Gold-D](https://www.ahasg.com/Gold-D_Collection.html) or Royal Canin but I prefer the former as it has probiotics. Wet food I use Aristo Cats. Litter I use Whiskers2Tail from [CatsMartSG](https://catsmart.com.sg/brands/whiskers2tail). \n\n5. There are cat hotels. There are also cat boarders and cat sitters found on the [petbacker](https://www.petbacker.com.sg) website. \n\nPlease also mesh ALL windows and your front gate. Cats can die from falling from a height. Keep your cats strictly indoors, do not let your cat roam or your neighbours will definitely complain. It is safer indoors than being outdoors. It is a myth cats need to roam. My cat is happy indoors and is not interested to go out the door lol. \n\nYou can look up Jackson Galaxy on YouTube for more cat advice too.']"

He wanted to discuss this incident that happened on our first day here. My husband forgot his phone downstairs and he brought it back up to us. He requested a ""token"" for doing so.

IngelSoong,nsodjo,[A Levels] Why is A Level Maths so Hard?,2021-06-05 13:17:37,SGExams,77716,37,95,"# Why is A Level Maths So Hard?

Having now graduated from the top 20% of the O Level cohort, the syllabus is now made much tougher to further differentiate among all of you.

Here are some reasons why A Level Mathematics is so hard:

## Tedious Workings

As we progress from O Level to A Level, the workings will become longer and longer.

You will also find some expansions to be tedious, especially when cubic equations are given.

Evaluating the cross product of two vectors are cumbersome with much room for careless mistakes.

For interest-rate questions involve geometric progression, it can be extremely difficult to formulate the general expression.

With no indication as to you have obtained the correct expression, you might end up losing marks further down.

## Answers Are Uglier

Answers used to be round numbers in O Level to make solving the questions easier.

In A Level, the final answers tend to be “more realistic” and you will see decimals, fractions appearing.

In reality, solutions are unlikely to look nice.

## Numerous Solving Techniques To Master

## Integration

Anyone who has done integration would tell you that there are so many techniques to approach the questions.

Depending on whether you have algebra, logarithms, exponential, trigonometry, and inverse trigonometry, the approach you adopt will be vastly different.

At times you will need to use partial fractions to divide and conquer the function.

Or you might need to use integration by parts.

And identifying which one to integrate, which one to differentiate is tough.

Not one size fits all

## Permutation and combinations

In the case of permutation and combinations, there are so many different scenarios.

Sometimes you will use the slotting method, sometimes complementary.

Unlike integration, the problem is all these approaches seem logical.

This means you might not get stuck while solving them and there is no way of knowing if you have attained the right answer.

## Curve Sketching

As A Level students, you are also expected to know the shapes of basic functions, such as polynomials logarithms, exponential, trigonometry.

Given a function, you are also expected to know how to draw the inverse function, f(-|x|), -f(-x) with asymptotes in mind

Sometimes without the aid of the graphing calculator.

## Need To Learn Manipulation

To derive the final answer, students are now exposed to the new technique of manipulation.

To manipulate in Maths is to create the desired term you wish to see for your solution.

For example, they can be used to replace long division, factorize functions, complete the square, or to prove identities.

## Abstract Concepts

## 3D vectors

The introduction of lines (and skew lines!) and planes in vectors have stumbled many.

For most students, 3D vectors are hard to visualize.

It is even harder to solve questions revolving intersections of planes, lines, or a combination of both.

Most students also do not appreciate the purpose of doing the cross product.

And questions like finding the foot of perpendicular tend to trip students

## Complex numbers

The idea that numbers can be imaginary is mindblowing in the first place.

## Volume finding

The fact that you can find the volume of a 3D object by integrating a function by pen and paper is fascinating.

But if you are the one doing it I doubt you will feel engrossing.

How much to rotate, by π or 2π also depends on whether your graph spans one half or both of the y-axis.

## Functions

For functions, it is difficult to determine the range of a function.

Students often learn through the hard way that they cannot simply substitute extreme x values to find the range of a function.

Also, determining whether a composite function exists or not requires an understanding of the connectivity of the substituent functions.

To determine a one-to-one function, do you use the horizontal line test or the vertical line test? Comment below.

## Not Knowing Where To Start

## Proving trigo identities

A common grievance students have is not knowing where and how to start.

Topics like these include proving trigonometric identities, where no formula seems appropriate to transform from one function to another, such as double-angle formula and R-formula.Formula list such as this may only be helpful to a certain extent.

## Binomial within binomial

Questions such as drawing samples behaving a binomial distribution and concurrences within the samples have binomial probability density functions are complicated.

## Complex Terminology

Many terminologies appear in the big topic of statistics, such as sample mean, variance, probability density functions, cumulative functions, discrete random variables, continuous random variables, hypothesis, regression lines, etc.

Since different known conditions can affect which of the distributions can be employed, students have to appreciate the terminologies and remember (and probably understand) nuances like why sample variance formula not the same as population variance

## Venn diagrams

Venn diagrams can be annoying, especially with the deliberate incomplete values and you are asked to determine the maximum and the minimum values of a segment.

Especially where a subset can occur.

## Transformation

Graphs transformation is annoying.

To shift y=x graph towards the right by 1 unit you use y=x-1 yet to shift the same graph up by 1 unit you use y = x + 1.

Darkness descends upon you when you are asked to determine the series of transformations to attain the final form.

## P. S.

Instead, they ask for students to understand the fundamental reasons behind the maths. \n\nA prime example of this imo is transformation of functions. It seems weird why shifting x and y involves opposite addition/subtraction, but if you dig enough, you can find out the reason. \n\nBasically, transformations are about moving functions, so rather than considering y = x, consider instead y = f(x).\n\nWhen shifting to the left, you subtract, say, 1 to move it by 1 to the right. Solving for y, y = f(x-1).\n\nWhen shifting up by 1, you similarly subtract 1, so you have y - 1 = f(x), solving for y, y = f(x) + 1.\n\nHence, the reason x and y shifts are opposite is because you rearrange the formula. In actuality, you sub in the same thing. It's just that it makes little sense when you are presented with the method for transformation without learning why.\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg. This is also why many find further maths difficult. It requires students to change how they think about maths. Of course, you can brute force it with practice and memory, but it's far more effective to find out why things in math are how they are (integration and probabilities aside).

26 this year and started a small shop with a online shop/social media back in 2018 fresh out of NS when I had no real plans. Business picked up around the time my parents lost their jobs so they've decided to come on board too. Now we've been running this together for around 3 years, and I've become really stressed about it. 

Thinking about how my parents, both in their 60s depend on this business kinda makes me feel really stuck and stressed. Sorta feels like I got to support them as much as I support myself. (Is this what people with spouses and kids or a lot of dependants feel?) 

While I am thankful that they're still able to work and support the business, though I can also see that they are getting older... they're definitely not gonna be able to find another job if I leave or shut this down.

So far the business has been pretty stable and it's been comfortable not gonna lie, but seeing my friends and peers getting ahead of their lives or climbing the corporate ladder just makes me feel really stuck haha.

What is your take in regards to insurance retirement plan (paying a sum every month for next 30 years, at a guaranteed return of 2% yearly or so)?

One is guaranteed while the other isn't.

My personal take is that DIY investing will still have a significant advantage and returns over insurance retirement plan.

chubbypun643,ngpslg,[UNI] Considering NTU? Here's what nobody tells you about.,2021-05-20 11:42:09,SGExams,77716,45,327,"I had the opportunity to speak to some juniors recently and realised that there really isn't much up-to-date information on NTU out there, so I thought I'd do a short write-up seeing as the first window is closing.

**NTU vs Other Unis**

1. **On-campus accommodation**: Compared to NUS, it is easier to secure a place on campus. Note that NTU only has halls and does not have RCs, so I'm simply comparing on-campus accommodation. There are much more rooms available and you have 2 years of guaranteed hall stay. Is this important? Yes, if you'd like to experience communal living or would like the opportunity to mingle with people from outside of your course.
2. **S/U System**: To S/U a course is to register that you have taken it, without letting it affect your GPA. As you may have heard, S/U is incredibly helpful if you wish to preserve your GPA, or have mods that you already know you won't be doing well, so it can be quite the dealbreaker if you're choosing between NTU and NUS. NTU's S/U system only allows you to SU electives, in other words you cannot S/U core modules for your course. Depending on your course, this may result in a situation where you can only choose to S/U a module for as few as 3 modules, throughout your entire university education. Further, you can only choose to S/U before seeing your grade, so it will really be a guess of how well you did, not in absolute terms, but as with all things in university, relative to your batch (read: you may not be able to predict your grade accurately).
3. **MOOCs for AUs**: This is something new from last year that many incoming freshmen would not pay attention to, but let me assure you, this will help you feel better after hearing about other unis' S/U system. [Long story short](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/admissions/matriculation/mooc), this means that you can essentially complete MOOCs to replace certain electives throughout, up to a maximum of 12 AUs (approximately 4 module equivalent). The beauty of this lies in the fact that 1. you can't fail MOOCs, 2. you can do it at your own pace, during or between semesters, and so subsequently, 3. you have less workload to worry about during a semester. When you'll be taking 6-7 modules a semester, being to take one less will help you tremendously.
4. **Your actual course**: Please also compare your course to the equivalent offered to you by the other universities. This could be something as simple as the opportunity costs of an extra year for Business/Accountancy, or something that's more difficult to benchmark such as how long the course has been established for and its impact on teaching quality etc. Every uni and course has its pros and cons, so you'll need to figure out which ones are the ones you prioritise more.

**2021 Updates**

1. **New Common Curriculum**: [This](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/CorpComms2/Documents/2021/01_Jan/TNP_210126_New%20common%20curriculum.pdf) is something that NTU launched early this year without much details, but based on what my friends and I have read from [SCSE's curriculum for freshmen matriculating in 2021](https://www.ntu.edu.sg/scse/admissions/programmes/undergraduate-programmes/curriculum-structure), it seems to be a **drastic change** on a **university-wide** scale. The classification of modules has been overhauled and there seems to be a revamp of a number of modules, including modules common to all faculties such as communication modules. Of note is the sheer number of modules that **everyone** has to take. What does this mean for you? Your seniors notes, and correspondingly, their advice, may be less useful. Are you likely to be performing better/worse in this environment? This will really depend on your own ability to cope and how independent you are. Not to worry though, as you'll only be competing within your batch, the Bell Curve God will smooth things out - if it's not meant to be, it really isn't meant to be. My uneducated guess will be that those who are in more academically-demanding courses are likely to perform better, on average, in these modules if these are graded on a common curve, so make of that what you will.
2. **Orientation Matters**: Given the prevailing COVID situation, it is pretty much set in stone for all universities to adopt virtual camps. Having attended these camps myself, I'll be the first to tell you that these are as lame as they sound. **But you should still go for them**! Anecdotally, you're likely to make most of your closest university friends in your first semester of school and you're only doing yourself a disservice if you skip out on the already limited opportunities to socialise. Sure, the games and all will be silly, but the people that you meet and the opportunity to meet up physically in school will be worth it, not to mention being able to know some of your classmates beforehand! If you're asking about which camps to sign up for, the only correct answer is all of them.
3. **Hall Matters**: Depending on faculty, a number of your modules may be conducted online. If you have the means to, I'll recommend you stay in hall regardless as it's an important opportunity to make friends in these strange times. As the world recovers from COVID, you may also find it harder to get a room if you're applying in Semester 2 if you don't already have one from Semester 1 (most NTU residents pay for Winter). And if you do, sign up for hall camps as well to make friends with your neighbours!

It becomes increasingly less useful in the later years, as you won't have a lot of level 1000 modules left.\n\nOn the other hand, NTU allows you to S/U any elective module, regardless of level.

Kidjojo,nwjv4c,Enlisted into PNSF (october intake) for NS. Please share some tips,2021-06-10 18:02:23,NationalServiceSG,11091,12,25," **TL;DR:** I have a few questions. Yes, im a newbie who has no idea how NS world works. I heard experiences and stories from my friends and that's about it, im still confused as to the different vocation and 'schedule' for NS. Much appreciated, take care and have a nice day!

1. Which is the better force? In terms of difficulty, career progression, pay and etc. (SAF / SPF / SCDF)
2. I have stumbled across a few articles/comments on this subreddit mentioning that OCT is not worth the time. May I know why is that so? \*im assuming OCT is the officer cadet school specifically for police force\*
3. Should I sign on? What are the pros and cons? I've received my acceptance letter from NTU in the engineering field, would this affect my NS journey or give me a slight benefit when I sign on? says higher paycut or something",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/nwjv4c/enlisted_into_pnsf_october_intake_for_ns_please/,"[""1. In terms of difficulty, SPF would be the easiest. You don't train the whole day, you will be spending half of your day in an aircon room studying law. Pay wise will be roughly the same through out the 3 forces.\n2. The OCT course is just GRF course with leadership elements added to it where they will send you to a 21 days OBS camp. Half of the course, you will be learning what the GRF are learning. One thing to note is that an OCT can never be posted to GRF.  In my opinion, being an OCT only helps with your portfolio as you are seen to have leadership qualities.  However, not all OCT gets to take up leadership role after they pass out from training, most will end up doing high paying admin jobs at division level with the exception of those who are posted to transcom, soc and procom.  \n3. No, having an uni placement does not affect your NS journey nor give you any benefits when u sign on. In fact, your NTU placement will be rejected should you choose to sign on. Don't sign on hastily, try to gain some exposure first then come to decide whether the job scope is what you want to pursue as a career. Just an advice, if you give up on your placement now, it might be difficult for you to apply for any of the big 3 uni in the future given the increase in the GPA requirement as shown in the IGP."", '😱 my one year junior intake 😎 I am from 181, enlisted October last year. \n\n1. Nothing like better but SPF amounts to higher pay (due to meal allowance pay for frontline). Each force plays its part in keeping Singapore safe. \n\n2. Yes, OCT is the officer cadet course specifically for PNSFs. I personally wanted it very badly (a fumble in the end made me lose my chance). If you do inspector course and then go frontline, you’re not treated with much respect in some places as you have less experience than your peers due to your longer training (6 months extra). On the other hand, who doesn’t want the rank right. Haha. And for prestige sake / if you’re one of those people that likes to strive for something higher / don’t mind ending up at a desk job, OCT could work well for you plus shiny diamonds is always a plus. \n\n3. Do not sign on in my opinion. Engineering is a good field and in demand currently and NTU is a very good university. Sign on life is crap. Start as a Sgt rank and stay there for years while some guy starts off with a degree and immediately gets inspector rank. If SPF is your passion, get your degree and then sign on.  If you still want to sign on and decide to, do it before you POP. The two years of NS will be counted in your five year liability. \n\nIf got more questions feel free to DM!', 'Also honestly most engineering jobs will give you a better pay than police force will :/ so unless police is your passion, I’d say don’t sign on.', 'Hey man. Firstly,  when you enlist in Home Team Academy, you\'ll be part of a collective that will be known as an intake. So my intake was 171st Intake, and each intake will consist of a ""fit"" and ""less fit"" intake, where fit intake is the one where you completed or passed your pre-enlistennt IPPT (which are done in your ITE/Poly/JC) and less fit vice versa. \n\n1) Every force is good and bad. There\'s no one ""better"" force so as to speak. NS wise, each have its pros and cons, and its up to how you look at it. SAF and SCDF will consist of more physical aspects for basic training, though SPF do have its strenuous PT sessions and tekan sessions, but alot of your recruit, or Trainee Special Constable(TSC) ,which will be your rank and title throughout your time in HTA until the very moment you POP. SPF NS pay is decent, especially if you get posted to a frontline unit(actually on the ground doing police shit and not desk job), as there will be numerous factors that would enable you to receive that decent pay, such as meal allowances, Operations pay, bearing of arms(gun in layman\'s terms) etc.\n\n2) Yes OCT is basically OCS for SPF. Bear in mind, if you are a PNSF, you will have to perform and show in your basic training that you really are OCT material as not alot of PNSF will be posted to OCT after POP, as the majority of OCT cadets are cross overs from SAF, or ad we jokingly call them, OCS rejects(I asked a number of NSPIs I know and they confirmed that they indeed had an interest to be in OCS but weren\'t selected). Deeming OCT as worth it or not is up to the individual, as for me, I would say you will be missing out on the experience of being a boots on the ground, the ""man"" life. I personally enjoyed being a ""man"" and going through cool police shit with my intake mates and regulars without the responsibility of the two diamonds on my shoulders(NSPI rank). Though NSPIs that are posted to ProCom, TransCom and perhaps SOC will go through the on the ground police life, they have the added responsibilities of doing more admin and paperwork which sucks alot. But the pros would be that you will have a strong bond with your OCT mates, experience GRF life for a while during your OCT, have the prestige of commissioning( and have that cool Instagram photos of commissioning day), being addressed as ""Sir"" and greeted by the peasants( NSF Sergeants, Corporal and Special Constables), have the right to tekan, scold, exercise some form of authority etc.\n\n3) Well, do you have this passion to serve as a police officer? Or perhaps do you really need the sign on bonus of $30K, like really really badly? Or do you not see and know what you want to do with your life 5 years from now? If there\'s a yes to at least one of these, then my man, frickin sign on. If not, going to uni would be a hella feasible and sensible option. And you can always apply to sign on as a degree holder as that would be positively looked upon anywhere in whichever workforce. However, having a secured uni placing will have no effect or outcome whatsoever in your NS life! So, if you dont want to sign on before or during your NS, you have alot of time to think over the course of your NS if you want to sign on or not! \n\nHope this helped at least a little bro. Anymore further queries and clarifications or just general questions about life in SPF as a NSF, hmu in the comments or messages! Cheers bro', ""1.  There is no comparison between the three. All the different groups and units have different jobs. Some are more dangerous, but none doesn't work without the other. We all work together to protect singapore in the end. \n\nIn POBC, if you are in the PTP batch, you'll be training the entire day. Up to 4 PT sessions in a day.\n\nOnce PTP is over, other activities will kick in such as shooting, obstacle course, and the dreaded law lessons. Law lessons are pretty doable, even the blur ones can pass, they're just a huge pain in the neck. \nI was in PTP, but it was definitely worth the extra 2 months. I actually somewhat regret not taking my PT seriously because in the end, my IPPT is what will make or break it in terms of my vocation choice\n\n2. Some guy approached me saying that OCT wasn't worth the time and saying I'll regret if i join, but his info was very vague. From the things I've seen OCT is pretty interesting. They have outdoor courses such as OBS, take driving license (if I'm not mistaken) and learn so much more than normal basic course. I'm pretty sure a huge majority of officers would say that their time at OCT was definitely worth it. Pay is pretty nice too (idk how much)\n\n3. Signing on will be your own choice to make. For me, I'm going to have a feel of how unit life is like first. See if police work is something i see myself doing in the long term, before deciding on signing on after NS. \n\nPOC AH!"", '1) Difficulty wise depends. If you hated JC and school in general back then, you will hate the law lessons which takes up most of your time in POBC training. SPF has less physical tekan sure, but you will have a lot mental tekan in the form of law, SoPs and document writing. Difficulty is up to individual. Pay is quite good especially if you go frontline or OCT  because we have this thing called meal allowance. Progression is that all frontlines are guaranteed CPL by ORD, with a few becoming SGTs. Non-frontline guaranteed SC2, with some becoming CPLs and very few becoming SGTs.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n2) I was ex-OCT and eh it really depends on each individual whether it is worth it or not. The most common reason for not going OCT  is that you have little chance of going frontline, alongside spending extra 6-9 months (depending on your intake and whether u kenna NDP) in HTA. The tests in OCT are not easy too as you learn advanced law even beyond GRF and the 21-days OBS is pure hell. Furthermore, in some vocations like mine you will never be called ""sir"" or saluted  because of the unit culture, and you need to interact with them differently to gain their respect compared to traditional SPF units.\n\nLife after OCT really depends on what you vocation you got assigned too. However, I will say that no matter your vocations, you WILL be undertaking some sort of leadership roles. This includes the admin roles which everyone says its boring. In fact you will be extremely busy if you are a manpower officer ( the toughest admin vocation) or an operations officer. Frontline roles are no joke too. You will be scrutinised when you enter new units and you must earn respect through humility and confidence. Its not an easy job and there are times I definitely wish I rejected OCT and went normal frontline, but if you are up for it and want to see how far you go then I encourage you to take up OCT.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n3) Sign on pros: good bonus, regular pay for NS period, stable long term career if u don\'t fuck up, decent support provided for any issues you may face\n\nSign on cons: shift work destroys body clock, mistakes like losing a single round can cost you everything, seeing stuff like dead bodies and suicidal people, and having to serve 5 years instead of 2 years.\n\nAll in all the biggest aspect is whether you have the passion for police work. If you don\'t you will hate your life. As for studies it will be affected if you sign on, unless you manage to get a scholarship/sponsorship and they release you for your studies.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI hope this has helped you a bit in making your decisions. Welcome to SPF and I hope you will enjoy your 2 years here!', "">most will end up doing high paying admin jobs at division level\n\nI assume what other redditors meant from boring or 'not worth' is the admin work (too mundane I guess).

But signing on w/o a degree will mean you are just a junior officer (Starting rank will be Sgt1/2). Even with the completion of your degree, you are not guaranteed an inspector rank (for those who sign on after they obtain their degree, starting rank will be inspector). You will still have to be nominated and go through several stringent interviews in order to get the rank. Like all interviews, there is still a possibility of failing should they see you are not qualified to hold the rank. So my advice is, if you are really keen on the money prospect and being a senior officer in the SPF, complete your degree first then sign on.\n\nAlso, if you managed to pass out as an NSPI (National Service Probation Inspector) after your OCT course and decided that you want to sign on, your rank will be reduced to Sergeant upon signing. This differ from SAF where the lieutenants are able to keep their rank.', 'Every intake of SPF NS has a number.

Snoo_91548,o4ngvd,[O levels] Poly vs JC - from a sec 3,2021-06-21 12:57:23,SGExams,77716,26,19,"Hi, I know there are people who posted about this topic but I just want some advice:( I have told my teacher about my dilemma but he didn't even bother to read my msg so I turned to this subreddit for help.

My parents recently lost their job and this was a wake up call for my initial decision to go to JC. Currently, I'm kind of seeing JC in a different light as the fact that you have to study other subjects that you don't like puts me off. Additionally, i dont think it's possible to work as much as going to poly and the fact that my future depends on this one big exam makes me scared.

Anyways, I'm determined to get into uni as it's my end goal but I will get to there later. I heard poly is ex but it is harder to get into uni (depending on the courses). Furthermore, it's risky to change courses if I dislike the course.(due to the no. of slots) 

I understand that no matter where I go, I have to work hard to do well but with my financial situation, I have to choose wisely.

Back to uni, the courses I'm interested in so far are psychology and pharmacy. I'm currently trying to explore the other courses. 

Thanks for reading this post and feel free to comment your thoughts :)",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/o4ngvd/o_levels_poly_vs_jc_from_a_sec_3/,"['There are financial schemes available to help subsidise your poly fees if you really need them, so if you really want to go to poly, I hope that your financial situation isn’t the reason why you can’t. \n\nI’m currently in Poly even though I was adamant about going to JC in my upper secondary school years because I found what I truly want to study and felt that JC wasn’t suitable to my field of interest, at all. \n\nThe thing about uni is… not all JC students end up in uni (or at least the Big 3 unis in SG); it still depends on their A Level results. And sometimes, their A Level results are not good enough for them to pursue the course they want. However, there are other universities out there in SG as well as overseas. Sometimes it’s good for you to go overseas and pursue your degree so that you can learn more about their culture AND how to take care of yourself (trust me, this is very a valuable experience given that I’m a foreign student in SG). \n\nHowever, if you really want to do pharmacy/psychology at the degree level, I would say that JC is a better path for you? This is because the academic rigour is greater in JC and will prep you when it comes to uni. However, there are poly students out there who did really well in their course, pursued it at degree level and are still flourishing, despite them not going the JC route.', 'For psych and pharm, I would recommend to go the JC route.\n\nPsych: you need a Masters to do clinical psych.\nPharmacy: you need a degree and training in Pharmacy to be a certified Pharmacist.\n\nHowever, if you are really not suited for the JC curriculum, it might be very risky.', ""even though poly's school fees is much higher, you can always apply for financial assistance or even scholarship. Financial issues should not stop you from going to poly, if you really want to go to poly.\n\nI believe that both poly and jc are viable routes to uni. No matter which way you choose, you will still need to get decent grades to get into either psychology and pharmacy. If you don't get the grades, even if you are in jc, you are unable to get into the desired course you want. \n\nHowever, if you want to work part time during school, I suggest you go to poly. Poly has a more flexible schedule that allows you to work part time. However, if you are choosing to juggle work and school, please please please have good time management. Please do not have the idea that poly is easier than jc. The reason for the flexible schedule in poly is to allow students to do their projects, own learning, etc. Hence, if you want to work part-time, be prepared to be busy and sacrifice either social life, sleep or academics. \n\nPoly or jc? well, this really has to be dependent on you. poly and jc have different curriculum. poly is more hands-on, with more flexibility but requires you to do your own studying and not being spoon-fed. as for jc, you just mug lor. but let me emphasise one more time, poly is not easier than jc. each has its own stresses.\n\ni am a poly student from a low-income family. school fees was definitely on my mind when i was choosing between jc or poly. in the end, i still went for poly as i knew that i wanted to work part-time while studying. poly gave me that flexibility. as for school fees, i applied to bursaries and scholarships to help me with my financial difficulties. i am fortunate enough to get a bursary that could cover academic fees for one year. hence, i do not have to worry about my school fees. my daily expenses would then come from my part time job.\n\nwell, this is just my personal take on this matter. please consider which curriculum do you really want and are able to strive in it."", 'Some people will claim that getting to Uni is easier through a JC route.\n\nHowever, I have not seen statistics to prove the above as a fact.\n\nPersonally, I was from a JC and made it to NUS. And in NUS, I bumped into several of my former classmates from Secondary school who went to Poly.\n\nBelieve it or not, I always thought the aforementioned classmates were going to make it to University regardless of the route chosen due to their dedication to work and intelligence.\n\nTruth is, if you are capable, nobody can deny you a place in your desired course and university.', 'hello, would like to give my 2 cents on this \n\nfirst thing i think it’s important to ask yourself is, have you found a poly course that you are sure you will stick through? i do know of many people who enroll into abc course thinking that they’ll do xyz modules and learn abc concepts, make sure to check what modules you’ll be taking, any internships available for the poly course you choose\n\nlike what other commenters have mentioned, there are financial aid to alleviate your financial burden\n\nif you’re considering jc, have you picked a certain jc and subject combination you’re interested in? it’ll be nice to make sure that you have a life outside studying in jc, like joining ccas, interest groups, having good support for higher education etc etc \n\nhope this helped !! :> all the best op', ""If you want to work as a psychologist, youd need a masters degree and a high GPA in your bachelor's. If you want to get into pharmacy, you need A in 3 H2, Chem, Bio, Math minimally.\n\n\nPoly is good too and all but its hands-on and practical nature means its more applicable for some courses like engineering or business rather than humanities or science."", ""id say poly.\nalthough poly is pretty expensive there are subsidary plans to assist you. if your comfortable w it, i think there are certain grants to helo you out. \nalso, in terms of experience, poly life and uni life r pretty similar so u get a small 'preview' of what poly could b like. in general, poly also provides many good experienves to train you in your field of study.\nalthough getting into uni may b harder, if you study hard enough, there r very good scholarship opportunities offered"", ""As a JC graduate, here are my opinions\n\n>Currently, I'm kind of seeing JC in a different light as the fact that you have to study other subjects that you don't like puts me off.\n\nI can agree to the fact that JC does have subjects that you might hate, especially the GP, PW, MT and contrasting subject.\n\nHowever, in contrast, Poly ALSO does have the same thing. Take NYP for e.g., they have a module for fitness and healthy lifestyle(aka Fitness for Life) which involves trying a sport and Understanding Singapore module, similar to GP but at a Singapore level. \n\nOverall, it really depends on the poly so do your research on the courses. JC subjects are more on the breadth side for the sake of multiple courses and interests and be more multidisciplinary while poly modules are more depth to become more specialised.\n\n\n>Anyways, I'm determined to get into uni as it's my end goal but I will get to there later. I heard poly is ex but it is harder to get into uni (depending on the courses).\n\nThere are scholarships. Do look at the back of the JAE booklet for more info.\n\n>Back to uni, the courses I'm interested in so far are psychology and pharmacy. I'm currently trying to explore the other courses. \n\nI would recommend more on the JC side for these courses as they are more academic based as compared to engineering, design and business which requires one to apply the knowledge. Plus for these psychology and pharameceutical science in particular, JC seems easier than poly for majority of my friends.\n\nAt the same time, poly is useful, especially after you graduate if we were to highlight the financial problem as you can go directly to a job w diploma but difficult(if not unlikely to get a job) for A Level cert."", 'For Uni Psych/Pharmacy, i think nearly majority will agree JC is a safer choice. Poly GPA isn’t just attitude and skills, there’s a huge component of luck too. You’ll literally have to be lucky to maintain a 3.9 and above. For pharmaceutical, you’ll need a very competitive GPA and portfolio. My friend’s medicinal chemistry course top graduate is 3.8x, not even 3.9x. Science courses are especially tough in Poly.', ""If you have a passion for a course or are sure of what you would like to do in the future, I would reccomend to go for polytechnic. However, this narrows your choices in the future and for the uni. If you are still unsure of what you would like to do, don't risk it and go for a jc instead to keep your options wide. These are what I've heard from my seniors."", 'For pharmacy u have to go poly.', ""Thanks for replying! How does the things we learn in JC defer from the modules in poly? Isn't it about the same? ( if lets say we continue taking the same course from poly and in uni.)"", 'Ahhh i see. Do you happen to know about the requirements to do forensic psych and educational psych?', 'Hello, thanks for the advice! I will definitely try to see my options with things you pointed out. All the best to you too ^-^', 'i can mention a bit of the general studies modules cos i was from nyp haha. firstly, the ""understanding singapore"" module is NOT like general paper at all hahaha i learnt nothing, it\'s the most useless and redundant module ever, everyone hates it but we just suck it up🤡fitness for life is a sports module - you get to pick a sport and it\'s fun if you enjoy it! it\'s like having a low commitment cca.\n\ntoo bad general study modules are compulsory but best thing about them is that they\'re only graded as a Pass/Fail module and are not counted towards your final GPA. people generally don\'t work too hard for general study modules cos they\'re not impt, the assessments/projects for general study modules don\'t require too much effort anyways. most year 1\'s get allocated the same general study modules but from year 2 onwards you can choose modules from different faculty and there\'s def interesting ones! \n\nall in all, general study modules are nothing to worry about in poly hahaha.', 'Is it a must though? Can OP go into the science stream in JC and then go into pharmacy in uni?', 'You should probably look at NUS website before saying this.', 'Mm if I’m not wrong, JC is really academic based where you just learn a more in-depth version of what you learnt in secondary school. Basically, whatever that wasn’t taught in sec school will be in the JC syllabus. However, for poly, even though some of the content is the same as JC (if you’re in the science courses for example), there are more experiments and hands on activities for you to try out. To put it in short, JC focuses on theory heavily whereas Poly focuses more on the practical side of things (to prep you for work). \n\nP.s. If there are any poly students in science courses and/or came from a JC background here reading my reply, please add on or correct me if I’m wrong. It’s bc I’m in a design course so my info might be inaccurate.', ""year 1 modules in most poly science courses aim to build your foundation in the sciences. i would say a good number of the modules taught throughout year 1 covers content from JC H1/H2 biology and chemistry. i took a lot of general science modules like physical & inorgnanic chemistry (tough af hahaha), organic chemistry, biochemistry, cell/human biology in year 1.\n\nyear 2 onwards, modules are more course specific. i did pharmaceutical sciences, so i started taking more pharmacy and health science-related modules, so things like pharmacology, pathology, immunology, microbioogy.\n\nto add on, some science courses offer specializations in year 2, so then your modules will lean towards that! it's great bc it gives you in-depth experience and knowledge in a certain area/specialization that you're interested in! :)\n\nlesson and curriculum structure-wise, i didn't think that there was a huge difference for me between studying science in poly and JC. i felt it was similar - i had lectures, practicals and tutorials, and had lots of pen-and-paper tests throughout. not a lot of project work and i've only had 1 formal presentation, which was for my FYP haha."", 'Should probably ask those within the industry.

CirclesM,nxb3f5,What to expect in ELECTC TECH vocation?,2021-06-11 16:37:54,NationalServiceSG,11091,24,5,I recently got my posting and not sure what to expect. I searched online and found nothing much expect vague answers like repairing signals equipment? Anyone got the same vocation and can shed some insight? And additionally what is OES which is the place I am supposed to go?,1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/nxb3f5/what_to_expect_in_electc_tech_vocation/,"['Fucking good life. Best life of all the technicians. 2 months of OES training at KC3 and then 1 month of training at your unit. Unit life is stay out as long as you don’t get posted out', ""throwaway account but i was posted to ELECTC TECH halfway into pes c BMT a few years back and trained there for around 3 months. not sure if its still the same but compared to AUTO TECH (cmech) it's rly much more chill (legit everyone else is jealous of elect). most lessons are in aircon environment. idk if i can go into details on what u will have to learn but it's rly q straightforward if u follow instructions. also, kc3 canteen is chefs kiss.\n\n(the things i learnt in elect training ended up having no relevance whatsoever to my eventual final posting tho lmao)"", 'u/ethicalbosun', 'Same vocation too', 'Hello, I’ve copy pasted this for around 3 batches of elect tech already haha, you experience might vary but I’ll still say it’ll be a good one.\nHoly shit this batch is probably the one I copy pasted this the most, I love that all of y’all elects are on reddit. \n\nHi!!! Welcome to OES! I’m an elect tech in unit now. So basically tech is a kinda cool (but not really) vocation, depending on which kinda tech you are. Prepare for a lot of change from bmt. There’ll be a lot (ALOT) of lessons and material and tests and practical and stuff like that, elect and hasa has more tests than practical, and the rest (auto, tracked, turret) has more practical. You’ll stay here for 11-12 weeks depending on platform and then go for a 1 month on job experience before getting posted out to various different camps. Also, officers(sorta) don’t exist anymore!! You’ll now be faced with Military Experts (ME) so familiarise yourself with the ranks. If unsure, anyone ranking ME3 and above should be treated as an officer(greet them as sir, room diam).\n\nLIFE AT OES Usual RO is reveille ar breakfast time Lessons until dinnertime with time for dinner and lunch (and canteen breaks!!! Yay!!!) Y’all will go back to bunk and rest until 2100ish when there is last parade. This will last for 2-4 weeks before stayout begins. SBA is regular at once a week before bookouts. Wall plugs are allowed(for my batch). Bring MANY power banks. Wednesdays are for nights out.\n\nLESSONS/STUFF YOU DO Most of your time in lessons will be spent with civilian Instructors who are really chill and give welfare, so please don’t get them into trouble with the MEs. They will cover varying degrees of content for different techs, and depending on which tech you are you will need to pass some learnet quizzes or practical or both. If you fail, you will likely be held back for RT after bookout or on weekends. But don’t get too stressed on that cause it’s unlikely you will actually fail since nobody wants to come back for RT.You will likely need a notebook to take down notes and stuff during lessons so remember to bring one. PT was cancelled for the covid batch but I’m not sure for yours. There will be nothing to do with combat that you will have to do for the duration of the course (e.g. range, outfield, IMT and stuff like that) but you will still have stuff like Range and IPPT and combat shoot and outfield(maybe) in units, but not very often.\n\nREGIMENTATION OES is very strict on regimentation so follow all your commander’s instructions to the letter. It is very easy to kena an extra or 2 in OES, e.g. not filling water bottle, not filling temperature sheet, using phone after lights out(which will get ur phone confiscated and put in an envelope). The SSM was a very strict ME3(man got posted to Australia) so just show all ur commanders basic respect. Try not to screw anything up if not you’ll be signing the book almost certainly. The sergeants taking care of you are especially strict, so try not to cross them. Marching is still required from place to place, which can be kinda annoying. Also, try not to screw anything up after you start staying out if not the commanders will use it as an excuse to hold you back. You will still do guard duty as trainees, likely 3-4 times throughout your course.\n\nTech is a hella good vocation to land, especially if you’re stayout in unit, you can learn some interesting stuff instead of being chiongsua with fieldpack and have time of your own to spare so you have some degree of control over your life.

2) what is your last drawn? 

From watching various youtube videos regarding hiring overseas especially in the western culture. It seems that it is not necessary to answer specifically qn (2). 

However in singapore, it is fairly common for HR to request to see your last drawn salary. 

To put it into a particular situation:

If i have been drawing a basic of 4.5 with variable monthly incentives between 700-1500. 

I would answer: 

(1) 

Depending on the job scope and the pay structure. A competitive salary expectations would be 5-7k 

(2) 

My last drawn is 4.5k with average monthly incentives of 1000. 

So my main question is if you were to jump job and think that you deserve more salary with much more experience now and deserve a higher pay. Is it necessary to answer qn (2)? 

Because it seems counter intuitive in terms of asking for your expected yet they probably will give u a pay package according to your last drawn.

Would appreciate some advice on what I should do next.

I'm 36M with 3 kids.

- $25k in current account 
- $15k in stashaway simple as emergency funds
- $2.5k invested in local ETFs
-$2.5k invested in global ETFs 

I think I can put more into investment. It's not much but I only really just started.

I'd actually not buy STI etfs but go largely (90%) into a world index like VWRA.\n\nI wouldn't touch your rainy day savings since you do have a family to support."", ""If you're not confident in choosing/picking stocks, you can consider putting monthly debits into VWRA (if you don't mind global exposure and currency risk), or a more local ETF (I'm sure some other posts here would recommend some). You can also consider Stashaway's other investment portfolios to invest over a longer horizon (I personally put in money monthly into their 36% risk global portfolio).\n\nOf course the most cost efficient way is to pick your own stocks to invest in, but you have to be able to live with your choices and do lots of research.\n\nImportantly make sure to hold cash that's approx 6mth of your expenditures for emergencies, and you can invest the rest quite safely (of course don't go yoloing all into bitcoin unless you are ballsy like that)"", ""A couple of thoughts. Stashaway simple gives projected returns, not guaranteed returns, meaning there is probably some risk of your capital dropping in value in the short-term. Also, not sure how quickly you can pull money out of it, so I'd be more careful calling it your emergency fund. Since you have kids and family, your emergency fund should probably sit in somewhere that is risk-free and immediately accessible.\n\n\\*\\[Edit to correct myself - Stashaway simple can be a perfectly viable option to leave your emergency funds, but as always, do your own due diligence before commiting to them.\\]\n\nThe amount of money you should retain as emergency fund will depend on your personal circumstances. 6-12 months expenses is a good rule of thumb, but do consider other factors like your job security and adjust accordingly. You need to make sure you can feed your kids and keep a roof over their heads if you happen to lose your job or have an unexpected large expense. You can invest the rest.\n\nYou are maybe a little overweighting Singapore in your investment. Your global ETFs would likely already include exposure to Singapore (don't know which ETF so can't say for sure here). It works as a basic porfolio, but do educate yourself more on the risks involved in doing this. The pinned thread in this sub is a good starting point.\n\nJust my 2 cents."", 'Just curious, why do you keep more cash in a current account compared to investments/emergency fund?\n\nIf you qualify for one of those hurdle accounts like DBS Multiplier, BOC SmartSaver, HSBC EGA, Maybank Family Plus, those accounts may be a better fit for your situation.

I also assume that your spouse's finances are separate, and that you are a sole breadwinner.\n\nDepending on your personal risk tolerance, job security, you might want to keep about 6-12 months X 3.5k in cash as your emergency fund, which works out to about 21 - 42k SGD. From that perspective your current cash balance of 25k does not seem too excessive. As others have pointed out, you might not want to put your emergency fund in any assets where your capital is at risk - money market funds (which is what Stashaway Simple invests in), while highly liquid and low risk, could still return negative returns in high stress events. You might want to put it in a high yield savings account that's capital guaranteed instead. \n\nAs for your remaining 1.6k, are u comfortable regularly investing this amount in the stock market? If so, I would suggest you regularly invest the majority of this in equities (60-80%) and the rest in bonds, depending on your risk tolerance. Personally I'm not optimistic about the returns profile of bonds given how low nominal rates are today, but I do think they have some value in reducing volatility in your portfolio nonetheless in times of market stress.\n\nWithin your equities, you should target an allocation 70-90% to a global ETF like VWRA and the remaining to a Singaporean ETF. The exact percentage depends, I guess, how optimistic you are about Singapore's stock market. Can research more into home country bias. Opinions may vary but you should probably not overweight Singapore as you are now.\n\nEDIT: I realised that you have 25k in your current account and 15k in your Stashaway Simple (which I treat as really a cash management solution). That works out to about 40k in total, which is about 12 months of your expenses. On the high side, but not ridiculous."", ""32% savings rate and you have 3 kids.

I actually did a lot of research on where to put emergency funds including reading the pinned guide in this sub. Ultimately I decided Stashaway was suitable to my needs. Now I feel I should put more of my current account money into investment instead.', ""Thanks for the comprehensive reply! I understand that Stashaway Simple is not capital guaranteed, but after seeing it listed in the pinned guide in this sub for emergency funds and having done my due diligence, I'm fine with leaving it there for now.\n\nLooks like I should think about allocating more into global etfs.

One of my TAs was a double major in math and physics and did a minor in statistics. Now he's gonna for a research in an ivy school. Same applied for careers too. But do take a minor that complements your major, else it doesn't matter to your employer nor your work.\n2. Another way is to go deeper on your major and take all those Level 3 and above modules. This allows you to be very specialised and gives you the upper hand of having technical knowledge. Yes you can clear level 1 mods here and there, but what's the point, you are just as average as the rest. Remember, nothing great in life comes easy.\n3. Lastly, would be to take language module. NUS offers a lot of languages upto as high as  Level 8, and these are internationally recognised. One of my friends was happy doing the modules on his sample schedule for his major, so he decided to focus on Japanese. And last Semester when I saw his schedule, we was already taking Japanese Level 4. This is huge value.\n\nThe key is to make sure that what you decide adds value to you, the field you're interested in and the society. =)"", 'Hi! If you come from JC you’ll have 8 UE’s to take for graduation, and in comparison, you’ll need to take 6 mods from a basket for a minor and 12 for a major.\n\nSo technically, you can take a minor using 6 of your UE’s and still have 2 mods to take whatever you want/are interested in. Furthermore, depending on your first degree and your second minor, some modules overlap, which means you can take less than 6 modules in order to get a minor.\n\nEssentially whether to take a minor or major depends on what you want from your uni! I took most of my UE’s from one faculty to apply for a second major, but I lowkey regret it cuz there are actually so many interesting mods out there that I can’t take now...\n\nAs for usefulness in the workplace though, honestly I still haven’t seen the usefulness of a minor at all. Although take my opinion with a pinch of salt cuz I’m not HR after all, but I personally think it makes your cert look nicer and that’s all.\n\nHope this (somewhat) helps! 😊', '\\^ i hv a similar qnn, is it better to take mods that are easy to score in, or take mods that are you are interested in? for instance ive seen ppl talk about how its not rly advisable to take language mods,,', ""ur minor won't better ur chances of employment.

exmj,o9i78u,Reduced Illustrative Investment Rate of Returns (IIRR) on Participating Policies,2021-06-28 19:18:06,singaporefi,19171,14,9,"Hi All, 

Would like to seek some advice regarding the reduced IIRR that will be taking effect this coming Wednesday.

Recently I got recommended a savings plan by my FA. The FA said if I find this product suitable for my needs then I should log on to the higher illustrated returns before the changes come into effect. 

Being unclear if the reduced IIRR would directly impact the returns of the plan (if I do take it on), I went to research on it and cross referenced information from LIA, financial bloggers, insurance group on FB. My understanding is that the reduced IIRR does not affect the actual returns of the policy and is purely for illustration purposes only. Basically to align consumers' expectations with the current and future economic outlook. The actual returns of the policy is still dependent on the insurers' par funds performance as well as other factors such as expense ratio. There are others but I can't remember them at the top of my head. 

While the FA acknowledged that the returns of the insurers' par funds shouldn't be affected, the FA also said what it means now is that the insurers only need to fulfil what is stated in the contract. The stipulated returns stated in the contract is what insurers aims to fulfil and anything more than that - they are not obligated. 

Can anyone share their thoughts regarding the last paragraph?

So does it mean under the revised IIRR of 3% and 4.25% , even if the returns for a particular year is great and they can afford to declare a returns rate as if it was still in the current IIRR of 3.25% and 4.75%, they are not obligated to declare anything higher than what's stated in the contract?

yaappyyap,nrcoop,[Uni] Journey of an EM3 student to NUS,2021-06-03 20:48:08,SGExams,77716,13,287,"**Shared my journey in NUS subreddit and was encouraged to post it here too. Such a pity I can't post in Singapore Subreddit.**

&#x200B;

Would I see myself where I am right now as an EM3 student in the past? Certainly not.

We are placed on a defined education track depending on our academic achievements in school. In the eyes of society, Express students are seen as ‘Smart’, Normal Academic (NA) as ‘Not bad’ and Normal Technical (NT) as ‘Cannot study’. Most EM3 students progressed to NT Stream in secondary school. If you performed well with stellar PSLE score, you may choose to go into the NA stream in certain secondary school. Express stream was out of the question for an EM3 student. With a PSLE score of 107, it wasn’t enough for me to go into NA stream. Hence I applied to one of the top secondary schools during the 2000s. Thankfully, my score was just one point above the minimum for the NT stream. My journey as a NT student began. I met amazing people in this school and I started to ‘wake up’ from my nonchalant approach towards education. I would say this is the pivotal moment in my education journey. Guess it is a blessing in disguise not going into the NA stream.

Most secondary school students moved on to Junior College and Polytechnic. However, as a NT student, the defined pathway is Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Polytechnic education was not something I even dreamed of. I would be lying if I didn’t feel demoralised, beaten and see myself as a failure in the education system. It didn’t help with the stigma on NT students and ITE. Naturally my self-worth diminished over time and I told myself to go with the flow and see how things pan out for me.

2008 was the pivotal period for me. For the same passion for football, I met a senior, 3 years older than me when I was in Secondary 2. He was from same secondary school in the Express stream, held leadership position and was embarking on his polytechnic education. We got along pretty well and hung out frequently over the next few years despite the stark differences in our education background and social economic status. Knowing that I will be entering ITE after my ‘N’ levels, he introduced me to his polytechnic classmate who was an EM3, NT and ITE student and made it to polytechnic. I was impressed and inspired to follow his footstep. This was the moment when I knew that polytechnic education was still possible for me.

At some point in 2008, my dad passed on after battling cancer for more than a decade. I questioned myself, ‘was my father ever proud of me when he was around?’. I could not think of any moment that would have made my father proud, none at all. I was mischievous during my primary school days, loitering around and education certainly wasn’t my priority at all. The timing was perfect for a change in outlook and my priorities. I was determined to do well in my studies, progress to ITE and moved on to polytechnic. This would be an achievement my father would love to witness if he were still around and hopefully he would be proud of me, for once.

I entered ITE with the goal to focus on my studies and progress to polytechnic. University at this point was not on my mind. 2 years later, I graduated with a Nitec with Merit and moved on to a polytechnic. Initially I was afraid I could not cope with the curriculum in polytechnic as the ‘O’ level cut off point was about 13 and required a good command of English language. I did not have any ‘O’ level credentials unlike most of my peers and the English syllabus in NT stream was definitely not as comprehensive compared to the Express stream. Fortunately, my first semester GPA was about 3.6 and I felt relieved and motivated. At the same time, I thought this is going pretty well and I continued to be driven to maintain the GPA, hopefully get a placement in a local university. During my time, the GPA cut off point for some university courses were about 3.6. Fast forward 3 years later, I graduated with a Merit and a GPA of about 3.7 and I was extremely delighted because it meant that I could apply for local university.

However, I applied to National University of Singapore (NUS) 3 times and failed all 3 attempts, during my polytechnic graduation year, 1st year in NS and ORD year. The cut off point for the university course was about 3.6 – 3.7 if I remember correctly and one of the requirements was a pass in ‘O’ Level English. I was clueless and pondered to myself, ‘could the rejection due to my lack of ‘O’ level credentials?’. I even thought of sitting for a ‘O’ level English exam in order to fulfil the requirement. I appealed and thankfully I was invited to a discretionary admission interview. I am glad that the interviewers had faith in me and were inspired by my resilience. I was eventually offered a place in the university. Now that I have unofficially graduated (With a second upper class), I guess it is worthwhile to look back on my education journey.

‘I believe you will make it to a local university. When you graduate, I will be there.’ – From my secondary school teacher as I was preparing for my ‘N’ Levels (NT) back in 2010. Such a simple encouragement but had so much meaning.

This sharing should not be construed in a way that academic achievements/milestones as the sole indicator for success. It certainly does not mean that if you do not excel in the education system, you are not successful. I know people who are doing well in life without excellent education credentials. ‘Success’ is subjective, and the criteria varies with individuals. We are successful in our own ways. And I certainly do not see myself successful yet, merely completing my formal education journey.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nrcoop/uni_journey_of_an_em3_student_to_nus/,"[""I love it when people started from the bottom and climbed their way up to the top despite obstacles faced in life.

There's only so much you can plan, but it is still good to have a rough idea of what you are going for.  \n\nTo fulfil a minor you have to take the modules stated for that particular minor (like 20 MCs), which are very different depending on the minor. Some you have to take fixed modules A, B, C, D, E. Some you get to pick a few out of a dozen options. These modules usually would be taken as a UE. In some cases, there may be modules that just so happen to fulfil your major, as well as your minor, and you may be able to double count them. But there's always exceptions and stuff so you still have to check everything they say on the website.  \n\nI wouldn't call it bidding for modules but more of balloting. You still select which modules you want, and it allocates based on priority scores that are calculated for everybody who wants the module (including year of study, ranking given to the module, requirement for major/2nd major/minor etc). Those with higher priority will definitely get the module, then the remaining slots, for those with multiple people of same priority balloting for these limited slots, it's random."", 'you can go google how minors work, all the information is on NUS website. you can wait for CHS to do the academic briefing to know how and what to bid for.

vanessalimmjy,nnpqgp,[UNI] What is the percentage of NUS CS graduates who actually make it into FAANG + ByteDance + Grab + Shopee + Sea + other companies paying >5k. And what is the career progression like? Any glass ceilings etc.,2021-05-29 23:25:42,SGExams,77716,26,126,"Computer science has become a very popular course of study in recent years partly due to the high starting pay. I do have some questions regarding this and hope those in the industry could shed some light.

1. I have read through a couple of post on reddit and although many have covered the renumeration of various companies, I haven't really seen one about the chances of getting in to each company, so I thought it might be good to start a thread so those in the industry could share some statistics for juniors to make a more informed decision about going into CS because as much as everyone wants to, not everybody will get into FAANG/ByteDance/Grab/Sea/other top paying company, Some will have to settle for less well-known companies or those that pay <5k etc. Would it be something like 5% FAANG, next 10% ByteDance, next 35% sea/shopee/grab/other top companies? Rough estimates of percentages would be greatly appreciated.
2. Could these percentages drop rather drastically since the effects of the sudden increase in CS places in Singapore universities are just about to take effect. Also I understand that big tech companies have been aggressively hiring as they are just setting up offices in Singapore in the last 1-2 years (initial hires), but surely they can't keep hiring 50/year every year right? there's not gonna be enough space in the office or something  + opening of economy in the next year or so after covid could allow more foreigners to apply for tech roles and migrate here as well? (Since one reason for the drop in supply of SWE was due to covid --> lesser foreigners)
3. What is the career progression or salary increment like as a SWE at these firms? I understand that there are only that many ""positions"" in senior tech roles and not everyone is going to get there, those that are good will be promoted, those that aren't will remain (its like a pyramid at most companies). But out of all the fresh graduates, approximately what percentage will make it senior tech roles.
4. I have heard of ageism in the tech industry, not sure if this is true in the Singapore context. Anyone has any comments on this?

Now I am aware that there are flaws in my questions and that every tech firm overall still contributes to the economy and we shouldn't compare them this way etc and people will say stuff like

""follow your passion, money isn't everything""

""your chances of getting in is dependent on your aptitude and projects, not whether you are top \_\_\_% in the cohort.

But I'd hope to leave these out of the conversation for this post. I'd just like to get a general idea of the statistics in this industry. Much like other industries like law where a set maybe 40% of lawyers get into  Big 4 or medicine where 20% get to specialise? (Now I have just plucked these numbers out from the air so they might be completely wrong as well). I believe this post will also help future batches to really consider their courses clearly as currently so many people are saying I wanna join CS and get into FAANG -.- without understanding that the odds are against them.

I *think* (emphasis on think) foodpanda is more lenient on new grads than Grab. The hardest one to get into in my experience is ByteDance.\n2. I doubt the increase in CS grads would affect the chances much, since the interviews at all these companies are still difficult - not everyone will succeed (and that's totally fine).\n3. The increments are pretty good. For e.g., before COVID hit, you could get around 10% increment yearly at Grab, and even more if you were promoted.

Allow me to share a fresh perspective, especially for the benefit of uni undergraduates hoping to enter the world of big tech :)\n\nPersonally, I graduated from NUS with a degree in business and engineering (2nd uppers only) and found a starting job in a bank paying SGD $ >5k. I quickly realized that while wealth management was a lucrative career, I was more interested in building tangible products and decided to make a switch from the finance sector to technology. \n\nSince **I did not have a CS background**, my software engineering was mostly self-taught and I built a whole bunch of fullstack passion projects like a stocks tracking mobile app, stocks news aggregator app, e-commerce website, indie game, etc. After 2 years I finally made the switch to the tech industry and managed to land offers with several non-FAANG, but still top-paying tech firms (eg. Cisco, SEA, Grab, ByteDance, etc). I eventually accepted the offer from ByteDance with a salary increment of >30% from what I was getting at the time -- and this was during COVID! Notably, Grab offered me about a 25% increment which was pretty good considering my base salary by then was more than my fresh grad pay (I won\'t elaborate too much for the sake of confidentiality).\n\nThe takeaway from my experience above would be that **your university degree doesn\'t necessarily dictate your career trajectory** and that **passion and determination will take you a lot further** than simply saying, ""I wanna join CS and get into FAANG"". Interviewers in my personal experience would be more impressed by what you did with all the academic knowledge you have learnt and how you translated them into real-world products with applications, as opposed to simply looking at your degree and thinking to themselves, ""oh yeah, this candidate has the prerequisite knowledge, come aboard"". So even though I know you already said you didn\'t want to hear this cliche... **I truly believe that at the end of the day, it\'s still most important to follow your passions hahaha! XD**\n\nRegarding the difficulty of landing all these offers, I can confirm what many of the other replies below have said -- all the technical interviews are difficult, and most of these top paying tech firms have 3-4 rounds of challenging technical interviews, which means it\'s really hard to pass everything by sheer luck, you have to make sure you\'re technically competent! These days, just doing leetcode and hoping to pass medium level algorithm questions isn\'t enough anymore. While most of the technical interviews I faced were algorithm based, there were a few curveballs like asking me to build app features on the spot (software development based) using the company\'s open APIs, asking me to design a system based on some product requirements, and throwing random code snippets at me to optimize for them. This points towards a growing trend of testing candidates on their practical development abilities as opposed to pure problem-solving ability as in the case of algorithm questions. So don\'t just focus on being a leetcode algo master, it\'ll also payoff to work on your own passion projects or doing more startup internships to build that practical handson experience!\n\nThis post ended up being way longer than I intended it to be... I hope it helps my juniors out there make better decisions with regards to their education and careers. Cheers! :)', '1. not sure about that, but actually the median is about 5k (i know it’s slightly higher than it should actually be) so probably the majority are going into SMEs (aka not FAANG etc) and earning that amount, with the top few % going into FAANG etc and earning waaayyy more\n\n2. don’t think so, at least not because of covid, simply because covid only took effect in the last year +, so prior to this there were already foreigners in the equation. also if foreigners can come in, don’t forget singaporeans can also take on jobs from the whole world given the nature of software jobs. not to mention the huge huge lack of skilled tech talent (some 2000+ uni tech grads only every year) and sg’s strict rules on import of migrant talent. \n\nabout general spike in cs grads in the coming years: i spoke to a few professors, and they mentioned that it is highly unlikely the supply is going to overtake the demand. (moreover one prof mentioned that the cs industry has been claimed to be saturated since he was in secondary school which obviously isn’t the case, so such hearsay isn’t going to be a very good gauge i would think?) plus we are all headed into digitalisation, and i think we are still very much in the infant phases, so there should be strong growth in demand for tech grads to drive this change. plus there are always new technologies coming out (self driving cars to name one) so more talent will be needed. automation is also geared to take over some 60% of jobs (can’t rmb the real stats, but i did memorise it for gp a while back haha) so there will be tech grads needed even after the initial move to a digitalised world, to maintain the software systems and upgrade them in the future.', '1 & 2. The fact is that yes, the percentage of CS grads going into these top paying companies will see a hit when the massive batches start to graduate and foreign competition comes into play again. It wouldn’t be accurate or representative to use the current statistics so even though I know it’s what you asked for, it’s not going to be too useful and definitely not worth the trouble to find out especially with the small data set currently available.\n\nWith that having been said, the demand in the industry is certainly keeping pace with the supply, so I wouldn’t worry too much about over saturation and whatnot. Even the raw number of CS grads getting into the companies you mentioned should see an increase in the coming years, just that the percentage of the total graduating population doing so will decrease due to the large spike in overall numbers. Hope I’m making sense to you here.\n\n3 & 4. Note that you won’t necessarily be doing hands-on software engineering for the entirety of your career. It’s inevitable that some will be tapped for managerial positions and being the best performer isn’t really all they’re looking for in that case. Naturally, some will choose this track while others will prefer to stick with the technical stuff, and there’s routes for advancement in both cases. Salary increments are once again, hard figures that are subject to change over time.\n\nAbout ageism, I think the industry is too young to safely make any assumptions as there’s not many older folks around and those that are seem to be generally respected for their experience. I could see it happening I guess, but as with most other careers you’re just going to have to commit to upgrading yourself and your skillsets.

QualitativeEconomy,nv35ap,"Real Estate is a Non-Productive Asset, but it is necessary for Retirement in Singaporean Society",2021-06-08 20:41:55,singapore,378960,27,25,"Let's face it. In a land scarce Singapore, putting money in Real Estate is a non-productive and inflationary way to make individual gains at the cost of societal welfare.  


However I also think it is an unfortunately necessary evil.  


We should clarify why it is non-productive first. There are two kinds of capital, productive and rent seeking.  


Productive Capital are the investments that lead to the development or acquisition of assets, technologies or skills that allow new or more efficient/profitable methods of production/marketing of goods or services. Whether these new methods or goods/services are beneficial or not is another argument, but ultimately they are additions and alterations to the whole of economic activity, and under the reasoned guidance of government, it will probably work out to everyone's benefit.   


Rent Seeking Capital are investments that seek to extract monies by purchasing control of a particular element of an existing method of production, which is often a indispensable part of economy, such as land or water rights. These investments do not add to the overall economic activity, but instead extract out a sum that inevitably gets passed on, adding inefficiency and higher costs to the overall economy.  


All investments are a mix of both, depending on the circumstances. However in Singapore, Real Estate investments, especially REITS, private property and overpriced HDBS intended to rent to foreigners/PRs, are explicitly Rent Seeking. Take an industrial building for example, as private property investments pour into surrounding area, the land price of building's owner increases and the owner must pass on the opportunity cost of not selling to their tenants in the form of higher rents, which to the extent that they are small businesses, will pass on that cost as higher prices in their products. If the owner does sell however, the new owner will probably also charge higher rents to recoup their investment. If the land appreciation + rent increases are only local, the tenants may choose to go elsewhere if possible, but if it is a Singapore wide phenomenon, then must either pass on the rent fees or move overseas. For some businesses it is possible, but for essential local services like F&B it is impossible. Unsurprisingly F&B outlets suffer the most outrageous rental arrangements.  


Real Estate Investment is also inflationary, in that it increases the price of goods without adding equal value. From a supply and demand POV, this effect is obvious. Singapore's real (or politically motivated) scarcity of land creates a near vertical supply curve, where higher prices don't increase price by much. Hence when demand increases, the price increases without much change in supply. However this goes a lot further than land prices alone, as most essential goods are linked to price. Housing Rents (or Mortgage payments) is the most obvious, and Dine in Food because of passed on Mall Rental Fees. Export manufacturing goods/services must also work in rental costs into their export price, as well as the housing costs of their workers as a part of salary costs. Many goods contain a passed on land-rental fees. Given that Singapore is an international facing economy, uncompetitive export prices (and comparatively competitive import prices) due to inflation is especially dangerous.  


The worst thing is that this inflationary non-competitiveness is entirely artificial and 'unnecessary' because most of it arises from demand driven inflation due to Singaporean investment money not wanting to go anywhere else.  


However I think that unless Index Funds, Crypto or other investment alternatives gain the appeal and safety of real estate, this situation of Singaporeans constantly pouring their excess cash into real estate investments is a situation that can't be helped.  


The problem is that many Singaporeans with money to invest aren't especially suited to earning money from productive capital.   


Singaporean PMETs, as overworked as they are, don't really have the bandwidth to start a business on the side. The wealthiest PMETs also work for governments and foreign MNCs/GLCs, the former of which doesn't exactly prepare one to jumpstart a SME, the latter of which utilising (due to their size) too complex of production methods to mimic on an SME scale with individual investment. This is also not considering the more technical positions where productive techniques are acquired are often filled by foreign talent due to our labor policy of prioritizing technical skill in foreign migrants.  


Our local SME capitalists aren't in that good of a situation either, as preferential tax policy towards foreign MNCs has priced alot of them out from major productive sectors, leaving only subsidiary/supplier roles and the odd niches where MNCs don't find profitable enough. The profit margins there are often not enough to be worth the investment, especially the opportunity cost investment of PMETs that are used to drawing Gov/GLC/MNC salaries.  


We lack the time, energy and technical competencies to delve head first into productive capital and get our ROIs from jumpstarting our own business and going through the pains of producing, marketing and selling our own product. A tiring and dangerous affair scarcely worth the possibly meager returns.

In light of this, ""passive"" forms of income investment are more preferable, as they allow safe, steady and predictable returns on investment to take place concurrently with full time employment in lucrative positions. The king of this is real estate, with more ""active"" property management being less preferable, and more ""passive"" forms like REITS being more preferable.  


This is because the inescapable fact is that people grow old and become less employable, and the wage and lifestyle commanded previously by PMETs undergoes severe risk upon retirement. In the absence of their own business or strong filial contributions by one's children, the risk of destitution exists for the retired middle class.  


Stocks and other investment assets do exist, however they are exposed at least symbolically to the risk of sudden crashes, always fresh in the memory of anyone whose family member was affected by an economic crisis.   


CPF also exists, however as a cash based account, it is also vulnerable to inflation that exceeds its interest earned. The same goes for all other cash based savings, or variations of it.  


So that leaves Real Estate as the only asset that is confirmed to always at least keep pace with inflation, whilst also providing regular passive and retirement proof income streams in the form of rents or REITS dividends.  


What is achieve is individual safety, the cost is societal detriment. The worst being borne on the next generation that must suffer directly from higher rents, choose to have less children as a result of the resultant smaller disposable income/less time away from working to pay rent.   


This shrinking population effect should mean a demand side fall on rents and real estate prices, but since that would endanger too many retirements, it is likely that a politically motivated supply restriction on land/buildings will be engaged to maintain prices. This leading overall to a shrinking and less vibrant economy.  


This is ironic because as an Asian Society, we used to invest heavily in our children as a means to secure our retirement, financing them to have more children to broaden the base and better secure the silver years of the most elder. This is a form of productive capital investment. However as filial piety declines as a reliable route for retirement (for many reasons), the resultant retirement funds capital flight into rent seeking real estates achieves the opposite effect, increasing rents/housing prices and making it more difficult to have children.  


So it seems the solution is to have children and finance those children to have more children, but really how many of us can safely count on our children being their for our later years? How many families remain with the moral and emotional core that can sustain this kind of arrangement?",0.64,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nv35ap/real_estate_is_a_nonproductive_asset_but_it_is/,"['OP has flaired the post with the ""Serious Discussion"" flair.

What this policy does is that it ignores the very real **inequity** in beneficiaries.\n\nWho are the biggest winners in such a system? Those who own the most land. Not your old auntie and uncle who have toiled for decades. Its the wealthy who own GCBs and entire condo buildings that earn the most. Look at the housing market, there is such a huge disparity in asset growth. The increase of private property costs outsizes everything else. Even 4/5-room HDBs are getting much more expensive while 3-room resale prices are stagnating.\n\nSuch a system is **NO DIFFERENT** from a tax-and-spend. You are just taxing young couples and transferring it over to property owners, who **MAY** be retirees. But more often, they are also wealthy landowners. So why not just actually tax everyone based on their wealth and transfer it to retirees who actually need it? That way, you can prevent the inequity problem because you can choose to limit the beneficiaries to those poor retirees.', '> Real Estate as the only asset that is confirmed to always at least keep pace with inflation\n\nI don’t see where you got this from?  By RE you mean **residential** real estate right? Not commercial or industrial.  And by **residential** real estate you mean HDBs, and by HDBs you mean HDBs across all of Singapore, not merely the central locations? And you are saying that in spite of the 99 year lease system, HDB prices will increase indefinitely? \n\nApart from all the assumptions you’ve made, I would attack this one.  Why do you think that housing prices are not in a bubble and that they would never crash?  And even in the likelihood of a crash never happening, why would you think housing prices might not be stagnant for decades and years to come?  \n\nRecently, a unit at Bishan Natural Loft was sold for $1M.  If I am not wrong, there was another unit near AMK Blk 3XX also sold for around the same price.  But note that there has not been a thorough review of the buyers profile and income levels, so we do not know the full picture of the people forming the demand.  In order for continuous increases in housing prices there has to be continuous increase in income levels to support this.  But if the increase in income levels here cannot suffice to be the main proponent in lifting housing prices, then most likely the increases in price is based on pure speculation. AKA “I think prices will be higher in the future, so I’ll pay a high price now”.  But this might not be the case.  A current buyer might experience very significant difficulty in finding a buyer who is willing to pay a higher price in the future.  The huge gains in the tech and finance sector might not be here to stay for years.  Moreover, changes in SG’s demographic are huge and we have yet to see the effect of this.\n\nNow, this possibility might baffle you, but think about it this way.  The next batch of home owners are demographically very different from the current one.  Singapore has an Aging population and an incredibly Low birth rate.  People want to buy smaller houses and do not need as many amenities due to ease of transport and lack of kids.  There’s no need to stay in Bukit Timah so I can send my non-existent kids to a good school.  Work from home, gig economy, side-incomes have become increasingly common so I don’t need an office job.  An even if I did, going to CBD is not a troublesome affair as 20 years ago due to our good transport system.  Statistically, the average adult lives alone or with their spouse without any kids, so why need such a big house?  Even a 2-room could suffice.  Last but not least, I’ve heard rumours that Covid has attributed a series of supply side factors to exacerbate public housing prices for a long time, who’s to say things won’t be back to normal in 1-2 election cycles time?  By then there could be more cooking measures instituted by the government.\n\nI think it’s abit of an overstretch for you to claim that rising housing prices is a **necessary** evil? I mean, back in the day we had pension funds which served entirely the same purpose, yet this policy is no longer in place.  Elderlies could just sell their remaining lease years and just rent if they want to.', '> Given that Singapore is an international facing economy, uncompetitive export prices (and comparatively competitive import prices) due to inflation is especially dangerous.  \n\nInflation is a depreciation in the value of the dollar that stems from an expansion of the money supply. It is illogical for export prices to be uncompetitive when you have a weak currency, given that the Marshall-Lerner condition is fulfilled. Conversely, inflation makes imports more expensive due to the SGD buying fewer USD, or any other currency.\n\n> The worst thing is that this inflationary non-competitiveness is entirely artificial and \'unnecessary\' because most of it arises from demand driven inflation\n\nThis statement doesn\'t really make any sense. The increased price of land is not just due to demand-pull, but supply-push as well. Yes, you pointed out that land is inelastic, but it is bounded by the natural supply of land. Up to a point, you literally cannot increase supply unless you do land reclamation or invade Johor, unlike other cities where surrounding townships and suburbs can develop via urban sprawl. To claim that it\'s ""entirely artificial"" requires more evidence.\n\n>However in Singapore, Real Estate investments, especially REITS, private property and overpriced HDBS intended to rent to foreigners/PRs, are explicitly Rent Seeking.\n\nThat\'s just false. Wouldn\'t you say that factories are productive assets? What about shopping malls? A piece of land with a shopping mall on it is inherently more productive than that plot of land sitting empty. Housing does provide a productive use: To house people.\n\nThe *ownership* of land can be said to be rent-seeking, a la Henry George, but the development of said land into condos, malls, and housing is not explicitly so. Economist often call for a Land Value Tax on the *unimproved* value of land because it is economically efficient.\n\nTo quote Smith:\n\n>The rent of land, therefore, considered as the price paid for the\r\nuse of the land, is naturally a monopoly price. ***It is not at all proportioned to what the landlord may have laid out upon the improvement of the land***, or to what he can afford to take, but to\r\nwhat the farmer can afford to give.\n\nHowever, when you *build* improvements on the land in the form of tangible productive assets, the nature of that investment stops becoming rent-seeking. A farmer working on unimproved land is very different from a shopkeeper working in a mall because the property owner has undertaken the risk and cost to improve the land into a mall. As you pointed out, all investments are a mix of being productive and rent-seeking. Is it no wonder why LVTs are designed to encourage as much building as possible?', 'The government is actually complicit in the rapid rise of commercial rents. \n\nThe rise in rental costs is in part due to the falling supply of subsidized public shop space provided by HDB. According to https://ipscommons.sg/the-relationship-between-rentals-and-rising-inflation/, the number of HDB shop spaces fell from 30,473 in 1990 to 28,477 in 2014 in spite of the huge increase in population between 1990 and 2014. Without an adequate alternative supply of retail space, small retail business owners are at the mercy of REIT landlords.', 'Actually, if you follow the basic passive investing principles and invest in diversified stock index funds with proper asset allocation, you will mostly do better than property and REITs.\nI have an investment condo, and I also invest in stock ETFs, and if I were to turn back the clock, I might consider  forego the condo and put all my money in the stock ETFs instead, less hassle and just let my investments compound.', 'I don’t think it is that sensible to look for a discussion and write three pages first. I do disagree with your premises - Singapore could easily make it less attractive to invest in wealth. Introduce - and increase - property taxes on non-owner occupied properties, etc etc.. \nbut at this point, your argument has already proceeded seventeen steps further and it becomes somewhat futile.', 'trickle up ftw', 'Exactly my point.\n\nThis system is unsustainable in the long term and also provides poor incentives for the economy.\n\nThe worst part is that like you said, the wealth lies exclusively in the realm of the already rich.\n\nProductive capital at least has possibility of a catch up mechanism, because someone with limited assets can still succeed via skill in production. \n\nHowever for rent seeking capital, ROIs are almost the same regardless of skill. Meaning the already rich will get richer at a faster pace than those that saved up from more modest means. All these without ever showing demonstrating merit beside being already wealthy.', 'I have stopped replying to this poster; he keeps getting the economics terminology and concepts wrong, and attempts to cast sociological concerns as economics problems. See my replies to his other posts.\n\nEdit:\n1. What do you mean by \'rent-seeking\'? It usually refers to the ""practice of manipulating public policy or economic conditions as a strategy for increasing profits"". I am not sure how ownership of land itself is rent-seeking.', ""Whoa you seem to know what you're talking about. Ok so what you're saying is that if you spend more money on improving the building then it's less rent seeking right, since you're improving the land.\n\nMy question is do you think that the legal rules governing REITs, which in Singapore is an extremely popular form of investment vehicle, encourage rent seeking? Reason is that legally, REITs are required to distribute 90% of their income to shareholders. This kind of structure seems to discourage using profits to do further investments on improving the land after the initial acquisition (in fact it makes this literally illegal).\n\nOf course REITs can get financing from Banks to do improvements, but you need to pay them interest, and banks are also much more conservative and there are gearing ratios and other rules governing how much the company can Borrower, in additional to restrictions in the loan agreement. Could this lack of flexibility and very low risk appetite perhaps explain why malls in Singapore feel so stale and boring?"", 'Yea but can you easily get 4x leverage with your stocks?

Economics and Sociology both refer to the same set of problems, the behavior of human beings in interaction with each other. \n\nHowever since you are so intent on traditional economics, we can do Smith\'s definition.\n\nRent is when: The quantity of good or desirable land is limited and those who own it can extract something from the consumer which is neither a payment for labor or necessary capital.\n\n(The Classical Base of Modern Rent Theory. Conway L. Lackman. The American Journal of Economics and Sociology)\n\nIn this case Singapore\'s land is limited. The function of property purchase (in its various forms). allows the individual to literally ""extract rents"" from people that don\'t own property but must use the land to exercise labor and necessary capital. E.g. a F&B business. \n\nIn this instance it is literally rent seeking. The other use of the term rent seeking, is to draw parallel to this more explicit phenomenon.', '> Ok so what you\'re saying is that if you spend more money on improving the building then it\'s less rent seeking right, since you\'re improving the land.\n\nTo an extent yes. An empty plot of land is basically unproductive, but once you build a mall or condo there, there is some productive value to it now, but that building requires money and risk-taking. I\'m not saying there\'s no rent-seeking, it\'s just that it\'s not as much.\n\n> My question is do you think that the legal rules governing REITs, which in Singapore is an extremely popular form of investment vehicle, encourage rent seeking?\n\nI really don\'t know. REITs are liquid and seen as ""risk-free"" investments delivering returns by the older folk, and that\'s my main problem with REITs since it\'s being treated the same way as bonds. In that way, I think REITs encourage speculation.\n\nI\'m not very sure about the legal stuff of REITs, but one way I can look at it is by comparing it to stocks. Warren Buffett\'s Berkshire has never paid a dividend because Warren Buffett believes in reinvesting into new projects, investments, etc. We can say that that is economically productive, especially when Coca Cola builds a new factory. Like you said, REITs doesn\'t have that, which means that money can\'t be spent on economically useful activities. From that angle, REITs are definitely not as productive as other assets.\n\n> Could this lack of flexibility and very low risk appetite perhaps explain why malls in Singapore feel so stale and boring?\n\nI think it\'s just a tried and proven solution. So far, this formula has worked and so there is no reason to change it. Definitely party due to a low risk appetite. The investment climate here across the board is stale, and the STI/SGX are jokes.', 'Not with stocks per se but you should be able to do so with other investment vehicles.', ""Lack of valid alternative retirement fund routes.  \n\n\nNecessary doesn't mean it is a good thing. Polluting cars are necessary in the context of no valid electric vehicles. Its worse because there is no easy solution about it"", ""Yet again, another misuse of terminology that betrays the economic meaning and exemplifies the sociological bias.\n\n> Economics and Sociology both refer to the same set of problems, the behavior of human beings in interaction with each other.\n\nA false justification used by sociologists hoping to elevate the status of their field. Economics is the study of value; over time, we realized that it depends a lot on the supply and demand and on the perception of humans and animals interacting in the economic system, and took these into account. Economics tend to be *positive* than *normative*. On the other hand, sociologists study the interaction between humans and often make normative statements just like how you always do.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThe concept of ***economic*** *rent*, which you are basing your arguments about 'rent' on, arose from a fringe, or at best -- outdated, theory in economics. There is no point in even talking about it when it is already irrelevant in modern economics. I also like how you talk about economics and then gave a reference from a sociological journal."", 'I think you bring up good points about the mix. I do acknowledge that under certain conditions real estate investments can be productive. However I disagree that such conditions are prevalent in Singapore, though niches may exist. \n\nOn the whole however, I think very few retail or retirement fund seeking investors buy into real estate with the intention of improving the economic productivity of the property. Rather the intention is earn higher returns safely, the best way being not to buy unproven assets and develop them, but to purchase proven assets and extract rents/appreciations.\n\nOn the topic of having less competitive exports, if inflation itself is not a compelling method of argument, perhaps a better frame would be this:\n\nAs housing rents/mortgage payments increase due to a bubbling housing market, the minimum living wage demanded by workers increase accordingly. (especially for non dorm staying migrant labour, like S Pass holders, who make the decision to migrate after considering income minus cost of living expenses like rent). \n\nThis directly relates to the labour costs of export manufacturers. Hence if these exporters are to operate at the same profitability, they must either raise their prices or move overseas. Assuming they don\'t, this increase in price owing from an increase in variable cost of production will lead to a decrease in Singaporean supply, raising the price of Singaporean goods and thus the shift of the market towards foreign made goods as substitute.\n\nWhile yes there is a supply side on the land costs that relate to this. If we assume that this is because of physical land scarcity, this can\'t be helped in the first place, it is a ""natural"" agent. On the other hand the demand factor, being retirees investments into rela estate bumping up land prices and therefore housing rents, is a result of human action and something that can be avoided.', 'There are plenty of other ways. They just currently don’t exist because policy favors real estate and fossil fuels. \n\nIf we were to shift existing taxes from consumer and I come to property and fossil fuel, there would be loads of opportunity to invest in solar, storage and alternative transportation. There is absolutely zero need for real estate as an investment. Money simply flows to the highest returns - and its public policy which has dictated the asset class.', 'I already gave you an alternative retirement fund route: Tax-and-spend.\n\nAnd before you say taxes are bad, note that it is no different from an artificially inflating real estate economy that you are promoting.', 'If economists are those that look to their graphs and mathematics and ""laws"" of supply and demand, and see not models of previously observed human behaviour, but as arcane arts that somehow dictate future human behaviour by some magic force. That this mystic power somehow supercedes any logical or common sense reasoning by virtue of a secret ""scientific"" explanation provable only by the most obscure of maths and the more convulted of rhetoric and definitions. If your definition is as such, then yes, I would not consider my reasoning economic. \n\nIt is quite absurd no? Trying to pretend the landlord asking for rent is not rent seeking, and that the monies that is transfered monthly between him and the tenant is not rent. If arguing via good and proper economics is this kind of pointless sophistry, what use is good and proper economics? \n\nEconomic models are best used to provide explanations for observable human behavior and then hypothesising their extended effects. \n\nThe hypothesis, like any science, being open to corroboration or falsification from surrounding and future evidence.\n\nIn this case the human behaviour is an insecurity about retirement prospects in addition to disposable income arising from profitable employment leading towards channeling of these monies into specifically real estate assets given the political and economic conditions around real estate rendering it a particularly attractive option with no close alternatives. The characteristics of real estate assets however may lead to certain follow up effects on the rest of the economy according to supply and demand (positive), which may not be optimal (normative).', 'I completely and totally agree with you.\n\nOnce the alternative productive investment options which are feasible to take up for the majority of Singaporean middleclass come into light, we may see the government shift policies to favor them. The ""necessity"" would then disappear.\n\nJamus Lim has been advocating pretty hard for education to be one such avenue, and while I kinda agree with him, the normative ways Singaporeans invest in education (i.e. that of their children) does appear to have a degree of saturation.\n\nThe final issue is that an retirement aimed investment alternative that matches real estate in safety, passiveness, ease of access and rate of return does not yet exist in Singapore. This is probably the fault of public policy also tbh like you mention, because if PAP was more willing to regularly shake the market supply side, real estate would not be as ""safe haven"".\n\nI earnest hope ETFs can one day reach this status, and maybe they will. I\'m only modestly familiar with them and hope they don\'t come with their own can of worms', ""To be absolutely clear I am against real estate investment as much as you. Merely just stating the conditions that make it so painfully and seemingly unavoidably attractive for individual investors seeking to secure retirement safety. \n\nOn that topic I do mean alternatives vis a vis the decisions of individual investors rather than on a governmental scale. While yes government decision making has a role to play, they only half the equation. The main driving force is the decision of the Singaporean masses to invest in specifically real estate as a retirement option, because on an individual level it appears by far the best option to secure a safe retirement. \n\nIf the government is willing to tax and spend, it may prevent pursuing such an option from becoming necessary. However the issue is that for the retirement question, the individual investor say age 35, needs to be confident not in just the current government to pursue this tax and spend policy effectively, but also that the government 35 to 50 years from now will also be at least equally as committed and effective. That, given the decline in PAP's popularity, is quite the hurdle.\n\nSingaporeans lead lives of significant precarity, as per the tenets of meritocracy. From the beginning of our education, we are taught that our system is one where survival is only owed to those who can win it through merit and performance, and relative poverty awaits those without merit. Extending from education to workplaces to even the affection/loyalty of our own families. \n\nHowever the undeniable truth is that  people grow old, weak, senile and useless eventually. With this comes the loss in merit, in usefulness to others. When such a day comes, how can one ensure they will not be abandoned to destitution? Many can't even trust their own children to respect/ look after them once they have outlived their usefulness. In times like this, the allure of real estate ownership and its perceived safe rents is undeniable. You can't trust the government, you can't trust your employer, you can't trust the world economy, you can't trust your own family. But land (real estate) in a land scarce nation, you can definitely rely on.\n\nBut this kind of thinking will be the downfall of all of us."", 'I understand your point. You trust real estate more than the longevity of a welfare policy. That is a fair assessment.\n\nBut I am not as confident. To me, real estate is just as precarious as policies. The rising prices are, in part, a direct result of policy. Demand for land, for example, is a function of immigration too. So I would be equally skeptical of land prices as I would be for welfare policies if we do not know what the govt in 15 year is planning to do. I think it is a mistake to take rising land prices as a political certainty.']"

This is cos I heard that poly students tend to struggle with the content in uni, especially the math 😭 (though I'm sure it depends on the individual too) so I thought it'd be good to start catching up early!! 

SOOo to the JC peeps taking H2 math & phys, what advice and methods would you recommend to someone trying to self-study these subjects?

Should I try to look for textbooks or are the notes in the holy grail better? Where are some places I can find practice questions? If anyone has any good resources that can help beginners like me, that'd be super great!!

flora_cash,nyqvch,[POLY][Rant] Showing Exam Grades to The Whole Class/Cohort.,2021-06-13 15:06:00,SGExams,77716,17,29,"I'm in year 2 accountancy and finance and I'm still not used to how our test and exam grades are being shown to the whole class/cohort. I'm not sure if all other polytechnics do this but I think it's demoralizing to see your test score with your other classmates that do better. For mid semester and end semester exams they will post the results on the student portal, where everyone can see anyone's grades.

I'm not insecure, I do my revisions and I understand concepts very well. But it gets discouraging when you see your test score among others. I've complained to lecturers/tutors before and they tell me that they only show your matriculation ID and not your full name or register number. But it still doesn't hide the fact that the whole class will know that someone scored a C- among the A+s. Plus we have to name our assignments and homework with our student ID so the whole class can easily recognize your ID. 

I just think that it's demeaning towards students who aren't doing so well but are trying their hardest. Not only is it discouraging but also embarrassing.

Basically it lists the grades of EVERY subject of ALL the students in the class and we have to sign it claiming that our results are correct to be keyed into the school system. **So everyone will know how you did and you can’t hide.** They will do this at the end of every exam and it is very demoralising because after that everyone will compare who did better and who didn’t.\n\nThe school tried to reduce this competition by not showing the IGP in our report card but it made no difference at the end of the day because they still need us to sign the “long mark sheet” and it already says who is at the top and bottom of the class.\n\nI don’t know what is their purpose/hidden motive for doing this but it definitely beat me down more given the toxic classmates I had.

I recommend Bahasa Indo or German. The lessons are quite interesting. Just put in effort into learning 😃', 'Looking at it from another perspective, high bellcurve correlates to people already knowing or have been exposed to the language beforehand, hence it is easier for them to score. Not knowing some prior knowledge beforehand will therefore put you at a disadvantage. So if you think about it, what are some of the languages that are likely for people to have some prior knowledge? I will say Korean and Japanese, because of exposure to kdrama and anime. Other than these 2, the rest (German, Spanish, French) should be manageable, most people should start on a blank slate.', ""Take something you're interested in! But if you're afraid of the bell curve, just avoid Korean & Japanese. Lots of people taking those are already fluent.\n\nI've taken French 1 & 2 so far and I really enjoyed the classes!

If you know Japanese, it will be easy to learn Korean and vice versa (to an extent). If you know Chinese, you\'ll have some advantage in learning to write Kanji in Japanese, but there\'s no such benefit for learning Korean writing.\n\nIf you are proficient in French, you\'ll have a leg up in Spanish and vice versa; both are related. It might also marginally help you in German, but ""marginally"" is the keyword here. But the thing about these three languages (and Malay and Indonesian) is that they are all written with variants of the Latin alphabet, i.e. you know the writing system already since you write English.\n\nKnowing Tamil will be of little use in learning Hindi and vice versa, except maybe that you will be familiar with the sounds. The writing and grammar are very different and the two languages are not related.\n\nI know this is quite preachy and long-winded, but the point is that whether you find a language easy to learn (and score in) or not depends on the languages you already know.\n\nAs for things like the bell curve and competition, those are not things that I consider in taking a module, so I can\'t comment. What I do know is that Japanese and Korean modules tend to be crowded and highly competitive with many classmates having prior knowledge that they do not declare or under-declare.', 'I enjoyed Spanish and the bellcurve was ok imo since most people come in without prior knowledge']"

- is it possible to study on a scholarship overseas? what must i do to boost my chances

- which UK universities are more recognised in singapore? for job prospects

- US universities vs UK universities? 

- better to study overseas or local? experience wise & career wise

thank you :)",0.6,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/o5f41h/uni_overseas_universities_info/,"[""1. UCAS - for application to UK universities only. It's a uni application portal. UCAT is a test meant for UK/Aus/NZ medical and dental sch.\n\n2. Yes, possible. Good results + resume + interview skills. \n\n3. Depends on what course you're studying. Generally those top few in the Russell group are good (i.e. Oxford/Cambridge/LSE/Imperial)\n\n4. Depends on what you're studying\n\n5. If you have the money/scholarship to go overseas, or the course is not offered locally, then yes, do it. Ultimately, how well it translates to career prospects also depends on what skills/degree/work experience you have. Don't go to the uni solely for rankings; NUS and NTU are ranked pretty highly also.\n\nYoutube does have quite a few videos about these topics, and there are some threads on this subreddit that talks about studying overseas too."", 'Hello! I can answer some of your questions. \n\n1. UCAS stands for the Universities and Colleges Admissions Services. This is a portal used for application to UK universities only. UCAT stands for the University Clinical Aptitude Test. This is an admissions test for the Medicine Undergraduate programme in some UK universities. UCAT ANZ is for Australian and New Zealand universities. \n\n2. For scholarships, typically grades-wise (if we look at the top-tier ones) you need 90RP to be safe though I’ve heard 88.75 is possible also. You will also need a good set of portfolio ranging anything from leadership to community service to sports so that you can stand out from other applicants. Usually scholarships allow you to study overseas unless it’s a local scholarship where you can only study locally. \n\n3. With regards to UK vs US universities, you kinda have to look at the reputation of the university as well because there are a lot to choose from. Higher reputation means more established and generally better curriculum ALTHOUGH this may not be true all the time so you’ve got to research into every university and see what you like. \n\n4. There are many pros and cons to studying overseas and local and you’ve got to weigh them yourself and decide what’s best for you.', ""For scholarships you will need to decide if you're comfortable taking up a bond since the majority of scholarships for UK universities are bonded with Singaporean govt agencies or govt linked companies. Of course you do need good grades,  CCA  involvement, but you'll also need to show interest in the work done by your sponsor and be okay with a bond of 6 years to your sponsor (though look at it another way; it's a guaranteed job after you graduate).\n\n Unbonded scholarships for the UK are much much rarer and each university only has a few. The application process for these varies alot but it is very very competitive.\n\nMost UK universities in the Russell Group (a term used to describe a bunch of research universities which rank highly) are well recognised globally and in SG although once you go down to a certain point in the rankings, NTU and NUS are probably more recognised in sg. This is very field specific and there's some universities in the UK which are renowned in some subject areas although they may be ranked lower overall. This is the same for the US too where some universities have specific courses more competitive than Harvard.\n\n\nUS and the UK follow very different systems although there are exceptions; most UK university courses are highly specialized and you won't have as much exposure to unrelated subject fields. In the US by contrast, many of top 50 universities have a liberals arts system or common curriculum which allow you to study differing fields and choose modules that you wouldn't otherwise have exposure to. \n\nAs for whether it's worth it; this is very student specific and depends on whether your wallet (or parents wallet) can afford it. Personally I was quite lucky to obtain a sponsorship to study in the UK so it was a no brainer for me because of the chance to experience a different culture and because for many career fields (mine included) the chance to start work in the UK an excellent opportunity. \n\nUnfortunately I don't know much about career fields for neuroscience but I did get an understanding for what sorts of doors my course and uni could open by looking through LinkedIn and what fields and firms fresh graduates from my university generally got into. I doubt anyone in this subreddit works in your career field so short of finding someone who works in that field you'll probably have to do the same."", 'ah i should probably have stated that i wanted to study neuroscience/biomed! neuroscience isn’t offered in singapore that’s why i’m looking more into it !! thank you for answering :)', 'ahhh okay! thank you for replying! but just wondering, was your scholarship a bonded one? so far i probably have somewhat secured cca involvement part as i have a leadership role but for grades do they ask for all? i kinda messed up ct1 already :”)\n\nand how do we use linkedin? sorry if i’m asking a lot', 'Np! You can consider looking into the curriculum for NUS Life Sciences and NTU Biological Sciences to see if the content there appeals to you. From what I know, NUS Life Sciences does cover a hefty bit of biomed content, and offers neurosci mods that you might be interested in.', ""My scholarship was unbonded; it's not a unique one and not many are given out so you can DM me for more details.\n\nGrades wise I don't think it really matters if you can improve in the future; you'll probably be applying with your predicted grades so I think you just need to do better for your next few exams so that your predicted grades are good to secure a conditional offer with the uni you want. \n\nFor linkedin its basically a social network used by working professionals. You can use it to browse through profiles of people who graduated uni courses you're interested in."", 'ahhh okay! for university modules are they something we’re allowed to choose? eg we choose a selected few only or do we have to do all? sorry still abit confused :”)', ""For NTU it's a bit more rigid from my understanding...maybe someone can correct me?\n\nFor NUS, modules are pretty fluid; there is a range of modules that you can choose from""]"

yaappyyap,nr8wym,Journey of an EM3 Student to NUS,2021-06-03 17:01:39,nus,21235,11,178,"**Sharing my journey in this subreddit as I can't post in Singapore Subreddit.**

&#x200B;

Would I see myself where I am right now as an EM3 student in the past? Certainly not.

We are placed on a defined education track depending on our academic achievements in school. In the eyes of society, Express students are seen as ‘Smart’, Normal Academic (NA) as ‘Not bad’ and Normal Technical (NT) as ‘Cannot study’. Most EM3 students progressed to NT Stream in secondary school. If you performed well with stellar PSLE score, you may choose to go into the NA stream in certain secondary school. Express stream was out of the question for an EM3 student. With a PSLE score of 107, it wasn’t enough for me to go into NA stream. Hence I applied to one of the top secondary schools during the 2000s. Thankfully, my score was just one point above the minimum for the NT stream. My journey as a NT student began. I met amazing people in this school and I started to ‘wake up’ from my nonchalant approach towards education. I would say this is the pivotal moment in my education journey. Guess it is a blessing in disguise not going into the NA stream.

Most secondary school students moved on to Junior College and Polytechnic. However, as a NT student, the defined pathway is Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Polytechnic education was not something I even dreamed of. I would be lying if I didn’t feel demoralised, beaten and see myself as a failure in the education system. It didn’t help with the stigma on NT students and ITE. Naturally my self-worth diminished over time and I told myself to go with the flow and see how things pan out for me.

2008 was the pivotal period for me. For the same passion for football, I met a senior, 3 years older than me when I was in Secondary 2. He was from same secondary school in the Express stream, held leadership position and was embarking on his polytechnic education. We got along pretty well and hung out frequently over the next few years despite the stark differences in our education background and social economic status. Knowing that I will be entering ITE after my ‘N’ levels, he introduced me to his polytechnic classmate who was an EM3, NT and ITE student and made it to polytechnic. I was impressed and inspired to follow his footstep. This was the moment when I knew that polytechnic education was still possible for me.

At some point in 2008, my dad passed on after battling cancer for more than a decade. I questioned myself, ‘was my father ever proud of me when he was around?’. I could not think of any moment that would have made my father proud, none at all. I was mischievous during my primary school days, loitering around and education certainly wasn’t my priority at all. The timing was perfect for a change in outlook and my priorities. I was determined to do well in my studies, progress to ITE and moved on to polytechnic. This would be an achievement my father would love to witness if he were still around and hopefully he would be proud of me, for once.

I entered ITE with the goal to focus on my studies and progress to polytechnic. University at this point was not on my mind. 2 years later, I graduated with a Nitec with Merit and moved on to a polytechnic. Initially I was afraid I could not cope with the curriculum in polytechnic as the ‘O’ level cut off point was about 13 and required a good command of English language. I did not have any ‘O’ level credentials unlike most of my peers and the English syllabus in NT stream was definitely not as comprehensive compared to the Express stream. Fortunately, my first semester GPA was about 3.6 and I felt relieved and motivated. At the same time, I thought this is going pretty well and I continued to be driven to maintain the GPA, hopefully get a placement in a local university. During my time, the GPA cut off point for some university courses were about 3.6. Fast forward 3 years later, I graduated with a Merit and a GPA of about 3.7 and I was extremely delighted because it meant that I could apply for local university.

However, I applied to National University of Singapore (NUS) 3 times and failed all 3 attempts, during my polytechnic graduation year, 1st year in NS and ORD year. The cut off point for the university course was about 3.6 – 3.7 if I remember correctly and one of the requirements was a pass in ‘O’ Level English. I was clueless and pondered to myself, ‘could the rejection due to my lack of ‘O’ level credentials?’. I even thought of sitting for a ‘O’ level English exam in order to fulfil the requirement. I appealed and thankfully I was invited to a discretionary admission interview. I am glad that the interviewers had faith in me and were inspired by my resilience. I was eventually offered a place in the university. Now that I have unofficially graduated (With a second upper class), I guess it is worthwhile to look back on my education journey.

‘I believe you will make it to a local university. When you graduate, I will be there.’ – From my secondary school teacher as I was preparing for my ‘N’ Levels (NT) back in 2010. Such a simple encouragement but had so much meaning.

This sharing should not be construed in a way that academic achievements/milestones as the sole indicator for success. It certainly does not mean that if you do not excel in the education system, you are not successful. I know people who are doing well in life without excellent education credentials. ‘Success’ is subjective, and the criteria varies with individuals. We are successful in our own ways. And I certainly do not see myself successful yet, merely completing my formal education journey.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/nr8wym/journey_of_an_em3_student_to_nus/,"[""Please tell me you are still in contact with that sec school teacher from 2010!

SirPalat,n5y4oh,A Guide to the 3 Fund Portfolio and its Singaporean Variations for Beginners.,2021-05-06 11:27:32,singaporefi,19171,63,134,"Recently, I have been absolutely been obsessed with personal finance and portfolio building. But as I talk to my friends and families, I realised that investing is not very understood and the barrier to entry is pretty high if you are a risk averse person. So this is an attempt at making everything more accessible. For a fuller and more comprehensive guide, [the pinned threads are pretty good.](https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/j7f815/starting_guide_to_fi/) But I will solely focus on wealth accumulation.

&#x200B;

So how do you build wealth with the most amount of returns with the least amount of effort? You invest into a 3 Fund Portfolio. What is a Fund? It is either an ETF or Mutual Fund, they are a basket of stocks that are packaged together to provide diversification or capture the market or industry's growth. ETFs are funds traded on the open market, like the SGX or New York Stock Exchange, while a mutual fund is only available for people who are customers of various investment companies like Vanguard or Charles Schwab. I will be focusing on ETFs as those are the most accessible to most of us.

&#x200B;

When picking an ETF there are various things to consider, the most important is what is the ETF's goal? For example  VTI is build to capture the whole American market, and ARKK is meant to find the most promising companies. Next is the expense ratio, it is the ""fee"" for owning the fund, VTI's expense ratio is 0.07% so that means for every $100 you put into VTI, you have to pay 7 cents yearly. Another thing to consider is that the taxes incurred. In Singapore we are not taxed on capital gains or dividends (yay!) but we will have to pay 30% tax on dividends on American ETFs (boo) and 40% of your stocks will be taxed by the US govt upon your death. As such most people would advise you to buy ETFs on LSE as the tax on dividends is only 15%. (Note that only IBKR  currently offers low fees access to LSE. [Here is a brokerage guide by seedly](https://blog.seedly.sg/the-ultimate-cheatsheet-cheapest-stock-brokerage-in-singapore/))

&#x200B;

Now with all the background out the way this is the fun part. Building your portfolio, most people would follow the Boglehead method where you have a domestic fund, international fund and a bonds fund.

**The Standard SG 3 Fund**

1. ES3 or G3B (Singapore's Domestic Fund, tracks SG top 30 Companies)
2. VWRA (International Fund; Tracks 3000 international companies from both developed and developing world)
3. A35 (Singapore Bonds)

So each component of this 3 funds have a role to play, **ES3** is a domestic index, this is important as it uses SGD which protects you from currency fluctuations. If the value of SGD drops or rises, you still can pull it out when you retire and spend with very little impact from the depreciation or appreciation of the SGD. **VWRA** tracks the world market, therefore your investments are not solely concentrated in Singapore, so if Singapore stagnates or grows slowly, you still can benefit from the growth of other countries. **A35** is just a standard bond index fund where they group a bunch of bonds in Singapore for you. The good thing about bonds is that historically when stocks go down, bonds go up. So you are protected from an economic downturn a bit (Most people call this protection ""hedging"").

&#x200B;

**Americanised 3 Fund**

1. S27 (The SP500 (America's biggest 500 companies) that is listed in our local SGX)
2. EIMI (Emerging Index Fund)
3. BND (American Bonds)

Many people do not see ES3 as a good way to accumulate wealth as most of its top holdings are banks that reached maturity and are no longer growing and so the price increase is going to be low. So instead you can buy into the SP500, for the last 5 years it has had an annual growth rate of 17%, this is higher than VWRA's 13%. But the volume traded in the SGX is pretty low so maybe you would want to buy VUAA or CSPX on the LSE instead. EIMI holds developing countries stocks, good way to expose your portfolio into China, Taiwan, Russia and Brazil. BND is the same as A35 except its all in American bonds.

**More Risk, More Reward 3 Fund**

1. CSPX (LSE SP500)
2. VWRA (International)
3. CFA (Asian REITs)

Controversial 3 funds but if you want to accumulate wealth quickly and can tahan tanking losses during a correction, maybe this is the one for you. Most people would advise against having both CSPX and VWRA as VWRA contains all the holdings of CSPX. But if you want growth and trust America to continue its hegemony, this might be viable as you are increasing your concentration of US stocks. You will be less diversified but have a higher potential for growing your money (because USA has a long history of outperforming the world and capitalistic af... maybe even to a fault). If you are young and willing to stomach losses, this might be a good idea. Following the risk taking nature, instead of Bonds and their low annual returns, you might want to get REITs. Internationally, SGX is known for its REITs listed and we have favorable Tax structure to capitalize on dividends. CFA is more stable and has 7% returns since inception and pays out 5% dividends yearly. However it will not protect against bad economic times but REITs generally will not drop its price as much as other industries.

Typical 3 Fund (Thank you /u/tegeusCromis)

1. SWRD (All Developed World ETF)
2. EIMI (Emerging Market ETF)
3. CPF

SWRD is a all world ETF that includes all developed countries. This means it has Singaporean holdings but not China. Historically it has performed similar to VWRA and provides a lower Expense Ratio than VWRA. Good weightage in America but the lack of Taiwan or China is definitely a huge gap. That is where EIMI comes in, with good representation of growing economies it is really helpful. One advantage is that you are able to tweak the weightage of developed vs developing countries. CPF was pointed out in the comments as a substitute for bonds and it makes alot of sense but I will be wary of treating as such. CPF can be used to buy house or fund education, making it very useful but it would make portfolio building a tad bit harder as there are more factors to consider when financially planning. But if you are comfortable with that, it could be a good substitute for bonds or REITs

&#x200B;

These are just 3 examples of a 3 fund portfolio, there are other variations to this and some people might just put in money in VWRA and call it a day. To me starting early and young is a lot more important than getting the perfect portfolio due to the beauty of compound interest. If there is anything I missed, feel free to add it in the comments

&#x200B;

edit: One thing I forgot to add was the distribution in your portfolio. For example you could go 20% ES3, 70% VWRA, 10% Bonds or 50% ES3, 20% VWRA, 30% Bonds. It all depends on your risk appetite and goals. (edit: Not advice on weightage, just random numbers i pulled out for example sake). But if you are young Bonds kinda useless... the general rule of your portfolio should be (110 - your age) in % in stocks

&#x200B;

edit 2: Someone asked me why is diversification important. It is a way for you to lower your risk (If Germany baoza and crash, you have the growth of America and Singapore to save the value of your portfolio) and maximize your returns. (Lets say Russia suddenly do very well, the Russian companies in your ETF will grow you will be rewarded) But be wary of overdiversification, it might limit how much you can make (Maybe Post-Covid America is amazing but if you only hold 20% in them due to the other 80% are in other countries, you wont see the gains as much). In short, its all a balancing act. The beauty about this is that you can be as hands off or hands on as you want to be",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/singaporefi/comments/n5y4oh/a_guide_to_the_3_fund_portfolio_and_its/,"['Not bad, but odd to omit probably the most commonly recommended combo of IWDA/SWRD + EIMI.

I only got into the Boglehead portfolio after a friend introduced it to me and I bought into the idea. To be honest I only spent 3-4 months learning about the in and out of a boglehead portfolio and I mostly learnt it from investorpedia or John Bogle's book. So the idea that 60% of holding is diversifying was never mentioned. In fact John Bogle advocated for you to not hold [international stocks](https://www.morningstar.com/articles/977718/bogle-had-a-point-on-international-stocks). Vanguard reccomend 20% ex US stocks. I believe that the current variations of SWRD + EIMI are the result of Europeans adapting it to fit their situation since their domestic index is not the SP500 and VXUS isn't available to them. \n\nSo when I talk about over diversify, I am coming from a portfolio building angle. And I found that most new people I talk to understand the term over diversify the same way. I enjoyed you picking at my ideas, one part of why I made this is to have something at hand I can send to my friends if ever they get interested in investing.

I’m glad we can have this discussion.\n\nI see where you’re coming from better now. The concept of overdiversifying makes sense if your aim is to beat the market.\n\nI wonder if there is some contradiction here, though. You seem to be offering local variations on a Boglehead portfolio, in which case beating the market is not the aim. It seems paradoxical to warn against overdiversifying – a concept that only makes sense in the context of trying to beat the market – when you are really trying to teach your reader how to *track* the market.\n\nYou’re right that Jack Bogle himself didn’t see the need to add much, if any, international. But Boglehead thinking has moved on since then. Bogle’s view was basically based on his belief in American exceptionalism plus the higher cost of investing in international during the majority of his career and life. (In other words, it’s not so much that he wanted to beat the market, but that the market he wanted to track was US, other markets not being worth thinking about to him.) Not many of his disciples/successors today share his view.', ""Oh yes I definitely believe that having a Boglehead portfolio, you should aim to be the market and not beat the market. One thing that many newer investors look for is returns, and when I talk to my friends they want to know how to either maximize their returns or minimize their risk, depending on thei character. People who like to maximize their returns, I would especially empathise the idea of diversity as held in VWRA. But for risk averse people, they would rather make alot less and keep their portfolio spread out amongst the whole world. Looking from their perspective, that is diversification, because how much more diverse can you get than 1/5 of your holdings in each continents. That additional comment was to address this. When I encountered this, as someone who stock picks, I saw this as someone over diversifying their portfolio at expense of their gains. So at this point you aren't even being the benchmark, you are flying under it. \n\nI definitely agree that Bogle's ideas are outdated and when I read r/SingaporeFI I realise it la but I my foundation has been him so I guess I will always have a US-bias due to him. But even if you ask me now, I will still hold about 70-80% US holdings because I think they are that big of a juggernaut. I don't see other countries pulling the same returns as they do.

mealtimeregym,nkkpty,[UNI] Here’s what I wished I knew before entering University,2021-05-25 16:27:59,SGExams,77716,13,320,"Hellooo students of all ages! :) I’m currently a 3rd going 4th-year student in NTU, and I thought I’d like to share some reflections navigating through the many years of education thus far. I guess I’ve learnt some important things along the way and thought this may help people treading along in their journey as a student. This is clearly my opinion so do take it with some personal judgment and contextualization.

TLDR

1. Study is important, but study to learn.
2. Don’t study too hard
3. Attitude is key

(My background was Sec sch>JC>Uni for some simple context)

**1. Studying is important, but study to learn.**

Grades are actually important (but not the most important). This may be a tough truth and reality to accept in SG but here are my few cents - treat it as a learning experience. The ability to do well in exams ultimately should not emphasize how much better you are compared to your friends, but it should focus on your ability to learn and grasp new concepts taught. Too much bitterness and (unhealthy) competition is being generated from infinitely comparing with others.

Being a student is such a privilege, and it happens in the best few years of life - so I really feel we should enjoy it. Set your own goals, work hard for them, enjoy the learning process. Although some subjects are less enjoyable, discover your strengths, play to them wisely and it’ll be super useful working in dynamic teams in the future.

The grind in uni is a lot about consuming a large amount of content in a small amount of time. The ability to learn fast is highly valued here. In uni, the quality of lectures and teaching sessions drops quite significantly and great teachers/lectures/Profs are a huge bonus, not an expectation. The responsibility of learning and studying then mostly falls onto the student, so self/independent learning is highly important. Learning to Google is extremely important.

Before uni, it was possible to understand most concepts and memorize things. In uni, consider optimizing your time by placing a heavier emphasis on components with higher weightage and don’t seek to memorize everything. Train to learn fast, enjoy the learning and remember to watch your lectures with at least 1.5x-2x speed to have more hours in a day, hahaha.

**2. Don’t study too much.**

Explore things around you. Unfortunately, one of my regrets is not having explored other fun things earlier in Sec Sch/JC/Army. The SG education can sometimes (unintentionally) narrow our vision to pure theoretical learning. I think I was caught up by that and didn’t really get to explore things outside the classroom.

Things like design, communications, leadership, robotics, software development, machine learning are just a few things to look at. Having the ability and space to go beyond classroom learning is crucial for the future. All these are widely accessible for learning on the web, it just takes some effort :)

In the initial few months of uni, having a background from JC, I was trying to secure my As and trying to understand every single thing that was taught. Honestly, one day I realized the people around me were too smart so I decided to look beyond studies and explore all kinds of other things.

I participated in several hackathons (competitions to create software products) with hardly the skills required (ability to learn plays super well here), planned for orientation camps, played for my sports team in Hall, took part in meaningful projects to help the community.

You may not enjoy everything you touch, but it’s fun to keep an open mind and explore while we have so many opportunities to do so. Don’t waste it. My favourite experiences are talking about startup ideas with some tech-geeky friends over some pizza or Carls Junior, haha.

In my 3rd year, I decided to work on a website to solve a problem that my family/friends and I had, it’s something exciting I’m working on right now!

I kinda have dreams to start a YouTube channel too. Haha, but that’s always a laugh to me and I like to dream big, heh. (Any ideas on what to do? :P)

**3. Attitude is key**

Do I think that the paths/institutions I went through were important? Probably yeah. I’d like to humbly concede that your choice of school, course, and path will probably determine your future in some ways. Being able to see the big picture of education preparing you for future endeavours is really important.

As I advanced into uni, I realized that your journey is largely determined by yourself rather than the environment. If you’re too dependent on the environment, chances are that once you move on to another stage, you’ll likely be influenced by wherever you go. Attitude is a big word but it really encompasses a lot, like keeping a positive learning mindset, helping your peers when in need, humbly accepting defeats.

Just to share an experience, for all those getting As before coming to uni, don’t underestimate the power of NTU Engineering Exams that play full-time roles in destroying students (haha). I took a couple of Ls after taking some of these ridiculously difficult exams and sigh they’re really hard (really gg thermodynamics and heat transfer). Uni is hard. Life becomes hard. Our attitude then matters. Again, train to learn quickly from mistakes, move on, play to your strengths, and enjoy the process.

My uni life really flew by too fast (probably because I enjoyed it), so I hardly got time to remember the exams that destroyed me. Those are not too important several years down the road. Hard and soft skills that you’ve picked up, experiences that have contributed to who you are, along with your attitude throughout these years, are the important factors that will last for a long time.

IngelSoong,nxhjaz,[A Levels] Why is A Level Physics Hard?,2021-06-11 22:40:09,SGExams,77716,12,32," **Why is A Level Physics So Hard?**

A Level Physics will be harder because assumptions and simplifications are gradually being removed to resemble real-world scenarios.

Compared to O Level, there is a steep increase in the learning curve.

This is only natural.

Having now graduated from the top 20% of the O Level cohort, the syllabus is now made much tougher to further differentiate among all of you. (List not exhaustive, feel free to add more here or at my blog)

## Simplification of Real World

Learning new concepts always start by trimming away the complexities.

For Physics, one of the items that complicate the maths will be friction.

So O Level Physics and to a certain extent A Level Physics always assumes a frictionless world.

Objects in motion, in the absence of friction, have to move forever.

But this comes as a cost as such assumptions does not gel very well with the real world.

On one hand you are told Physics aim to help you understand our physical world.

Yet on the other, you have to fight to resist the idea that you are forced to study something that appears to be blatantly incorrect.

Here are some reasons:

### Misleading stories

Fake narratives like the famous Galileo’s experiment where he dropped a feather and cannonball simultaneously and found both to land on the ground at the same time confuses many Physics students.

“I thought there is supposed to be air resistance? How could this happen, when the terminal velocity of the feather is lower than that of a cannonball?”

### Gravitational energy formula

In A Level you will learn that GPE = mgh is nothing but a simplification when g is assumed to be constant.

Where gravitation field strengths changes in vast distances the GPE = mgh formula will break down and cannot be used.

## More Complex Concepts

As you progress in your education, more complicated concepts being introduced.

### Concept of field

The concept of fields, such as the gravitational field, magnetic field, and the electric field is confusing because you cannot see them directly.

However, we can experience them either directly, through the effects of gravity or indirectly where you observe things move at distance from a force.

### Free-body diagram

Learning to draw free-body diagrams can be a pain because you need to account for all the forces and their directions.

Students also find it hard to relate that frictional and normal contact force are components of reaction force.

Furthermore, it is also hard for some to understand Newton’s Third Law where the action-reaction forces do not cancel each other out, since we cannot feel the force we impact on other objects.

### Quantum physics

The need to start introducing the 21st century’s Quantum Physics may be repulsive for some when it is juxtaposed against 17th century’s Newtonian Physics in the same syllabus.

Imagine you have been rigorously studied Newtonian Physics and finally accepted it despite living in a world where friction exists, only to find out that it is not the gold standard for Physics.

New concepts such as wave-particle duality where waves can behave like particles and vice versa, or mass-energy equivalence, where lost in mass can produce energy are mind-blowing.

You have learned first about magnetism, then electricity, and finally the confluence of both leading to the phenomenon of electromagnetism.

Yet we should not avoid understanding this topic because the discovery of electromagnetism vastly improves our standards of living.

So in some sense, students should pray Quantum Gravity, linking quantum and gravity will never be established.

## The Need to Handle Mathematics

Students often complain about the presence of mathematics in Physics, such as Calculus topics like differentiation and integration.

The frustration arises because they are not adequately trained on techniques such as chain rule when used in the derivation of force as the rate of change of momentum.

So students tend to memorize the laws line by line rather than attempting to derive the final formula through derivation from first principles.

Mathematics as a subject exists in the compilation of common techniques to help solve problems in sciences.

For example, did you know Fleming’s Left Hand and Right-Hand rule exists from the cross product?

The cosine theta in W = F s cosθ exists because of the dot product.

Same for the magnetic flux formula Φ = B A cosθ.

Formula list like this might only help to a certain extent.

## Context-Dependent Sign Conventions

### Negative signs

Negative signs when used in Physics can be extremely confusing.

On one hand, when used in vectors they can indicate directions.

At times, they are employed to describe attractive forces, as in the case of gravitational forces.

Yet it can also be used to mean a decrease in scalar quantities such as energy.

No wonder A Level Physics can be confusing.

### Negative acceleration

The term “negative acceleration” is used in some Physics textbooks.

But the use of this term can mean different things when used in different contexts.

If you have set right as the positive convention, negative acceleration can mean deceleration in the right direction, or it can mean accelerating in the left direction.

In one case you are gaining speed while in another, you are losing speed.

### 1st law of thermodynamics

The 1st Law of Thermodynamics can be very confusing to some due to the way work is done W is defined. Should it be work is done on the system, or work done by the system.

Also, when will the negative sign be attached to W?

That effectively means there could be four permutations as to how it can be interpreted.

By the way, Wikipedia defines the first law to be U = Q – W,

where W is the work done by the system, adding to more confusion.

The correct way would be to think of how internal energy can be increased through the input of thermal energy plus work done on the system.

## Staying Conventional

The part about having discovered that direction for conventional current is actually “wrong” can make some feel uncomfortable. Such as:

### Temperature scale

Similarly, students tend to feel uncomfortable on the now preferred use of the Kelvin scale over Celsius, despite the widespread use of Celsius or Fahrenheit.

### Electromotive force

What exactly is the electromotive force? A force, or an energy source?

Legacy terms that can lead to so much confusion should be deprecated.

### Heat energy

Just like there is no current energy, there should not be heat energy.

Make a conscious effort to use thermal energy instead.

## Formalized Explanations

Because textbooks tend to be formal, certain concepts can be hard to understand.

It will be so much easier to explain why voltages in the parallel circuit have to be the same by illustrating the concepts differently.

It would be easier to understand that voltages are the quantity of energy carried by one Coulomb of charge and that any charges could only take one of the branching paths to travel around the circuit.

Since all the charges are pumped up by the e.m.f. with the same energy initially, charges in all the branches must have the same voltages.

To explain why adding a resistor in parallel, no matter how large, always decreases the effective resistance.

Say you are queuing up in a fast-food restaurant with only an ordering counter and a super long queue.

Despite manning by a super-efficient staff, the queue does not seem to move.

If a second counter is open now but manned by a newer and much slower staff, would you agree that this will still help in shortening the overall waiting time, albeit only by a little?

Hence, putting another resistor (even one with super high resistance) in parallel to the first always decreases the overall resistance.

redemptivewallflower,o2dwzv,What to expect in NUS Industrial Design?,2021-06-18 10:02:29,nus,21235,3,16,"Hello! I will be matriculating into industrial design this year and understand there has been [big] changes to the curriculum and structure of the course. Does the new common curriculum actually dilute the course? 

Is the intensity of the course like the kind expected and seen in architecture? I have seen numerous architecture threads here but not many for ID. 

I tried searching and digging for information but beyond the promotional stuff put up by the course and its students, can anyone [seniors and graduating students] give a fair assessment or personal POV of how the course is like [good, bad, & ugly], people, profs, how are lessons usually conducted during covid and just help to give a clearer perspective of what to expect if that is possible! How should one do their best to prepare themselves for the experience? I’d much appreciate it! 

I am aware the course is pretty hands-on and group projects are mainstays of the program, I’m an introvert so I’m not exactly sure how I might fit in if I’m someone whose battery dies out pretty fast hahaha 

Thank you!!",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/o2dwzv/what_to_expect_in_nus_industrial_design/,"['Hi!! I\'m in ID y2 this ay :) tbh my batch feels that the new curriculum offers a lot more freedom & choices & breatheable space -- so i think it\'s mostly a good thing HAHA I know some of us are really jealous of some of the changes ahaha\n\nArchi and ID have different kind of workload, I personally don\'t think we are as intense because I feel that ID profs really let us do our own projects and the expectations is mostly on you & the competitions of your own batch. Otherwise we are kind of free to submit our own concepts so the intensity depends a lot on yourself\n\n+ve small cohort = closer pals. I feel that ID being so small helps to ensure you\'ll know people slightly more than the surface level. But then again we are accepting more people now so experience might be different. My batch are honestly quite close and I think the support is really nice\n\n+ve approachable profs (mostly). In ID profs wont really spoon feed because like... there is nothing to spoon feed haha. Most of the time they will give you a brief, you research and build your concepts and then you run through them to get their opinions. I love most of my profs but that\'s also because I talk to them a lot, connecting with them helps :)\n\n+ve wonderful workshop technician. Try to be friends with them, they\'re your life saviours. Super nice, super helpful but please don\'t do last min work and burden them.\n\n\n-ve you can be very lost most of the times hahahahaha bc of how much freedom it really depends on how desperate you are to do well. Really need to prepare stuff for consults if not you\'re going to waste your time in class (quite a given but really you will have a lot of backlog 🥴)\n\n-ve timetable =/= how much time you give to projects. Some days esp nearer to submission days you\'ll probably stay in workshop till 11 or overnight :"") try to get healthy amount of sleep if not you\'ll crash\n\n-ve your classmates will probably be very very talented so there will be days you\'ll feel quite bummed bc comparing will be quite inevitable. On those days you have to be extra kind to yourself and try to find some good points, everyone have something they\'re good at :) Just try your best, most of the time your friends probably feel the same things you\'re feeling\n\n-ve some profs are very vague, I can\'t give any input in this bc then I\'d be very specific on which profs HAHAHAH so imo do qty works (sketches/ideas/mockups) then show them then you scale down and improve the quality rather than making sure you\'re producing quality works 24/7 (only some Gods can do this without burning out)\n\nFor covid periods we are divided into smaller groups of 8-16 for irl class. We still have mostly irl class the past AY. Can expect at least 1-2 offline days per week. ID mostly about consistency, you have to plan your time well so you won\'t burn out. It\'s honestly not that bad, but can get quite tough wk 6/ wk12. Since there are quite a few changes, I think I can\'t really say how the changes will affect yall but Prof Clement & will share more during IDC, other profs will drop by too :) so do join us if you can!\n\nActually for year 1 most of the stuff are individual projects :) For platforms i think it\'s another hurdle to think at a later time ahahah. Quite a few introverts in ID, and I think surviving just fine. (Honestly again really depends on your batch and partners :"") )\n\nAn advice given by my senior is ""Done is better than perfect"" and I think it helps to hold that thought, you\'ll always have something to improve, so don\'t be too harsh on yourself.\n\nHope you will have a good time in ID :) hmu anytime \n\nPs if this is very messy ahahah', 'Hey I can link you up with one of my buddies in ID if you want!

sour_lemonade26,noj2jy,[UNI] iPad vs Samsung,2021-05-31 03:53:48,SGExams,77716,10,15,"Hi, so I'm thinking of getting either the iPad Air (with the pen, or a ripoff of the pen) or the Samsung Tab S7 for school and was wondering which one gets you more value-for-money.

At first I was leaning more towards the Samsung because I'm more comfortable with the user interface but I heard that the S pen can be quite temperamental which is kind of a turn-off :/

On it's 7th year, it started having 'ghost touch' and it's actually unusable away from a charger just because it dies in like 2hrs.

Happy-Coast7987,no4hzl,[Uni] rejection from all unis?,2021-05-30 13:44:48,SGExams,77716,13,116,"hi! i’m matriculating into university this year and have had some friends who received rejection from universities and are stressed about what to do so i decided to compile some things that they have been doing in case anyone needs help!

these are things you could possibly do:

1. appeal to the universities! you can actually appeal to any course regardless of whether it was in your choices or not. of course the chances are low but you never know if you never try!

2. apply for private universities such as SIM
GE/ Kaplan. i realised that many people have misconceptions about private universities - too expensive no job prospects etc. but if you research well enough, there are actually affordable options (30-70k for the whole
journey) and honestly many graduates do earn a decent starting salary so there’s no harm trying! most of the applications close either on 31st may or early june so please decide ASAP 

3. if you’re not interested in private uni/ want a specific dream course maybe you could try retaking A levels again (institutes like MDIS offers preparatory courses!) you could look into taking the SATs etc as well! (not necessary unless you can handle the workload?) edit: for SATs please check on whether the unis you’re interested in allows to use it first (refer to comments below for further clarifications!)

4. if you don’t want to face the same A level trauma then looking into polytechnics with diplomas of your interests work! not sure about the application process of this though so if anyone has experience in doing this please do share! edit: you can do so using your O level results for the upcoming October intake 

5. overseas universities are an option and some do offer foundation year (especially in Australia) but may require additional tests such as IELTS so you could research more into that as well! it’s pretty costly though averaging to about 70k-100+k/ year depending on the course! 

this may be information that’s pretty much known already haha but the point of sharing this is to tell anyone that’s facing this situation that it is really not the end and that you’re not alone in this journey!

1. how is sji’s environment/culture (batch bondedness, super serious and stressful or more lax, elitism, school spirit, strictness etc.)
2. what’s the typical school schedule of an acsi student and a sji student (school hours, extracurriculars etc.) 
3. the sji facilities!! 
4. quality of the various departments in both schools 
5. can we choose our own ee and tok topics?

thank you",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/n29azc/ib_acsi_vs_sji/,"[""you can actually search the past subreddit posts, there have been quite a number of such threads asking for comparisons, but anyways i was from sji so i'll answer your qns\n\n1. sji has a super small batch size (280-300), very strong school spirit and community spirit, you can expect a very close knit community. most ppl are serious about their studies, for my batch alot of ppl tended to stay back late in school to study together/grind out submissions together. on the night of my EE final submission we had about 70-80 of us that stayed back at the school foyer area to grind out our EE and provide each other support. there's no elitism, discipline i wouldn't say it's too strict but a reasonable level. honestly i had a really good time there, and alot of it was cos of the community that was in sji, don't think you can go wrong with sji at all\n\n2. depends on how much CASes you have, I only had one weekly one that was once per week so I'd be done after my classes ended most days, which is between 2.30pm and 4.30pm usually for most people. if you're in a competitive sports CAS like ultimate frisbee, dragonboat or soccer, you'd have training about 3 times a week (sometimes more/on weekends too) and they'd end about 7pm on days with training. on days with CASes i'd wrap up about 7pm, but i'd usually stay back to study some days, especially in year 2 and leave sch about 7pm on average. for most of my final submisisons for eetokia i'd stay back pretty late, past 10pm. i stayed until midnight for my tok essay final submission.\n\n3. it's average? i'm not really sure how to answer this but sji provides all the facilities you'd need for a normal school life. if you're asking about the classrooms, the j2 form class classrooms have aircon, the j1 ones don't. yall will use different form classes for different subjects (and sci labs for sciences), the j1/2 form classes are on level 6/5 respectively so just be prepared to climb alot of stairs (or just don't get busted taking the lift honestly lol)\n\n4. everything is ok except for the bio dept which is not that great (it's not terrible but it's not that good), for bio you probably do more self studying than any other subject. idk if it's still the case now but that was the case in my year. from what i can remember most the rest of the subjects have pretty solid teachers (again, from my year)\n\n5. for EE, yes - subject to approval by your mentor but normally what u want u can probably do. sji also provides the option to do a world studies EE, which is an interdisciplinary EE focusing on global issues. i did a WSEE, if you have more qns on that you can feel free to ask. for TOK, presentation topics have to be cleared by the teachers and the essay topics you choose one of the 6 topics set by IBO for each exam session."", 'Hi I might be qualified to answer this because I was from ACSI express track and then went to SJI through JAE, despite being able to go to ACSI at that time.\n\nA lot of people, and myself included, chose SJI over ACSI because they are turned away by the school culture in ACSI. Although what you experience in your secondary and JC school years depends greatly on your classmates, your personality, and your background, I think generally SJI is a much more close-knit and wholesome community than ACSI, which sometimes feel exclusive and segregated. SJI people, including the IP people, are very welcoming and inclusive, which makes making friends much easier, even if you\'re introverted like I was. My 2 years in SJI, imo, is way better than the years I spent in ACSI. Some of my friends (non IP) chose ACSI and did not really thrive there, although they are quite intelligent and extroverted people themselves. Some AC people can have a big ego and a lil bit of a superior complex, so I don\'t really relate to them that much. But if you have a big and stable friend circle who are all going to ACSI, you may fare better there.\n\nIn terms of facilities, SJI is obviously worse than ACSI, and the strictness is arguably the same in both schools. SJI will force you to climb up and down the stairs a lot, so be prepared for that... I think IB is a bit of a choose-your-journey experience, so how busy you are depends on your work ethic, as well as the amount of CASes and extracurriculars you participate in. If you\'re a good sportsperson or a distinguished music/art/drama student, I highly recommend you to choose ACSI, provided that you can cope with the environment and curriculum there. SJI (and IB) in general places an emphasis on independent learning, so there are a lot of trials and errors as well as determination to help you get through IB. Allegedly, in ACSI, there\'re a lot of spoon-feeding and ""cheating"" going on, so that the school can ensure that the students\' score are as high as possible for the sake of school image, but the expense of the students\' learning. So I\'d argue that SJI and ACSI have different teaching styles, and it depends on which one you prefer, and whether you want to challenge yourself. Regarding TOK and EE, SJI and ACSI give their students the freedom to choose their topics, as long as it abides to the respective requirements and that it is approved by the teachers. Something to note that I was not aware when I joined SJI is that ACSI offers more subjects than SJI. Subjects such as Business Management, Computer Science and Malay AB are now only offered in ACSI. \n\nDo check other threads and posts that talks about the differences between the two schools. I chose SJI over ACSI and it\'s a decision I\'d never regret. But again, it really depends on your personality, preferences and friends. If you have any more questions, feel free to DM me. Good luck!', ""Currently in SJI Y6 and I can't really say that there are many elitists. From my knowledge about the current Y6, Y5 and Y4 batches, I can probably think of maybe 5 ppl across the 3 levels mentioned. While many people in SJI are from the upper percentiles, there is very little, if any at all, class or race discrimination. Ppl really take sch community spirit seriously and as much as we may make fun of the sch, if anyone attacks the school or a brother, I know that many will be up in arms. I will say that most in SJI have a strong sense of integrity and right and wrong and from a school culture perspective its definitely one of the most supportive. \n\nFrom academic POV, its very self driven here. The onus is on you to do things for yourself, be it EE IAs or even setting up consultations with your teachers. While teachers will approach you if you are visibly struggling, in a normal case where you don't understand something, if you don't voice out they wont actively try to explain it better either.\n\nOne piece of advice for IB in general though: Expect the jump in rigour between Y5 and the early part of Y6 when all your IAs, EE and TOK is due to be larger than you think it to be. \n\nEdit to add: In Y5, we usually end at 4.30, but some may end at 3.30 (really depends on your timetable though as each person's time table is customised to them) except for tuesday, where everyone ends at 2.30 for CAS. In Y6, its reversed. We usually end at 3.30 instead of 4.30, but, (again depending on your personal timetable) some days may still end at 4.30. Tuesdays are still early days for CAS though. \n\n\nIn terms of CAS/extra-curriculars, I didnt really find anything lacking. There are plenty of options to suit most interests."", ""ohman I was from ACS(I) so this is quite shocking to me to be honest. I quite enjoyed my time there - I was express and then transitioned into IP from Sec 3 onwards, so I might have a slightly different experience from some of the rest on here. I felt that I was able to really enjoy my time there because the guys in there were so chill. It was kind of an happy go lucky environment where everyone could be themselves. So, on that front, I wouldn't have chosen any other way! \n\nOn the other hand, I can see why those coming through JAE might reconsider. We have a cohort of about 450 (?) and i think only 10-20% come from JAE so it is possible to feel like an outsider. But I do know of many people who fit right in! I think a lot of it is about luck, but from my experience, ACS is a good choice for you if you'd like a chill-ish environment where you don't want to worry too much about work :) \n\nDisclaimer: I wasn't too active outside of my class so I might not be in the know about any of the politics or rumours or nastiness or weirdly toxic environment going on.

gdbyeeelol,ny2wa9,[Uni] Pros and cons of studying locally vs in the US considering Covid?,2021-06-12 17:29:42,SGExams,77716,5,5,"I'll be graduating this year and I've been wondering if it's still worth it to even apply to the US considering the covid situation + possible racism due to covid. 

These are the current pros and cons I've thought of: 

Local: 
- safer 
- more within comfort zone
- keep in touch with Singaporean friends 
- stay with family
BUT
- might not be as challenging 
- Too similar to education thus far

US: 
- broaden my horizons 
- possibly a more holistic education 
- get to know people from more varied backgrounds 
BUT
- lonely 
- application process is very long (and realistically speaking chances of getting into a top US uni are quite low. On a sidenote, can anyone be brutally honest in telling me what are the chances I can get into a top US university? For some context, I am in a special programme in a top JC, got a SAT score of 1570 and my CIP is quite strong but on the other hand, I don't have any leadership positions + my grades are only slightly above average in my class) 

Feel free to correct me if you think any of the pros and cons listed are wrong! Thanks in advance :)",0.63,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ny2wa9/uni_pros_and_cons_of_studying_locally_vs_in_the/,"[""Pros:\n\nMight not be as challenging? No, sg uni known for difficult course content and bell-curve marking. Hence I'd say SG Unis are even more challenging than overseas unis.\n\nSimilar education : Depends of the Uni, SMU and YaleNUS is know for their seminar styled education, while NTU and Nus have the tradition Lecture Tutorial style. Well many US unis also use the L-T style education. It's Oxbridge with their 2-3pax tutorials that's really different and intriguing.\n\nCons:\nPossibly more holistic. Again depends, MIT CALTEC are Stem school at their core, and is limited to a all rounded Science education, with limited humanities elements. UK unis straight up forces you into a single major with no room for modules from other facilities. Liberal Arts schools? Sure, but YALENUS is also a Liberal Arts college.\n\nDo you really want to take your chances in the US with all that Asian hate right now? I'd suggest maybe wait a few more years and go there as a masters or PhD Student. \n\nBrutally honest : Very low chances. You need a good score THROUGHOUT your entire year 3 - year 6, ie (Sec 3 to J2). Every major exam results counts (Mid, end, prelim, promos, Os, As), and they need either a visible improvement, or As all the ways. (No straight As in Os but immediately fails in CA1).  Top US unis are looking for the crème de la crème in a particular country. So for example MIT takes in on average 2 SG students per year, and CALTEC on average 0. (Data from like 2 years ago when I was trying to see if I should apply lol). So if you don't have stellar grades, better have a banging essay, extraordinary life story, exotic origins, great extracurriculars, etc..."", 'If u can afford it, go to US unis. Doesnt have to be the top unis but a good enough uni with strong placements will do.', 'The Asian hate thing is a bit overblown by media, but lets face it, no matter where you go, its not going to be as safe as SG. Also, COVID seems to be improving there with the vaccine rollout and I think if you take your jab you should be fine. Ppl go US because they want to work there and that is the biggest advantage.\n\nAs for your chances, its quite hard to chance without something more detailed. Your SAT is up to par though. I think outside of leadership, you should have some academic achievements or interesting ECs. What that special programme is, what above average means could vary a lot based on interpretation so I wont make a judgement based on vague info.  If you organised the CIP yourself, thats good and it counts for leadership so dont get too worried if you dont have CCA leadership exp. You can head over to r/applyingtocollege, r/intltousa or r/chanceme for more info or you can provide a bit more specific info and I can make a guess as to what your chances are.', 'Top us schools r definitely more challenging than NUS.. isnt even close. Bell curve making and hard course content is not unique to singapore either.\n\nAlso mit is #2 in the world for arts and humanities. Stem is #1 still but many disciplines such as modern economics started there. It is definitely still probably better to do liberal arts in mit than say singapore. This is tbh the case for most us universities. They require u to take electives from stem humanities etc.\n\nI agree with u on the asian hate stuff tho. Singapore is so safe.. going overseas is daunting. Uk unis r also only for those 100% certain of their majors.\n\nEdit: uk unis r also cheaper and shorter btw generally', 'Thanks for the detailed answer!!']"

The pay would be about $93k SGD per year. I have a wife and an infant son. My wife attended NUS, but isn’t a Singaporean. There is a possibility for her to also find work although not sure about the exact salary figures yet.

Singapore isn\'t the most vibrant place in terms of arts and culture, to the point that this industry was deemed to be ""non essential"" during our lockdown last year and hence a lot of folks in the field didn\'t have work for a while. I\'m hoping your job will be more stable (seems to be the case since you\'ve been offered an annual salary).\n\n\n2. There is a sizeable Asian American community in Singapore which includes ABKs and ABCs, so you and the missus will fit in without much issues. Food would not be a problem either as you must have heard as well! Just come with an open mind and be reddy to embrace and assimilate into our community and you\'ll be just fine.\n\n\n3. At the end of the day, moving here should not put you in a position that is worse off than you are currently, especially in monetary terms.\n\nGood luck!', 'Some considerations:\n\n1.

It will not be enough to live comfortably unless your wife manages to find a job as well (which might be tricky with an infant son and no family support network). She will have to qualify for a job pass on her own merits, as rules have recently tightened on the ability of Dependant Pass-holders to work. Bear in mind you will have tax obligation with the IRS back home too. \n\nWorldwide the culture/entertainment sector has been hit hard by pandemic prohibitions against large events and concerts. Likewise for Singapore. Traditionally too this is a sector that isn\'t as hot as say tech or pharma. Advancement opportunities might be limited, though this very much depends on your actual field and scope of course.\n\nBut that said, if you can make the numbers work, Singapore is a great place to be and especially if you\'re hoping to raise your kid in an ""Asian"" environment. It\'s safe and very family-friendly.', ""I will get heavily downvoted for saying this but if you're an Indian I'd consider options very carefully because there has been an increasing wave of xenophobia and racism even before the Indian variant of covid was a thing.

For research, you need a PhD."", 'Biomedical focuses more on the manufacturing of medical devices like stents, pace makers, contact lens..etc as a chemist you’ll probably be attached to the manufacturing site to do testing in the laboratory and sometimes take part in investigations if the material doesn’t meet specifications. Drawbacks is that this industry are often located at Tuas region but most companies have their shuttle buses. If distance isn’t a factor for you then it should be fine! \n\nIf you want to be a chemist (i.e in the lab doing testing), you should consider a chemistry course rather than a biomed course. As chemist are trained in the testing equipment in school.(of course the company will also perform training) \n\nIf you enter a biomed course, will probably be an engineer or quality engineer. But then again, if you’ll need a phd if you want to venture into research.', 'As the others have mentioned, you really would need a PhD if you really want to have good career progression in this industry, so that you can spearhead research, rather than just doing wet lab.\n\n\nFor your first question — I think NUS Life Sciences is pretty good for this, as they do offer a Biomedical Science specialisation. You can also consider NTU Biological Sciences with a Second Major in Biomedical Structural Biology (if it’s called that hahah it’s a very long name). Personally, I prefer NUS as I feel the modules cover a wider range as compared to NTU, but you can always check both universities’ websites to see what you prefer! (You can also Google the respective NUS module numbers, as there’s an online database telling you what each module entails)\n\n\nI think your second question has been answered, so I’ll focus more on the third and forth ones. In general, any scientific industry is bound to be very competitive. The answers given are pretty good as to where biomedical scientists work, and one of the answers in this thread is focused more on biomedical engineering, which is a different field from biomedical science.\n\n\nLike I mentioned above, you really need to get a PhD if you want to progress your career here. While this process may be tiring and even landing a spot as a PhD student can be difficult, it’s possible and quite important for this industry. You can also consider getting an MD in your postgraduate years if you’re interested in practicing medicine! \n\n\nIn the end, I think there’s quite few career options in this industry and it’s very fulfilling! All the best :-)', "">Which Uni course is would be more suited to being a biomedical scientist?\r  \n\r\n\nBasically life sciences courses in NTU or NUS. Not sure about NUS Life Sciences (from what I heard it's difficult to get in but pretty reputable), but NTU Biological Sciences gives you the option for second major depending on what you wanna do, e.g. Medicinal Chemistry or Structural Biology. I suggest going to their course website for more details. Also if you really wanna know what the research experience is really like, I highly recommend you join some undergraduate research experience programme, like at NTU we have URECA and I'm sure NUS has their own programme as well.\n\n>Are biomedical scientists in demand in Singapore?\n\nYes but it depends on the field you're interested in e.g. NTU has a lot of faculty doing research in neurobiology. As pointed out earlier, biostatistics is the in thing now so it would give you an edge if you take up data science on the side.\n\n>Are there any drawbacks regarding the biomedical science industry?\n\nYou'll need a PhD if you wanna pursue the scientist route which in itself is a difficult and potentially expensive task. The PhD students and postdocs I've worked with before told me that not many people would do PhD without scholarships, which also means taking care of your academics. Otherwise, career progression can be slow and experiments often fail, but that's just the process of science. If you do hit something worthwhile though, it can be quite the game-changer.\n\n>Is the industry competitive? I don't mind it being competitive, just want to get some census.\n\nYes, but same as point 2 it depends on your field of interest and your competitive edge. Some fields are saturated but that's because it is a field in demand, while others are more niche with less competition but it also means difficulty in getting grants because it's a less profitable field.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nHope this answer helps you in your decision. Note that the above is talking about academic research, corporate research tends to have a different focus so imo it's worthwhile to explore both. Good luck!"", 'Alright thanks for the heads up.']"

As I'm an incoming freshman who will be staying at hall, I would like to receive some input from people staying at hall. 

If you have no aircon in your room, how is it like? 

If you have shared toilet/ attached toilet, do you prefer it that way? 

Additional question: double room vs single room, which one is better in your opinion? 

Thank you :D",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/n9sz99/is_it_worth_it_to_get_toilets_that_are_shared/,"[""For non air-con, I think it depends on where the room is facing and which hall. If you are someone that sweat easily/scared of warm, you can bring a standing fan too. On days when it doesn't rain, sometimes the room can get really hot during the day. But with the ceiling fan & standing fan, it should be okay unless you are used to having air-con at home. During rainy season, the room can be so cold even without the fan on.\n\nAs for toilets, I'm not sure about shared/attached toilets, but just fyi common toilets can be quite clean and neat too.\n\nDouble/Single I think it really depends on your personality/preference & how much you intend to spend. As for costs, double is really alot cheaper than single rooms (the costs you can save in a long run) and some double rooms are much bigger also. If you are someone that like to have people accompanying you (some people moved out of hall because they have no roomie), then go for double. But if you are an introvert that wants some personal space especially after long day at school, then go for single. If you are worried about going for single would refrain you from making friends, you can always make friends with your neighbours/join hall activities.\n\nAnd as for double, it depends if it's random roomie or are you rooming with a friend. Some people get nice random roomie, but I know of a friend that moved from double to single because she couldn't stand her roomie doing some things. So be mentally prepared. And for random roomie, you have to make sure you guys agree on some things together to prevent future conflicts. Such as lights, fan, noises...(you can always see people on ntu confessions complaining about their random roomie and you'll understand why xD)\n\nOhh and btw, given the current situation some tests/interviews/meetings could be online, so if you are going for double, I guess might be a little awkward if you were to do interview with your roomie in the room?\n\nHope this helps!"", 'Shared toilet(communal) for me. There’s like cleaners helping us to clean everyday. There are some halls with personal toilets that will mean you need to clean it by yourself. \n\nWith regards to aircon, it really depend on your heat tolerance.

My room window faced the west so it could get pretty hot in the late afternoons, but there’s study rooms in hall with aircon so it wasn’t a problem.

Would not recommend it as I think they cram many people onto 1 floor as well (compared to other halls where it might be more spacious? not sure abt other halls tho)', 'It mostly up to your preference and  privacy.   \nBut for toilet that is attached or share . You may have to clean it yourself instead of common toilet.  \n\\-Down side-   \nThere is always a very very small chance someone might record you showering .

Never stayed double as I hugely value my privacy and personal space, and generally prefer to work in the night and sleep in the day. Also was useful this year as I had all my interviews and exams online, which was super convenient having a single room. But staying single, the costs tend to be quite expensive compared to double.\n\nNon-aircon room is honestly fine for me, but it depends on what hall you stay and whether your room is on high floor, facing anything heat-trapping or whether it faces sunlight. My aircon room, I was thankful that I paid up for the aircon, as that room was really hot and tended to get stuffy. Meanwhile my non-aircon room was super cooling even without aircon.\n\nAs for the attached toilet, washing it once every 2-3 weeks sufficed for me, just have to bleach the toilet and the shower area then wash with water. Takes maybe an hour or so. I felt that it was totally worth the price to pay as the toilet is really quite nice, and you get a lot of convenience and privacy.

Would like to get some feedback on the school, especially in terms of the STEAM Programme, culture and environment, for secondary 1 posting. Especially in terms of whether you would recommend the school for a P6 student interested in Science and Math, and to find out whether the school is stressful, competitive or nurturing and encouraging. This will help to shortlist secondary school after PSLE. Thank you for reading and for the help to provide advice!",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nik80j/a_levels_dunman_high_ip_programme_would_you/,"['Hello! I’m a recent IP graduate of Dunman High :) I had a really great 6 six years at DHS so personally I would really recommend the school to P6s! \n\n1. In my opinion, our school’s academic programme is quite rigorous, in both languages and sciences. I think this becomes especially noticeable at a Y3 and Y4 level, when our syllabuses for almost all subjects are actually beyond the standard O Level syllabuses because we are ultimately preparing for A Level, so we are exposed to JC topics at a Y3 and Y4 level, which gave us a little head start when we moved on to Y5. Since the student is interested in Math and Science, the school offers many opportunities for students to sign up for, such as Math, Bio, Physics and Chem olympiads, and I think the school will almost fully subsidise the participation fees. When I participated in the Math olympiad, the school waived my weekly olympiad training cost. (Not sure if they still do the same though haha). There are also Science research programmes available, where students will be mentored by a university professor and conduct research that’s to their interest. \n\nCulture and environment wise, I really really love Dunman High culture lah. Most people are really quite nice and the culture is quite wholesome and very family-like. Environment wise, the school is pretty big and we really have a lot of facilities for a wide range of activities, such as our state-of-the-art performing arts center for the performing arts CCA, or multiple indoor and outdoor courts for sports CCAs, and many many more. Also my personal favourite, we have a really big canteen with a lot of food options, and on top of that we also have a cafe and a hostel cafeteria which all students can go to for more food options. The school is also very conducive for studying and learning, and I have fond memories of studying for hours in my classroom or the school library (which is really big as well - 2 storeys!) especially during exam seasons haha. Also because I’ve studied there for 6 years, I think it has really became a lot like home to me, and it’s always nice to visit the school again as an alumnus :-)\n\n2. If the school is stressful, competitive, nurturing or encouraging - I think I’ve definitely felt all 4 before. Definitely there will be times when studying gets stressful, especially during exam seasons, and yes the academics can definitely be competitive, but DHS teachers are all really really encouraging and are very solid pillars of support. And it’s also very very common to arrange consultations with teachers to clarify any doubts. Most of the teachers that have taught me are really some of the most sincere and genuine people and they are super dedicated to teaching, and have definitely nurtured me and shaped me to be who I am today. Honestly, the whole culture and environment wise, I think don’t have to worry too much. I really really liked it here :)', 'hello! am a recently graduated student from the dhs ip programme. I think the experience varies from student to student, but I personally enjoyed my time a lot in school! I too was a student who was very much inclined towards math and the sciences and I found that there was plenty of opportunity for in junior high especially to pursue an interest in stem from the start. programmes such as E2K and science learning journeys (there is an overseas one for selected students in year 3) are offered to interested students as early as mid-year 1. of course, these are all subject to demand but I would say that the science and math departments in dhs are all solid and provide ample support for students’ learning. in fact, despite my initial interest in science and math, there were various other opportunities presented across the school years for the humanities as well that piqued my interest and eventually became the university course that I chose to pursue. so I would say that the opportunities are not limited at all! \n\nas for the culture and environment, I think dhs is known to have a very sheltered environment for her students. teachers are very willing to meet with students outside of their usual timetables for consultations to help them with any issues for academics, cca etc. competition between peers is rather minimal, unless you are in the GEP classes where you may be more pressured to do well. the culture is very much centered on helping one another and many seniors very willingly share their old notes or tips with their juniors to help them on their own journeys. the stress level naturally increases from y1/2 to y3/4 and eventually in y5/6 when the A level season hits, but it is more often subject to the performance and time management skills of the student themselves rather than the school syllabus or academic structure. but as an SAP school, I must say that the student population is expectedly rather racially homogeneous and it is uncommon to make friends of other races within the school, save the those entering via the JAE in senior high. \n\nthat being said, I am one (graduated) student who has had a great experience in dhs. maybe my fellow seniors/juniors/batchmates can share more about their own different perspectives :>', 'Hi, as a DHS student, i can give some insights.\nFor the STEM (im assuming you meant stem?) , I would say our school gives the students many opportunities for them to nurture their interest in science and math, like talent development programmes, our KSL (knowledge skills learning day where the school lets students choose a few programmes (a half day one usually) that they want to attend (there are limited slots students get in based on other factors), olympiads and research programmes.\n\nPersonally, i feel that our school doesnt have a competitive culture and everyone is quite comfortable in their own skin, the teachers also care quite a bit for the students and takes our opinions into account. \nThere are definitely teachers who arent well liked by students, but i feel that all of them only want the best for  their students, just that they teach with varying levels of strictness.\nHowever, id say the environment the new s1 will study in also depends on the other students in the cohort and the attitude of the specific cohort. For example, in my year, the students were more relaxed than previous years in terms of their attitude (mostly in CCA so it doesnt have much to do with grades). \nEven though many may say that DHS students are quite meek and not as ambitious as those from other schools, but i think this really depends on each of the students goals in life and doesnt rlly depend on the school. The school does encourage students to step up and lead, e.g. student council elections where students have to prepare individual speeches and campaign, which also fosters their creativity. Students are also encouraged to speak up in class and we did quite a few presentations over the years.\n\nOverall, id say dhs is a great school and would recommend it👍', 'hi js graduated from dhs last year and went through the ip stream as well! \n\ni wld say DHS offers a lot of opportunities to expand your knowledge in some subjects, there’s the LSP (learning skills program), Olympiads (we barely pay much for going for it) and a bunch of other stuff. oh yea there’s the BSP (bilingual studies program), GAP (general arts program), ACE (smth like social studies). in y1/y2, you have to attend TRP (forgot the long form) and subsequently you can use whether you would like to do TRP or TDP (talent development programme). TDP has many interesting subjects, i can only rmb the one where you can debate in parliament and another researching on sports sciences. in y3/4, the sch offers unique humanities subject such as Chinese & English literature which you can continue studying in jc. \n\nwe also have annual education fairs where universities come down to give talks and pamphlets for you to go to their university. there is also a ECG (education career guidance) counselor that is rly helpful as you continue further into your ip path bc she helps you in deciding which course and uni is better for you. can’t rly remember anything much bc sec sch is 2 years away lol. \n\nbut the culture in dhs is very supportive, we always say once you’re a dhs student you’re forever in the dhs family and our previous principal always asked alumni to 回家看看 when they’re free. obviously during exam periods it’ll be stressful but usually you will have friends by your side studying w you or you can even consult teachers anytime. the teachers are rly helpful and nice so you can just send them a text or email anytime to ask for a consultation. \n\nsometimes as a joke we will bow to kongzi to ask for help before exams. the library in dhs (2 storeys) is also rly huge and packed with useful materials, from books to past year dhs exam papers and project work examples. we also have this notes sharing portal in dhs where seniors can upload their notes for juniors to refer!!\n\nthere’s numerous studying places in school, from the canteen to the library then to the  benches placed everywhere in school and ofc the classroom! we have a great variety of CCAs, such as band, Chinese orchestra, uniformed groups, English/Chinese dance, English/Chinese drama, softball, tennis, volleyball, badminton, air weapons club from what I can remember. Many CCAs have been attaining stellar results such as the performing arts CCA who pre covid have been invited overseas to perform. bc of the huge amount of CCAs we have, we have plenty of facilities available such as the performing arts centre, tennis courts, field, basketball courts, parade square, music atrium, dance rooms etc. \n\nnot to mention we have quite a great amount of good food there lol, we have 16 canteen stalls, a cafe. Just nearby are kampong arang hawker centre, old airport road hawker, kallang wave and kallang leisure mall.\n\noverall I really enjoyed my 6 years in DHS and have forged many unforgettable memories and friendships there. rly highly recommend to go DHS bc it’s js such a wonderful sch!!\n\nif u hv any qns you can ask here or pm, both is fine!', ""Not from dhs but what's most important, apart from getting seniors'/aluminis' opinions, is to walk the grounds of the school and try to experience the culture and environment. It's hard cos of covid but joining the open houses and trying to speak to seniors f2f helps alot!! \n\nI can't give much comment about the school. But do be wary that ip may not necessarily be everything or the best. There are both pros and cons about ip and O levels and I think many people don't consider it at that age. To name an example, I've seen people doing Os and getting excellent scores to get into their dream school while people being especially lazy in ip (by no means, a generalisation just a possibility). It's good that you are guaranteed a spot in jc (ofc you have to do well enough) but if dhs isn't your dream school, ip may hold you back from taking Os at all. Ofc there's the risk of doing badly in Os. I reckon any path doesn't make much of a difference at the end. You can end up perfectly well via both channels"", 'highly recommended to go to open house this year (if it’s ongoing) bc seniors wld be there as well and u can ask them abt their own feelings and we will be pretty truthful']"
jayeyeanne,mgzt27,"Singapore Premier League (aka S League): 25 years on, where are all 25 clubs now?",2021-03-31 14:27:10,singapore,378960,95,339,"On the back of an exit of Malaysian football competitions, the S.League (re-branded as the Singapore Premier League in 2018) was created in 1996. In its heyday, the professional league drew large crowds, at times attracting in excess of 20,000 fans. 25 years on, the league has gone through numerous changes to its roster. We look at all the clubs that ever participated in the competition:

**25. Clementi Khalsa (4 seasons from 1999 to 2002)**

Created to represent Singapore's Sikh community (hence the name Khalsa), Clementi Khalsa spent four seasons from 1999 to 2002 floating between mid to near bottom of the league. A merger with founding S.League member Balestier Central birthed the current SPL side Balestier Khalsa FC.

**24. Sinchi FC (3 seasons from 2003 to 2005)**

Portmanteau for ""Singapore"" and ""China"", Sinchi were the OG foreign import team, formed to shore up waning interest in the league. Consisting entirely of players from China but fully based in Singapore, Sinchi's debut season in 2003 placed them in mid-table. Things took a downturn as they finished 9th out of 10 consecutively for the 2004 and 2005 seasons, and subsequently disbanded. Sinchi didn't quite set Singapore football alight, but gave us cult legends Qiu Li ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4nmUlosyVw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B4nmUlosyVw)) and Shi Jiayi ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT-l3swScSk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CT-l3swScSk)).

**23. Paya-Lebar Punggol (1 season in 2005)**

Finished bottom for the 2005 season, the only season they participated in before a merger with Sengkang Marine Football Club in 2006 to create Sengkang Punggol Football Club. Eventually, Sengkang Punggol Football Club gets renamed in 2011 to Hougang United.

**22. Sporting Afrique (1 season in 2006)**

The one that got the S.League international news coverage. Founded by Collin Chee (yes, the former actor Collin Chee), Sporting Afrique consisted of an entire squad of African players from Cameroon, Ghana, Kenya and Nigeria. They finished the 2006 season with a disappointing 9th out of 11 clubs, but on-field problems paled in comparison with off-field ones. An exposé regarding the players' pay and living conditions ([https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/today20-s-league-football-stars-who-take-home-less-maids-june-7-2006](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/today20-s-league-football-stars-who-take-home-less-maids-june-7-2006)) raised an uproar, eventually culminating in coverage of the issue on BBC [http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/5079434.stm](http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/africa/5079434.stm)). Collin Chee has since shed more light on the issue ([http://www.junpiterfutbol.com/turning-full-circle-family-man-collin-chee-opens-up-on-abrupt-departure-from-singapore-football-and-coming-back-with-dads-for-life/](http://www.junpiterfutbol.com/turning-full-circle-family-man-collin-chee-opens-up-on-abrupt-departure-from-singapore-football-and-coming-back-with-dads-for-life/)), revealing that despite proposed changes to the club, FAS rejected Sporting Afrique's application to participate in the 2007 season. The team disbanded shortly after.

**21. Liaoning Guangyuan (1 season in 2007)**

After Sporting Afrique's departure, Chinese Super League side Liaoning FC were invited to field a satellite squad in Singapore for the 2007 season. Liaoning Guangyuan consisted mainly of Liaoning FC's youth players. They did not fare much better than the African side they replaced on or off-the-pitch, finishing 10th out of 12, and got themselves embroiled in a match-fixing scandal ([https://www.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20080108-44022.html](https://www.asiaone.com/print/News/The%2BStraits%2BTimes/Story/A1Story20080108-44022.html)). Seven players were jailed, while general manager Wang Xin jumped bail and fled Singapore, and was eventually caught and convicted in China in 2012 ([https://www.asiaone.com/print/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Crime/Story/A1Story20120615-352938.html](https://www.asiaone.com/print/News/AsiaOne%2BNews/Crime/Story/A1Story20120615-352938.html)).

Unsurprisingly, the Liaoning Guangyuan team was discontinued, but it would not be the last we see of satellite clubs.

**20. Super Reds (3 seasons from 2007 to 2009)**

aka Korean Super Reds before being renamed, the Super Reds were pretty much a Korean version of Sporting Afrique, with a squad entirely made up of Korean players but without the off-field problems. Heck, even the founding Chairman and coach was Sporting Afrique's Technical Director. After finishing bottom in their debut season in 2007, Super Reds came close to being the first foreign team to win the league in 2008 with a runners-up finish. A mid-table finish in 2009 was followed by an attempt to localize the club as Yishun Super Reds, but disbanded after being left out of the 2010 S.League season.

**19. Dalian Shide Siwu (1 season in 2008)**

Another Chinese Super League satellite team, this time of Dalian Shide, which consisted of mostly Dalian Shide reserve and youth team players. Perhaps to the relief of all, uneventfully finished 10th out of 12 teams in the 2008 season, before FAS uninvited them for the 2009 season and the team discontinued.

**18. Beijing Guoan Talent Singapore FC (1 season in 2010)**

Rinse and repeat: it's 2010, yet another Chinese Super League satellite team consisting of youth players from Beijing Guoan, and yet another 10th of 12 finish. Where are they now? Discontinued, of course, but remains one of the more infamous Chinese sides in S.League history, no thanks to this:

**17. Étoile FC (2 seasons from 2010 to 2011, 1-time champion)**

In the same season that Beijing Guoan Talent literally fought through, Étoile made history in their debut season by being the first foreign team to win the league. The predominantly French side pipped Tampines Rovers on the final day to the 2010 title with a 4-2 win over fellow foreign team Albirex Niigata. Things seemed to be looking up as Étoile appointed seven-time Ligue 1 winner and French international Sidney Govou as their ambassador in 2011. Whatever positive effect the appointment intended did not come to fruition though, as Étoile could only muster a 5th placing in 2011 with a squad unrecognizable from the title winning side. Étoile pulled out of the S.League altogether, and these days operate as a grassroots football academy [http://www.efc-academy.com/](http://www.efc-academy.com/)

**16. Harimau Muda A (1 season in 2012)**

Literally ""Young Tigers A"", the developmental squad consisting of Malaysian U-23 and senior players participated in the 2012 season in an exchange programme of sorts that would have seen Singapore's own developmental squad, Young Lions, participate in the Malaysian Super League. The Young Lions wound up not making the journey across the causeway, as a certain LionsXII was created to play up north instead. Harimau Muda's sole season finished with a respectable 4th placing, above the 10th placing achieved by the Young Lions who remained in the S.League. Just in case you were wondering, LionsXII didn't fair too badly either, finishing as runners-up in the 2012 Malaysian Super League.

Harimau Muda A went on to have a 8 month long Slovakia training camp in 2013, participated in Australia's National Premier League Queensland in 2014, and were disbanded in 2015 after a short-lived merger with...

**15. Harimau Muda B (3 seasons from 2013 to 2015)**

Should really have been more aptly named as Younger Tigers, the squad consisted of Malaysia U-21 players. While Harimau Muda A went off for their above-mentioned Slovakia escapade, Harimau Muda B took their place for the 2013 season and carried on in 2014 and 2015 as well, finishing 9th out of 12, 12th out of 12 and 7th out of 10 respectively. Merged with Harimau Muda A in 2015 briefly and disbanded.

**14. DPMM FC (8 seasons? Or 10? Depends on how you count from 2009 to 2020, 2-time champion)**

This is a strange one. Duli Pengiran Muda Mahkota Football Club, translated as His Royal Highness the Crown Prince of Brunei Football Club, hails from Brunei and is owned by the Crown Prince of Brunei (and at one-time DPMM goalkeeper) Prince Al-Muhtadee Billah. DPMM made their on-field debut in Singapore in 2009 after leaving the Malaysian Super League to join the S.League, but mid-way through the season got suspended by FIFA due to Bruneian government interference in the club's affairs. DPMM's participation in the 2009 season got scrubbed, and spent the next 20 months in-limbo.

In 2012, the ban was lifted and DPMM finally made their official debut in the S.League. DPMM had a mixed start, finishing as runners-up in their first season but placed 8th in the following 2013 season. For the 2014 season, former Blackburn Rovers manager Steve Kean was appointed, and DPMM achieved success throughout his tenure, winning 1 league title and 1 league cup. Kean departed following a poor 2017 showing, and in response to new import player restrictions by FAS, DPMM went shopping for another league in the region. Making no headway with discussions to play in Indonesia or Malaysia, DPMM remained in the S.League for 2018 after compromises were made with FAS. DPMM returned to winning ways in 2019 with their second league title, but withdrew from the 2020 season due to some corona-thing rendering travel between Brunei and Singapore slightly complicated. DPMM opted to participate in the Brunei Super League instead but the 2020 season got cancelled just like many other 2020 things.

DPMM are now awaiting commencement of the 2021 Brunei Super League season in June.

**13. Sembawang Rangers FC (8 seasons from 1996 to 2003)**

Nicknamed ""the Stallions"", the club was a merger between NFL sides Gibraltar Crescent and Sembawang Sports Club and was a founding member of the S.League in 1996. The Stallions lasted 8 seasons horsing around in the bottom half the league table, before dropping out of the S.League in 2004. Sembawang Rangers now exists in the fond memories of Singapore's northern dwellers.

**12.  Jurong FC (7 seasons from 1997 to 2003)**

Founded in 1975 as Jurong Town Football club and renamed in 1997, the Cobras alternated between 5th, 6th and 7th positions for 7 seasons. Notably, Singapore Legend V.Sundramoorthy, in 1999, took charge of the Cobras and became the first ever player-coach in S.League history. Just like the Jurong Reptile Park that once housed their club house, Jurong FC no longer exists after financial issues came to a head in 2003.

**11. Gombak United (12 seasons from 1998 to 2012)**

Founded as Redhill Rangers FC in 1960 and renamed in 1998, the Bulls spent their first 4 seasons yoyo-ing between 5th and 10th placing, and after finishing bottom in 2002, sat out for the next three seasons due to financial difficulties. Gombak United made a return in 2006 and, with the exception of a third placed finish in 2009, spent most of their time in mid-table until sitting out of the league again from 2013 onwards. Word has it that the Bulls has been eyeing a return to the SPL... or was it just a hot, steaming pile of BS? [https://themonitor.sg/2019/12/23/gombak-united-set-for-a-return-but-chairman-john-yap-isnt-aware-of-it-though/](https://themonitor.sg/2019/12/23/gombak-united-set-for-a-return-but-chairman-john-yap-isnt-aware-of-it-though/)

**10. Woodlands Wellington (19 seasons from 1996 to 2014)**

Founded in 1988 as Wellington FC, the Rams joined the inaugural season of the S.League in 1996, renaming themselves Woodlands Wellington and calling Woodlands Stadium home. The Rams narrowly missed out qualifying for the Championship Playoff final in 1996, finishing 2nd and 4th of the 2-part season. Woodlands Wellington would fail to reach such heights again, with 3rd place finishes in 1997 and 2005 their best showing since. Financial troubles necessitated a merger with Hougang United in late 2014, which ultimately never materialized. The Rams have been missing from the league ever since, despite some progress made towards a comeback [https://www.todayonline.com/sports/football/new-beginnings-woodlands-wellington](https://www.todayonline.com/sports/football/new-beginnings-woodlands-wellington)

**9. Warriors FC (24 seasons from 1996 to 2019, 9 time-champions)**

One of two former uniformed group teams. Started in 1975 as Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) Sports Association for national servicemen serving in the Singapore Armed Forces, the Mindef-run Warriors joined the inaugural 1996 S.League season as SAFFC. The Warriors won the second series of the 2 part season, only to lose to first series winners Geylang United in the Championship Playoff final. Over the course of the subsequent 16 seasons, with S.League legends Mirko Grabovac and subsequently Aleksandar Duric leading the line, SAFFC raked up a total of 8 title wins, including 4 consecutive league titles between 2006 and 2009, and a S.League-Singapore Cup double-double in 2007 and 2008.

SAFFC were the first Singaporean club ever to play in the AFC Champions League, qualifying for the competition in 2009 and 2010, rubbing shoulders with the likes of Kashima Antlers, Gamba Osaka, Shanghai Shenhua and Suwon Samsung Bluewings.

In 2013, SAFFC renamed themselves as Warriors FC, and in 2017 fully cut ties with Mindef. The re-naming coincided with a less successful period that saw the Warriors only win the title once in 2014. The storied club ran into debt, and was charged in court for failure to pay staff salaries in 2019. Warriors FC has since worked to get their finances in order, and are looking to return to the SPL.

**8. Young Lions (18 seasons from 2003 to present)**

The developmental side consists of U-23 Singaporean players, with the odd young foreign-but-can-naturalize player addition in the past, such as Itimi Dickson and Agu Casmir. Other than two 3rd placed finishes in 2004 and 2006, Young Lions have unwittingly become the whipping boys of the league, mostly languishing near the bottom of the table and finishing bottom 4 times. This has sparked much debate about the merits of the Young Lions project and there are increasing calls for the team's disbandment. Things have been slightly looking up in recent years though, as Young Lions have avoided finishing bottom since 2017, and have shown maturity and composure beyond their years so far for the 2021 season.

**7. Tanjong Pagar United (14 seasons from 1996 to present)**

Founded in 1974 as Tiong Bahru CSC, the Jaguars competed in the inaugural S.League season in 1996 as Tiong Bahru FC, finishing runners-up in the second series of the split season. Tiong Bahru FC came out runners-up as well for the 1997 season, and in 1998 were renamed Tanjong Pagar FC. The Jaguars were a force to be reckoned with in the late 90s, alternating between 2nd and 3rd placings. During this period, the Jaguars had a on-again, off-again relationship with their 1.97 metre goal-machine Nicodeme Boucher. The Senegalese would gain S.League infamy in the 2000 season, when a feisty top of the table clash between Tanjong Pagar and Warriors FC spilled over off the pitch. Boucher reportedly charged into the Warriors dressing room and punched Singapore right-back Tan Kim Leng: [https://web.archive.org/web/20181106030233/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/sleague-old-boys-nicodeme-boucher-towering-senegalese-goal-machine](https://web.archive.org/web/20181106030233/https://www.fourfourtwo.com/sg/features/sleague-old-boys-nicodeme-boucher-towering-senegalese-goal-machine)

Boucher, slapped with a one-year ban, left for Reunion Island. Tanjong Pagar were never the same again, and (with the exception of 2001 and 2013) spent subsequent seasons either finishing bottom half or sitting out of the league (between 2005 to 2010 and from 2015 onwards). In 2020, the Jaguars finally came out of their second hiatus and hastily assembled a squad. The lack of preparation showed, as Tanjong Pagar finished the season bottom of the league without a single win. Three games in, the Jaguars are still looking to get back to winning ways in 2021.

Bonus fun fact: after his retirement from professional football, Tan Kim Leng is now a certified property agent: [https://agent.sg/R003524Z](https://agent.sg/R003524Z)

**6. Balestier Khalsa (26 seasons, from 1996 to present)**

Finally, a club that has survived through every single season and some. The clubs ancient origins date back to 1898, known then as Fathul Karib. They were renamed in 1975 as Balestier United Recreation Club, and again in 1996 for the S.League as Balestier Central. After a merger with Clementi Khalsa, the Tigers became Balestier Khalsa. The club's best finishes were in the inaugural 1996 season, finishing 3rd in both series of the split season, and four 4th placings in 1997, 1998, 2013 and 2015. After finishing bottom in 2019, the Tigers gave a much improved showing in 2020, narrowly missing out on AFC Cup qualification by a point.

**5. Hougang United (23 seasons, from 1998 to present)**

Another familiar story of rebranding, restarts and mergers. Starting out as Marine Castle United in 1998, the club were bottom dwellers for four seasons. The tides turned slightly with a renaming to Sengkang Marine, with two consecutive 8th placings in 2002 and 2003. The tides then took a turn for the worse as they had to sit out the 2004 season due to (you guessed it) financial difficulties, and also in 2005 when Paya Lebar-Punggol FC took their place.

In 2006, Sengkang Marine merged with Paya Lebar-Punggol to create Sengkang Punggol. Until 2010, Sengkang Punggol were consistently finishing near bottom.

Another renaming occurred in 2011, and Hougang United had finally arrived, with Hougang Stadium as their home ground. The Cheetahs has since then established themselves as a mid-table club, only slipping to bottom placing twice (in 2015 and 2018).

2019 was a watershed season, as Hougang United finished 3rd, their highest ever placing, and qualified for the AFC Cup for the first time in their history. Hougang United, however, failed to build on this success and only mustered a 6th of 8 finish in 2020.

**4. Geylang International (26 seasons, from 1996 to present, 2-time champions)**

One-half of the Eastern rivalry, the Eagles started out in 1973 as International Contract Specialists FC (ICSFC), founded by SEA Games gold medallist Colin Ng. ICSFC were a dominant force in local football, with Singapore legends like Dollah Kassim and Samad Allapitchay turning out for them. In 1974, the club was renamed Geylang International, after the hallowed Geylang field in Lorong 12. After a rough few years in the early 80s, Geylang International returned to their dominant best, winning 6 out of 8 of the semi-professional FAS Premier League titles, the top domestic title back then.

Geylang International joined the S.League in 1996 as Geylang United. With a star studded squad consisting of Singapore internationals Fandi Ahmad, Kadir Yahaya and David Lee, and Iranian World Cup players Hamid Estili and Mohammad Khakpour, the Eagles ran out overall champions in 1996, beating SAFFC 2-1 in the Championship Play-off final. Unexpectedly, Geylang United would only add to that tally in 2001, after four years of 3rd to 5th finishes, winning the title with the likes of Noh Rahman, Aleksandar Duric, current head coach Noor Ali and with Malaysia Cup legend Jang Jung as head coach.

Geylang United then spent the next few years slipping down the table. A re-branding in 2013 to revert back to Geylang International failed to stop the rut, and in 2018 the Eagles had their worst ever showing, finishing second from bottom. Since then, Geylang International has enjoyed a resurgence, qualifying for the AFC Cup in 2020, a competition they last qualified for in 2009 with their only Singapore Cup win.

**3. Lion City Sailors (26 seasons... or is it 2? From 1996 to present... or from 2020? 2 league titles or none?)**

Simultaneously one of the oldest and youngest clubs in SPL history, the club originated in 1945 as Police Sports Association, before renaming to Police FC for the 1996 S.League season. Similar to fellow former uniformed group team SAFFC/Warriors FC, the club provided playing opportunities for national servicemen in Ministry of Home Affairs vocations such as SPF, SCDF and ICA. The club was renamed Home United in 1997, presumably to be more inclusive towards SCDF and ICA. It wasn't home sweet home for the then-nicknamed-Protectors though, as they finished bottom of the league that year. The next year saw Home United claw their way up to a mid-table 7th finish, and in 1999 they pipped their uniformed rivals SAFFC/Warriors FC to their first ever S.League title. From there, Home United would come close to winning it again with a 2nd placing in 2002, and successfully won their second league title in 2003. The Protectors then became somewhat of the nearly-men, finishing runners-up again in 2004, 2007, 2011, 2013 and 2018.

In 2020 came the big reset. Billionaire Forrest Li, founder of game developer Garena and one-time cringe-inducing-champion Shopee ([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EMLSRA57JM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EMLSRA57JM)) bought a 100% stake and privatized the club. Excitement turned to dismay for some Home United fans, as the club's history was completely wiped out. The club was renamed Lion City Sailors, and Home United were reduced to a mere throwaway line on the LCS website ([https://www.lioncitysailorsfc.sg/the-club/](https://www.lioncitysailorsfc.sg/the-club/)). The Sailors missed out on silverware on their first attempt, placing 3rd for the 2020 season, and have splashed the cash for the 2021 season, making Diego Lopes the first ever multi-million dollar signing in Singapore football.

So far in 2021, both club and player have yet to set the league alight.

**2. Albirex Niigata (S) (17 seasons, 4-time champions)**

The longest surviving foreign team, the Swans are one of several satellite clubs (some are even non-football related) to J2 League side Albirex Niigata, and has competed here since 2004. Seemingly hampered by their annual reset of their squad, Albirex has long been a firm mid-table club, before a steady ascent in the early 2010s with 3rd placings in 2012, 2013 and 2015.

Then in 2016, the floodgates seemingly opened. Albirex became the third ever foreign team to win the league title after Étoile's triumph in 2010 and DPMM's in 2015. Then they did it again in 2017. And again in 2018. Only a second DPMM win in 2019 broke their stronghold. With the defending champions sitting out 2020 due to Covid-19, Albirex returned to the summit in 2020, making it 4 titles in 5 years, and 6 years running since a Singaporean club won the league title.

With the uncertainty surrounding the last Singaporean league title winners Warriors FC, there is still one club fans are pinning their hopes on to buck this uneasy trend...

**1. Tampines Rovers (26 seasons, 5-time champions)**

The hope of the nation (maybe with the exception of Geylang International fans). The Stags form the other half of the Eastern rivalry, and like Eastern rivals Geylang International, enjoyed much success and prominence in their early years. Rather uniquely, Tampines Rovers have kept their name since being founded in 1945, and were invited to the inaugural S.League season in 1996. Their prior successes did not carry over, as Tampines Rovers spent years hovering around mid-table. With the appointment of Thai football legend Vorawan Chitavanich as head coach, the Stags won two consecutive titles in 2004 and 2005. After a period of consistent top 4 finishes, Tampines Rovers enjoyed another spell of success, making it three titles in a row in 2011, 2012 and 2013.

Tampines Rovers maintained their status as fierce title challengers, finishing runners-up 5 times out of the last 6 years. The Stags caused a stir amongst fans in 2016 when they signed former Arsenal and Liverpool winger Jermain Pennant. Intrigued by the possible impact such a big name signing could create, league viewership spiked briefly before tailing off. Likewise, Pennant's time here ended with a whimper, with the Englishman declaring that even Messi couldn't save the league ([https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-even-lionel-messi-would-not-have-helped-s-league-says-jermaine-pennant](https://www.straitstimes.com/sport/football/football-even-lionel-messi-would-not-have-helped-s-league-says-jermaine-pennant)).

The foreign big leagues create this value easily by creating a shared, global identity. Singaporeans even pass down their English Premier League club following to their kids!

thesilentblackswan,mjyll2,[Uni] Basic Guide to choosing laptops for students,2021-04-04 23:41:08,SGExams,77716,89,256,"First of all, I am no expert at this, I just did my own research and bought a new laptop not long ago AND how I wished there's a short summary/guide on how to choose my laptop, so here's what I consolidated. To the laptop/com experts here, feel free to add your own comments or opinions.

&#x200B;

MEMORY (Random Access Memory RAM): short term memory which allows multitasking and allows many tabs and apps to be opened at the same time. So if u always open a lot of tabs and apps, u shld get 16gb. But honestly I think 8gb is enough for normal student/office work

&#x200B;

Ports: alot of laptops now ONLY has type C USB ports which is kinda annoying if u need to pluck in a thumbrive or a mouse which is type A. In my knowledge, some laptops like dell xps or macbook only has type C (thunderbolt is the new version of type C), so u have to buy adapters which is kinda troublesome and really a hassle to be always carrying it and plugging and unplugging it. So yea having at least one type A port will be very useful. Also, if u think you are likely to be doing a lot of presentations, a hdmi port will come in handy too.

&#x200B;

Battery Life: this one very impt to me lol cuz I lazy charge. My laptop has a battery rating of 63Wh  and it can literally last me the whole day without charging if I don't use it excessively. But then 63wh abit overpower HAHAHA so around 50Wh normally is decent enough to last you through your school day. ALSO, don't ever trust them when they say the laptop can last 12hours++, they usually run some minimal applications or battery tests which are highly inaccurate. So look at the battery ratings instead (Wh). Watts hour(Wh) is the amount of energy stored in the battery so yea

&#x200B;

Processors: idk much about ryzen but I heard its better than intel but imma tell yall more about intel since I have done more research about it. ITS A MYTH THAT I7 IS BETTER THAN I5. I7, I5 are like a series and what matters is the generation. So a I5 11th gen can be better than a I7 10th gen. The newest gen now is 11th btw and its written like this: I7-11sthsthsth which means its i7 11th gen (so i5-10sthsth is i5 10th gen), the behind numbers and letters have meanings to it but I don't think yall need to get that hardcore ya (unless yall are gamers lol). So basically processor determines how fast your laptop will process things which is vv impt also so yeah if u want the best just get i7-11th gen. i7-10 or i5-11 are very decent as well. There's i9-11 now but its too ex and not worth the price. 


Ryzen: after reading all the comments, it does seem like ryzen is better than intel HAHAHA so basically, ryzen processors are smaller in size and yet as or even more efficient than intel. This leads to be a higher thermal efficiency and a better battery life. Ryzen 7 has 8 cores, ryzen 5 has 6 cores which are all really good specs. So yea my take is choose a laptop model u like and if that model offers ryzen chip, go for the ryzen one :) but if it doesn't, hey intel ain't that bad.

&#x200B;

Storage: er depends on your personal preference but I think 512gb shld be more than enough but the more the merrier lol. Also u can take note whether its ssd or hdd storage. Basically SSD transfers data much faster than hdd which can help with your battery life too. Alot of laptops nowadays offer ssd or a hybrid of both, so this isn't really a big concern to me but yea, good to know hahahaha

&#x200B;

Display and Weight: if yall are okay with small screens, 13inch will do and honestly if u use it long enough, you will get used to the 13 inch screen anyway. Laptops that are around 1.2kg are sleek and super portable but yea anything less than 1.5kg should be fine bah

&#x200B;

So yep guys, these are the main considerations when I was choosing a laptop. Hope it helps :))

&#x200B;

Okay btw I bought asus zenbook 14 UX435EG-AI016T recently and I'm loving it. Not only it has all the specs I want, the touch pad also acts as an additional screenpad which is hella LIT. You literally have 2 monitors in one but then personal preference la hor, if u think its helpful then yay :) okay but zenbook isn't the only series with this feature, u can look into vivobook too if u want HAHAHAH

&#x200B;

Windows recommendations: levono thinkpad, dell xps or asus zenbook.

The new macbook with the m1 chip is really good (freaking fast processing speed), so if you are a fan of apple and its ecosystem, why not :) However, one bad thing about this m1 chip is that it may not be compatible or verified with some software apps, so coding/engineering students take note ya, yall might wanna check if your apps are compatible with m1 chip first(got this info from a comment below)

iPad is still a great choice for those who just need a laptop for slides, zoom, notes taking, presentations. However if u need to use developer apps, coding, rendering, CAD designs and things like that, you shld get a proper laptop :)


EDIT: Added some info (ryzen, storage type, battery life, m1 chip disadvantage) based on the comments, so keep the comments coming and I will edit accordingly :) AND THANK YALL SO MUCH FOR THE AWARDS HAHAHA honestly didn't expect this to get so much attention :))",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mjyll2/uni_basic_guide_to_choosing_laptops_for_students/,"['Ryzen laptops are usually more efficient in thermals and power usage, especially since Ryzen 4000. Ryzen 5 usually has 6 cores while Ryzen 7 usually has 8 cores.\n\nIf possible (as in you can afford so), I would recommend something like a ThinkPad or other business laptops that aren’t very flashy, and that can’t game (unless your course absolutely needs a gaming GPU like a 1050, 1650 etc), to minimize potential of distracting yourself with gaming, and if you want to game, get a desktop.\n\nGood thing about business laptops is that if you just need a laptop for typing notes and whatnot without much special requirements (no VMs or heavy dev work or CAD design), you can usually get away with a used ThinkPad that are pretty cheap yet still reliable. E.g. A ThinkPad X260 is a dual core 6th Gen Intel with DDR4 RAM, and goes for around $400 SGD on Carousell. If you need quad core, you’d need a T480(s or not, up to you, S is just slimmer, lighter but parts not as replaceable), but Carousell isn’t a good area to find T480’s since it’s usually $1k+, so not very sure there, since you might as well buy a 4 or 6 core AMD ThinkPad X13, or a 6 or 8 core T14.\n\nI personally use a Ryzen 7 ThinkPad T14 for poly cybersec, and I got it for S$1300, you can usually find it for equal or less. It has 8 cores 16 threads, up to 48GB RAM (16 soldered, 32 added), replaceable storage, and very easily user serviceable. 6-7 hours of battery life, and very cool on battery and light loads.

Currently I’m at a dilemma as I need to pick a course for the first window (my first choice course is actually SMU) so I’m stuck between NTU and SUTD. 
For the choice of course I would prefer SUTD however I’m not sure if the prestige of NTU as well as its general environment would make it more worth it for me to choose NTU instead, even though biz is not the course I’m most interested in. (Ofc a part of me also wants to have a “brand name school” as part of my portfolio, especially since there have been a few people who have said SUTD’s reputation pales in comparison)

TakingPrivateALevels,mxka1h,[Rant] Tuition Discrimination,2021-04-24 21:45:30,SGExams,77716,37,146," Since many SGExams members are attending, seeking, providing or offering tuition, we need to discuss this important issue.

Two days ago, AsiaOne ran an article about qualified tuition teachers facing discrimination when searching for tuition opportunities. Messages like ""strictly female Chinese tutors only"" are common from parents, tuition agencies and postings on tuition portals.

Such discrimination should be completely unacceptable, especially in our diverse little red dot. How can we counter such discrimination? Here are my suggestions but I welcome ideas and feedback from others.

**For students looking for or attending tuition (or parents seeking tuition for their children):**

Make it clear (especially if going through an agency or portal) that you are open to tutors of all races and both genders! This may lead to better outcomes for you, as you may get a minority tutor who is more capable for the same or even a lower price (as there is less demand for minority tutors due to discrimination).

If you have valid reasons for preferring or avoiding a certain demographic of tutor, explain them clearly and consider how they can be worked around. For example:

* ""My family is Mandarin-speaking and my English is weak"" will prevent mismatches with Chinese tutors who are weak in Mandarin and allow matches with non-Chinese tutors who are fluent in Mandarin.
* ""My family keeps two dogs at home"" will prevent mismatches with Chinese tutors who are afraid of dogs while allowing matches with Malay tutors who are fine with dogs. Perhaps the tuition could be conducted at a void deck or other public place?

**For tuition teachers seeking opportunities**

If a potential student or their parent practices discrimination (such as by asking ""what is your race?""), reject the opportunity (even if you are their desired demographic) with a statement condemning discrimination. Then, depending on how you found the opportunity:

* File a complaint with the agency.
* Leave a negative review of the student or parent on the portal.
* Inform the friend who referred you this opportunity.

The goal is to make it harder for discriminatory students or parents to find a tutor of their preferred demographic. If the student fails their exams as a result, they deserve it. Depending on the circumstances and evidence available, you may consider naming and shaming the parent or student online.

**For both groups**

Going through an agency or portal? Ask them (or check on their website) how they handle discriminatory requests and make that a factor in your choice of agency or portal. For portals, leave negative feedback on (and report) discriminatory advertisements.",0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mxka1h/rant_tuition_discrimination/,"['thank you so much for this. i know of people (minority races) who struggled to find tutoring gigs for this same reason, despite them being sufficiently qualified. more people need to understand that this is racism, and that discriminatory practices in the education sector is seriously damaging to both tutors and students who may even adopt racist mindsets as a result.\n\nedit: spelling\n\nedit 2: don’t personally agree with OP’s views on gender as it may be uncomfortable for certain girls/women to have male tutors in their home (for personal or cultural reasons) but i agree w the rest :)', 'Great post.

Maybe they have had a bad experience with that certain race in the past? I know of a classmate who had a bad experience with a certain race before, and refrains from making friends with that race. I have told him it’s a bit weird, and kinda wrong to me. It’s hard to try and mitigate these types of race issues.', ""Since you seem to disgree that choosing the sex of the tutor is ok, I'll give you another reason why parents would want to get the same sex. Social anxiety. Most people who has SA usually get very very anxious talking to the opposite sex. So if getting a female/male tutor helps the child, why wouldn't the parent do that? Plus SA can stop the tutee from asking the tutor questions because they are way too anxious which may hinder the tutee's grade."", 'Logic wise, I wholeheartedly agree with you. But emotion wise, it’s not something I find that I can control :/ I have no problems with tuition teachers of any race or religion, but as a teenage girl I find myself less shy around females + I feel less awkward around a “big sister” character. I’m not sure if this is understandable or justifiable, but being in girls’-only schools for half my schooling life really makes it tougher to socialise with people of the opposite gender yaaaah (even my classmates rn) \n\nI do think everyone should try to work towards zero discrimination, but such emotions are not something that I can change in a day, nor I believe should be something that deserves naming and shaming online?', 'While I certainly understand why requesting only for a certain race in a tutor is racist, I dont think that requesting for a particular gender is sexist.

I think that it is perfectly justified for parents to prefer hiring a tutor that is of the same gender as their child (especially female tutors for female students). This has nothing to do with a prejudice against men, but rather preventing potential sexual assault cases from happening. Would you rather the parent sit in all the lessons then? If something were to happen, wouldn’t it unfortunately become a ‘he say she say’ situation?\n\nSuch cases can be rare, and I’m sure that 99% of mixed gendered tutors are good and professional. But what is wrong with preventing a possibility of something going wrong? \n\nWith regards to race though... I agree with your post. I don’t see why race has to be a mitigating factor unless there’s a language barrier.', 'Exactly! Thank you for this post. As someone who has personally been searching for both jobs and tuition gigs, I have come to realize how much worse the racial bias is than I previously thought it was. As much as I try to give them the benefit of doubt, I can’t really see why would a math tutor, or a receptionist at a tuition center, or a retail assistant would have to be of a certain race or would have to speak a certain language. These people should stop hiding under the pretense that “blank speaking applicants required to liase with blank’ clients” when that is very clearly not the case.', 'Agree for race but not for sex. Parents prefer tutors of the same sex as their child because of safety reasons AND to prevent any chance of an infatuation or crush forming that can hinder the tuitions effectiveness (cus they assume child is straight)\n\nI dont know about you but if I were a father I wouldnt feel comfortable leaving my 14 year old daughter alone at home with a 25 year old grown man. Too many perverts nowadays (just look at the news...). Obviously same gender sexual assault still happens but the chances are much lower. And Id rather my child be safe than worry about missing out on a better tutor/spending more', ""I am a little late to this, but as an Indian, I thought this was an issue no one else noticed so it's good to know people are talking about this. I have career aspirations in the tuition industry and want to become a private tutor in the future but I always felt limited by my race because I have never come across another Indian tutor before."", 'Unfortunately, such discriminatory practices will continue unabated unless and until we (especially those from groups who benefit from such discrimination) take action to counter them, which is why I started this topic. How can we convince parents and students of the benefits (especially to them) of not discriminating, while hindering discriminatory ones from finding tutors of their target demographic?', ""It's more of preferences tbh. If im a student choosing a tutor, I would have an ideal tutor in mind and these traits would ideally help me pick a tutor that I deem most competent/ feel safe with; these traits may happen to coincide with gender/race. While, I have no intention to discriminate against anybody, it's just that since I'm paying for tuition, shouldn't I get to voice my preferences?"", ""> but as a teenage girl I find myself less shy around females + I feel less awkward around a “big sister” character. I’m not sure if this is understandable or justifiable, but being in girls’-only schools for half my schooling life really makes it tougher to socialise with people of the opposite gender yaaaah \n\nI do understand and it is true for guys as well (especially those who study in boys' schools). Unfortunately, gender segregation is quite ingrained in our society and even in mixed settings, the pressure to socialise along gender lines is strong.\n\nConsider the implications in the long run. Difficulty interacting with the opposite gender will be detrimental to your career. On a macro level, gender segregation (whether explicit or implicit) facilitates sexist attitudes and discrimination. \n\nFor example, my NS unit mates were far more likely to make objectifying comments than my secondary school (mixed) or JC classmates and my colleagues (I am already working). Even among my NS unit mates, those from boys' secondary schools were far more likely to make such comments than those from mixed secondary schools.\n\n> I believe should be something that deserves naming and shaming online \n\nTo clarify, I do not think every case of gender or racial discrimination deserves naming and shaming online. It depends on the details of the specific case (and of course, the evidence available)."", '[deleted]', 'I do see where you are coming from. Sexual assault is a serious issue. Whether hiring only female tutors for female students is effective at preventing sexual assault cases depends on other factors, such as the age of the student, the age of the tutor, where the tuition is conducted and (if conducted at a house) who else is in the house during the tuition. There are also other inherent risks (such as stealing) in letting a stranger (regardless of gender) into your house, especially for an extended time.\n\nThe parent and student must consider whether eliminating a 1% risk is worth a higher chance of paying more for a female tutor or choosing a female tutor who may be less capable (since demand for female tutors, especially the most capable ones, would be higher).\n\nWhat message does hiring only female tutors for female students send?\n\n* To male tutors: ""Gender discrimination is normal and acceptable""\n* To female students: ""Reduce interaction with males for your safety""\n\nThis will lead to worse outcomes for females in the workplace.', 'speaking from the perspective of a minority race here. although i haven’t personally tutored before, I’ve definitely signed myself up on tutoring platforms only to find such discriminatory statements (chinese only etc). \n\ni personally feel like tutoring platforms have the onus of filtering out tutee profiles that mention specific (majority) races, and possibly even make it more difficult for these people to find tutors (e.g: hide their posts). alternatively, they can also review such requests and ban them, such that there isnt a chance for these people to actively continue discriminating unless they change their ridiculous requirements. \n\nin the long run though, there really needs to be a change in the mindsets of these racist people for this to be wholly successful (but not sure how that’s gna happen though :”)). but luckily, much of our own generation isn’t as racially discriminatory, and i have high hopes for us ! \n\nthank you op for this post and bringing to attention such a serious matter!', 'While I do get what you are trying to say, the part about competency or safety is a result of racial bias, even if it may be unintentional. Feeling someone of a certain race or gender is more competent clearly is a result of questioning capability and talent simply based on societal stereotypes. While yes, technically it is your money and you can have preferences, it doesn’t necessarily mean it is right of someone to do so.', 'If you need to be around a specific race to feel safe, then you’re probably racist', 'You do realise that there are genuine concerns regarding the difference in sexes between a teacher and a student? Of course there are people that are comfortable being taught by the opposite sex, but there are also those who aren\'t for valid reasons. What about the students who have sexual trauma? Do we tell them to suck it up and deal with their ""sexism""?\n\nSex and race are very different things. When we request for a specific race, it is almost always due to preconceived stereotypes and prejudices, whereas requesting for a specific sex can be due to actual concerns and not because of an inherently prejudiced mindset.', '[deleted]', 'Your entire reasoning is so flawed that I don’t even know how to begin with my reply. \n\nChoosing to hire a same-gendered tutor eliminates the risk of male-on-female sexual assault ENTIRELY, irrespective of other factors that you mentioned above. Why should a parent have to go through so much effort to reduce a risk (eg. making sure the male tutor is of a desired age, making sure a parent is at home at all times when tuition is taking place, etc) when they could just, you know, choose to hire a female tutor??\n\nI think that you’re also severely underestimating just how saturated the tuition industry is. There are plenty of female tutors who are equally as capable.\n\nWith all the recent cases on sexual assault, I can’t believe you don’t understand WHY people are wary. If I tell you that there are 2 rotten eggs in a basket of 10 eggs, and you can either choose to pick an egg from this basket or choose another basket/ingredient entirely, what is the issue with the latter?', '>much of our own generation isn’t as racially discriminatory\n\nConsider me pessimistic but I think the younger generation are just echoing the “correct answer”.

This is especially necessary in this case, since many people still view such things as simply a preference and fail to see the racism behind it (which frankly I too didn’t at one point!) until they are told about why even a seemingly harmless preference without intended harm can impact certain groups of people so greatly.', '????

element3254,msjmdg,"[O levels][Poly] Discussing Social Anxiety in Schools. To those with social anxiety, how did you fare in school?",2021-04-17 12:02:31,SGExams,77716,40,221,"Hello r/SGExams, I have been reading a book about social anxiety and it really showed me that people really have it worse and are often pushed aside or not really thought about it especially in schools. 

Disclaimer: I'm just putting my thoughts as what I have learnt about the anxiety people face and wish to produce a discussion here as I believe learning about the people around you helps you to be a better person in general. There is a tl;dr at the end  


**We all have some level of Social Anxiety**

That feeling of ""damn, shit. I'm nervous, what if I screw this up"" , the sudden increase in heart rate as you are asked to do something or worse present in front of class. 

The common advice we hear is to not just step out of the comfort zone and put yourself out there and most people can do that just fine. But there is that group unheard, and usually unnoticed. The super quiet type, not because they don't like people and don't like to talk but their brain is constantly scaring them from making the smallest step in interacting with people. Those are the ones with Social Anxiety Disorder or SAD for short.   


I kinda feel bad for these group of people cause I didn't really learn about them in school and who knows the people around you that are actually suffering from it. 

&#x200B;

**Shy/ Introvert vs Socially Anxious** 

It's very common to label these people or just shy or introverted because it is more likely. 

Introversion does not equal shy. Introvert gain energy through social interactions, if you feel tired after talking to people you are most likely introverted. You can be the most confident person in the room but also be the introverted one depending on your ""social battery"" 

Shy people are those who feel uncomfortable being nudged into social interaction, be it the presentation in front of the class or even feeling lost during conversation with friends because you feel like you have nothing to say.  But for one, they usually have experiences of being comfortable socially in their very close friend groups.

Those suffering with SAD are what I would like to call the socially anxious. They seem to experience anxiety in a very strong level.  The very strong feeling of what the average person might feel. They can find themselves thinking about a social interaction that day for the whole night, or getting a strong panic feeling once being put in a place where they have to speak up. 

I can't begin to imagine what it was like to have that feeling as I learn more about the disorder and what some may face. If you don't have social anxiety, imagine the heart racing feeling you might experience times 10. And having your own inner thoughts constantly judging you and thinking you will fail if you do something as simple as asking the time. 

If you think you might have SAD, do look up the [DSM-5 criteria of diagnosis](https://www.theravive.com/therapedia/social-anxiety-disorder-(social-phobia)-dsm--5-300.23-(f40.10)).

**What can we do to help?** 

I believe the first step in just being a humane person is to just accept and acknowledge these people and not increase their feeling of constantly being judged by people. 

Don't ask ""Why are you so quiet"" that everyone hates hearing. If you do care about them, just ask how they're feeling genuinely

If you are friends with any shy/social anxious person, do acknowledge their attempts at interaction. To just acknowledge what they say if you hear it and not interrupt them and further push back their attempts socially. 

&#x200B;

**What can schools do?** 

I do believe when teachers encourage students to improve their public speaking skills or interacting with group mates in lessons is very important. However, it must be done in a way that is inclusive while lending a hand to people who really feel uncomfortable. 

Exposure to social anxiety is important (and mental health in general) To those unaffected, it will never cross their minds to believe that someone could be so anxious that they want to never speak. 

Lastly, teachers need to be aware that there might be people who are struggling and they really need the helping hand to push forward in their lives. Young teens may not even realise that they have a problem until it becomes too late.

&#x200B;

**Things to think about**

Can you think of people around you that may have struggled with their social anxiety. 

Have you struggle with your own level of social anxiety? 

Is your level of social anxiety too much to handle? If so, find help in any way you can (friend or a trusted adult)

&#x200B;

tl:dr Social anxiety is something everyone faces but there are some that are unable to handle the load on their mental health and I believe learning about it can bring about better inclusion with others around you.

And I remember there was a time where I got so anxious I wasn’t helping enough to the project that I started tearing up in class.\nI would like to say thank you for this post OP, I agree with a lot of your points', ""I don't know and don't think I have SAD but I'm kinda socially anxious in certain occasion since primary school. I'm shy/introvert but I still want to talk to people but it's just so hard to express myself to friends until recently. I'm totally fine with my family though.\n\n**[Primary School]**\n\nIn primary school, everyone just feel so scary to me and Idk what my mind was thinking back then. I wanted to talk and make new friends, but I can't because I lack the confidence to approach. There were some kind classmates who either talked to me occasionally or once in a blue moon. But I can't help but feel like it's out of pity because no one else seemed to approach me. When my teacher gave me a high leadership role in class (ideky..), I hated it. \n\nI knew I wouldn't be able to do well and I wish people can just talk loudly, act normally like how they do with others but whenever I talked to the class, it was really quiet. I understand, they were just paying attention to this classmate who rarely talks but I don't like the silence. I'm happy though that sometimes, me and 1/2 classmates would go home together and just talk about our day. It seemed like that's the only time I feel like I can talk the most casually. Otherwise, there were actually days when I go to school speaking only a few words or sentences. Somehow, I managed to do well in school though but it feels kinda sad that my achievements was probably what people remember me for. Unlike many people who looked forward to school to see their friends, the lack of friends and social interaction made me look forward to school because of the teachers and the joy of learning.\n\n**[Secondary school]**\n\nSecondary school was much better though, especially in Upper Sec. Probably because I entered secondary level with the mindset of wanting to be more confident in talking to people and making friends. I like observing my class a lot, since I was at a seat whereby I can see what is happening around. It was to the point I know the character traits/personality of my classmates just through observing. Even if I didn't talk to them, it's as if I talk to them because I observe their interactions with others.\n\nSecondary school had a few group work tasks, so I guess that kinda helped me to be given the opportunity to talk? I realised I'm better talking in smaller groups but can barely handle it talking in a big crowd like in front of a class.\n\nIn Lower Sec, it was first time asking if I can join a group and it felt heavy doing it because I was scared of being rejected. But they gladly welcomed me and that might have had a positive impact. I also became good friends with one of them and probably the first person I hang out with after school hours. Though I don't like some of my classmate's personality, I'd rather be with them than any of my primary school classes since they seem more willing to approach this classmate. But I hated it whenever I'm seated beside someone whom I have no confidence to talk to and it's unbearably awkward when other seatmates can talk to each other normally and then there's me. It's not like I don't want to talk, I just don't know how to start a conversation and probably my seatmate didn't know how to either.\n\nIn Upper Sec, it was a smaller class but it feels more bonded though I hated some of their rowdiness. I feel more comfortable in this class and I'd say though I'm not exactly close with most of them and of course there's still awkwardnes to a degree. But most of them were a bunch of people who were willing to talk to anyone and act like themselves regardless of your personality. They'd be the ones starting a conversation first, which helps me to also carry on the conversation casually. There were many funny moments with my seatmates and also classmates approaching me for help in a subject (since I was one of the few in class who does very well in the subject) gave me the confidence to talk and help them. Man, I even put in extra effort to make notes that could explain the concepts in a much more simplified manner (since textbooks can be long winded and the English too chim to grasp). Just for them. And the look of relief when they finally understood the concept or question is an immense joy to me.\n\nI also made friends whom I occassionally contact or hang out with even after graduation. My Upper Sec teachers were also very nice and I appreciate the attention they give me though I feel very bad whenever I screwed up by not finishing my homework.\n\nBut outside of my form class, I still experienced this fear though and lowkey isolated myself whenever it's mother tongue time. Ideky, my batch of mother tongue classmates are probably some of the nicest and least problematic out there but I have this unreasonable fear of talking to them. They're mostly introverted too and well-mannered but we only talked occasionally and outside of class discussion, no one except for one or two seemed to talk or approach me. Whenever we wait to enter the class, I always feel very awkward because everyone else seem comfortable with each other and then there's me. Tbh I come to mother tongue class looking forward to my teachers and some funny classmates (imagine if they weren't there, my day would feel so boring 😩).\n\n**[TERTIARY]**\n\nI feel like it was back to square one in trying to gain confidence but at least I made some friends. But seriously, my fear of talking to people came back again though it wasn't as bad as primary school. I was more confident in talking to my CCA friends than my classmates and when I told my CCA friend that I'm not confident in talking, she was surprised because I seemed talkative/confident to her. \n\nI just have that fear of rejection or being talked over, that's why I rather do things alone not because I don't want to be with people, but the negative assumption of people (ignoring me) that I had in my mind, makes me rather be alone. Whenever I'm in groups, I feel like a filler member because the lack of confidence somewhat affected my willingness to put in more effort. I wasn't a confident speaker like the rest but I did try to practice rehearsing more and my groupmates did compliment everyone's effort no matter how good or bad we turn out, so that kinda gives me strength in a way though I still feel bad for them. \n\nI hated it whenever we have those personality or character traits game since my classmates don't know me at all since we rarely talked outside group assignmemts and we weren't too comfortable with each other. I was barely involved in the game and it was unbearable for me since I just put on a smile that was lowkey shivering just because I don't want to look aloof. \n\nBut somehow, in my last year of school, I managed to break out of my shell and got more confident in speaking. Thanks to a Kpop group lol. You might want to check out my post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/mqrrm7/its_cravitys_1st_anniversary_and_i_have_many/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) on how it helped me become more confident in speaking, writing and expressing myself. But all these years since primary school, Kpop has always been my coping mechanism after a day of dealing with unbearable awkwardness in school. But I'd also thank my groupmates too for finally wanting to put in more effort to know each other especiallly since we went through so much difficulties together."", 'I teared up bc i felt so heard. \n\nI feel like my social anxiety is a result of build-up over the years and it got more evident?/worse when i got to my tertiary education. The school i went to requires a lot of group work, interactions and presentations and it stresses me out bc i am not good at talking and voicing my opinions in the first place. I feel like it’s bad luck for people to have me in their teams. \n\nI’ve received a lot of feedback from teachers telling me to interact with my teammates more or made me feel that my part of the presentation was lacking. As a result my grades and gpa dropped and i skipped school as a form of avoidance which made my gpa dropped even more. Which is kind of awful bc i did wanted to go to uni but considering my gpa now i don’t think i can make it. I wasn’t eating in school and my weight got to 3x.xkg. I thought i would be able to manage getting through but some things happened (in school and outside) I ended up taking 2 sems off. I ran out of class one day to go to the student care center and cried a lot trying to calm myself down and the counsellor offered to hook me up with a one-time psychiatrist to help me. From there i met my current psychiatrist and psychologist and i’m currently receiving help and going for cbt sessions! \n\nI’m not sure if my friends know about this or not bc i’ve never spoke about this to them before. \n\nI hope more places and people have this awareness... i don’t really want to hear people asking why i am being so quiet and calling me antisocial and other instances and yet i don’t know how to explain to them or tell them', ""Hmmm as a more outgoing and wild person my advice for those who struggle in groupwork is to observe who are the better ppl to work with.

I just kept pushing myself to talk and socialise in Poly. The key mindset is that everyone is new and is learning in life so they are very similar to you.

From my primary to secondary school years I had always tried to mask it with confidence and nonchalance whenever I feel it creeping on me. Remembering the nausea, panic and stress that I went though trying to keep up my fake confidence and not wanting people to make fun of me. \n\nTo keep up this confidence I kind of turned to substances to quiet the doubts in my head but I think I just came out more fucked even after being sober because I never really learned how to cope with people staring at me weirdly and thinking that everyone is using me/hates me/gossiping about me because whenever that happens I just get high or drunk. Now I have no shield and it\'s getting pretty scary. \n\nI guess in my brain I thought of how much people hated me whenever I went to school. I always skipped school because I was bullied/teased quite a bit. I also never went for any camps or excursions because I didn\'t want to be around people/ sleep with strangers in the same tent in a foreign place because I was probably going to do something stupid to make them hate me.\n\nWith presentations. They sucked I remmeber I cried during my first presentation because I was so nervous and was shaking so hard. I still do this but on a lesser degree, I try to keep my deliveries confident but the only difference between now and then was that I don\'t cry anymore lol. But whenever I\'m up there presenting. The guy in my brain is like ""hey you fucking idiot, people are judging you for your shaky voice. You sound so stupid and uncredible, how do you even expect people to think you researched what you are saying if you can\'t even deliver it correctly?"" And I start to panic live with classmates watching. \n\nI got frequent anxiety attacks in school, I usually masked it quite not decently. When I have a attack I get extremely quiet and kind of catatonic? I don\'t speak or move until my brain stops buzzing, even when someone speaks to me. \n\nI find my whole ordeal quite hilarious because due to this I was too afraid to talk to anyone about how I was feeling. I had never been to a counsellor because that situation of being alone with a stranger to talk about my deepest problems isn\'t something I want to experience. Also thinking of going to therapy after I get a stable job with enough funding but I also don\'t want to go to my GP and tell them I need a referral. So I just live with it. I don\'t know if I\'m getting better but I pray it\'s just a chemical imbalance so I\'m waiting til my early 20\'s after my brain developed and my hormones calm down if I would be better. Because that\'s literately my only hope for the future rn.', 'I started showing symptoms of SAD in late 2016, self-diagnosed myself and had a psychiatrist confirm my diagnosis in 2017 (Sec 1) and as of 2019 I no longer have SAD. Here\'s what I have to share: \n\nTo start off, I\'m not a very sociable person. I frequently have trouble with social interactions. Sure I have some close friends, but most of the time I\'m pretty awkward when I interact with others. My psychiatrist said I might be on the spectrum, but I haven\'t been officially diagnosed. So I was (still am) slightly anxious when interacting with others. \n\nI think the incident which triggered for my social anxiety was when I was shouted at by my father\xa0 at lvl 1 of a shopping centre atrium(?) of a shopping centre for around 20 seconds (he had every right to scold me in that case, but he didn\'t have to shout). Everyone from the 1st to 5th story was looking at me. I\'m not gonna elaborate on the amount of humiliation I felt that day. \n\nSince then, I started to become extremely self conscious about everything I did. I was afraid of people\'s judgement of me based on everyday stuff like: \n\n• How fast I was walking (afraid I was walking too fast or too slow)\n• My speech (I sometimes speak too fast and mess up my pronunciation as a result)\n•Which part of the corridor or pathway I was walking on (whether I was too close to the edge or the centre, especially when someone else was walking towards me from the opposite direction)\n• Where I positioned myself when on the bus/MRT (I was usually standing)\n• The way I had to ask other people to make way for me to alight the bus/MRT when it was packed\n• The way I ordered food at the canteen\n• Any and all other actions I did during social interactions \n\nI started having anxiety whenever I left my house. The anxiety I was feeling was even more extreme when I was in school, since repeated interactions with people in school meant that I was more likely to be judged, and that people were more likely to remember any ""stupid"". things I did. To be fair, I\'m sort of a judgemental person, and I remember little details or actions people have done for years. So at that time I felt that my fear of being judged was justified. \n\nWhenever I was anxious, my heart would beat really fast,\xa0 I would sweat a lot and get sweaty palms, and my thoughts would be completely focused on what was causing the anxiety and I would have trouble getting a clear train of thought. I would mess up my speech even more than before. In extreme cases, I would have a mental breakdown and cry. \n\nMy social anxiety was at its highest in 2017, the year when Secondary school started. Orientation was pretty tough for me, since I knew no one in my class, and only had 3 people from my primary school (who I wasn\'t friends with) in sec school. I had anxiety throughout the orientation programme, especially during activities like sharing about myself, ice breakers, stage performance etc etc. I was afraid of asking questions in class and didn\'t seek consultation with teachers because I feared that I would waste my teacher and classmates\' time, and that people would resent me for it. I also had fear of talking to others, since I couldn\'t pronounce some words clearly and people had to ask me to repeat what I was saying (I was\xa0 recommended by a few people to go for speech therapy, that shows how bad my speech is). I hardly contributed during group discussions and project work out of fear of being judged for giving a stupid input. I was anxious while queuing up and ordering food because of my speech problem and how it would delay people waiting for their food. I feared PE lessons because I had poor performance in sports. PE games really spiked my anxiety because I was bad at some games and made my team lose. \n\nI thought that this level of anxiety was normal for people, and never discussed it with anyone. Sometime that year, I started realising that this anxiety was not normal and not everyone had such high levels of anxiety that I had. I searched up my symptoms and found out about SAD. A few weeks later, I had an anxiety attack in a movie theater that made me cry in the theater. I finally told my parents about my symptoms and asked for medical assistance. \n\nI went to the Child Guidance Clinic and was officially diagnosed with SAD. There, my psychiatrist gave me plenty of insight and advice, which allowed me to ""cure"" my SAD. \n\nFirstly, she told me that most people don\'t really judge you. Most people will forget any ""dumb"" thing you did in a day or two. And as for the judgmental people, she said that the judgment didn\'t matter. So what if people judge you? Why do you have to care about their judgement of you? How would it personally affect you? As I started thinking about it, I started realising that the judgement didn\'t really matter. \n\nThere was also the issue of my confidence. Being more confident really helps in reducing anxiety. One of the ways to boost confidence is to have proper body posture for something like walking. I started taking slightly longer strides, looking straight ahead at eye level instead of looking down, allowing my arms to move naturally instead of keeping them stiff at my sides, and walking at a pace that I was comfortable with. ""Facing your fears"" is also another way to improve your confidence, so I started getting consultations with teachers, then eventually progressed to asking questions in class when I needed help. I started speaking up more in class, giving more inputs during discussions and eventually managed to lead a few discussions in group/project work. But this exposure to our fears must be paced properly. You can\'t expect someone who has SAD to transform from speaking one or two lines for a group presentation to making speeches during school assembly in a few days. \n\nIt\'s important to have a support system as well. I shared my fears or any ""incidents"" with my parents and they supported me thoughout this part of my life. I also had a close friend in school who supported me.

Personally I see my level of anxiety as pretty high as I was diagnosed with severe anxiety consisting of social anxiety and GAD. I would say participating in class has been really rare as the anxiousness and struggle to not breakdown and have an anxiety attack without thinking others are looking/judging is really hard.I would not continue with the details but everyday is just constant panic.As a freshman in my Polytechnic,my polytechnic emphasises on participating everyday for my class discussion for my daily grade,and I didn\'t write my diagnosis in filling out my details because I wanted to prove to myself that people who struggle can do it too or be even better.But with this invalidating doubt from others about mental illness especially some adults , it still is hard voicing about our mental health.Even with the notion ""you aren\'t alone"" , have we actually lend a listening ear and extensive care to someone who is alone and suffering , of course they are busy but this notion is hypocritical. But I agree with what teachers/lecturers can do to help students with social anxiety but I\'m just curious if the implication of you have to act like "" you\'re a business person"" have forcefully kicked mental health out of the picture as Im from a business course and I would like to hear your insight from it . But lastly i appreciate you speaking out on these issues so that people with anxiety has a voice to look out to, with that thank you :)', 'Hi, i\'m personally in uni rn, and I still face the same issue. Last time I used to be a girl who would stay silent and stand in front of the class when the teacher asks me to present.\n\nThe increase in heartbeat and anxiety attacks still happens for me despite the years of presentation experience. I try to ignore them while presenting, and just make sure I know what i\'m saying. \n\nIf you realise, most presenters do mess up when they are presenting, followed by a, ""sorry I meant this not that."" Realising this helped me put a lot less pressure on myself. It\'s the realisation that it\'s not only okay to screw up but it\'s perfectly normal. No presentations go perfectly. People honestly don\'t care about a minor blunder or you saying the wrong thing (even a major blunder is excusable sometimes) as long as you correct it afterwards.\n\nHowever, even though I say all these, my friends (and definitely the audience) can still hear my nervousness from across the room. My voice trembles when I speak, and my whole body also starts trembling. I\'ve learnt to tell myself it\'s okay to have my anxiety attacks, don\'t let it get the better of you. Let it happen and live with it, don\'t need to try to get rid of it! So every presentation now has me with a trembly voice - but imo if i present the content necessary, it\'s a success!', 'Thanks so much for this post. For 18 years of my life, I thought that I was just shy or introverted, but turns out I just have social anxiety (undiagnosed). Gotta thank social media for this one.\n\nI remember that in Pri 1 you had a lunch buddy for a few weeks, and despite my head saying ""talk to him! just say what you\'re thinking!"", nothing came out. It felt like a knot in my throat, and I never managed to say a word to him at all. He asked me what I\'d like to eat for two or three days and I stared back at him, and then he just gave up. I felt really bad but happy when he finally left me alone, as I couldn\'t order any food with him following me everywhere.\n\nThe same thing happened when I had a buddy when I was Pri 3. She asked me how to pay sixty cents to one of the stalls, and I could only stare back at her despite me wanting to answer her.

It was worse when you had to stand up in class, because it felt like everyone was staring and judging you. It felt like I was in an unwanted spotlight. If you could leave after finishing a test, I would wait for someone (or two, or three) students to submit their papers before I dared to submit mine. Social anxiety also made me be more prepared. I would bring all the pens and tools I needed (eg. curve ruler, graph paper) so that I didn\'t need to ask from anyone (cause I can\'t).\n\nI don\'t really know how I got over a big 50% of it since then, but I can order food outside now, and ask strangers for directions instead of relying on signs and gut feeling before GPS was available (only when I REALLY can\'t find my way though), and being able to contribute in group discussions (still shuts down when I feel unwanted or unneeded though). I\'ve also noticed that my heart gets pumping really fast, hands get sweaty and I subconsciously start shaking my leg a lot before a big thing, eg. interview, presentation, etc., and I notice that my stomach churns and gets upset right before it too (probably a flight response). \n\nI think that before schools can start to help (teachers can be more lenient on such students), governments should educate on social anxiety and other mental health related issues. The lack of education in areas that play such a prevalent part in our lives can affect the way teens feel about themselves, rob them of opportunities since no help is sought, and in serious cases, be life-threatening.', ""I do not have SAD but am just shy and introverted.\n\nIn Secondary school, I had a small handful of friends that I'm close to.

During these unusual times of our lives (2020-2021), there are some comfort desserts we can depend on in Singapore. My favorite is ice kacang (shaved ice with soft peanuts/red beans). The various colors, the diabetes sweetness, the surprise fillings, and the sweet sugary colors of the syrup all combine into an asian dessert to lift your downcast spirits, even for a split second. Try it.

QualitativeEconomy,n6v3n4,Is access to computing education at a University Level restricted?,2021-05-07 18:09:02,singapore,378960,32,32,"Recently the MAS Chief spoke about Singapore having to rely on foreign manpower for our IT sector, because there is a lack of local workers for that sector.

However as of right now, the IGP for all 4 of NUS School of Computing courses is AAA/A, with the poly route GPA requirement being min 3.75. (10th percentile) 

Source:
https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp)

This seems abit excessive. If indeed the future of Singaporean economy is tech dependent (in both the narrower IT sector and the broader Smart Nation sense), when why is computing education being restricted to such a narrow band of top performers? 
Our universities are not short on budget for facilities and instructors, and the training for computing is not so difficult that only the very best of Singaporeans are capable of it (if A Level grades are even representative of forms of intelligence relevant for tech).

So  it appears to be a bottleneck. If we look at the undergraduate enrollment, while it is increasing, it is still at a sluggish pace. I have also heard from NUS senior management that these modest increases were also after quite persistent pressure by the senior management.

(Google NUS Undergraduate Enrollment for source, link very long) 

If we Google for the NUS graduate salary survey, we can also see that computing graduates earn significantly above the average market rate of most other graduates. 

So from the MAS comments and the salaries of fresh computing graduates, we know there is a strong demand. From the high IGP, we also know the school of computing is over subscribed. So the bottleneck can only be the Universities, that due to having a rather monopolistic position, is not letting Singaporean Labour be trained to meet market demand. Why they would choose to do so is beyond me. 

However unless we expand our tech training (and certification) and make it more accessible to those willing and able to learn, the market will eventually pressure the government to let in foreign alternatives (which it is already doing). Given the incumbent party's well founded (but not entirely holistically conceived) intention to upgrade our national economy, they cannot resist the market pressure forever.

Whether a student is AAB/B or AAA/A likely has little correlation with how strong an engineer he can be . Unfortunately, when current demand has far exceeded the universities' capacity to produce capable computing grads, they can afford to be as choosy as they want.

Look at how much we pumped into NTU's medicine school and it could only train about a hundred docs per year. \n\nComputing can scale much faster since it requires way less hardware than medicine and much more software. But the bottleneck still comes from two sources: labour and physical space. Someone has to teach and grade all the student's work. NUS is literally competing with FAANGs in order to hire profs for this job. These people are neither cheap nor easy to hire. Whoever in Singapore has a PhD in AI is making bank. Combined with the fact that the local universities has some reputational standard to adhere, they can't just hire any graduate to teach for them.\n\nAn entire ecosystem needs to be built in order to provide a good bachelor's degree.

As others have mentioned, a degree in tech is not necessary for tech. Whether medicine, business, architecture and dentistry have closure-esque characteristics is a discussion that will await new evidence. \n\nOn the topic however, I disagree that building of new facilities serves any real bottleneck. Construction of new facilities in Singapore, especially before COVID set in, does not take alot of time, especially if Government land is allotted strategically in favour for increasing training capacity. Even so, decentralisation and utilisation of underutilised facilties in other faculty buildings is always an option. \n\nThe inability to acquire and organise the necessary skilled instructors to rapidly ramp up training is probably the greater issue. However the governments pockets run deep, as we have seen, and it isn\'t an insurmountable issue. \n\nHowever to the extent that our island nation must compete with FAANGs for talent, then yes I agree this is a concern.

The number of tech relevant modules that ""loophole"" non tech students into being relevant enough to work in the field (or at least bridge the dividends of technology into productivity gains for other sectors) appears to be multiplying and would be a great boon if done properly.\n\nEither way, given the almost certain future importance of technology for Singaporean economy, though the effort and pains of building the necessary base of Singaporean labour is great, it is preferable to the dependency on foreign labour, and hence should be pursued as an option before relenting to pressure to relax current restrictions on labour import.', 'True dat I use MX blues myself', '>Internationally at least closure theory has some credence.

As for medicine, the problem really is expensive tech and labour. Singapore doesnt just produce doctors, we produce one of the best in the world. I\'m not sure how many Cuban doctors can operate the latest equipments. And maybe there\'s a case there to lower standards but teach more doctors. \n\nI don\'t think our skilled Singaporeans in tech should be ""altruistic"" that they should sacrifice money to teach for the nation.

tacos_21,n1by6k,"Enlisting soon, have some questions",2021-04-30 03:21:12,NationalServiceSG,11091,31,7,"Hi all,

Will be enlisting on 4th May (Pes B1, PTP batch) and have some qns.

1. Am underaged (20 this year, 21 in Jan) & a heavy smoker. Friends who have finished BMT (they didn't go through PTP) recently have told me that I should just bring in my cigarettes then declare during bag check because worst case scenario is that they will be confiscated (no charges). However, read on another post that there will be military and/or civilian charges. What should I do?
2. Have poly graduation a week after I enlist (still in confinement) and have been given permission to book out to attend my grad. (2pm) Anyone have similar experience with this? When do I get to book out and how long will they allow me to be out for? Have heard that I will get to book out the night before my grad to prepare whilst heard from others that I only get to book out few hours before my grad (book out -> go straight to grad -> book back in)
3. PTP batch able to bring snacks in?
4. Able to ""sneak"" wall charger in for my phone?
5. How different  is PTP as compared to BMT? Heard from friends that PTP very little army-related things, will just be PT, sleep, wake up, rinse & repeat
6. When does my confinement actually end/when will I get to book out? Quite confused about the 2 weekend thing, is it 21st May?
7. Do I really need to change my glasses to plastic before I enlist? Called up CMPB about glasses claim but they said that I will only be allowed to make a claim AFTER I enlist, meaning to say I have to go through my confinement in my metal glasses. Many friends have said high chances of my glasses breaking lol.
8. Able to book out on Hari Raya? (am chi)

Sorry if the questions are dumb! Hope am able to get more insight and clarifications on my questions. Thanks for your time :)",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/n1by6k/enlisting_soon_have_some_questions/,"['1. My personal suggestion is to not even bring - because if you bring and get caught they will get confiscated. Even if you don’t get caught bringing in, it would probably surface eventually when you want to go for your smoke breaks since smoke breaks are quite controlled. The only way to circumvent this is if your commanders turn a blind eye - which I doubt they will at BMT. \n\nMy personal experience is that an underaged smoker in my unit had his cigarettes torn in front of him after he was caught possessing the cigarettes. \n\n2) What time you get to book out and for how long will depend on your company. I personally only booked out for uni interviews and the standards for book out time and duration depended on the company’s schedule. \n\n3. Yes eventually. You should eventually clarify what kind of snacks can be brought in. \n\n4. Can is can - just don’t get caught. \n\n5. PTP is longer, more PT. But as a whole the PT generally is easier as it caters to the unfit people who are in PTP. The army-related things are more spread out. You will get relatively more admin time as a result, but some of your days might feel quite sian as it’s wake up, PT, eat, sleep. \n\n6. Not sure about this. I enlisted on a friday and had to undergo 2 weekend confinement. So exactly 2 weeks. If this is your case, then shag bro. At least you get to bookout for your graduation. \n\n7. Not sure about this sorry. \n\n8. Yup public holiday all bookout.', 'I think most of the questions had been answered already so i just add on a few stuff:\n\n1. You should not bring them into camp and yes you may be liable to military charges if found to be in possession after declaration\n2. The arrangement is such that you most probably will bookout the night before, and attend the graduation. You will book in that evening or whatever time they gave you. Then again please clarify with your commanders.\n3. Depends on COY SOP. gotta check with them\n4. You can, but if you get caught then no one is gonna help you. Same goes to the type-C charging. If you get caught using the learnet charger to charge then be answerable for it. Do it at your own risk.\n5. I guess the others already answered. You can search through this subreddit for info as some others may already have answered this question\n6. Your confinement will likely end on the 21st may judging by the enlistment date.\n7. short answer: Up to you. My suggestion is to only make your glasses AFTER your enlisted so the claims application can be approve. These receipts are liable for audit checks so only do so after you enlist. The plastic frames is just so that it is less dangerous than metal frames. My glasses originally was metal frame and kinda injured myself during field camp(which was a much later date) so for starters just be careful where you place your glasses. make sure you or your friends dont step on it. else black tape is an option to fix it:)\n8. Hari Raya is a PH. You should be rostered to bookout the night before and book in on the day of hari raya.\n\nAsk away, no questions are stupid questions', ""You may or may not have seen this comment to another post but I'm just going to copy and paste it here.\n\nI noticed that there are mixed comments in the comments here. However I just want to advice you that the use and possession of tobacco products by a person under the age of 21 in Singapore is against the law and therefore illegal. Hence, I would like to advice you not to even think of bringing cigarettes in to camp as you wouldn't want to get marked on the first day of your enlistment. Furthermore, SAF camps are lawful places and both the Military Police Command and Security Troopers as well as your Sergeants or Sirs will conduct frequent patrols and surprise checks and if you're caught in possession of any tobacco products while under the age of 21, your punishment may range from a slap on the wrist to getting charged. Lastly, as an SAF personnel, you are subject to both military and civilian law and you may be charged under both. Hence, it is in your best interest not to even think of committing any illegal acts while you're serving your National Service. However, if you would really want to exercise the SAF 9th Core Value of doing anything you want but not getting caught, you may go ahead but however, it's very risky and  you may do it at your own risk. Cheers!"", '1. Don’t. They are quite strict on this now\n\n2. Yea they will let you book out, but you need to ask your sergeants on the details\n\n3. Again, depends on your coy. My coy allowed dry biscuits and packet drinks like milk and soy milk but no coffee and other stuff. Neighbouring coy had a fitness maniac for a csm so they were allowed to bring in protein powder\n\n4. Best not to. However, pro tip is that the learnet tablet they give you for e learning runs off a usb type c charger, so if your phone or powerbank has a type c port, you’re all set. Otherwise, just try and ration your powerbank usage\n\n5. Depends on if your coy is full ptp or half ptp half enhanced batch. If the former then you will overall get a more spread out bmt cos they have 4 months to clear all the high keys compared to 2 if they need to take in enhanced batch people later on\n\n6. From what i remember, you need to spend 2 fridays in camp, but i don’t remember exactly since it was 2 years ago. Anyway, like you, i got to book out the friday of the week after i enlisted to collect a level results, and they gave us the whole day off and let us book in on Saturday morning\n\n7. Buy a black plastic frame, and keep the receipt with you when you enlist. Once you get everything settled down, look for your sergeant or your pc and tell them you want to claim for your spectacles. Pass them the receipt and you should be credited $40 to your bank account in a couple of months. Spec claim can only used once a year\n\n8. All public holidays you will get to book out, unless there are extenuating circumstances (for eg kena extra and need serve guard duty)', ""1) This one is dependent from coy to coy. I was from a mono intake last year and when I enlisted, the first thing they ask for is about underaged smokers. Some brought in their ciga and confiscated as usual, but sometimes the sergeants there will close one eye (As it's TEKONG, not mainland) and allow you to smoke (CSM will usually NOT allow it so if your sergeant allow you to do it, be thankful and if you do get caught don't paotoh your sergeant). In unit, underaged smoking is definitely not allowed. \n\n2) This one, from what I have read online, is not a book out but rather you will be given an OFF pass to attend the ceremony, meaning you will book out the day itself in the morning, attend then come back to camp immediately after the event, especially since it's your confinement week and they are being fair to other recruits also.\n\n3) This one REALLY depends. PTP batch have the highest chance to enter into mono. (MONO is usually the infantry CHIONG SUA one, infantry or armour infantry). If you do kena MONO right, likely your snacks will get confiscated as in PTP, you are considered unfit and the snacks will not help you get fit. Usually after your first bookout you can bring snacks, but the type of snack you can bring is very limited as compared to unit life (Heads up. Unit you can bring stuff like potato chips, instant noodles etc)\n\n4) Even if you bring in, there's bag check done so likely that will be confiscated."", ""Just use power bank la, it's been said for decades don't bring wall charger.

But remember that this is the military and they may punish you in other ways, like further confinement, later bookouts etc. I highly doubt they will let you off with a slap on the wrist. \n\nAlso remember that this is the military. If you get caught for an offence it may not affect just you. I can imagine the perfectly plausible scenario that one underage smoker gets caught for possession, and the whole company gets an immediate turnout/stand-by-universe to catch other underage smokers.

I have read up on the commitments and details of these 3 CCAs from ig but am hoping to know more about their culture. 

Background info: I stopped playing the trumpet after graduating from JC in 2017 with a grade 5, but played in secondary school and JC (CCA). I still play the piano casually at home (but stopped having formal lessons since JC after I took the grade 8 exam). I played the violin in primary (CCA) and secondary school (private lessons), and stopped at grade 5 in secondary school.  As such, I do not have formal training and lessons for all of the instruments for many years. 

So among all the instruments, I'm not very confident with the violin and the trumpet especially having known a friend who got rejected from the auditions and I hadnt played them in a long time and had stopped at grade 5. I am worried most people would have at least a grade 8 and the jump from grade 5 to 8 in terms of skills and difficulty is especially big especially for violin. I don't mind lagging behind alittle and more than keen to learn from others but am worried about a too competitive/ critical environment as I dont think I will have much time after CCAs to practise further due to my heavy workload in school as I am overloading in Year 2 and 3. I do enjoy playing the trumpet, but it's almost impossible to play at home because of how loud it is. 

Therefore, I was hoping to know more about their culture and how the people are like for the different CCAs before deciding which to join.

theregoesmymoolah,nsojtx,Is my mindset wrong?,2021-06-05 13:28:34,singaporefi,19171,31,0,"Would like to seek some opinions regarding stock picking and buying ETF. 

I'm in my mid 20s. My partner and I recently debated about our different views on investment methodologies.

Context:
1. $300 per month to invest currently, amount will grow gradually 
2. Started less than a year ago
3. Intend to hold stocks for the long term (retirement fund)  

My partner believes in DCA ETFs following the boglehead 3 fund portfolio. IWDA + EIMI are the centre of this portfolio. This will allow a somewhat worry-free investment strategy since he does not possess the time and effort compared to fund managers and firms who do that for a living. Bonds and local index/stocks might be considered in the future, as well as possibly commodities like gold or crypto. Diversification and passive investment is key here. 

Me on the other hand, disagree with this approach. I believe in stock picking and not in ETFs because I don't want to buy into a fund where I don't know much about its holdings. I spend my 300 monthly stock picking when I sense that the price is right. 

Currently I’ve 2 stocks which I alternate in buying monthly depending on the market (AAPL & SE). They are both doing relatively well and I intend to expand the number of stocks I pick in the near future. Actively discovering good stocks to pick is key here. 

I do regularly follow finance blogs, investment youtubers, and read news about stocks which I’d like to purchase in the future. I invest on a monthly basis. Recently I also spent some of my monthly 300 to pick and sell some meme stocks for some gains, which I’m going to use to reinvest. 

Is my methodology of excluding ETFs wrong? My mindset is why buy a small % of a holding from an ETF if I can buy the actual stock for better gains?

This is because there is a huge survivorship issue for most of the companies. On average, most companies will suck in returns.   \n\n\nBy diversifying, your partner is able to mitigate the risk that if he makes a stock call and he is wrong, he will impair a large part of his wealth. .  \n\n\nBut also by diversifying, it allows your partner to capture the returns of those companies that eventually make 3000%.   \n\n\nIn contrast, if you own these two stocks, you got to make sure that these two stocks really do well and cannot be impaired.

Blue_Fantasia,mot5ft,What are the average Managers like and how do you spot a bad/good Manager?,2021-04-11 23:50:08,singapore,378960,91,50,"Some of you might remember me from my previous posts from [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/me2sa0/need_some_advicehelp_on_leaving_my_current_job/)

Some update from the linked post:

* I did end up turning in my resignation letter, though it was a week later than planned.
* I came to realize a few more things about the place, but wanted to have more insights from other people. 

As I've never worked other full time jobs besides this one, I do not have a lot of comparisons to make when it comes to Managers. However, some of the things I've mentioned to my peers are often returned with shock, conflict and confusion. 

I'm not exactly sure how a bad Manager is supposed to be like, or what a good Manager is supposed to be like, but here are some of the things I've come to witness/be exposed to after a month of working. 

* My manager likes/wants to know about everything that has happened in the lab. Even something as small as a sponge that the lab boss has provided to one of my colleagues (it was supposed to act as a floating device for when we warm a sample in a pot of water). They came into work the next day angry/annoyed that we failed to inform them of such an addition, this is after they came in early in the morning and found the sponge. This is also the same as for when we're doing things in the lab, such as what has been done for the day etc. 
* When you make a mistake, they will raise their voice at you. On my second week of working, I made a mistake of mislabeling something (I agree that this was entirely my fault) and ended up getting a stern talking to where they raised their voice when I was trying my best to recall what was it that I had done on the actual day of testing. This is also what lead to me going into work stressed out the following two weeks whenever it was my turn to do testing at the station, as I was really worried about messing up again. 
* Morning meetings that always take up to 30mins. Well this can be a good thing as they will provide some feedback about the ongoings of the lab, I do find myself getting somewhat irritated as I feel that 30mins can be used to do my work. (Mornings are always busier.)
* They like to complain. This can be the boss from another department to just other workers from other department. I did not take notice of this initially until it was pointed out by my colleague (I was mainly focused on doing my work.)
* They cried openly to me and my colleagues (I've seen it two times now.) First time was when they were saying that they felt that the boss from the other department was being rude to them. (Cutting them off while on call, sending them 'K' in a whatsapp reply. Also because they kept giving them work to do even though my manager is not from that department.) Second time is on an incident that I will touch on later.
* Environment of the lab feels tense when they are in a bad mood. If a mistake is made, how they react is dependent on their mood. Though this mood is often made before the day starts as they would convey their mood during the meeting itself. 
* I was told by a colleague that if the Manager wants to have lunch early, we should drop whatever it is we're doing as they don't like to be kept waiting. (They insists on all of us having lunch together for team bonding.)
* Often buys food for us, without asking if we're okay with accepting it or not. A colleague tried to reject her once, but was ignored and forced to take the food home. 
* Insists that they're trying to create a happy environment in the lab where we can work in laughter and positivity. 
* Brought a colleague (who is a new recruit too) to their table and told them that they didn't like the way said colleague is speaking to them. (This colleague of mine has a more direct personality and tends to say whatever is on their mind.)
* Overly friendly and touchy-feely. (This could just be my own personal issue as I'm not comfortable with anyone I'm not familiar with touching me.)

Two incidents have happened in a month that ended up with a colleague handing in their resignation letter. To help with explaining the events, I'll try and give some nicknames/titles to make things clearer.

Colleague 1: The senior colleague

Colleague 2: The second colleague after my senior who has ended their probation.

Colleague 3: The new recruit that came in a week earlier before me. 

The first incident:

I'm not too sure about the whole context of what have happened, but based on the few snippets of what I've witnessed and from what my Manager had openly confessed, I can only say that both parties were at fault in their own right. 

* Colleague 3 was not doing the labeling as have been taught by my Manager. While it doesn't affect anything, the Manager was not happy about it and ended up scolding them loudly. This scolding involved them raising their voice while standing over colleague 3, and going off on them for about 10-15minutes. (Could be longer, but I wasn't checking the time and just felt awkward being borne witness to it. It almost seemed like they were trying to make an example of them by doing the scolding in front of me and my other two colleagues.)
* Manager was just angry afterwards and pointedly told us we'll regret it if they caught us doing the same thing and to 'better not let me see such a thing'. (This was during lunch)
* While on the way to lunch, we checked on colleague 3 to make sure they were okay and to understand what was going on. Colleague 3 did not say much, only expressed unhappiness at the fact that the Manager insists on 'doing things at your own style' but is angry at colleague 3 when they do end up doing things in their own way. (This happened in the locker room when the Manager wasn't around)
* When colleague 3 went out of the lab to collect samples, the Manager suddenly turned on us and aggressively questioned us in a raised voice on whether colleague 3 bad mouthed them behind their back at the locker room. They proceeded to call each of us by our names and would not let us go back to our work until we said something. All of us said no, which didn't seem to be enough of a answer as my Manager then moved to face all three of us directly and loudly proclaimed that we will regret it if we do not tell them what colleague 3 has said. To try and just get the situation over with, Colleague 1 simply said that colleague 3 felt stressed out from the station. Unhappy with the response, my Manager simply exclaimed ""Stress? Stressed out?! They're stressed out from doing this test?!"" (This happened on my second week.)
* The following morning, my Manager directly told me and colleague 3 that 'If you're unhappy with this job, you can tell me and I'll speak to HR.' (This was said during the morning meeting)

The second incident:

For this part I'll lean towards the side where I agree the Manager is the one at fault. While all of us are at fault in our own right, things have only escalated the way it did due to my Manager's action. 

* Colleague 3 did a labeling mistake again which was spotted and corrected in the afternoon. I wasn't sure how bad of an issue this has caused, but it doesn't seem to have affected anything for the production side. Fearful that they were going to scolded the way they did the first time by the Manager, Colleague 1 decided to cover for Colleague 3 mistake. Me and colleague 2 agreed to pretend that we weren't aware of this cover up. (Manager was not working on this day.)
* Manager came in the next morning and brought up the mistake. As agreed Colleague 1 covered for Colleague 3 by saying that they read the labeling wrongly (The sample type needs to be updated to the Manager by morning) and it was an error on their end as they 'mistyped'. Manager seemed to buy it and give us a small, but stern lecture on doing things correctly, as it would end up affecting other colleague's workflow etc. 
* What we all assumed as the Manager letting go of the issue, it was simply the opposite. Having lab experience themselves, they Manager knew that we were covering up for Colleague 3. They proceeded to once again scold Colleague three in front of everyone (I couldn't hear what was being said as I was in the corner of the lab). It seemed to be pretty bad as it left Colleague 3 in tears, who later excused themselves to the washroom, which was understandable. 
* Manager then later came to check up on my work. Proceeded to make the following comment 'Did you think I wouldn't know? I have lab experience, you can't hide things from me'. I would also like to note that they were smiling when saying this. 
* Colleague 3 came back and instead of leaving them be, the Manager called for them to go to their table. Colleague 3 was obviously unhappy with the Manager and wanted nothing to do with them, and simply carried on with their work. They ignored my Manager's call which seemed to really upset my Manager as they raised their voice and moved forward to grab Colleague 3's arm and pull them to sit by the table. (I was beside colleague 3 while this happened as we were both at the sink.)
* Manager proceeded to talk to colleague 3, seemingly demanding an explanation as to why they made the mistake they did or something similar. Colleague 3 didn't want to speak, and continued to ignore my Manager. Angered by this, my Manager refused to let colleague 3 to go back to doing their work until they said something. 
* This process went on for the whole morning till lunch time, so it went on for at least 3-4 hours. During this period of time, my Manager, frustrated that Colleague 3 refused to talk to them, loudly exclaimed to me and Colleague 3 ""I know this is cruel, but the two of you are still under probation."" 
* At one point my manager came to me and colleague 1, calling us cruel for making them do such thing. 
* At lunchtime, my manager finally let colleague 3 go. On our way to lunch, colleague 3 simply said that they've had enough and wanted to go home. Colleague 2 asked me and colleague 1 if they should inform the manager. We both agreed that they should as there is a likelihood that the manager would turn their anger on the three of us if we did not inform them that colleague 3 had went home. 
* I'm not quite sure of what is the full event that happened after. But after colleague 2 informed my Manager on a call, it was said that my Manager quickly made their way to the locker room where colleague 3 was packing their bag. They questioned colleague 3, whom at that point continued to ignore them, until my Manager asked them as quoted ""Do you want to speak to me or HR"" ""I want to speak to HR, I do not want to speak to you.""
* Colleague 3 went home. After lunch our manager had us sit down for a quick meeting and gave their own version of events. I'm not going into full details on this as it just sounded petty and doesn't seem to really change the outcome of the event. They then proceeded to tell us that if there is anything that we're unhappy about their managing skills, we can always feedback them. (Of course, none of us did.)

Some key events that happened after:

* On the day I had to OT on a weekend, my Manager cried to me and colleague 2 that they felt accused for being 'the manager who sent the newbie home crying'. (This is on the same week when the second incident happened.) They said that they felt they did nothing wrong, but and that now everyone knows what had happened and they feel the rumours to be unjustified. (I was tired and felt awkward as I couldn't do my work, it almost felt as if they deliberately chose to cry in front of me and colleague 2.) 
* Manager had me and colleague 2 stop doing our work to discuss about their actions. Manager asked each of us if they were being strict etc. When I agreed that they were, they proceeded to mention things such as: 'Well I guess I'll not be so strict then"", "" I'll stop checking up on your work progress all the time since I'm so strict. It'll also give me more time to do my own things."" etc. 

There are probably also other things that happened that I can't remember off the top of my head and because this thread will become too wordy. Many of my peers have told me that my Manager is being manipulative and gaslighting me and my colleagues, and that they're not a good Manager. 

Do you agree? How do you tell between a good/bad Manager? Would my Manager be counted as a bad/good one? And why?

But it seems that your manager is trying to do things right and unfortunately, not getting the support needed.\n\nI’ve been blessed with many good managers who’ve mentored me as I progressed up the ladder. Here’s what I’ve learnt and try to apply as a manager;\n\n1. Don’t micro-manage; I train my team and give them support and resources they need to do their jobs well. I don’t interfere in their work unless they request for help or I have to step in.\n\n2. Support your team; my team knows that as long as they are honest with me, I’ll have their backs. If they are tired and need rest, I’ll give them time off as long as the rest of my team can manage.\n\n3. Develop and grow; we talk about growth, what needs to happen for them to grow and fight for increment and promotions, I have given my top performers a bigger raise than I’ve got and make sure they are recognised for their work.\n\n4. Trust; hire the right people, listen and make sure the team knows their opinion matters, enable them to be successful and trust them to do a good job. \n\n5. Communicate; Be open and honest. l let my team know when they are doing a good job, I let them know if they screw up. They know where they stand with me and how to make things right if they are on the naughty list.\n\n6. Foster team spirit; team lunches, huddles and slack channels. I delegate training to senior members on my team so that relationships get built fast.\n\nA caveat is that all these things are possible because my company is in a very fast paced and competitive space which puts a lot of pressure on us to keep our top talents happy in order to retain them. We also go to great lengths to ensure our folks are compensated fairly and treated well by doing 360 reviews to hold managers accountable and on the ball.', ""I'm a manager, and I never raise my voice to my staff.

It is hard to have a definition for good managers, and feel free to agree/disagree with these attributes.

Every manager knows that they can't please everyone, and I dare say, will be badmouthed by someone. But they roll with it and either accept it, or handle it in a more productive way (like speaking to the colleague in private).\n* Raising their voice and questioning colleague 3 for so long - again, seems like insecurity. Either handle it quickly or let HR handle it. You don't create a toxic environment from the mistakes (whether warranted or not) of one person.\n* Creating such a fearful environment that colleagues cover for each other. Yeah, that is just not going to end well. As an example, crashing an airplane because of mistakes is not a criminal act because that will just lead people to conceal the actual reason and nothing is learnt from it.\n\nJust as an illustration, from my own experience, this is how good managers act when their subordinate (me, in this case) makes a huge mistake.\n\nThe Managing Director in charge of my domain asked me to create a list of items to be sent to managers and senior leaders in the company.  Imagine a list of Cities and Countries, so New York will be tagged to USA and London tagged to UK. I accidentally added an extra row, so 50% of the data ended up being wrong (imagine New York is now tagged to China). The mistake is obvious to anyone glancing through the list. He sent the list through his email without noticing the mistake to 100+ managers. We received 5 emails back pointing out the obvious mistakes (and probably more who didn't see the need to point it out to us), making it seem like he doesn't know basic geography.\n\nWhat did he do? He didn't blame me for making the mistakes in public. He sent a revised email out. In a private email to me  (which did not even include my direct manager), he sent a stern email reminding me that such mistakes affect his reputation and to be careful next time. No aggression, no threats, no need to have drama when we are all adults here. Still, it was enough for me.

And in cases like this, scoldings will just drop their morale even further which will not help your case."", 'I think that becomes irrelevant in this context because you guys already handled it wrongly. \n\nIn an ideal world, there should be open communication but clearly there has already been a breakdown, considering we have a situation where one of your colleagues decided to stonewall the manager for a few hours. \n\nHaving been on both sides, I will say that things aren’t always so black and white. Some of the examples brought up, such as eating together or buying food, actually sound like a manager that’s trying to keep morale up or forging bonds. \n\nThings like raising voice also really depends on the work environment and culture. I work in a high stress environment where people do get dressed down fiercely, even if it’s not with a loud voice, and that’s still considered within acceptable boundaries. No idea what your work environment is like.\n\nI mean, for all I know, your colleague is damn useless and this is just one of multiple incidents where a mistake has been made. Everyone paints their version of events in the best possible light. I’m sure if you ask your manager, she will have a very different perspective on things.', ""We're talking about work that they've been doing well here.\n\nAnd to clarify, when I say underperform, I mean comparing to their past performance and not to their peers. And that includes their drop in work ethics.\n\nI am fully supportive of assigning someone a different role that is more suited rather than firing them. I do believe in giving everyone a chance to make a living."", ""This is the first time the colleague has made the mistake. From my pov it seemed that they just didn't want to be scolded again hence the cover up. The first time they did get scolded, it wasn't over a mistake, simply because they're doing something in a way that the manager disagreed with. \n\nMy manager has given their pov and they do sincerely believe they did nothing wrong. However, I do not understand why they have to cry about it when rumours about them sending a worker home crying was circulating around. \n\nPerspective wise, it is merely what I've witnessed since the Manager did it openly in front of all of us. \n\nWork environment wise, it is busy as I'm working in production. We do not always go back to work on time, and we have to work an extra day every week as OT even though that's not what was stated in the contract or mentioned during my interview. \n\nBut I think you may have misunderstood my question. I was asking more in the context as a managerial position. You sound as if you've had experience as one, what would be the appropriate way to respond to such a situation? \n\nAlso, I do not believe it is irrelevant. I doubt this would be the last time I'll encounter such an issue, so it would be great if I received advice on the appropriate way to respond as well."", 'If you’re asking how a manager should handle it, it is complicated like I said. \n\nEvery employee reacts differently to different management styles. I have had people who work well to positive reinforcement and others who actually work a lot better to much harsher treatment. You’ll be surprised but some people don’t learn if you just keep being positive because they take advantage of what they deem as “softness”. \n\nSo the question is what’s your preference? A good manager tailors their approach to each individual. There isn’t a one size fits all management style. \n\nIn an ideal world, everyone is professional and recognises that work needs to be done smoothly and efficiently. The base for this is being able to communicate effectively but bear in mind that communication is a 2-way street.', ""I see, that is understandable. I have been told that a good manager will try to understand your learning style. \n\nPersonally for me, I found myself working best with positive reinforcement. I treat my own mistakes very seriously and do try my best to not commit them a second time. I do wish to do a good job and getting things done, and knowing that I do does encourage me to work harder. \n\nCommunication wise, the good thing about my Manager is that they're okay with me asking a lot of questions. But is very strict when it comes to mistakes. While I understand it from their pov that they want things to run smoothly, I have witnessed that it has lead to a tense environment (or fear culture?) where colleagues get tensed up and anxious when they make a mistake. Or even forget something. I too have started becoming this way as well, when I saw the shouting my colleague was exposed to. \n\nWhile we agree that getting scolded does make us remember things better, it lead to situations where we become stressed out when mistakes happen as we worry about how we're gonna face the Manager. \n\nOne of my colleague was actually stressing out about how they're gonna be able to resign smoothly because they worry that the Manager will pressure them to stay and help out. (I was told a previous colleague who resigned actually got ignored by the Manager during their one month's notice. Manager refused to speak to them at all.)"", 'It’s actually good they let you ask questions. The really bad ones don’t even allow that. \n\nBeing overly harsh with mistakes can be a double-edged sword like you pointed out. It is effective in terms of learning via fear but too much and it does become detrimental. In this situation, highly possible your manager has swung too much the other way.\n\nResigning is yet another complicated issue. The best advice is just to resign professionally, serve your notice and get out of there without burning any bridges.', ""I see, thank you for the advice and taking the time to answer my questions.\n\nI guess at the end of the day, it is easier to just say that I am still young and very green to the realities of the workforce. \n\nI'm actually quite sad that I have chosen to resign. My manager wasn't the only reason I chose to leave, but they end up being one of the main reasons. I was having trouble sleeping on days where I have work and finally decided it probably wasn't worth it.""]"

Currently, I am listing out the pros and cons btwn the local unis and would like to know what are the other selling points of NTU other than the cheaper accomodation, 2 year guaranteed hall stay. 

I also have other questions:

1. How are the gyms in NTU. Is there a booking system?
2.  Are there plugs at almost every study table? I visit U town and theres plugs literally next to every study table.
3. How's the student welfare like in NTU?

The athletes gyms is free if you’re from a school team and $10 iirc per year if you’re not. Has a some weights and lifting rack. The other gym is at North hill and is free and is always packed and gotta book a week in advance as all the slots will be taken soon. Each hall has a smaller gym but idt anyone goes there really. \n\n2. Yes there’s a power point near most tables. If you’re studying in tutorial rooms there’s a plug at every table. Most TRs are free to study in if there’s no lessons there.\n\n\n3. Student welfare is questionable. Depends on how you look at it and which school you’re from. Some are really involved but others are meh.\n\n\n4. Campus buses. I rather walk 20 mins in the hot sun than wait 20 mins and realise the bus isn’t coming any time soon and start walking after. Also the quality of teaching in some schools, can’t even understand what  a few profs are saying in lectures. And reusing slides from five years ago.', ""In ntu, you dont get to know your results (school policy to not realise number grade. sometime, the prof say letter grade is also not allowed) (prof likes to use school policy as an excuse). You don't get past year paper answers for some mods. You dont get your papers back ( you wont learn from your mistake). Basically a school for results, and not learning."", ""1. Every hall has a gym, size depends on how new the hall is. There's also multiple gyms around the campus - the ones i know is at Wave and another at North Hill. Not sure on booking system.\n\n2. For libraries maybe around 80%? Depending on the library because there are many in NTU. Outdoor benches really depends on where ya at, but there's plenty of charging points. Because of COVID they installed a lot of tables at common areas around North Spine (I believe these are temporary and hence no charging points for those tables)\n\n3. I'd say not bad! There are multiple student clubs that gives out exam welfare packs (including halls etc.), organize activities and all. There's plenty out there - just whether you want to make use of it or not. \n\n4. \nShelters. NTU is huge and some parts of the campus are not sheltered, making it difficult to travel when it rains heavily. \n\nS/U system is hugely debated. You cannot SU core modules unlike NUS, and also cannot see your grades before you SU. In other words, you mess up your core modules, goodbye to your GPA.

Winter_Key1634,nep1th,[UNI] NUS vs NTU CS..which should I choose?,2021-05-18 03:14:25,SGExams,77716,14,29,"I am really desperate..I have done an extensive amnt of research on the Internet between NTU and NUS CS. And I still can't make a final decision because the views and opinions are so mixed. The thing is all along I have decided to go to NUS CS but I hesitated when I saw that I received the CNYang scholarship from NTU..and I have to make a decision in a few days' time. I'm feeling really anxious even after asking so many people..

Some views I gathered + Opinions:
NUS: 
 + While competition is undeniably intense, the rigourous curriculum can enable me to explore and learn more. (Tbh I am lowkey afraid of this but I know I am a hardworking person and I am unafraid to put in that effort to do my best)
 + Better establishment, reputation and resources (Based on what I have gathered online, lectures, materials seem to be better than NTU's, many saying that they are not bad and they are just fine)
 + Closer to my house (I would not stay in hostels so that I can spend more time with my family, esp my grandparents)
 
 - No news for scholarship..I feel really bad having my parents to pay for school fees. (I think we don't have difficulties paying but I really can't help but feel really bad after all they still have loans for my siblings' exorbitant uni fees) (I know that there are mid term scholarships but this is really a risk to take because I can't say for sure that I can score well in NUS CS)
 - Competing with top-notch individuals, fast-paced

NTU:
 + Recently revamped their curriculum, but some seniors of the new curriculum told me that it is still lacking in different ways (I can't determine how true this is since it's quite subjective)
 + CNyang scholars programme (With research opportunities and additional modules, financial help)
 
+/- While I know it's a sweeping statement to say that there is less competition, many have stated that NTU has a gentler learning slope and bellcurve
- Lower graduate starting pay (I am taking this with a pinch of salt because I know that this is a shallow way of choosing uni but I kept thinking about the reasons why. Some noted how a possible reason is how nus curriculum prepares their students better for the industry) (But we all dont know the real reason for sure)
 - Further..living away from my family because I would need to stay in hostel
 - One CNYang senior noted how the programme may not be really relevant to what employers are looking out for in CS undergrads unless one intends to go into research (I am not looking for a research-related career in the future)
 - May not be looking forward to learn chem because it haunts me (But I love to learn so I don't mind doing so for the programme but I'm not sure whether it would be more beneficial for me to spend that time learning more about cs)


I have started learning coding for a few months..and I realised how I really love it, esp that kind of satisfaction I get when I manage to debug a code and successfully come up with a code to solve a problem. Hence, I really don't mind studying hard for a more rigourous curriculum. I know many say that uni doesn't matter and it still depends on individual's effort but I really hope I can have as many learning takeaways as possible in this 4 years of my life. 

I know this decision is mine to make. And I can't depend on anyone to make this decision. But I hope to get any additional last min advice or even a simple opinion to which sch would you choose if you were in my position will really help me 🙏🏻 I feel quite tramautised from such decision-making because I once made a wrong one and I regretted so badly.  Please...thank you so much!",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nep1th/uni_nus_vs_ntu_cswhich_should_i_choose/,"['[deleted]', "">(Tbh I am lowkey afraid of this but I know I am a hardworking person and I am unafraid to put in that effort to do my best)\n\nAlmost everyone at NUS is hardworking, I think the definition of hardworking is very much expanded in NUS. Furthermore, you hardworking != results. It is very much the case in NUS that you are ridiculously hardworking but still get dogshit results. The payoff of hardwork is very little in uni as compared to JC.\n\n>reputation and resources \nReputation maybe, but CS is very dependent on your portfolio. \n\nResources not true, if you consider youtube a resource then sure. NUS has its fair share of garbage modules and resources. Only very few modules are taught very well. Consider this, many NUS CS modules are taught by student teaching assistants who may not be the most qualified to teach. It is literally RNG. Most of the time, you are left self studying the material.\n\n>Some noted how a possible reason is how nus curriculum prepares their students better for the industry\n\nThis is totally not true, I guarantee you no curriculum in any uni prepares you for the real working world. Your own effort to learn things outside the curriculum matters, the curriculum only lays the foundation for what you learn. A consequence of this fact is that where you get your degree doesn't really matter. Don't be hoodwinked by the starting salary.\n\n>Hence, I really don't mind studying hard for a more rigourous curriculum.\n\nDon't say this before you actually have a taste of what academic programming is like.

Sashimi1999,mniblp,Chao Recruit Beginner's Guide to Investing during NS,2021-04-09 22:24:23,NationalServiceSG,11091,32,344,"# **Investing During National Service**

## **❗️Disclaimer: I am by no means a financial advisor/ professional. All advice is strictly educational only so please do your own due diligence and research before putting your own money at risk!** *Also, this is my first post! So hopefully I don’t screw this up haha 😅*

## 👋 **Introduction**

Hey everyone! Just got a ton of questions from this subreddit regarding how to start investing and I thought it’ll be a good idea to share some tips I’ve discovered about investing. *(2 years ++ of experience)*    

## 🌈 **My Journey**

I started investing abit before enlisting into NS. Took up a part time job about 4-5 months before NS and enlisted into NS! During that period was where I started to get serious about investing. I used the time to research on investments using YouTube, blogs and various godly investors (Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch) etcetc.

After that, I enlisted into Tekong then proceeded on to be a man. I would bring books during BMT because damn sian lol. Sometimes read about investing, sometimes about self development. Then during unit life luckily managed to find a circle of friends to talk about investing, and we have been bouncing off ideas each other! Really grateful to have bros ah that are passionate about this topic.

Also dabbled abit into trading, algorithmic finance, but didn’t do too well at it. Personally, I realized that investing seems to suit my personality more and have been finding more success at it!

My investment style is to do a semi-active style where I would pick and research great businesses, hold them for the long term, and **Dollar Cost Average(DCA)** into them once a month, or once every 2 months.

### **Asset Allocation**

* Had a bunch of savings before enlisting into NS. (work and angpao).
* Dedicated 12 months of emergency expenses as an emergency fund *(DONT TOUCH)*
* REC pay was $560 at that time. Pumped $300 monthly (4 months, PTP)
* PTE pay + combat about $650. Pumped $300-400
* LCP pay + combat about $700. Pumped about $400-500
* CPL pay + combat about $800. Pumped about $450-550

On a monthly basis, I would take some from my chunk of savings *(lets say $400)* then proceed onto combining it with my NS allowance. ($300-$550) Thereby investing a total of $700 - $950 a month.

I personally invested in a range of **big cap US stocks, ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) and Cryptocurrency.**

## ✨ **Intro to Investing**

### **Risk**

**All investments come with a form of risk,** ***(which is why you should henceforth get a return from it)*****. Generally speaking, the higher your risk, the higher your return.**

However it is important to **allocate risk to each individual’s situation**. Depending on the individual, there could be various factors affecting how much risk to take on.

Some examples are: *Income, savings, debt, psychology, any other personal situation*

*Your risk should be tailored to the maximum amount you could lose without making a panicked decision, an impromptu cash out, or losing sleep over fear/anxiety*

### **Compound Interest**

The beauty of investing is in compound interest. Try calculating **1\*1.10 20 times...**

*You would end up with* ***6.73***, meaning a $100 investment will become\* ***$673 in 20 years if you manage to get a 10% pa rate of return.*** *Now imagine consistently adding $$$ and compounding. Cfm stack like mad*

*One way I like to think of this is like a XP multiplier (if yall play games). Last time Maple Story got 2x EXP card, but this one like 1.1x EXP HAHAHA, still solid la every time u earn 1000$, become like $1100.*

### **Asset Classes**

Whilst researching about investing, I’m sure you’ve heard words such as *“Real Estate”, “Equities”, “Stonks”, “Bonds”, “Bitcoin”, “Stashaway” etcetc...*

These are various **assets types(classes)** in which you can invest in. Each one comes with it’s own type of **risk vs reward!** *Ideally, you would want to mix up and buy a few of these asset classes, so as to diversify your portfolio and avoid putting all your eggs into one basket!*

*Here are some asset classes...* Generally, in the order of low risk to high risk, and some examples.

***Fixed Deposits / Savings Account >>> Bonds  >>> Hedge Funds / Mutual Funds / Robos >>> Total Market Index Funds / ETFs >>> Real Estate >>> Stocks >>> Cryptocurrency***

### **Fixed Deposits / Savings Accounts**

Probably the lowest risk investment you can make. Park money at a bank or financial institution to get on your deposits. Could be a good way to grow emergency funds.

*Risks: The financial institution collapsing or running into super big trouble, jialat until they cannot pay you. Also interest rate risk, locking up your money at a low rate of return.*

*(expect returns from about 0.5% - 1.5% pa.)*

* Local bank savings account
* Local bank fixed deposit
* SingLife

### **Bonds**

Bonds are financial instruments where you lend money and receive payments (coupons) based on your loans. You get your $$$ generally annually, but it depends from bond to bond ah. Basically you become ahlong but legal HAHA.

There are mainly two types of bonds. Govt bonds and corporate bonds. Govt bonds are where you lend money to governments, corporate to companies / businesses.

You can also choose how long to lend your money for. This is also known as the Maturity of bond. Generally, longer you hold, more $$$ you earn.

*Risks: Companies or governments collapsing, interest rate risk.*

*(expect returns from about 1.0% - 5.0% pa.)*

* US Treasury Bonds
* SG Savings Bonds
* Corporate Bonds (DBS, Apple, Google etc)

### **Hedge Funds / Mutual Funds / Robos**

Give money to other zaikia / professionals to invest. *(Remember that huge af Endowus ad at Serangoon MRT lol. thats actually a robo investor)* If you have invested into insurance investment schemes, they will have these zaikia investing for them. (Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, etcetc). They then charge you a fee for their professional services.

*Risks: Outperformance by general market, mismanagement by manager, abnormal market conditions (covid etc)*

*(expect returns from about 5.0% - 10.0% pa.)*

* Your local insurance provider
* EndowUs / StashAway / Syfe


### **Total Market Index Funds / ETFs**

Index Funds are a financial instrument where you invest in the broad stock market. For example, if you buy the S&P500 index fund, you would technically own over 500 stocks in the USA market. Vice versa for the STI30 for SG stocks.

ETFs (exchange traded funds) are basically instruments that contain a bunch of stocks / equities. You could buy these ETFs off your local exchange / broker. Each ETF can suit a different theme of investment. (Index, Sector, Philosophy, etc)

*Risks: General market conditions, picking the wrong sector to invest in*

*(expect returns from 6.0% - 11.0% pa.)*

* Standard and Poor’s 500 (S&P500) Top 500 US stocks by company worth.
* Straits Times Index (STI) Top 30 SG stocks by company worth.
* Arkk Invest (ARKK) Innovative companies
* (XLF) Top finance companies in US / Worldwide

### **Real Estate**

Basically properties lol. Buy properties and charge rental, hoping for asset appreciation for your property.

One thing you can invest in is REITs. Basically you can buy a portion of properties around the world with limited capital. (Like can start with 300SGD). For example if you bought CapitaMall REIT, maybe you own one square tile of Plaza Sing HAHA. *(and get paid for it stonksss)*

*Risks: Location, macroeconomic factors, management, tenants*

*(expect returns from 4.0% - 8.0% pa)*

* Your BTO Flat
* Private Properties (Condo etc)
* CapitaMall REITS

### **Stocks (aka Equities)**

Buy shares of a business. If you buy a share of DBS for example, you own part of the business. If business does well, stock price will generally increase. Vice versa for declining companies.

Can be divided into small cap, mid cap, and large cap stocks. Cap = Market Capitalization, aka how much the company is currently valued at. Generally, large cap stocks are safer to invest in rather than mid cap and small cap.

Also, some businesses give payouts to their shareholders *(****aka Dividends****)*. Basically you own abit of the company mah must get paid abit hor :).

You need to sign up for a **brokerage account** before you can start buying stocks.

*Risks: Poor selection of businesses, macroeconomic factors, management, psychology / self destruction (yes a lot of this from my personal experience / talking to other people)*

*(expect returns from 6.0% - 15.0% pa)*

* SG stocks such as DBS, SIA, ShengSiong stc
* US stocks such Apple, Netflix, Disney etc
* Other worldwide companies

### **Cryptocurrency**

Cryptocurrencies are a relatively new form of asset class that are revolved around digital technology. Basically they are digital currencies etc. Could be somewhat more risky as no one really knows what's going to happen to this asset in the near future.

*Risks: error and hacking, discontinuation, basically everything, no one knows what's gg to happen*

*(don't expect any estimated returns, just enjoy the ride lol)*

* Bitcoin
* Ethereum
* Dogecoin

## **Creating a portfolio**

So got so many asset classes, how to start ah?

Firstly, look at your personal finances, see how much you can afford to lose / put at **risk**. Always have some backup cash (emergency fund) lying around before investing! You never know what could happen tomorrow, and it’s always best to be prepared.

Then, I would say really ask yourself deep inside what's your **risk tolerance.** Find smth that really suits your mentality and keeps you invested for the long haul. **Always remember the magic of compound interest!**

Choose a variety of asset classes (to avoid risking everything in one asset class). *As investors, we allocate and manage risks in our portfolio.*

Research what assets to buy from each asset class, abit hard to explain in one post. Will maybe continue or edit for next time!

For example, if you’re more of a risk adverse person can consider:

*50% Bonds 50% Robo Investing*

or for a more risk taker:

*80% Equities 20% Crypto*

It all depends from person to person. There’s no perfect way to invest, and the best way to learn is to really get your hands dirty. *(rmb field camp anyone)*

Then, choose a way of pumping your money in. Could be either monthly, quarterly, yearly, or everything at once (lump sum). For me, I do a monthly DCA into equities / ETFs, small lump sum into cryptos.

## 🧐 **Resources / Education**

*These people probably give better advice but yea pls pls pls do more research before investing!*

* YouTube (Investing with Rose, Graham Stephan, Adam Khoo, Chicken Genius Singapore, Sven Carlin etc)
* Blogs (Seedly, Moneysense, The Motley Fool)
* Books (The Intelligent Investor, One Up On Wall Street, Rich Dad Poor Dad)

Mahsunon,nspntp,Some FAQ of the local fixed gear scene,2021-06-05 14:43:58,singapore,378961,23,0,"Hi everyone I noticed there aren't many fixed gear posts on here so I thought of chiming in as a local fixed gear cyclist myself. I don't intend to push any agenda I just want to be informative.

# What is fixed gear ?
I don't think there's an official definition, but I believe when people talk about fixie or fixed gear bikes, they are referring to the same thing. A fixed gear bike has only one gear, and that single cog (attached to the rear wheel) is 'fixed' to the motion of the cranks. This means that, like conventional bikes you see on the road, when you pedal forwards, the bike goes forward. But for fixed gear, if you pedal backwards, the wheel goes backwards as well. It's easier to demonstrate this in a video/ in person.

# Fixie no brakes ?
Again, I don't think there's an official standard as to whether fixed gear bikes have brakes or not, but from the many fixed gear cyclists I've seen in the community, there are riders with brakes, and riders without. It's entirely up to the rider. Most fixed gear bikes have the front hole drilled in the fork to fit a conventional rim brake. The reason why many fixed gear cyclists don't use brakes is because the fixed gear system is inherently a braking system as well. Since the wheels are fixed to the motion of the cranks, you can pedal backwards and counter the forward motion of the bike. You can resist the forward motion gradually but it's quite inefficient. Instead, with proper technique, you can completely stop the rear wheel from moving even while the bike is still in motion. This is known as skidding. This is the most popular way of braking. When I first started riding fixed, I couldn't skid. I used a front brake. I practised skidding while still having a front brake. It took me some time to confidently stop by skidding. Skidding isn't my most efficient method actually lol I do a 'jump skid' that looks like I'm hopping on my bike. Again, it's hard to describe this through text.

And now the hot question hahaha can skidding replace brakes ? Personally I would say it depends hahahahhaha. I feel there are two main conditions to be able to go brakeless. First you'll need to be experienced and confident in your skidding ability. Second, your legs and lungs need to be conditioned to it. Nobody seems to bring my second point up. SKIDDING IS EXHAUSTING. Especially if you're cycling far and fast. Maybe I'm just weak or my gear ratio is too high lol. To stop a fixed gear bike, you need to counter your forward motion. So if you're cycling fast, there's more motion to counter. Imagine doing this between traffic lights. It's tiring.

## Since skidding is not easy, why go brakeless at all ?
Hahaha this is the one thing I can't shine a good light on the community. [Brakeless just looks much better.](https://www.flickr.com/photos/109906786@N06/) I think the worst combo, aesthetically, is riser bars + brakes + black aluminium rims with faded brake track. It makes the bike look cheap. I think the best way to look good with brakes is drop bars + cross top lever + carbon rims. This topic is extremely subjective lol. 

# Where did fixed gear come from ?
I believe wayyy back all bikes were fixed gear until multiple gears and freewheel hubs were introduced. Fixed gear is still used in indoor track events like in the olympics, velodrome races, Japanese keirin races. Track bikes don't have brakes. I guess cuz lighter faster and no traffic lights. Speaking of track bikes, I think I should clarify that track bikes are a subset of fixed gear bikes. Most fixed gear bikes you see aren't built like track bikes - to be super aero and all. They're built up to be a little more tough. Street builds.  

But in this post I want to focus on the local scene so where do fixed gear bikes come from ??? Where do you buy one ?? I'm not too familiar what happened 'at the start' but currently there's this brand from China called Tsunami that makes very cheap fixed gear frames. Search up fixed gear on aliexpress or taobao and you'll see that there's $200 Tsunami frames with $150 wheels, and $50 OTA cranks. Carousell it and you can find a full bike for $200 or so. There's also this brand intro7 that's been dishing out lots of affordable fixed gear stuff. These tsunami fixes are very popular within the local fixed gear community because the community is mostly secondary school kids without a lot of money hahahha. Of course there's higher end brands ranging from Engine 11, Cinelli, Look etc.. I believe most fixed gear cyclists order them through local bike shops that specialise in fixed gear bikes namely, cycleprojectstore, progressionbikes, and fishtail cyclery.

# Who are fixed gear cyclists ?
Rowdy noisy secondary school kids riding tsunami fixies appear to be the face of the community because they have been making headlines and they're always blasting JBL at PCNs but that's not everyone. A couple of years ago before I even started riding fixed, there was as local fixed gear race called Holy Crit. There was also this popular mass ride event called Mega Mass Ride. I believe these two events plus bike messengers took the spotlight until Holy Crit stopped. This wasn't my era so I don't know much. But now from what I see, the local fixed gear community isn't one big united group. It's just small groups of friends here and there. Fixed gear communities overseas seem to be more united and organised.

# Why fixed gear ?
It's just really fun. I feel that fixed gear is like an enthusiast level of cycling. It's quite like mechanical keyboards hahhaha. People will always say simplicity, maintenance whatever but personally I think it's just fun. Some might say it's idiotic to ride a bike that's harder to ride since no gears but like I said, you need to try it to understand. The power trasmission, the control, the feel (lol im like describing mechanical kb too). You probably won't understand it until you've spent time riding a convential road bike and then switch to fixed.

Sorry for my incoherent writing there's just so much I would love to write about. My opinions may even be misinformed so lmk if I missed anything. I'm actually quite opinionated about bikes so I hope I remained objective lol.",0.44,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nspntp/some_faq_of_the_local_fixed_gear_scene/,"['As you said, skidding on fixies is much harder than regular braking, and also something that needs experience to do properly.\n\nSo that raises the question of how someone would gain that experience without endangering others due to not knowing how to skid properly, as well as how the enforcement of ""must have enough safety knowledge and experience to ride"" might happen, whether from the government or from the fixie community (or communities).\n\nMandating brakes on all bicycles, fixie or free, seems to be a lighter touch than the immediate alternative that comes to mind, ie requiring licence tests for any fixie riders (or all bicycle riders, should it come to that).

taipciataila,o9sh6n,[uni] Questions about Oxford econ and management,2021-06-29 04:17:28,SGExams,77717,4,1," 

Hey!

I'm making this post hopefully not only for myself but for others planning to apply to E&M at Oxford. I have a couple of questions regarding the application process, the PS, TSA ant other stuff.

1. I'm not from the UK and in the country that I live in we don't have A level economics. We only have economics as a course but the lessons are treated like garbage. I study at the best high school in my country and we haven't had an economics teacher for all 3 years that I studied it. There were lectures here and there but really the lessons weren't happening.

Because of that I'm currently enrolled in Coursera for finance, microeconomics, model thinking, game theory and some maths. I'm also thinking of reading the Cambridge international A level economics textbook. Because I'll only have from now until oct. 15 ( the deadline to apply ) and I also work a full-time job + have a life besides work and studying I'm not sure if I'll be able to really really excel in economics. I am incredibly interested in this subject ( hence the application ) and am ready to devote A LOT of time to learn it. I just want to know if this might affect my application.

2) Besides the pure theory of economics I read a lot. I am very interested in the more philosophical per se economics like Marxism, Keynesian economics, behavioral economics and just the way that people, societies and economics rely and depend on each other. I know an oxford PS is very academia based (are they?) and less so work and extra-curricular based. Do you have any niche and specific econ book recommendations that were interesting to you. I really want to read more and apply the reading to my Personal Statement and ( hopefully ) the interview!

3) Besides econ books I don't really read too much on the management side. Have any recommendations? I manage 2 non-profit organizations and 1 company of my own but that's pure work-experience and I would enjoy some theory.

4) As for work and extra-curricual experience As mentioned before I don't have an actual economics class in my school so I haven't had the chance to go to any championships or anything of this sort that is related to economics. I do on the other hand have 2 non-profits that I lead and 1 running company that I created. I also am on the winning team of my country's national debate championship. Will that be enough?

5) How much do you think one should prepare for the TSA? I'm thinking of buying the guide book, do you think it's worth it?

I do understand some of these questions are basic, some of them may sound irrational but they're not dumb to me. I'm taking this application very seriously because I know I can do it if I put enough effort into it. Please refrain from ,,Don't go to Oxbridge'' , ,,x is better'' comments, I don't need them.

This is extremely important to me and I do believe that it's important to so many students.

Good luck to the applicants and thanks for the help, cheers.",0.56,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/o9sh6n/uni_questions_about_oxford_econ_and_management/,"['I feel your pain but I think we are not in a position to advise you.

I remeber printing out 10 years of papers lol. it's quite an important part of the application so definitely worth being prepared. also, the econs I've had so far has been mostly pure micro/macro type things studying models and the like, and not the philosophical aspect. marxism is more of a politics thing. not sure if it's the same for E&M so if you're really interested in that part that's something to consider."", ""thanks!\n\nI'll make sure to do my tsas :) As for the other half: I have considered PPE for a bit since I am a very philosophical/political person but something, and I can't name what, drives me to decline this idea and apply for E&M. I also for example see Marxism as a very economical and scientific thing, the theoretical ideas can't go on without the mathematical/statistics side of it. Also management is very much so up my alley, so it seems only natural to apply for E&M.""]"

Also, I wanted to ask how many credits/mod is it till you overload credits and need to ask for permission to take more classes? thanks :D",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/njprwm/uni_overloading_credits_and_taking_a_minor/,"[""Whether it's feasible or not depends on how many Unrestricted Electives (UEs) your course has. As a professional degree, I'd imagine nursing doesn't have that many. While minors allow a certain number of mods to be double counted (for specifics check the minor in question), in practice this doesn't really happen with really specialised degrees like nursing, because there won't be overlap between the content covered. In other words, a psych mod is unlikely to cover content relevant to nursing, so its unlikely it can be used to count toward both courses. In which case, if your number of UEs is less than the number of MCs required for the minor, you will have to either overload or extend your uni term to complete the minor. \n\nYou won't be allowed to overload at all in your first year. Subsequently, how much you can overload is dependent on your CAP. In your first year you can take max 23MCs iirc. So overloading is around like 24MCs per semester or more, which is roughly 6 mods. NUS says that each MC is equivalent to a certain number of hours of work per week, you can Google the exact number, but in my experience this really varies from mod to mod. \n\n\nImo, taking a minor is only worth if you really want/need that extra accreditation on your cert. If you're just interested in learning the content, you can take like Coursera courses on the subject instead. This route is also much more flexible time-wise."", ""Fellow Nursing student here!

Best would be to check with OA and maybe some tutors in the faculty regarding reading a minor.\n\nEdit: Nursing has 2 UEs in the 3 years of study. 3 UEs if you do an honours.

Wide_Yogurtcloset934,nlyqc7,"[O Levels] What are some tips for Tamil Lc , Oral and P2",2021-05-27 11:39:04,SGExams,77717,5,14,"hi y’all so tamil o’s is in 4 days and i am panicking because i am to get an A1 and i do not wish to retake it on nov cause i want to focus on other subjects . the only issue rn is paper 2 sentence structuring ,, no matter how many practices i do i keep getting below 5 usually 2/3 and it pulls down my p2 results greatly . My compre and all other sections are pretty strong . yes lc is a torture , i fail lc always . it is actually the easiest paper but i cant seem to pass at all even tho i understand the content and qs clearly . oral bro i used to get 40/50 since sec 1 till sec 3 but for some reason i got 25/50 for mye this year even tho i tot i did better than sec 3 haha . apparently all of my peeps in my class also got below 30 so idk if the teacher is too strict or what . would greatly appreciate if you can give me tips for all of these :) also is there bell curve for o’s cause irdw to be too dependent on it .. THANK YOU GUYS ! GOOD LUCKKK!",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nlyqc7/o_levels_what_are_some_tips_for_tamil_lc_oral_and/,"[""For LC, practise is key. Just ask your teacher for a lot of practices and keep practising. My teacher uploaded the practices onto SLS so we just practised whenever we wanted and answers were given there as well. When we wanted more practices we will just ask her and she will upload it there. So yea you can ask your teacher to do that as well! \n\nFor oral, practising is also key. You would need your teacher's help. Consult your teacher almost every week and do 1 or 2 practices (reading and video interaction) with him/her. After the practising session, ask your teacher to give you back feedback on how you did and write the feedback on a notebook. Go home and practise again on the same text u did, this time take note of the errors in your feedback and rectify them. By the next practise session with your teacher, make sure you have corrected your mistakes by then. So essentially, you should be doing 2 TYPES of practises each week, one with yourself and one with your teacher. And for spoken interaction, when they ask you a question, understand it well before answering. When answering, just talk like there's no tomorrow. Of course, don't talk out of point. But keep talking until they tell   you to stop or you have no more points ahhah! Trust me at the start you will feel like you have very little points to talk aboiy but you just need to push yourself a little to think and you will have more points to talk about! Oh yes and reading tamil books during your free time helps too!\n\nFor paper 2, time management is key. You really need to split your time well. For example, i would split 50 mins for compre section and the remaining time for the other sections. Usually i will write till the last minute and won't really check but I'll be very meticulous when doing all my questions, to avoid careless mistakes. Sentence structure really need to practise, you won't get it if you don't practise. Once you practise a lot you will realise there's a pattern. And once u know that pattern u can do damn well. So my only suggestion is practise for sentence structure and learn from your mistakes. Sometimes paper 2 can be hard but don't let your hopes down. \n\nAs for the bellcurve, please don't worrry about it. From my experience, it doesn't exist for tamil. Many people told me after the paper (2020 June) that it was easy  and that cut off for A1 will be 80-85%. I lost hope because the most I assumed to get after calculating with LC, oral, P1 and P2, was about 75-78%. I also messed up my P1 because I didn't finish my compo (only wrote like half if I'm not wrong cause I spent so much time on email - see time mangement is key). So at most, i was expecting a B3 and if lucky A2. Was really disappointed cause I worked super hard for it and I thought I wouldn't do well. Fast forward to results day, to my surprise I got an A1! So i would say the bellcurve doesn't really exist for tamil? So yeah. All the best for the exam on monday! Don't think of the results too much as it would put pressure on you, leading to you not performing so well during the paper because of fear. Once again, all the best and you can do it!"", '[deleted]', 'omgg thank you this is really helpful !!', '[deleted]', ""There isn't any video I can think of tbh. Just gotta practise. Just like what the above person has mentioned, just gotta practise, consult and learn from your mistakes. Still have time left you can do it! Try ur best to catch your cher.

Then by this way you are learning from your mistakes. All the best!"", 'No worries, glad it helps :)', '[deleted]', 'yoo there aren’t really any videos to help you with that but what i’m currently doing rn is practicing it and booking consultations with my aasiriyai one on one to go thru the practice and corrections . i can defo see drastic improvements and its my only struggle . so ask ur aasiriyai for more practice and ask her to mark and have a consultation with you !']"
Grand-Pop-5363,nfkbhj,Need advice on IT Career progression,2021-05-19 03:49:33,askSingapore,44675,24,8,"Hi all, am a 24 year old, diploma holder from Kaplan. ORD-ed in Oct 2019 and worked as a Desktop Engineer at a school from Dec 2019 till Mar 2021. Earned only 1.8K. Currently working as a L2 Deskside Support Engineer with a salary increment of $600.

I'm working under agency currently with minimal basic benefits (no AWS) although was told there would be yearly increment depending on performance. I'm planning to work here for about say 2-3 years and finding a job that's direct hire with better benefits and pay.

Thing is I'm not sure where to head on from here if I'm to resign in 2-3 years time. I'm open to switch roles and learning other stuffs to i.e networking/programming/cyber security. Doing a degree PT is another option but not relevant to me now as 1) too costly 2) Need to support family monthly as my sister and mom was retrenched. Only dad and myself working. I would also like to know what courses out there I could pursue and obtain to boost my resume if possible. Can't use skillsfuture for now due to age limit but I do have some savings tht I can use to invest in courses.

All the best to you! Respect you for supporting your family at a young age. Also, see if you can apply for financial assistance.', 'From someone who has walked a similar path. Let me give you some real advice. \n\nFirstly, software engineering is not for everyone. Good SWEs get paid decently, only the best get paid super well so it skews the perception of SWE making bank. There are probably a couple of hundred Singaporean SWEs that are in FAANG, top Chinese firms. Rest are just getting by.\n\nSecondly, there are many career options in tech/IT besides software engineering. You need to have an idea of what your goals are first before someone can help guide you.\n\nEg. If your primary driver is money, you should aim to get into sales and/or management track. Sales track you need to figure out a path to SI/Vendor while management track you need to spend time to get your degrees etc but not many make it beyond middle management.\n\nIf you want stability, the technical track is more suitable and you can advance along your current line from desktop support to windows engineering to enterprise architect or IT service management. \n\nIf you want something in between, can try out technical sales track with presales or customer success roles but similarly you have to move to SI or Vendor.\n\nIT is a huge and varied field but one way to identify your path is to figure out something you like and have a passion for as you need to keep learning constantly to keep up with tech. Ask your friends what they are doing, look for a mentor, get an idea of what you want first before figuring out how to walk the path', ""For programming, you don't need a degree in computer science. Take up free online courses, self-learn, sign up for programming bootcamp (usually 3-6 months) and make sure you have side projects to showcase during interviews.\n\nI was a quantity surveryor (construction industry). I took up a programming bootcamp and am now a software engineer!"", 'Having a degree will definitely help in opening some doors, but if you think that\'s not what you want to do for now, you may still want to take up some CS / programming courses on Udemy.

I personally prefer paying a small amount for a structured course (as a complete beginner) rather than watching free youtube videos which may be all over the place.\n\nAfter completing the basic courses, you can then boost your resume by doing your own projects ""for fun"". Needless to say, all of these are going to take some dedication and sacrifices in terms of time invested.\n\nAnd if you do decide to pursue a related degree in 2 to 3 years time, you\'ll also have some headstart over the rest (or at least, be on par with others who also did their own self-study, lol!)', 'I actually started out as an SI, but the pay was low for local SME so I took up a IT support role for an MNC, which was actually helpdesk + one man department. The pay was definitely better but during my few years there, I noticed that most IT staff are contractors, including me and treatment between employee and contractors are vastly different. Especially when it comes down to personal development planning. As a contractor, you are pretty much on your own to upskill. Whereas, employees are given time off and opportunities for further training, pay raise and projects to lead.\n\nAnyway, helpdesk is a shit dead end job.

Just because they educated, doesn\'t make them good at IT but they think they just lazy to do it themselves, that\'s why I am there for them.\n\nIn the end, I couldn\'t take it anymore. ATM, I\'m not sure whether I wanna return to IT industry. Ppl keep saying its good. But my time in IT, I saw tons of talented ppl being reassigned downwards, stuck in their role or let go, due to outsourcing. I keep hearing this popular buzz word ""Cost Cutting"".

Examples of vendors are Cisco, VMware, Cyberark, Palo Alto, Crowdstrike, Zscaler, Qualys amongst many many others. Vendors pay the best but as they are generally foreign companies, the ceiling is usually regional leadership and are very competitive. I work in this space.\n\nSI or System Integrators are companies that offer consultancy services to install/configure solutions ,ie vendor products. Higher tier ones often offer customisation or bundled solutions to address client needs in multiple areas. SI can have many tiers from large global MNCs like Accenture, IBM, PWC, NTT to local firms like NCS, Trustwave, Ensign to really small SMEs.\n\nIn between Vendors and SI, we have distributors which mostly handle support, RMA and logistics. They also help vendors do outreach and marketing, as well as buffer risks for global companies who sell to local firms. \n\nLastly, we have the end users. Usually IT/Security are considered cost centres but large firms which are subject to regulatory compliance will take cybersecurity more seriously and value the team higher. Usually Financial services like banks, insurers, telco or even law firms which hold sensitive customer data.\n\nThat’s basically the tech/cyber ecosystem.

Looking forward tomorrow for your input in CyberSec, as mentioned above that's what I'm planning to pursue in the near future 😊 have a good night!"", 'i think they over-market these mid-career courses. not everyone is cut out for such deep tech stuff. could also be the way they teach though..zzzz...', 'Cybersec is a broad field as well, I know these few areas; endpoint security which focuses on protecting end user compute such as desktops, mobile devices with software such as MFA, Antivirus or EDR solutions. Then you have those focusing on perimeter and network security such as Nextgen firewalls, IDPs, encryption software, another area is identity management software providers like cyber ark, zscaler, RSA etc... These are on vendor side.\n\nOn end user side, you have security teams handling these products, incident response, security operations who monitor for breaches and as well as external red team testers.\n\nNext is up to you. You need to do your own research and training into these solutions and roles, read up on what hackers are doing today and reports of high profile attacks. You need to have a real interest and learn the fundamentals for yourself based on the areas I’ve mentioned. Google is your friend and you can look for companies and roles job description so that you know what skills are required. There are many good resources and even free course available on Coursera and udemy. \n\nLastly, you need to make the right moves to progress, I suggest moving to a SI for your next role as that’s where someone junior can gain a lot of exposure and learn as you work on many products. If you have the chance to join a SI even if pay is not that great go for it, short term but you gain a lot in the long run.\n\nGo for it, be hungry and be brave.

Also take note, ""be sued"" means its not a criminal offence but a civil one.\n\nNot familiar with the GOM but from this case, recording is sent as part of complaint, not spread around social media...... yet......', 'Yeah I removed the criminal sanction point from my comment because I realised it’s only a civil infraction here in Singapore (I’m sorry, I’m more familiar with other systems where it’s a criminal rather than civil violation).

I wanted to enquire about the average work/life balance in Singapore. My brother works there, and my father constantly wants me to go there. He sends me a lot of articles about higher education in Singapore and yadda yadda yadda.

Frankly, I would prefer to work in a European country, but I understand that it’s isn’t an easy feat, which is why I’m considering settling for Singapore.

The thing is, I never really had the best mental health. My self-esteem and self-worth directly ties to my status and career, and considering the general competitiveness of Singaporeans, I don’t want my mental health to suffer more than it does due to overworking and stress. Furthermore, the work/life balance there seems to be pretty bad, from personal accounts that I’ve heard, and the properties are absurdly expensive lmao (though that is understandable due to it’s size).

ItsNotMyFirstRodeo,midzwi,Has anyone here gone through MOE's PGDE program? Looking for advice :),2021-04-02 13:47:08,singapore,378961,32,31,"I'm currently Y3 in a local uni and I'm contemplating applying for MOE's PGDE (Post-Graduate Diploma in Education) program and signing away 4.5 years of my life to teaching (1.5 year training stint + 3 year bond). I definitely have a passion for teaching, would ideally like to teach English/GP in JC or at the Secondary-level as I'm majoring in one of the social sciences (but I wouldn't mind teaching History or Social Studies as well). I've also undergone the 3-month MOE internship prior to entering uni where I was attached to a secondary school so I've kinda had a taste of the harsh realities of the teaching life and very well know what I'm signing up for.

I'm now facing a dilemma where I'm unsure if I should try to secure as many internships in the private sector till graduation to really ascertain whether teaching is what I want to do. I've also worked part-time in a tech startup during the first 2 years of uni (which is completely unrelated to my degree i know) so I kinda have a sensing of how life in the private sector feels like.

So, to those who have gone through the PGDE, I have a few questions!

1. Was teaching your first choice?
2. Did you end up regretting your decision?
3. How was the remuneration and pay-progression like?
4. Is the work-life balance as bad as they make it out to be?
5.

Without revealing too much, I applied for secondary but was only offered primary instead, and I took it. It is definitely waaaay harder to get into the sec/JC cohort now as compared to a few years back due to the closure of some schools and downsizing. I think my batch had only like 20 or less JC trainees? Either way, PGDE itself in NIE was a blast.\n\nTo answer all your other questions as a whole, I don't really regret my choices, but 3 years in and I can really feel my passion fizzling out. Other than the admin load and other factors,I can say that it's really hard to do any real teaching due to resistance from many parties. People always complain that teachers are only teaching for tests but all I can say is that's not what I want to do, but it's what I'm forced to. I still love my students and will do anything for them, but nowadays I think twice when considering whether to go the extra mile in teaching."", ""1. Yes, have been in service for more than 20 years\n\n2. No, it has given me many opportunities to grow myself and I look forward to working with students daily. Since you have a passion for teaching, I'm sure you will enjoy the journey.\n\n3. Reasonably compensated (starting pay around high $2K to mid $3K) with typical civil servant bonuses; promotion increment can typically vary around $200-$500 (depending on your performance and promotion rate); if you add in the perks like (almost) free training/further studies and Connect Plan, it is decent pay.\n\n4. Work-life balance depends very much on your own commitment; work assigned usually commensurate with your sub-grade; most schools strive to manage number and length of meetings so that teachers can focus on teaching and learning. Not an issue with most young/senior teachers. Life stages and family situations can demand attention at certain times so it really varies.\n\n5. Like other parts of holistic health, it really depends on how you manage your self-care in your career. Most of my colleagues who are open-minded and flexible in managing changes and challenges have no issues with mental health. Stuff like exercises, breathing exercises and hobbies help me."", ""Pay quite good, and it's an iron rice bowl.

Was teaching your first choice?\n\nFor most of my friends, yes. If they couldn’t get in the programme they would have went private tuition center. \n\n > 2. Did you end up regretting your decision?\n\nIt really depends on the school that you are assigned to. My friends are lucky in the sense that the schools they are assigned to have relatively good cultures (supportive colleagues, not much politics) but they have heard horror stories from their other friends. \n\nAlso be prepared that 90% of your time will be spent on admin stuff (planning lessons, meetings, ccas, marking) and only 10% on teaching. But my friends say the 10% makes up for the 90%.\n\n > 3. How was the remuneration and pay-progression like?\n\nStarting around 3.3k (plus minus depends on ur honours). You get paid while going through NIE too so that’s a bonus. Pay progression should be fairly standard like most civil service. \n\n > 4. Is the work-life balance as bad as they make it out to be?\n\nAgain this is dependent on your school but be prepared to burn time off work to plan for lessons and marking and other misc admin stuff. \n\n > 5. How has teaching affected your mental health over\n\nAgain, this is quite dependent on your school culture. Some schools have very toxic and political environments and it’s quite easy to become disillusioned and get burn out if you are in such schools. Also from what my friends say, people who had the wrong expectations from the start also tend to get burn out easier. \n\nSo I would say try to manage your expectations for this profession and pray that the school you are assigned to have good culture haha.', ""* One of my top few choices\n* No\n* High floor low ceiling, your starting pay is 3-3.5k, you gain another 400-500+ increment after finishing NIE and if you are a guy you should get a cohort promotion within 1year+ which will raise your salary to low-mid 4k+. After that your progression will be determined by your CEP/performance but don't expect any fast or easy increases, even scholars have to slog for their promotions. You won't starve for sure :)\n* Work-life balance depends on schools/individuals. You can have good work-life balance if you slack but you will be promoted slower. Also how welfare your school is depends a lot on the principal. Some principals like to have looooong meetings where they give loooong speeches and the KPs all take their cue from the principal and have their own looooong speeches and stories.\n* I am quite happy go lucky and consider myself pretty resilient but almost cracked a few times due to challenging classes and committee workload. Had to take a step back a few times and manage my own expectations to mentally balance myself."", 'Ill answer for my relative. \n1. yes\n2. no, yes. sometimes. But mostly due to politics, not because of teaching.\n3. expect the occasional raise every few years as you go up in rank. im sure you might find sth online about moe pay grades. Expect a bonus twice a year. I once calculated it, considering all the unpaid OT, you get the same as someone working at McDonalds. Dont do it for the money.\n4. See 3. You can of course not give a shit, come to teach, clock out, push responsibilities to colleagues and barely do any productive marking for your kids, but your colleagues wont like you.

The regret kicked in during practicum, when I was spending 12 hours in school everyday, followed by 4-5 hours of marking/ lessons prep into the night. The admin workload of a full-time teacher is hell. Teaching is fun but long meetings, compulsory CCA sessions (our school didn't let us rotate), committee work and admin work really took a toll on me. \n\n3. I quit after I finished my bond, so I don't have much information on this. Based on what I observe, teachers who spend wisely do get to live quite comfortably. Many of my colleagues live in condos.\n\n4. Depends on your school. I practically had no time for myself, but my sister in another school was doing fine. She is 4-5 years older than me but she reaches home earlier than me every single day.\n\n5. In general I don't think I'm a resilient person, so I'm surprised I even made it through my bond!

john_hanz,ncevgt,An absolutely crazy idea to reduce our reliance on cheap overseas labour,2021-05-15 02:02:43,singapore,378961,65,0,"Alright, this idea probably deserves to be blown to Reddit hell for how crazy it sounds, but hear me out.

The two COVID waves that Singapore experienced in 2020 and 2021, in my opinion, can be distilled down to one factor: our over reliance on cheap manual labour. Be it for construction, sanitation or whatever industry that normal Singaporeans shun, we have no choice but to rely on this group of people to keep the country running. It's as simple as that. **We have no choice.** The person who said that Singapore is built on the backs of migrant workers could not have said it more aptly. The moment we stop the flow of these migrant workers or implement a dormitory lockdown, you can hear the gears that keep Singapore going grinding to a halt. BTO delays, construction delays etc etc.

However, if there is one thing that COVID has proved, is that this is not a tenable long term strategy to keep Singapore going. There's no predicting what's the next crisis that may completely shut off our supply of cheap migrant workers. And to make it scarier, it might just not only the construction industry next time (ie nurses in healthcare or your rubbish collectors).

So the question is, how can Singapore as a small country with almost no human capital address this issue? Where can we find a pool of natives who are willing to shoulder the back-breaking work of building up our nation? Is there a ready group of people who are already earning peanuts but yet are put to grueling work day after day because it's their national obligation?

If you're on the same page as me, then yes, I'm referring to National Service.

But that's crazy! I hear you say. How can our Singaporean sons be expected to become a construction worker? 

My question to back to you is why not?

If it's because construction work is deemed as a lowly job only suited for the lowly skilled, then you need to check your privilege and your stereotypes. As the past year has demonstrated, we depend on our construction workers. Without them, Singapore comes to a standstill. There will be no HDBs, no roads, no MRTs, no national projects. If this is not national service then I don't know what it is.

If you're worried that this depletes the strength of our armed forces, then it is high time we conscript women too. I get it, it's an incredibly touchy subject. But in a country where every person counts, we cannot afford to ignore 50% of the population. For those of you who subscribe to the liberal thinking, this would be the ultimate celebration of gender equality. As for those of you who lean more to the conservative side, our healthcare workers rely strongly on foreign labour as well, which the NSwomen can contribute.

And if you're worried that the construction work is more dangerous and tougher than NS, then you need to reevaluate if that's a sound assessment. Because after all, how can we expect a civilian job to be worse off than being a soldier?

Nonetheless, to be fair, I don't think we can completely eliminate our reliance on cheap foreign labour using this method and there are tons of other considerations such as employment, but it would at least in theory reduce our reliance. It would decimate private construction companies, but given how important this is to our nation, wouldn't it be logical to reduce our total reliance on cheap foreign labour to build Singapore, and to start having a pool of locals who are able to take this up? 

It's no different than SFA's initiative to ensure that we have at least a certain percentage of locally produced food for food security. Maybe it's time we start looking at National Development security too.

Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.",0.37,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ncevgt/an_absolutely_crazy_idea_to_reduce_our_reliance/,"[""1. There are a ton of developed countries with damn high minimum wages that somehow can still build skyscrapers. If its possible for them to pay a proper wage for their construction workers, why not us too? Look at Western Europe and the US. How are they building homes that are so much more inefficient than ours but somehow still profitable and affordable? The bulk of our HDB costs is not labour, but land.\n2. It's not fair to the NSFs to build our homes for us. No matter how you cut it, some of these NSFs may not be able to afford or even want an HDB. They benefit from defence, police and SCDF. But they might not benefit from HDBs. It is damn unfair to literally point a gun to a person's head (which is what conscription is), and force them to build a house so that someone else can flip and make hundreds of thousands. So unless you're willing to give one free HDB unit to each NSF that ORDs, I'm not supportive of such an idea.\n3. The HDB unit is a **PRIVATE** profit. Yes its public housing, but profits and benefits are **PRIVATE**. Private individuals own the HDBs and if you profit from it, those profits are privatised to you. National security is a **public** benefit, no one can hoard it and no one can personally profit from it.\n4. The NSF is not like the foreign construction worker. The foreign worker willingly chose to come here, its a pay for labour contract. The NSF did not choose. You would literally be forcing someone to give YOU a private profit.\n5. So unless we totally revamp HDB, then it would be agreeable.

I respect that opinion, but again those are opinions and not facts. It's a common response around the world to paying fair wages to workers but very little of it actually materializes. Inflation adjusted wages in these low wage sectors across the developed world have pretty much stayed stagnant for the past 40 years, but cost of living has risen accordingly anyway, so the argument that wages push up prices isn't really true. That's just the narrative that capitalists and neoliberal governments conveniently paint. Neoliberalism has it benefits, but I think we have to recognise that paying fair wages to workers was never something it embraced.\n\nSo I don't believe there's much truth to the idea that BTO prices will triple or quadruple if we were to play 40 years of catch up in the wages of these sectors. Real estate prices have ballooned over the years, salaries of CEOs and executives have gone off the cliff, while productivity has pretty much stayed flat, so you'll likely see an outcome where BTO prices will remain roughly where they are with capital share of income falling and labour share rising.\n\nI'm advocating for this to be done across all low wage sectors but since this thread is specific to BTOs we'll limit the discussion to that."", ""TBH, you're still not going to get enough locals to be construction workers at $3000+ a month.

There is an age limit for constructions jobs, so the pay should be higher to compensate for the loss of employment opportunities later in life.

Numerous_Prune_72,muqzwf,[Uni] How fluff is SMU marketing for the school and any regrets joining?,2021-04-20 22:02:01,SGExams,77717,5,105,"Hello, I’m a prospective student and have trouble deciding whether I should accept offer from SMU business management or NTU business. Personally not going to consider NUS because I stay really far away and hall is not guaranteed which means it will be a struggle to juggle 5-7 CCA/ committees and academics. So basically NTU is my safety net with guaranteed 2 years hall and I just have to juggle a few commitments to secure hall + it’s also way cheaper than SMU.

What SMU has to offer seems really attractive in terms of interactive learning, double majors, internship opportunities and the global experience so I just wanted to find out how fluff the marketing really is so these are some questions I have:

How would you rate the quality of education? Not to offend SMU students but I heard many ppl say SMU kids are good at talking but don’t know how to do things so I don’t know how true that is... 

How would you rate the career guidance support? Does the school provide students with a list of quality companies or self-source is preferred? 

I’m quite keen on SMU X but haven’t really come across post about it, just wanted to know if that is a compulsory mod or do we have to sign up for it?

Recently I just visited the campus and found that the student facilities seems rather limited.. I notice many students choose to study in cafes and Funan mall and the library is also very pack. There is also lack of fans around outdoor study areas so can you share more of your thoughts on student welfare in SMU? 

Also I read about the school culture and I’m quite on the fence about it.. so can you share your overall experience in terms of people you work with, class participation, ratio of individual assignment to group projects? I understand that many people do module bidding in groups so do y’all work together on projects or are y’all split up by the professors? And how does that affect students alone in the mod? 

If you don’t mind can also share how much do you spend on average for your meals in SMU? 

Finally I would also love to hear your thoughts about how SMU change you as a person and do you have any regrets joining SMU? 

Sorry for asking so many questions!! Just wanted to ensure I make an informed decision as I want to ensure that I make my moneys worth choosing SMU. 

Thanks for helping out a desperate and indecisive prospective Y1!!",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/muqzwf/uni_how_fluff_is_smu_marketing_for_the_school_and/,"[""SMU student here, but I'm not from BBM so I will reframe from commenting on their Marketing major.\n\n>How would you rate the quality of education? Not to offend SMU students but I heard many ppl say SMU kids are good at talking but don’t know how to do things so I don’t know how true that is...\n\nBased on the group mates that I have worked with so far, this stereotype doesn't hold. If you're talking about free loaders in group projects, they exist in every uni, so it boils down to your luck.\n\n>How would you rate the career guidance support? Does the school provide students with a list of quality companies or self-source is preferred?\n\nThere is a dedicated Career Guidance office that provides students with internship and career guidance, such as resume writing, interview skills and so on. Look up Dato’ Kho Hui Meng Career Centre.\n\nThere is no 'preferred' way of choosing an internship — you can either apply via the school portal or self-source on external job portals. Either way, it still fulfils the internship criteria needed for graduation.\n\n>I’m quite keen on SMU X but haven’t really come across post about it, just wanted to know if that is a compulsory mod or do we have to sign up for it?\n\nSMU-X is not a module per se, rather it's a format of teaching where students work with external clients to solve real-world problems. SMU-X modules are generally more project intensive as students are expected to present and/or write a report of their findings at the end of the term.\n\nStudents are expected to bid for the bulk of the their modules, and SMU-X modules are no exception.\n\n>Recently I just visited the campus and found that the student facilities seems rather limited.. I notice many students choose to study in cafes and Funan mall and the library is also very pack. There is also lack of fans around outdoor study areas so can you share more of your thoughts on student welfare in SMU?\n\nThere are actually a lot more study spaces in each school which outsiders have no access to. Keep in mind that due to Covid-19 physical restrictions, there's limited occupancy in the libraries. Plus, this is peak exam season so naturally most of the common study spaces will be occupied. Otherwise, the libraries and common study spaces aren't that packed.\n\nAs SMU is a relatively new university compared to NUS and NTU, the facilities are generally better. SMU's Law Library opened about 2 years ago and the interior is gorgeous. Look up Kwa Geok Choo Law Library.\n\n>Also I read about the school culture and I’m quite on the fence about it.. so can you share your overall experience in terms of people you work with, class participation, ratio of individual assignment to group projects? I understand that many people do module bidding in groups so do y’all work together on projects or are y’all split up by the professors? And how does that affect students alone in the mod?\n\nThe short answer to this question is it depends. Depending on which faculty you're in, majority of your modules in the first year will be pre-assigned to you and cannot be swapped. This means that you may or may not be in the same class with your friends. After the first year, if you're fortunate enough to meet a group of friends in school that you can click with, naturally you'll want to bid for modules and work together.\n\nDifferent modules, and even different profs, has different assessment components. Some may emphasis more on class participation while some may not. In short, it depends.\n\n>If you don’t mind can also share how much do you spend on average for your meals in SMU?\n\nAbout $4-5 on average. One of the perks of SMU campus is that it's located in the city, which means you can easily travel to places like Plaza Sing, Orchard or Bugis to have lunch/dinner, if that's your thing.\n\nSchool food in SMU is generally meh lol.\n\n>Finally I would also love to hear your thoughts about how SMU change you as a person and do you have any regrets joining SMU?\n\nNo ragrets.\n\nHope this helps. Cheers."", 'Hi there, I’m an almost graduating SMU biz student, hopefully I can provide some answers for you! \n\nI don’t think I can really comment on whether SMU kids are just good at talking and don’t know how to do things because.. that’s pretty sweeping and can’t possibly describe all students. In general, there are going to be bad apples everywhere you go, as well as outstanding individuals. I believe that boils down to the individual. What the smu pedagogy does provide though is the element of interactive learning, which at least trains you or pushes you out of your comfort zone to speak. And speaking is the first step to getting you somewhere, right? (think job interviews) \n\nCareer guidance is pretty good! Each student is assigned a career coach, where you can book appointments with yours. and there’s also workshops that prepare students for job application/interviews/networking etc., at least for my batch, though I’ve heard about massive changes for the new batches so I’m not sure if it’s still the same.\n\n“List of quality companies” sounds very subjective. What is of quality company to you might not be to another person. E.g. person A fits the start up culture better, person B fits being in a traditional MNC better. that aside, no, the school doesn’t provide “a list of quality companies”, though there is a school internship/job-seeking portal called ontrac that students can browse. You are also free to self-source internships and get it approved by the career centre. \n\nSMU X is a category of mods where the group project involves working with a real-life client. Not that it really changes much but you do deal with external pressure from the client to perform and deliver, so that’s the difference. It’s not compulsory, and most of the time the SMU X mod is prof-dependent, meaning if you intend to bid for say FNCE392 and there are several profs teaching this mod (for which you can bid for prof/class time slots), most likely only one prof is teaching an SMU X class while the rest are not. \n\nIt is true that SMU isn’t very big, limited spaces, but all these years even if I don’t find a seat in the library I can still find seats along the corridors in the schools. Some seats along the corridors are within the air-conditioned areas anyway, so there isn’t much of a problem. other areas outside have fans/are windy so you should be good. \n\nThere have been good and bad for the people I’ve worked with. I would admit some projects I couldn’t really pull my weight, either because I’m bad at the subject or the others were being much more alpha, while others I had a bunch of teammates who weren’t pulling theirs and I really had to make it work. Really depends on who you’re with and the group dynamics. \n\nClass participation is something I’m not fantastic at, honestly. Till this day, I have to admit that I still get nervous thinking about whether I should speak in class, even when I have an answer in mind. I can’t say “you’ll get used to it”, I suspect I haven’t fully myself. People tend to imagine a war zone of raised hands in every smu class. it’s not like this for most cases. also class part is highly dependent on the nature of the mod, the students in the class, and how much (and what kind of) emphasis the prof places on class part. I’ve had a prof who just required students to “class part 4 times each class” and you’re expected to shut up after you’ve done that for the rest of the class. He also sends a name list of the no. of times each student class parted after every class. think about the class part culture that breeds - mostly useless answers and everyone snatching to answer from the start of the class. But that’s an extreme example. Most of the other profs don’t really do this. Some profs are encouraging and try to pick people who haven’t spoken, tell you there are no stupid questions etc. \n\nEvery mod in smu has a group project. You can’t escape it. I had a rare one mod in my entire smu journey where there was no group project. Honestly couldn’t believe it the entire sem. Ratio for individual to group projects depends on the mod. I would say on average about 50/50. \n\nAgain, whether you can form your own groups or the groups are pre-assigned by prof, depends on the prof/mod. If you bidded in alone, just hope and pray you get a good group lol. you should be finee, just make friends :) \n\nAverage probs about $5-7 range. Food in school isn’t fantastic. Koufu sucks. The rest are meh, you go tea party also need to spend $6. Best place is waterloo caifan cheap and good but I haven’t been back to school heard that closed down recently. There are definitely still other food choices around school (I like going to sunshine plaza for Thai food). It’s also easy to be like “hey let’s go funan/Raffles City/plaza sing” since it’s so near with your friends and end up spending $10 and up once in awhile. \n\nSince you mentioned wanting to find out “how fluff the SMU marketing is”, personally, I have some thoughts about that. Having been here for 4 years, I do think SMU is pretty good at marketing themselves. I had to find out the hard way the mismatch between the marketing of “how easy it is to do a double major” vs the reality of the bidding system in smu. I’m sure you’ve heard about bidding and that’s really a pain in the ass. I wanted to do a second major in another school (school of social sciences). Basically, you don’t get priority in early rounds for bidding even if you declare a second major in another school. Plus the shortage of profs for sosci is just pretty bad so that jacks up the prices of sosci mods. Imagine high demand, in late rounds, shortage of class slots, limited money. it’s just pretty darn impossible to do a second major in social sciences as a biz student.  That being said, if you don’t intend to do a second major in another school (esp sosci), it shouldn’t be much of a problem because biz mods are generally cheaper (high supply and priority bidding if you’re a biz student), and you should easily be able to double biz majors :) \n\nFeel free to dm if you have questions, I’ll try my best to answer!', '[deleted]', 'Thanks! Totally did not think about the level of difficulty getting mods in double major. If you don’t mind, can share which double major did you take?

1. what is the cohort size for eng & econs? 
2. will someone who dislike studying h2 physics be able to do well in engineering?

6. is engineering still a male-dominated industry? are females ‘looked down upon’?

7. will someone without econs background be disadvantaged? i heard that uni econs is more about math so will a good foundation in h2 math suffice?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/n93ue7/engineering_econs_ddp/,"[""Econ and Engineering DDP with FASS as home faculty also, just completed the program recently.\n\nAgree that the DDP combo and its usefulness depends on the actual engineering major and how you intend to use it for employment.\n\n1. In my experience, the cohort size is quite small in general as it is quite rare.\n2. Depends on the engineering major, some majors may need a better foundation in H2 physics and deal with more physics concepts.\n3. Workload is generally slightly higher per semester, looking at maybe \\~1 more module per semester. Gets more problematic in senior years, such as FYP and honours for FASS degree being 2 separate components to fulfil because most don't want to purse IHT, causing more modules to be taken on top of the original workload.\n4. Econs mostly lecture/tutorial for foundational mods, seminar for honours classes.  Engineering can expect mixture of lecture/tutorial, small lab classes and projects.\n5. Job prospect depends on the hard and soft skills I believe, but I believe if you have the passion to really pursue your interests, it will be a fulfilling career. Salary wise seems ok as well.\n6. Am a female and I think there are more males than females in general, but that does not disadvantage us in work. As long as you know your stuff well and can explain your train of thoughts logically and directly, I think gender isn't a problem and I've met so many female engineers who are great in what they do.\n7. No H2/H1 economics background may not be a bad thing as most of the concepts are related but not exactly the same in Uni, so there is a lot of understanding to do as well even though I did economics in JC. H2 math, statistics and those math concepts taught in uni will be of great help, but is not sufficient if you do not understand the economic principles and theories behind the mathematics.\n\nEdit: Would like to highlight the double honours thing in point 3 because you're from CHS and I'm not sure if a DDP in Engineering and Econ still requires a compulsory double honours. This is different from those whose DDP with Engineering as home faculty, because in my batch, they still have the option to complete with a single honours in the Engineering degree (and complete a BA in econs) and that shaves off some modules. So going into the DDP with home faculty in FASS meant that I didn't have the flexibility to complete less modules as I had to do the double honours."", ""I'm a senior taking Econs & Eng DDP. \n\nEngineering really differs significantly across different engineering majors, and whether it complements with econs is something you should consider carefully. \n\nMany upsides and downsides of taking this DDP combo, benefits which I have gained and efforts which I felt were wasted in the end. Things you have to question yourself about: how many years you want to study for, whether you want to go for SEP/NOC, if you want to do semester internships, if you don't mind studying for something that you would not use it for a career in the end.\n\nMany things that I have not thought of before uni, or even during Year 1 and 2, that I have come to realise after that.\n\nPM me if u wanna know more, probably can answer all of your questions.

Because I'm only in Y1 I've only taken the foundation modules that comes from both engin & science (physics). For our engin modules, it combines diff engin courses' foundation modules into just 1 or 2 so it's kind of like a 'crash course'. The breadth for our foundation modules open up options for specialisations in Y3/Y4. \nAnother thing that's special for ESP is that we have design projects (1 in Y2, 2 in Y3). I managed to take the Y2 design project in the previous semester despite being Y1 and the brief breakdown of that module is that the first half is learning about PID control system and applying it to a Zumo Robot, and the second half is on building a STM (designing and 3D printing parts + constructing the circuit)\n\n2. Socialising really depends on u! Due to the small class size, we generally see each other in most of our foundation modules and we would sometimes eat tgt after lessons. I would advise u go for ESP orientation so u could meet some ppl (u might not remember everyone from orientation but at least it's a start)\nFor meeting ppl outside of ESP, it would depend on whether u stay on campus, what IGs/CCAs u join, ur tutorial classes etc. I met a Y2 mech eng senior during a mech eng mod and also other ppl from RC4.\n\n3. For job prospects, I've asked that question a lot of times also. Some of our seniors who graduated went onto do research. I'd taken a career talk before and I was told ESP's employment rate is pretty high and graduated seniors go into different fields: semiconductors, energy, computing etc. It really depends on the specialisation u r going into.\n\nHope this answers ur question!

thank you so much :)",0.75,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/n9p6rj/uni_smu_ple_econs_double_degree/,"['Hi, I\'m a PLE student. I will say that your questions suggest the very typical academic-centric focus the average Singaporean has. In PLE, you will meet many capable individuals who may or may not want to focus on their academics. Everyone has different interests, tastes, and challenges, and the one thing that strikes me in PLE is the diversity of students that are in the programme. It is really up to you to charter your course while you are in uni, and for the rest of your life really. There are different trade-offs, different definitions of what it means to do ""well"", and ultimately, different definitions of what make you happy.\r  \n\r  \n1. How hard is it to do well in double degree programme? any seniors can tell me what their uni life is like? any heavy involvement in ccas or isit just studying all the time hahahah\n\nIt depends on your own capabilities really. If you have a strong inclination towards economics and mathematics, it won\'t be that much more difficult compared to the average PLE student who chooses more Econs mods. In Y1, you will find about 20-30% of your peers taking double degrees in PLE, or even more. But quite a fair bit will drop their second degree by the end of their second year. Many of my peers find it not worth the additional effort. That being said, quite a fair bit of the Econs mods will double-count towards your PLE degree as well. If you are generally capable, and have a strong inclination towards mathematics and economics, you should do okay. The only worry is that your core PLE mods might be difficult for you to manage, and you might need to spend some time on them. Needing to learn different fields is like learning in different languages, and that might take up a lot of your time. I suggest you look at the course outline on the website and PM me for specific modules you might be worried about.\n\nMost of the PLE students who are still doing double degrees at the end of Y2 are the top scorers of the cohort (GPA of 3.9 - 4.0 and above, which in SMU is an average of an A for every subject). \n\nYou can always take your double degree first, then drop your Econs degree later if you find it too difficult to manage. Plenty of my peers do that, and there\'s nothing wrong with it either\n\nWhat is Uni Life like?\n\nAgain, it really depends on you personally. There are students who just study and focus on the rat race. There are students who manage a business outside of school while pursuing their studies. There are students who work part-time to fund their education. There are students who spend every year in EXCO of a CCA or organisation. \n\nStudent life (not hall life; thats non-existant) in SMU is, imo, the richest out of most unis because of the nature of CCAs, workshops, internships, and opportunities out there (but if you want a rich sports CCA experience probably NUS would be better for you). There are many CCAs you can ""join"" that are low commitment ie show up if you want to (ie SMU E-sports, SMU Toastmasters, Animal Welfare). But there are also CCAs that require some form of minimal commitment to it (ie SMU Broadcast and Entertainment, Conjunct Consulting, Cognitare). \n\nThere are also constant welfare days, student events, and student competitions that occur every year. There is definitely something for everyone. Name an interest and there will almost always be an interest group for it. You can PM me if you want to talk about it more.\n\nBut its really up to you how you want to manage your life. This recent semester I didn\'t do any of my readings for all my classes after the third week because I felt I can maintain a decent GPA I am happy with, while just listening in class, and doing assignments. And I was tied down with work and volunteering commitments. I wanted to focus on other things. I was generally very invovled in CCA and student life until recently tbh.\n\nIt\'s really up to you how you want to manage your time. It\'s your life.\n\n\r  \n2. how competitive is it & & how hard is it to get highest honours? i heard getting highest honours is rly impt for future employability (correct me if im wrong please)\n\nAgain, it depends on how competitive you want to be. About a third of PLE is highly competitive that aims for an A for every subject. There are also students who want to focus on other areas of interest. There are students who just want to get by, because there are more important things in life than grades.\n\nGetting highest honours would help you secure an interview, but it is by far not the most important thing for employability. What matters most is how you can fit the job description. There is no point if I score A+ in all my classes, but the skills I gain from them have nothing to do with the job I\'m applying for. There are plenty of students who use their CCA experiences to gain employability in the job market as well. Conjunct members gain consulting skills, SMUBE members gain entertainment industry skills. If you know Royce Lee, he first started gaining prominence through SMUBE. Nothing to do with grades; everything to do with skills.\n\nGetting the highest honours would help but seriously if that is your only concern, and you don\'t bother to learn more about what skills you require, and if you don\'t have the propore soft skills required, you will not succeed. It might help you secure an interview and have a favorable impression, but you need to have substance as well.\n\nThat being said, SMU in general has better starting salaries than the other unis, so take from that what you will. \r  \n\r  \n3. for PLE itself, is the degree too general? i’m also quite hesitant since it’s quite new. any seniors can share some insights about the curriculum etc? is it well designed? any cons or loopholes? also curious if any seniors have any regrets joining ple\n\nIt depends what you mean by ""too general"". If you want to rely on your university education solely to gain technical skills from the subjects you study, then it is likely that PLE will be too general to your liking. It does not have the hard skills like engineering degrees, marketing majors, or computer science. So if that\'s what you want out of your university education, its probably a bad choice. I think it is rather good for acedemia if anything. But, you also have the option of doing more econs modules. Again, what matters more is the skills you gain from the individual classes/experieneces, not the label of the degree.\n\nHowever, if you want to learn how to think laterally, if you want to gain more insights into different fields and learn how they interact with each other, it is a good choice. I don\'t think the issue is about it being too general or narrow; it is about if you are the kind of person to whom this course value-adds to. \n\nMost students who take PLE do it not because they need to depend on it for their future career. Most students take PLE because they want to, because they think they would enjoy the experience and find some form of value-add in it. I\'m pretty sure most of them would have succeeded even if they chose another course instead of PLE. \n\nThis is just the course that is best fit for them in terms of interest. Of course you could always do a second major or second degree to complement.\n\nCurriculum was better than it was when it first started, but it can be quite challenging because you need to be able to manage learning from different fields, especially Law and Economics, if you want to do well. I think the curriculum is alright. Some of the newer, PLE-exclusive mods are a bit rough around the edges and have high expectations, but overall was a good experience. Feedback from every batch would help improve the quality too.\n\nYou honestly have a ton of freedom because all modules from 3 different schools are available. If you want to specialise more, sure. If you want to be general about it, sure. \n\n\r\n\nIn terms of regrets, I only know 2 people from my cohort who regrets going to PLE as a result of the curriculum. One of them wants to become a doctor and is likely going to pursue that after she finishes her degree. The other is a financial consultant (a legit one), and honestly she prefers her work to school. \n\nI\'m sure there are more, though, just that I don\'t know them well enough.', 'I will type a full response later as a PLE student. Will take awhile to type out all my answers', ""I graduated from SMU a few years ago with double degrees in Accounting/BBM, so it's definitely possible. Not familiar with PLE though, could you elaborate on what it is?"", ""4. what u like the most and what u dont like the most from the ple programme\n\n  \nI enjoy the company, and some of the subjects. I also enjoy the freedom of classes I can take. Class is almost always enjoyable. Its an enthusiastic learning environment, but it is demotivating for some who are not used to it. Hearing your coursemates ask questions or give insights that are unique, critical, and challenging in a consistent fashion can be demoralising (and can be taken as showing off).\n\n  \nI don't enjoy some of the restrictions of modules I can bid for. PLE students are not given priority for certain modules that are in SOE, SOL, or SOSS, but do not fall under PLE. So they might be a bit more expensive which affects bidding decisions. But you can always just bid for classes alone. And strategising for classes just becomes something you have to do if you want to take certain mods.\n\n  \nIf you are doing a double degree, though, you probably won't face this issue. This would be only for students who want to learn from different schools and have the mods to burn; double degree students do not have this opportunity because they have classes to finish.\r  \n\r  \n5. if i don’t want to work in govt sector, what other possible careers are there?\n\n  \nThere are a ton. PLE students generally just do their own thing, and are not constrained by their degree at all, because they use their experiences to fit the job description. I have peers doing marketing internships (because they want to; they have portfolios). Consulting firms are a rather popular option. From the larger consulting firms, to botique consulting firms, to more niche ones... Plenty of options. Macroeconomic consulting firms too... I have a friend doing an internship at ActiveSG as an Ops intern too. Bizdev interns... Research/Analyst positions are rather popular too imo. IB is another choice that you hear of. There's really a wide variety of options for you.\n\n  \nFor gov positions, there are also a wide variety of positions. There's a PLE student in my batch who got offered a cybersecurity internship recently at their international cyber policy desk, and they function more as a start-up than a traditional gov org. Would highly recommend checking them out if you're interested there btw, the people there are lovely.\n\n  \nThere are really a ton of options out there. For anyone, not just PLE students. Ontrac, the school's website, helps a lot.  \n\r\r  \n6. hows the alumni network  \nIt is pretty strong if you choose to tap on it. I have great seniors who always reply me if I need help, but I don't reach out to them that much.\r  \n\r  \n7. whats the culture among ple students like?\n\n  \nWell, it really depends on batch... Every batch is different. There are also people in every batch who would not like their batch's culture.\n\n  \nBut my group of friends in PLE are, imo, genuinely lovely people. Since its a small cohort and you share classes with most of them every semester once or twice, or even more since you'll be doing similar classes, you get to be familiar with most of the cohort.\n\n  \nIts nice to be able to recognise familiar faces. Its really easy to ask for help imo, because people are familiar with one another, even if we're not friends or anything. There are also people who share notes or important information with the rest of the cohort because we largely take the same classes.\n\nClass is always very vibrant with them around. I think thats what I appreciate the most about PLE classes or classes with PLE students: its seriously such a vibrant learning atmosphere that you dont get in other classes. Usually there will be 3-5 people in other class who speaks up on a regular basis. In PLE its more than 10-15. There are more people who are genuinely interested in learning than people who just want to do well for the mod. Which leads to more questions, and discussions outside of the class. Its really vibrant, and I enjoy this level of academic discourse I find very difficult to have outside of these classes. But again, it can be demoralising if you feel you arent keeping up\n  \nHonestly I am enjoying my experience. But I know people who are not enjoying it as well. \n\n  \nIt depends on the individual.\r  \n\r  \n8. what kind of qualities/strong traits i shd have as a ple & econs student?\n\n  \nRegardless of degree, aim to be kind, empathetic, understanding, and hardworking.\n\n  \nYou can always PM me for more information."", 'hiii thanks for replying! ple stands for politics, law & economics! \n\nmay i ask last time in smu were u active in ccas as well? thank youuu', 'I was active in my first two years, but not in sports ccas.

1. What is the difference in working hours between audit Big 4 and Mid tier firms? 

 I've friends working at both and heard that working hours at mid tier are much more manageable than Big 4, albeit having to OT during peak as well. Also heard that culture in mid tier is friendlier and people r more willing to teach/help?

jayeyeanne,mcuk36,Singapore Premier League Game Week 1-3: Winners and Losers,2021-03-25 17:51:51,singapore,378961,49,214,"Inspired by the Winners and Losers column on Football365, I have written the following piece covering the first 3 rounds of matches in the SPL. Trying this out to see the interest level, and if it garners enough interest, maybe start a subreddit for our local league.

**Winners:**

**Tampines Rovers** \- Trust in the process. The much touted mantra by Gavin Lee was put to the test this season as Jordan Webb bowed out of Singapore football to pave the way for Armin Bosnjak. Three games in, the Montenegrin has proven the process works as he slotted into the Tampines side seamlessly. After a rocky start conceding 2 goals against Lion City Sailors just 6 minutes into the 2021 season, the Stags have collected 7 points out of a possible 9, placing them behind Albirex only on goal difference, playing some fantastic possession based football. Could this finally be the year Tampines bucks the trend of foreign teams winning the title?

**Yasir Hanapi -** While all the media spotlight was on the new influx of Brazilians, the name that has shone the brightest so far has been Yasir Hanapi. 3 goals in 3 games, with one for the highlights reel against Tanjong Pagar in round 3. All these makes for an intriguing encounter against...

**Hougang United -** The Cheetahs. After a disappointing 2020 season, Hougang were not off to a good start, losing 3-1 against Albirex and threatening more of the same from the previous season. Clement Teoh and his team deserves full credit snagging Tomoyuki Doi, whose four goals in two big, statement wins against Geylang International and Lion City Sailors put the opening day loss into distant memory. Without distraction from regional competitions, Hougang may prove to be a dark horse this season.

**Albirex Niigata -** Year after year, the Swans rotating roster of players and coaching staff just keep maintaining the same standards of the predecessors. If the Tampines mantra is trusting the process, surely Albirex's is trusting the system. The Japanese feeder club's ability to churn out quality players year after year has to be something FAS needs to study, seeing that one of the national teams most pressing need is also to ensure a strong pipeline of footballing talent to draw from. 

**Young Lions -** Speaking of things FAS needs to look at, the Young Lions system continues to be controversial, but that's a whole can of worms for another day. At this juncture last season, Young Lions lost all three games, conceding 9 goals and scoring 1. This season, it reads played 3, drawn 2, lost 1. Creditable draws against Balestier and Geylang has showed that regardless of our gripes with the shortcomings of the project, this is a crop of players the fans can get behind. 

**Philippe Aw -** The maturity, composure and spirit Young Lions are showing thus far this season boils down to the philosophy of Philippe Aw. After stints as head coach for Home United and Hougang, this is another opportunity to bolster his reputation as a head coach, especially if Young Lions continue to play their hearts out and also throw in the odd giant killing feat. The Young Lions sinking the Lion City Sailors perhaps?

**Balestier Khalsa -** On paper, the opening day draw against Young Lions would have been cause for concern. The meek performance in the 2nd round loss against Tampines surely raised alarm bells and called for a rally to get the Tigers' season back on track. And rally they did. After the final whistle against Albirex, Balestier might have felt they dropped two points instead of earning one against the defending champions. Such was their performance, solid at the back and threatening going forward.

**Singapore's youth prospects** \- Granted, 30 minutes of game play may not be the most accurate indicator, but Martyn Mun's assured performance provides much hope. In the dying minutes of a game where Albirex were pressing on for a winner, his decisiveness in the 87th minutes snuffed out a dangerous cross, and in the 90th minute showed strength and composure collecting a high ball under pressure from two Albirex players. Him, along with Khairin Nadim whose unstoppable strike against Geylang made him the youngest scorer in SPL history to reach 5 goals, is proof that we do have young talent worth developing. 

**Impassioned game commentary -** Football broadcasting has come a long way, evolving into a full fledged experience complete with fancy camera angles and game analysis. The quality of match commentary plays a very big part delivering a quality experience to fans. Without any match atmosphere to speak of, it is highly commendable how SPL match commentators can keep up the enthusiasm and passion in their coverage. During the Albirex-Balestier game, an impassioned debate was sparked off after Albirex did their usual routine of switching out their Singaporean players at half-time, and it was lovely. Commentators of the SPL, keep up the great work!

**Losers:**

**Lion City Sailors and Aurelio Vidmar -** With the unprecedented amount of money spent on signing Diego Lopes, all eyes had been on the Sailors. Post-circuit breaker in 2020, LCS seemed to have found their feet, and the expectation was that with their new signings, LCS will just cake-walk their way to a first SPL title. 3 games-in, LCS has been underwhelming to say the least. If Aurelio Vidmar does not deliver the title this season, his position will surely be under threat.

**Hassan Sunny** \- There has been a myriad of goalkeeping errors this season, but none so glaring than those of the usually excellent Hassan Sunny. Against Hougang, he failed to deal with a corner, made a mess of a routine clearance, and saw a repeat of Yasir Hanapi's second goal on opening day. Uncharacteristic.

**Tanjong Pagar United** \- Supposedly more prepared for the season than they were last season when they assembled a squad at the last hour, this season looks like it might be another long and arduous one. The addition of Khairul Amri has yet to make any impact, and while the Jaguars will be hoping Ridhuan Mohammad returns from injury soon, depending on the 36 year-old to provide answers is quite a long shot. The wait for their first win since 2014 continues.

**Geylang International** \- With Barry Maguire out, and the verdict still out on Matheus Moresche, Geylang International will be hoping the Sylvano Comvalius thunderbolt against Young Lions will be a weekly occurance. The Eagles have been flat so far this season, and unless they kick into gear, the joy of returning to regional competition in the AFC Cup will be shortlived.

**Officiating standards** \- You could argue they get no help from VAR in the SPL, but some of the officiating has been comically poor. Case in point: In the first half between Geylang International and Tanjong Pagar United, a free kick was given (unfairly, in my opinion) against Tanjong Pagar just outside the penalty box. First, the ball was placed by the referee in the wrong spot. Second, after the Tanjong Pagar defensive wall refused to maintain a 10 yard distance from the ball, the referee took matters in his own hands and moved the ball backwards. Third, he seemed to realize that was a terrible idea, so he then immediately moved the ball forward again to the original spot. For a professional league aspiring to be one of the best in the region, this surely cannot be happening.

**Broadcast streaming quality** \- The choppy streaming quality of the opening clash of the titans between Tampines Rovers and Lion City Sailors dampened an otherwise entertaining game of football. And it was such a shame, that a great advertisement for the SPL was undone by technical shortcomings. Things improved from that game onwards, but audio or video issues periodically crop up. These niggling issues have to be ironed out to give the best chance for the league to succeed.",0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/mcuk36/singapore_premier_league_game_week_13_winners_and/,"['Fucking love the toplines bro.

Theoretically, you have a developmental team with exposure to the highest level of football in the country, and this crop of youngsters should rightfully form the core of the senior national team.\n\nIn practice, what I see is that the Young Lions system limits the development of players. I think it is important to bear in mind that football development depends not only on matches, but even more so on training. If these youngsters are training amongst themselves everyday, it shouldn't be surprising that come game day they will get a shock to their system playing against seasoned pros.  Let them train with seasoned pros so they are aware how far they are behind and what they need to do to get nearer to the pro level. Let them earn their game time at senior clubs. With the u23 ruling, there are much more opportunities for them to make appearances for senior clubs than ever before. \n\nSo I think the ideal situation for me is to disband Young Lions, and try to add 1 or 2 more senior clubs in the league to ensure we don't lose players from the disbandment."", 'They are a decent team with probably one of the most passionate fans in the league who show up at every game outside the stadium and chant 90 mins.', 'And yet here you are commenting... rofl', 'You can not click you know', ""great to hear they're free to watch!\n\nany teams in particular to look out for?

Maybe have a monthly thread for not just the SPL but also Sg clubs playing continental football too', 'Thanks for replying! That’s insightful \n\nMy thinking originally was that in theory Young Lions maximises the time that the core of the national team get to practice together, mitigating the issues a lot of other national teams have where their players are a smooshed together cast of stars.

It is not uncommon to hear of $800 to $1.2k starting pay.\n\nMid level pay can expect about $3k.\n\nBecause most ID firms are small Ah Beng operations, you will likely cap out at $4k or so. It depends. The big firms can and do pay more.\n\nIt really depends. This industry, the pay is all over the place.

They may or may not have a base salary. Usually those without any base pay will have a higher profit sharing percentage (40%-60%). And those with a base salary generally have a lower profit-sharing percentage (0%-40%).\n\nIt very much depends on the individual how much he/she earns. An average monthly figure is not useful here because a few top performing individuals can earn many multiples more than any of their colleagues and incomes fluctuate every month (because it is project-completion dependent.) Yes, some months can be zero.\n\nThere really isn\'t any ""entry, medium or senior"" levels to speak of (for these firms). A freshie will be offered a lower profit-sharing percentage only as a start.

So if the project value is $40,000, an ""ID"" on a 50-50% split will make $4,000 at the end of the project. However, the whole process can take about 2-3 months. Obviously the project values can be bigger/smaller, the process can be longer/shorter, and margins greater/smaller, every project is different. An ""ID"" can take on as many or as few projects as he/she wishes to handle.\n\nSo in summary, it depends on performance. In my observation, most people will not make it in this space.

+ Added information about appeals.

In the comment section, there is information (contributed by other users/me) about:

+ SMU + SUSS
+ Swapping classes
+ ABA + ABA personal statements
+ How people find friends in uni ....?

*START OF ORIGINAL POST*

 After scrolling for a few minutes on this subreddit and seeing the amount of Anxiety About Results posts, I have come to realize that the A results release are this friday! Which is Very Soon 😀👍. Honestly it made me feel like I had time travelled to 2020 feb since all the posts felt like i could have ghostwritten it a year ago 💀

 After recieving my results last year, I quickly realised that no one was there to spoonfeed me information of how to apply, which is completely understandable since we are all considered as adults at this stage. But that doesn't make it suck less or make it less confusing lololol 😿😿 So hence this post: a starting point to make this stage less confusing and hopefully less stressful for the next generation:


## **HOW TF DO I APPLY ❓❓**




First of all. There is NO JOINT PORTAL like JAE where you apply to all the six local universities.

**❗ You will have to apply to each university SEPARATELY.❗**

You can find the application forms on each of the university websites.

+ And these applications will cost money! 💸💸💸

If I can recall correctly, NTU + NUS both cost $10...? and SMU costs a little more ($15) i think? Anyways all the fees are considerbly less costly compared to UK/US universities so don't complain too much okay 💀

Each university allows you to rank the choice of majors you wish to apply for. This part is the same as JAE! But for NTU, do take note of the ""implied choice"", when ranking your choices. 

+ For NUS, there is additional points (2.5 last year) for first choice, for non medicine/law courses.

+ ALSO. In NUS, you are free to take on 2nd/double majors after matriculating but in NTU, you have to indicate it when you apply. ❗❗❗❗ *You cannot take up one after matriculation.*




There will be submission deadlines for each university. Please write it down so you don't forget 🙏🙏🙏🙏

There will be different application IDs for each uni too! Pls write it down also lolol its different for different unis too.

In addition to this, there will be many other things you will have to submit, such as criminal record declarations etc. But these usually will not have the same deadline as the application submission itself. Do take note of the deadlines pls.






## **HOW TF DO I KNOW WHAT TO APPLY FOR❓**




This is a tricky question! Ultimately no one can tell you what to apply for, but I would like to outline some considerations I don't usually hear people talk about:


##### 1. *For choosing between universities* for a major (ie: should I study psych in NTU or NUS???):



 Last year, I did some snooping around the university websites and have come to realise that although the majors are the same, the modules offered by the different univerities can be very different. 👀👀👀


 Go take a look at it on the websities to see if the mods offered by a university has specific content you are interested in! 


For example, for biological sciences in NTU, you can find it via

+ ACADEMICS>UNDERGRADUATE PROGRAMMES>NTU PROGRAMMES BY AREA OF INTEREST: SCIENCE: BIOLOGICAL SCIENCES> just click on any combination of major/minor you are interested in>CURRICULUM AND COURSE DESCRIPTION>AY2020 ,,, tada!!! all the mods you will ever have to take is listed here. All of the links should be hyperlinked so you can take a look at the descriptions of the mods. 

+ For psychology, it isnt hyperlinked, but the course codes are there. Just search up the course codes eg ""HP2200"" + ""NTU"" in google. The first link with a pdf should be it.


+ For NUS: go to the nusscience website: ADMISSIONS>UNDERGRADUATES>OUR PROGRAMMES>LIFE SCIENCES> scroll down: LIFE SCIENCE MAJOR REQUIRMENTS AY 2020 (this is the study plan), if you scroll further to LSM MODULES (these are the description of mods)

the information for different majors should be in about the same place so do just do the same thing for your own desired majors! 🤗🤗

##### 2. Interesting mOds /= you can take them if your mod allocating system is sh!t HAHA.
Take into account this pls💀💀💀







## **HOW TF DO I KNOW IF THEY HAVE ACCEPTED ME❓**




Firstly, there is also, **no mass release date of application results** like JAE. I heard there is a mass rejection date though....... 😀

From personal experience, how fast your application results is released depends on :

+ 1. How much better you are compared to the rest of the applicants. If you have 90 RP and you're applying to FASS (i know it doesn't exist anymore but just a example), you will most probably recieve a acceptance faster than someone with 80RP.

+ 2. How much earlier you submitted your application. No this doesn't give you an advantage but I heard those who apply faster will get a response earlier. Pls dont rush your application tho.....🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️

 Also! They don't just SMS or email you with ""grats ur in 😚😚😚✌✌✌🥳🥳🥳🥳"". 
They give you a vaguely threatening message of ""Your application status has been updated. Please check the portal."" . This can be either a rejection or a acceptance but into your 3rd choice or a acceptance in your 1st choice. You won't know unless you check!


edit: **FOR APPEALS**
> Although there is no uniformed result release (they release it in batches), there will be a day where they have finished releasing all the results for round 1. You can check this date on the websites!  **YOU CAN ONLY APPEAL AFTER THIS DATE**



## **HOW TF DOES UNIVERSITY WORK ❓❓**



Just going to go over this is very brief detail because seniors will clarify it for you in your respective camps! 

I will introduce enough to you so that you don't get lost while browsing subreddits or lurking around the university websites keke 🥴🥴🥴

##### 1.All unis have different way of assigning weightage to a course you will have to take. ⚖⚖⚖

**NTU uses ""Academic Units"" (AU), NUS uses ""Modular Credits"" (MC).** Also for lower levels (ie introductory mods to build on foundation for more intense, specific mods you will take on in your later years), NUS's default is 4MCs per module and NTU is default 3AUs. No idea why tbh..... 




edit!: *The amount of MCs/AUs you have to clear will vary between different majors, but will be fixed for a major.*

> For example, Biological Sciences has to clear 141 AUs for graduation. 

The breakdown of these AUs (Eg: Some will be AUs for courses directly related to your major, some AUs will allocated for ""General Education Requirements"" ((See point 3 below for more details)) ) can be found online too!  🌐🌐🌐

Following the above points where I explained how to find the mods you can take, for NTU, this can be found under ""PROGRAMME REQUIREMENTS"". For NUS, this is under ""STUDY PLAN""

These AUs will be split over your 3/4 years of study! Albeit a little unevenly for some.....🤡🤡🤡




This brings me to my next point!: *the workloads for each semester will be recommended but never fixed.* 

Each sem's workload will be different. Engineering has a average of like 24 AUs (hearsay) .... props to yall 😹🔫🔫 

If you want to ""overload"" you can apply to do so! If you fk up your mod and want to ""remod"", you can ""dabao"" a mod by providing MC for your final, and retake it next sem too.

(edit!: However, some mods are only offered in certain sems! Pls don't dabao and then realize you can't take it next sem ..... that would be pretty tragic ngl 😿😿😿)

You'll come to realize that university is very fluid and flexible!

 Hate your tutorial's TA? Hop over to another tutorial session! Hate your timetable because you have a obnoxiously long break? Swap classes with a peer to compact your classes!

(EDIT PLS DONT SKIP CLASS IF YOURE IN SMU!!!!! ❌❌❌ And if you are graded for class participation in NTU/NUS *cough* biz kids *cough*, it would be better if you formally change your tutorials😀😀)

##### 2. Default for uni is eleCtronIc *EVERYTHING.* 


You don't HAVE to buy a ipad but 70% of people I see on campus have one. 

*If you're in a science course you will probably have to take a programming mod somewhere in your 4 years.* 
So you will need a laptop! 💻💻💻




HENCE, PLEASE AT LEAST ATTEND YOUR FACULTY CAMP. OR AT LEAST BE FRIENDS WITH SOMEONE WHO WILL ATTEND IT.
Seniors will send the illegal textbooks and reading materials to you! Godbless yall ✌✌✌




+ edit!: Sometimes, you will still have to source for textbooks yourselves. There are posts about where you can obtain it online, but this is the website I used the most! And I haven't got any viruses yet so should be safe HAHA 🚫👾

[textbooks!](http://b-ok.asia)


##### 3. Just like in A levels, there are compulsory ""Contrasting Subjects"" you will have to take in university too.


 ie, If youre in a social science major, you will have to take a contrasting sciency mod or two. ⚗

Edit!: There will be preallocated AUs for these contrasting subjects! For example, I only have like 9 AUs worth of these :-)




For NUS, with the whole combined college, I have 0 idea how it will play out.... Also, different universities have different names for these as well! 

+ NTU's one are called *GERPEs* (General Education Requirements, Prescribed electives). These are divided into:
 BM (biz), ST(science + tech) and lastly LA (liberal arts). 

+ NUS one's are just called general requirements i think...... 


Then there are Unrestricted Electives (UEs) where you can take whatever the fuck u want HAHA. 



#### 4. CAMPS. 

The faculty ones are sent through email (for me) but for other camps (eg UOC) you have to sign up yourself/get selected for it.... ngl not really a camp-y person so idk, but someone who went pls say in the comments? 🥺


5. no more student price for mrt welcome to broke uni student club !!




❗❗THats IT FOR NOW! No idea if anyone will actually read this but i hope this helps someone out there bcause i was srsly fking lost last year LOL  <\333

***** 

edit:
> The information here is **NOT EXHAUSTIVE** .There are many more details like how to properly bid for mods etc that you can either find tips from the uni's website itself, in the university subreddits, or from seniors. This is just to provide you with a starting point so you don't get that lost or overwhlemed looking for information!!! Pls go do your own research too💫💫💫 


 I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE THIS TIME TO APOLOGIZE FOR THE LACK OF SMU/SUSS/SUTD/SIT INFORMATION. 

Edit: 
> For SMU kids, look out for curry chicken's comment!
> For SUSS kids, look out for starryangelin's comment!! 


I really don't know any one from there and am unable to provide more personal information about these schools. IF SOMEONE IN THE COMMENTS WOULD LIKE TO HELP IT WOULD BE VERY NICE! 🥺 But the points about applying and recieving application results should be universal across all SG unis.

anyways despite the title, yall are not dummies! Very proud of you guys for completing a major exam while doing elearning during a pandemic! 😼😼😼 Say real if i had to learn the krebs cycle online at home i would have stabbed my eye!  👁👄👁   ➡️    ❌👄👁

Once again, I would like to thank u for reading this, my thumbs hurt, and i am once again behind on my lab report......but i hope all of you do well for As, n get into the course you want!!! 💖💖💖💖

From there, you can see if you have been shortlisted, and if you are, you will have to go to the selection process. 3-4 weeks after the selection process, you will receive an email regarding the selection process result. If you\'re a kanchiong spider like me, the result will be reflected on the portal too. It will straight up tell you ""You have been accepted into the programme"", and vice versa.\n\n**SELECTION PROCESS**\n\nThe whole process lasts about 3 hours! The interview was held on Zoom for my batch, and there are**four parts** to the interview, namely:\n\n1. Cognitive Test (12 mins) There are basic questions in the test! They are really simple, such as ""identify the next number in the sequence"".\n2. Group discussion You will be given an article and a video which are related to your course. You are expected to research way beyond what is given!! The group discussion is held on Zoom, but don\'t worry!! IMO, its quite casual! To me, its like a chat where everyone says their point of view, not very serious! Not really sure how is it like for all of the courses!\n3. Essay I do not many tips to give here, as it depends on your essay question! But better to overprepare for a wide range of questions they may ask, than to be underprepared imo!\n4. 1-on-1 Interview Again, I am not sure about the other courses/people, but for mine, it was quite casual, as my interviewer was very warm and friendly!!!! Basically, they just want to find out more about you, your interests and hobbies, things like that!\n\n**General Tips**\n\n1. Stay calm! It\'s very normal to feel very nervous, but try your best to NOT PANIC, even when you make mistakes (which is normal to do so)! It is very normal to make mistakes here and there and stutter during the group and 1-on-1 interview, but try your best to not beat yourself over it!! Just stay calm, and move on!\n2. Adjust your body clock! As the interview is most likely held in the morning (as far as I know), it\'s better to adjust your body clock back to normal, to prevent fatigue and brain fog in the morning!\n3. HAVE FAITH IN YOURSELF!! You may feel that ""Oh, I totally flunked my interview/essay/etc, I have zero chance of getting in."" Trust me, I felt the same way too! I feel that I didn\'t do as well for the selection process in all areas! But I still got in! (And I am very grateful for this opportunity given )\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**How is life like in SUSS?**\n\nWe are also known as Singapore University of Self-Study. AND ITS TRUE.\n\n**Lectures and tutorials**\n\nIn SUSS, we do not have lectures and tutorials. Instead, we have seminars, which is like a lecture combined with a tutorial. We have a study guide (akin to a textbook of sorts), an actual E-Textbook, plus seminar slides (usually). Students are expected to take on the initiative to prepare for the seminars beforehand. Even though the professor will go through the seminar slides, they go through it \\* very fast\\*. Recommended to at least glance through it, and complete any pre-seminar activities (if any).\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**TImetable**\n\nIn one year, we have 2 semesters. For FT programmes:\n\nSemester 1: August to Nov, Semester 2: End Jan to May.\n\nEach semester is further split into 2 terms with each term lasting about 6 weeks.\n\nEach term we take different modules AKA: in term 1 takes modules A B C, and in term 2 modules D E F. As the modules are (usually) compressed into 6 weeks, it can be very rushed at times.\n\nOn average we have 3-4 lessons each week. If you\'re lucky (and can tahan), you can arrange all of your lessons to be in 1-2 days. I.e. Return to school only 1-2 days per week.\n\nEach seminar lasts for 3 hrs.   830am - 1130am, 12-3pm, 330-630pm, 7-10pm. Some modules, especially minor mods, are taken during the night.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n**Curriculum**\n\nSUSS calculates modules using Credit Units (CU). Each semester requires minimally 30 CUs, and you can choose to clock up to 35CU if your GPA is above 3.5.\n\nMost, if not all FT programmes are direct honours.\n\nThere are common modules taken by ALL SUSS students across all faculties, namely SCO modules and ETB.', 'u the mvp 👍', 'Hi! For those that are interested in coming to SMU, there will be 36 mods to take over the course of 4 years which means 9 mods per sem (not inclusive of exemptions, so what you take might be lesser). You can take 4 for one sem and 5 for next sem. You can also take 5 each sem so you have lesser to take when you are in Y3/4. Bidding is the tiring but at least you can bid for your mods and plan for your timetable. Those that bid well only have 2 days of school lolz. But this is not possible for Year 1 students as they have pre assigned mods. But you can bid for your own classes in year 2!! Btw do apply for Camps!! It’s a must!! As we do not have halls like NTU and NUS it is much more difficult to make friends so do join camps to make friends. Regarding classes, it is more difficult to skip for classes or swap classes with another friend HAHAHA.

Kelvinylt,j8j8ie,Will Universal Basic Income work in Singapore,2020-10-10 19:57:42,singapore,378961,43,33,"Recently came across a video byWall Street Journal on Universal Basic Income (UBI) program in Korea and find it interesting. 

Link: https://youtu.be/EbWv_1NbWyw

Such a program could really revitalise local small business. I mean there are pros and cons to such a program but in my opinion, this would help citizens and small business during such difficult time. 

Yes, the Government has issued cash relief but the system the Korean employ is much more effective in channeling funds to local small business. 

Thoughts?

Update
—————-
Seems like many aren’t in favour on UBI as some would argue that the money distributed to individuals would put a huge hole in the country’s reserves and also rampant spending. 

However, from the video, the Koreans have set some restrictions on how this money is spent. The money issue is into a card which can only be spent on local businesses in the neighbourhood. Individuals are not able to spend the money outside of their neighbourhood or at international chains.

imo, if implemented, there should be some restrictions on how and where the money can be spent, I.e local small business like hawkers Center, neighbourhood shops, polyclinics, public transport. All to assist citizens to relieve some financial stress on basic necessities.",0.73,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/j8j8ie/will_universal_basic_income_work_in_singapore/,"['if i had a dollar for every time someone discovers UBI for the first time and tries to start a discussion on r/singapore ...', ""I would hazard that while it might work for a larger country with a bigger domestic market, Singapore probably wouldn't fare too well with UBI due to its size and dependence on exports/imports for its economy. The fact of the matter is that Singapore has a really miniscule domestic market, and local (inward-facing) small businesses therefore form an extremely small segment of our economy - so a restricted UBI may not have the intended effect of effectively pumping back demand to pre-Covid levels to industries that need it (in fact, because there's only so much that your hawker can cook, increasing the demand through a UBI-like stimulus package would likely just result in inflation of the price of goods offered by local small businesses)."", ""You can debate all you want and all the professionals can weigh in with all their data and analysis but the fact is, the only way we'll ever know if it will work is if they actually implement it and observe how it plays out."", ""There are 3.47 million Singapore citizens in Singapore in 2018. \n\nEach citizen gets $1000. \n\nThat works out to 3.47 billion per month, which adds up to 41.64 billion. \n\nThe government spent 80.02 billion in total in 2018.\n\n36.4 billion was used in social expenditure. \n\nIt would be possible to cut down on social expenditure and give everyone a thousand bucks per month while increasing government expenditure by 5-10 billion. \n\nUBI is not impossible for the SG government. The reason why it is not implemented is simple. Singapore, like anyone who ever played a 4X/Simulation games before, loves micromanaging and optimizing the heck out of every cent. Rather than giving a cash handout, Singapore's size makes it possible to try to micromanage each payout (means-testing is the chimp-word for it) to those who need it the most. \n\nUBI makes more sense for larger countries without the bureaucratic muscle. America, for instance, with how antiquated the social-services are, benefits from UBI because it cuts out all the federal-state-municipality red tape that costs the taxpayer more money for no reason."", ""Personally it's not a bad idea but there are always pros and cons with any new experiments. I heard about one initiative in Canada some time back but not across any detailed findings or cost-benefit-analysis. Also, Singapore is very unique in terms of our economy and high dependancy on trade enabler. So, how to manage cashflow or money supply or inflation or sustainability are key. The side effects on workforce participation, family, children etc all need to be specific to country. For example, if we're to give 1000 to every adult,  it may cost 3Billion every year which is rather easy on our finances. But let's say this caused 500,000 to drop from workforce then the indirect impact would be disastrous. Some of us do not need that and what if the people spend that on other non-necessary goods or services? or in local terms, just go and buy another small condo :)"", ""Pipe dream.  The government will never allow UBI to happen.\n\nYou will continue to slog and be productive for this country in return for suppressed wages, just as your parents and ancestors have done so in the past. \n\nYou will continue to slog and if and when you do finally retire you'll still not be able to redeem your hard-earned retirement funds in full.\n\nYou will continue to live under a government that predominantly favours the welfare of big business and the holy GDP rather than the dispensable individual, who must continue to work to make ends meet and keep the economic machinery of the country well-oiled.\n\nThere is and will be no free lunch in Singapore."", ""UBI will work, it doesn't have to be $1000, it can start at $500 and see how it goes, if it works (which it will), can gradually increase to $1000.

Today, I will be sharing my opinions about whether exam results really really matter. 

I personally feel like they only really matter to you if you 

1. Only have this in your life (no other skills like graphic design, music)
2. Do not have a good portfolio that can showcase your talents. 

I was devastated when I received my A level results. Having worked very hard, I attained 77.5rp instead of an expected score of more than 85rp. Context, my prelim and promo results have been ok and I even got an offer from the school to take H3 Math and History. \[Disclaimer: I am not saying that 77.5rp is a bad rp, it was just pretty disappointing for me\]

My family background has not been very supportive. Although I have two parents, I would say that I interact only with one while the other has been very nasty to me (e.g. direct economic threats to me since young, abuse). This has never thrown me off and has spurred me to prove him wrong and work harder for the future. 

I worked while I was in JC, teaching music during my free time and aggressively invested in my job (e.g. advertising costs). I admired my friends that could use that time to study and had no worries about the cost of living in the future. They had parents to fetch them home after a long day of classes, while I would rush to different households to teach music.

I admit that I am not the most qualified person to teach music - like I do not have a bachelor's degree in music. I was just a JC student trying to hustle. I was really happy when I received the news, one day after the release of A level results, that one of my students scored Distinction in his ABRSM exam.

Now, I feel like I have attained success beyond my peers. I have a group of more than 10 students and secured a side income of nearly, or more than 2k. I am inspiring the future generation of students to take learning seriously, and I am instilling them with good values that would be useful for them in the future.  I am contributing positively to society and I am semi-ready for the next stage of life.

So if you feel so devastated by your A level results, ask yourself if you should really feel so. Now, I feel that my achievements may speak more than someone who is lazy, unmotivated but still has a higher RP than me.

All the best to everyone out there. :)

broskiunited,ltopq4,[JC][Uni] Just how important are A levels and what if you screw them up?,2021-02-27 22:01:08,SGExams,77717,73,474,"## Disclaimer

Hello, how are you doing? Before I dive deep into today's post - I would like to clarify that this post is not for everyone. Some might consider this post to be ""toxic"" in nature or overly encouraging a lifestyle that results in burnout or an impact on mental health.

I acknowledge that people will disagree - this is wholly my personal opinion.

&#x200B;

## What are A levels and why I'm writing this

For most people, the A levels signify a graduation of sorts - when we Singaporean kids leave the formalised education system of Singapore and have a real choice in what we want to do and study. To me, it is a huge turning point and represents how I'm no longer a child. Lastly, some claim that it is an objective measure of intelligence - I will not comment on that. All I will say is that you can either choose to play a game or not at all. If you do, you have to follow the rules, however stupid the rules are.

Today's post focuses on a narrative that I feel might be overly extremely. An increasing number of people are claiming that A levels are not important, from them saying things like

* ""After Y1 uni, no one asks about my A levels.""
* ""I'm applying for jobs and they only care about my GPA.""
* ""Look at me! I fucked up A levels but still started my own business and pull a million yearly.""

Unfortunately, I think this is a rather myopic perspective and would like to offer an alternative view - A levels have a huge compounding effect and dictate your starting point.

I will be covering the following

* The impact of A's, both tangible and intangible
* GG if you messed up your A's?
* Considerations

&#x200B;

### What are the tangible effects of A levels?

**Decides what university you go to**  
Immediately, A levels will affect if you can enter a public or private university, or even an Ivy League! Beyond that, your rank points will also determine your ability to select a major. This rolls into the following:

* Will you enjoy your next 3-4 years?  
   * Depending on how limited you are in your major selection and how strongly you feel about specific domains, this would affect whether you get to study what you want. (That being said, what I wanted to study in University has changed many times)
* Estimated mean pay after graduation  
   * Yes, money is not everything - but having no money is everything. Unfortunately, different majors can have widely different payment averages, so make of that what you will. \[Do note that studying something for the $ is an entire can of worms by itself. I might cover it in a future article, but that can remains closed for now.\]

**Decides if you obtain a scholarship**  
Now I wish someone told me sooner, but a scholarship is fucking huge. Let's use a more basic scholarship as a benchmark - a faculty one. There's no upfront cash, no housing benefits or whatsoever. All this scholarship does is to cover your tuition fees. Using [NUS as an example](https://www.nus.edu.sg/registrar/docs/info/administrative-policies-procedures/ugtuitioncurrent.pdf), the approximate value of the scholarship is $40,000.

Now, I know it sounds a little abstract - let's try to contextualise this number.

1. Assume a monthly salary of $3800
2. Assume expenses (food, travel + family = $1800)
3. Net savings = $2000.
4. Savings after 12 months = 24,000.

For someone drawing 3,800 (which is arguably pretty good already, looking at you FASS), **one needs to work full-time for 2 years** to hit $40k.  
Basically, getting a scholarship and saving the cost is equivalent to having worked full-time for two years.

**How fucking insane is that?**

### The intangible effects of A levels

**The type of people you interact with**  
Your university and major determines the type of people you interact with, the level of competition and overall culture. Naturally, a more competitive course implies more competitive and driven people. \[Note: too much competition can be toxic. Again, a can of worms we will not open for now\]

Beyond competition, this also impacts your network and connections. ""Your network is your net worth"" —> Now, this isn't very evident in school, as all of your results is entirely by your own hands (hard work), but network becomes increasingly important.

Your ""value system"". Now, this is a little more abstract and overlaps with the two things above - but warrants a mention.

* What ""kind"" of person do you want to be, and what do you want to do? Would being surrounded by like-minded people help? What about people that are better than you at doing it whom you can learn from?

**Compounding**  
“Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. He who understands it, earns it; he who doesn't, pays it.” Beyond investments, compounding happens in real life.

Let us use a straightforward example.

* We have Ah Seng and Ah Peng. They were both in the same primary school and had their PSLE differ by 30 points. Ah Seng went to Raffles, while Ah Peng went to a neighbourhood school.
* Ah Seng had a lot of fun, but also tons of opportunities. He learnt a little about research, got involved in events and MUNs and met some alumni (who were in careers he was keen on). Ah Seng entered university with a scholarship and already knew plenty of seniors, joined the right CCAs and had hand-me-down notes from seniors. This culminated in a great job with great prospects.
* Ah Peng also had fun, but the lack of opportunities meant he grew a little lesser. Less outspoken, less confident and less experience. He moved on to a mid-tier JC, did okay and went to Uni, without a scholarship. He grew as a person and ultimately did okay for himself, but nothing spectacular.

You see, the only difference was 30 points at PSLE, and even though ""After <insert some event>, no one is asking me about <PSLE/O's/A's>, the impact **compounds.**

\---------

### Broski! Why are you tell me this now? It's too late, I only did okay for my A's. Does this mean I'm fucked?

Well, yes and no.

Yes because

* Your starting point is far behind. Some might claim the ""gap"" is unsurmountable. There's no way you can work hard and smart enough to catch up.

Well, fuck off. What I will say is that if that one line was enough to demoralise you, you have to reconsider your mental fortitude.

**No, you ain't fucked.**

* Midterm scholarships.  
   * Think of it as a second chance. You need to grind like a little bitch for 1/2 years, and you could potentially access 40k.
* Change course in uni / Change uni  
   * Not happy with our major? Not as good prospects? Then even more reason to do well and show you're a hard and smart worker so that you can change to a more popular course.
* Hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard  
   * Ok, sadly (or not), a lot of talented people in Singapore also work fucking hard from the start. You have to outwork them (be it harder or smarter) somehow.

Bottomline is, if you fucked up your A levels, it's not the end. It's just a massive uphill battle.

&#x200B;

### Ultimately, it's up to you

I said it above, I'll say it again.

* **How do you want to play this game called life?**  
   * Grind like a fucking dog to pull 5 figures upon graduation?
   * Chill and rely on parents to take it easy?
   * Chill and lead a simple life and enjoy the process?
   * Something in between?

There's no right answer, and I don't expect anyone < 20 years of age to be able to answer it. I just wished someone told me that this question existed in the first place and to start **taking** **steps** to answer this question.

For me personally, I hate the system but want to beat it and change it from within. Hence, I'm focused on myself and working hard until I have the ability to start to make changes. Even things like writing this is an attempt to help people, to help the underdogs and make a difference.

&#x200B;

### You're in primary/secondary/JC right now?

* If you're still young - good! I hope this post manages to serve as motivation for you to work hard. The fact of life is that there are limited resources in life.
* Do not let things like being in a neighbourhood school or ""a lesser"" family get you down.
* Do everything you can to claw your way up.

### Already in Uni/just completed A's?

* Well... it's gonna be an uphill battle, but never the end. Just be conscious of the fact that you need to **work a hell lot harder** to catch up.

PS. I just want to emphasize for the last time - there is NOTHING WRONG AT ALL to be Ah Pheng. What hurts me the most is seeing people being Ah Pheng when they don't want to.",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ltopq4/jcuni_just_how_important_are_a_levels_and_what_if/,"[""ngl, this post makes me hella stressed out about my life in general but well, I guess it's typical life in Singapore that I soon have to adapt to...  BUT THANK YOU, thank you for this reality check not to me, but im pretty sure, to many many people, no matter how well or how badly they're doing at this particular stage in life!"", ""rlly gotta comment but this hits home so much. like seriously the education system rlly just focuses so much on grades and this mindset that 'you got to go to the best school and get the best grades and you can do well in life'. sadly thats singapore and it is seriously an uphill battle like what the person who posted this mentioned.\n\nthis uphill battle is seriously unfair honestly and it starts from 12 years old, when all of us were mere kids. this idea of going to the best sec school cause theres ip and all and they have better opportunities than neighbourhood schools is rlly unfair. unfortunately, thats the way the system works and we have to play by the rules. tbvh even though im in a quite good jc rn, yea i still feel the hit from the past because i see my ip friends having way better portfolios than me cause they had the time to go for competitions and all that while i didnt cause i was busy studying for o levels and yea my sec school didnt know about any competitions and sent students for it LOL\n\nyea lifes unfair but rlly just to beat the system we rlly have to play by the rules, no matter how suffocating, no matter what it costs unfortunately"", ""I always love it when people talk about what is effectively the Matthew Effect, which is essentially compounding over generations, not just your lifetime. \n\nEssentially the world of meritocracy is set up such that the rich becomes richer, the poor poorer. Meritocracy is set up such that being born from a good family, having good genes good talent etc almost shape your entire life. Its seeming savior or the titular equalizer is hard work, which ultimately is correlated to stuff over which one has almost no control (being first born is correlated to having good work ethic). Meritocracy is such that those who succeed gloat and think it is their own doing, but in fact it is really beyond anyone's control. The distribution of wealth can be reset, just kill everyone, but can the distribution of natural talent be reset?\n\nWe often overestimate the effect of personal agency. Go read about the ovarian lottery. You are more a product of your environment and genes than about yourself. In fact Michael Sandel goes as far to say that we have close to 0 effect on our achievements. That in place, it makes sense that the people you mix with affect your outlook. In theory that's the case. Empirically, I have seen both low and high achieving dudes in Cambridge. The difference in their circle of friends is pretty apparent. I spoke with multiple (50+) people in the industry, those who most consider very very successful (look, multi million annual income), and the common point is that they mostly felt that it's all about their circumstances and they people whom they mix with that made them who they were. My observation is that, the more successful the person, the more they attribute their success to luck. And luck is a function of exposure, exposure to what? To people and ideas who affect your outlook. Yeah correlation isn't causation. But take what you want from those stories. \n\nIt is certainly more difficult to prove yourself later in life. This is ultimately more true in SG than elsewhere. Look, how and when are PSC scholars chosen? PSC scholars who made it to General level who know nothing about public transport are given the role of ceo in smrt. Yeah at 18 years old. How do you become a high flying SAFOS scholar over the age of 18? No you cannot lol. Elsewhere the effect is smaller yes. But ultimately not negligible. Have a look at how many papers argue that criminalism is correlated to parent's predisposition. \n\nHis point about psle isn't without merit. Heard of the term输在起跑线上？Good PSLE means better chance of good secondary, which means better odds of being exposed to the best etc. It's a game of odds. A little better odds here, a little there, adds up significantly. Yes nobody asks you about PSLE when you work, but then again doesn't ASTAR asks you when you apply for their scholarship? Point here is having a better starting point sets you up for a better next step. Better being the operative word. Point of note, if you go search profiles of high ranking individuals who work for decades, their profiles still mention their alma mater. How does it matter? It doesn't, but the compounding of having a good school transfers to having a good first job, having better exposure etc. \n\nIt's about the ovarian lottery. The right country, the right zip code, the right environment/mien/exposure, the right work ethic (affected by genes anyways), the right talent (yes it's genes again), and being in a society that values those traits (would yaoming have earned as much as he have if he lived during wartime? Would chinese actors have earned as much as they did if they acted in the US? Would you as a straight A student have been valued during wartime/prehistoric times?)\n\nI'm from a poor family, in the bottom 5% of the country. Yes it has shaped me, and any success/failure I have can be traced back to my mien and upbringing. Here I think the actual real equalizer (disregard hard work. Hard work is hardly equalizing. If it were, the short and skinny construction worker who exerts more to carry a load than the muscular man should have been valued more) would be luck. Yes lol luck. Go figure. Luck is a function is exposure, and people who expose themselves more are luckier just by probability. Yeah luck is still a function of hard work, but can be less so. It is a mindset (which again is a function of mien and network). \n\nIt's about applying yourself in the smart way. I have spoken to a number of high ranking dudes and their number one complaint to me about Singaporean students is that they are boring, awkward, don't take initiative to network, and utilitarian. In this sense, and given the effect of luck(since luck's effect is totally random), it seems like an excellent factor that the underprivileged can exploit to get ahead.\n\nFun stuff. Random thoughts. Happy to discuss.\n\nPS.

Agree with a lot of what u said esp on the compounding effect. I kinda hate it when people sugarcoat and say ""oh grades don\'t define you"" esp when do they this just to motivate students before getting their results. Bec its like saying grades serve no purpose. Ofc I am not saying grades are everything and its the sole determiner of your worth. Ofc it isn\'t. But it definitely defines your life and u as a person to some extent whether u like it or not. Why? Like what OP said whatever results u get definitely determines ur immeduate future(eg. What sch u can go to, what course/subjects u can take,whether ur gonna retake) and maybe even ur eventual future bec of the compounding effect it has. It also defines u as a person to some extent too as what grades u get for ur individual subjects shows ur aptitude in them which maybe needed esp for Uni courses that are very technical in nature(engineering/med/computing...) I also agree with OP on how ur results for the national exams can affect u through the compounding effect. For eg, if u did poorly for Os and went to a low tier JC, statistically ur chances of doing well in As is lower than those who did well in their Os. Not to say that u can\'t improve or that if u did well in Os, u will do well in As. Ofc those who did not do as well can work hard/smart and do well in the next national exam and there are stories of these cases(have friends who have went through this myself) but this is rather rare. My point is for those who did not do as well ur chances of doing well in the next national exam is lower but u can still fight and ""work a hell lot harder"" like OP said to get to where u want to be. So like OP said the national exams are important to a certain extent and the last thing u want is to not be able to go to ur desired sch/course bec u didn\'t do well enough for it.', ""I think for any exam (including A levels), grades are only important if you do really well or if you do really badly. if you do really well then as you mentioned you will enjoy the compounding effects, and every last 0.5 RP will matter because you're competing on a whole different level. similarly if you do really badly every last 0.5 RP also matters because it can be the difference between you having to retake or try a different route which will put you behind your peers. but if you're in the 70% of JC grads that can more or less comfortably manage to get a place in a local university doing a course you're okay with then no point stressing yourself out so much over that additional 0.5 RP. \n\n>Ultimately, it's up to you **How do you want to play this game called life?**\n\nagree with this sentiment. how much grades matter will depend on how badly you want to be in that first group. if you're okay with being average or are interested in other things, don't let people tell you that grades are the be all and end all."", 'Man you spitting the facts.

The ones who are devoured are the ones who are forgotten about, having to do sth they don't like or low pay(basically those who don't get a choice in where they want to go in life).

egghead678,mm2sno,polyclinic referral to IMH?,2021-04-07 22:03:34,askSingapore,44675,20,12,"so i’ve been giving this a lot of thought for quite some time now. i want to get a polyclinic referral to IMH, for therapy and meds. but i’m not 100% how it goes?

bit of bg story: been sh-ing for 5 years now, suspected depression (was never diagnosed), no major traumatic events happened in my life so i don’t exactly have one root cause to all of this, just some events here and there that built up over the years i guess. i have trouble sleeping, when i do sleep i occasionally get nightmares that cause me to wake up sweating slightly. i either sleep too much/too little, but either way i still feel tired throughout the day. i feel like i’m worthless and don’t really think it matters if i’m alive or not. i have poor appetite. i’m “fine” through the day, but at night or anytime i’m alone, sometimes i just break down for no reason and i think about how meaningless my life is and everything hurts and i get the urge to sh bc the physical pain takes away the emotional pain sort of thing? i have no motivation to do anything. i feel that nothing makes me happy, if anything, only distracted. and then over time it builds up and i break down all at once randomly. have had multiple serious suicidal thoughts through the years 

the reason i haven’t gotten any help all these years is because 
1. as mentioned i don’t have any major traumatic events that happened, so i keep thinking maybe my case isn’t big enough to be worthy of help? like if i go for therapy i don’t have specific root causes to give them? or maybe i’m just over complicating my situation when it’s really not that bad? 
2. i can’t let my parents know, we don’t have a terrible rs but they have strong stigma against mental health and it’s just really not a good idea. therefore i didn’t know how to afford it or do it under the radar. but now i think i have sufficient money of my own and i’m old enough (above 18) to afford to go through the subsidised imh route, so i’m really considering going for it but i’m not sure. 

so if anyone can tell me how the process is like and the fees of everything (including meds) please do :) 
and if you could let me know if you think my case is you know, big enough? to be worthy(?) of getting help

Normally they will ask you to come back after you finish your course of medicine.\n\nAs for the psychologist, you cant choose your psychologist, but I had a really good one, who helped me through just about everything, I remember as a subsidised patient it was 50 dollars per hour session. I am very grateful for her :)"", ""I first asked for a referral to IMH because I'm on some psych meds prescribe from my psychiatrist when I was overseas. So they gave a referral to see IMH psychiatrist. \n\nSo it really depends on which polyclinic u go to. For example, if you go to geylang polyclinic, they might refer you to Geylang community wellness clinic. However, if you go to another polyclinic somewhere in the central like toa payoh polyclinic, you will probably be referred to IMH directly. It kinda depends on proximity to the nearest psych clinic and how big the psych department is. It gets kinda confusing but imh has the largest cluster of psychiatrists and psychosis which is why most polyclinics refer patients to IMH\n\nOverall, I would say that you don't have to be afraid of IMH and the stigma. It's mostly because of stigma that people are afraid of IMH."", 'I think you should ask the polyclinic what are their options for referrals.', 'thanks! i’ve put in my contact details for CHAT already and i’ll see how it goes from here.', 'All the best.

They work insane hours, but will chase you out of the workplace at 5.30pm sharp hahaha (but there will be the occasional OT depending on your engagement)\n\nThe thing about audit is that it\'s engagement-based, so you don\'t have a direct supervisor to work under, instead you support your engagement seniors. We still get assigned under a manager - sometimes they are called ""mentors""/""coaches"" depending on firm - but relationship-wise we\'re not really close - but they\'re the ones that will be doing the overall performance evaluation for you at the end fo the internship. What they do is they\'ll collate information on on your performance from the various seniors that you\'ve worked under.\n\nDay-to-day work varies, vast majority of the time is spent on workpapers (vouching/analytical testing/stat reviews).
