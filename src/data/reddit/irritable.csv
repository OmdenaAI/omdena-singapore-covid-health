0,SGExams,53344,"[O levels] “Withdrawal symptoms"" after finishing most papers",jkcxvo,NotFromYouTube,1603987853,17,1,"Many of you may have heard of withdrawal symptoms after one has stopped drinking alcohol, stopped doing drugs or smoking. 

I now have 1 week until my paper 1 for physics and chemistry and I have decided to pick up my PS4 after 3 months. The feeling I got when I turned on my console was the same feeling of looking at homework as a primary school kid. I stopped playing after like 5 minutes due to my brain going into overdrive telling me to stop and study and my entire body feeling itchy and I also felt very irritable. 

Holding the controller in my hand is the most unnatural and disgusting feeling I ever felt even though I fucking love video games. Why I labeled this as “withdrawal symptoms"" is due the similar symptoms. This is the first time I have stopped studying in almost 2 and a half months and I study almost 5 hours a day. Today was the first time I stopped in a while and felt this. To really test if this was something like a withdrawal, I went to my room and did some MCQ papers and 4 hours flew by. I did not feel any dread or boredom while doing the papers, hell I even felt happy and energetic.

Did o level really fuck up my brain to the point I hate the things I love and love the things I hate? Or is this just a one time thing? To give you context I used to study 5 hrs a day before my CT or Exams but only like 2 days before. O level was the exception. I am also able to play games 5 hrs a day. I don't really have a in-between and although this may make me seem like some top school student flexing, no I'm not. I go to a normal neighborhood school and get slightly above average grades all the time. What have I become, I became the very thing I sworn to destroy. Can any seniors tell me if this ever happened?

TLDR: Played PS4 after 3 months of studying for o levels and felt absolutely terrible while playing and stopped and went to study even though I love video games and hate studying",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jkcxvo/o_levels_withdrawal_symptoms_after_finishing_most/,1.0,['same here :”) except i only stopped 1-2weeks before but still felt weird to suddenly stop for a while']
1,SGExams,38754,[RANT] How do I deal with parents who are not understanding??,h9jmxc,imtired9447,1592238597,19,3,"I’ve been feeling quite depressed for a while, ever since I got rejected by all the unis I applied to. I have a borderline gpa with a slightly decent portfolio so I was quite shocked that I wasn’t accepted into any uni at all, even if I met the cutoff for last year. However, I tried to pick myself up and tell myself that the competition is just more intense this year and I should take a gap year to improve on my portfolio so that I can try again next year.

The problem is, my parents have never been understanding towards my issues. When they heard about my situation, the first thing they said was about how I never put in effort into anything and my shitty results is probably why I cant get a placement. They have never been through tertiary education so they don’t know what is GPA and how the admissions requirements are like. So when they found out that I wasn’t able to get into any local uni, they immediately thought it was because I did not do well for my exams and basically started pointing out all the faults they could find in me and making me feel even more shitty than I already do. I don’t even know how to begin to explain to them how competitive it is this year due to multiple factors and admissions aren’t based on just grades alone. They also kept pushing me to find a full time job, which I’m already trying to do although I am having difficulty finding one when most companies suspended their hiring processes. The thing is, I’m actually already working multiple part time jobs related to the degree I was interested in. They’re aware I’m currently working part time. And yet they still continue pushing me to find a full time job for what? So i can be even more stressed by juggling full time and multiple part time jobs at the same time? I told them its hard to find a job outside now and their response is just basically saying that I’m not trying hard enough.

I don’t dare to hope for them to be understanding towards my issues but I just want them to leave me alone. I’m already depressed enough because I felt inadequate for not being able to get into local u. And after what my parents said to me, I feel even more worthless as a person. I don’t take allowance from them and they don’t pay for my education fees either. So I don’t understand what gives them the right to be so controlling over me when I’m already an adult and they’ve never been through the same education pathway as I did so they have no right to say I don’t work hard enough just because I don’t show them that Im trying my best. To be honest, I’ve been thinking of cutting ties with them in the future because I can no longer deal with how toxic they are. It’s messing with my mental health a lot. I could be having a good day but if they are feeling irritable they’ll start snapping at me and saying i’m useless out of nowhere and then start having an one sided rant about all the dissatisfaction they have with me. And it really hurts me badly whenever they do that. I tried shutting out their shoutings but I can never forget the pain they caused me.

Am I in the wrong for getting rejected by all the unis I applied to?? For those who took a gap year or got rejected by all the local u this year too, how did you manage to make your parents understand your plight?",https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h9jmxc/rant_how_do_i_deal_with_parents_who_are_not/,1.0,"[""hi! not here to provide solutions but just wanna say youre not alone in what youre going through! \n\ni got 74.25rp after mt which arent super amazing results, filled up my uni apps without any backups and im currently in the same position as u rn \n\ni guess, my family and friends are also wondering why i couldnt get into uni, but most of it is just me beating myself down. yes, i do feel ashamed that i may have to reapply next year when i could've most definitely avoided this outcome, that i have to lag behind my friends and take an extra year just because i made poor choices. but i guess, one way i went about it was to admit that i didn't do well enough for As, that i did uni apps without thinking thoroughly, that i truly made a mistake somewhere along the way. \n\nthe competition this year is indeed unprecedented, and it is no one's fault that covid happened, or that u couldn't get a spot in uni. there's not really a whos right or wrong in this situation, the most important thing is looking beyond this and planning ahead. im very sure that there is always a way to achieve your goals, even if it means taking more time compared to others. about your parents, i hope you arent too disheartened because if u allow yourself to wallow or begin to lose faith in yourself, no one can improve the situation that youre in right now. \n\nadmit that something went wrong, admit that you didnt reach expectations. but after that, pick yourself up and make the best out of what u have!""]"
2,SGExams,47498,[Rant] To everyone that scored L1R5 of 25 and above,iwea8k,toukendanshi,1600610196,11,1,"You're not alone. 

I know it's super upsetting coming on this sub and seeing people talk about their prelim L1R5s being 15 and below. It's been rough, hasn't it? We're probably still lamenting over how much we studied and yet we still failed, I know I'm still bitter on how I spammed my TYS everyday and still failed my E Math. 

Personally, it's been difficult for me to get back to studying after seeing my results. Funny, right? I thought that my prelims results would finally be the slap of reality I needed to push myself, but it's been difficult to even open my notes or start any practice papers. I guess seeing my results made me realize that the all-nighters and the frequent cramming sessions didn't work for me when it worked for all my friends. It just made me irritable and I couldn't remember information.

So, to the person reading this: take care of yourself. Take breaks when you need to, stop pulling all-nighters if your mental and physical health is starting to be affected by it. If you get anxious over reading how much people have been studying, be it on IG or twitter, get off them. Remember to eat, even if it's small meals. Please don't neglect your health in pursuit of that A1.

3,SGExams,3385,"[A Levels] [Need Advice] : Advice on learning patience, pacing one's self and staying calm.",917uzn,_meL-,1532358611,7,4,"JC curriculum has not been much easier for me than the rest. We all recognize that it is really a demanding \~ one and a half year run to the A Levels and that only those who really grind it out will come out with certificates fully studded with As. I expected it to require me pushing myself to slog it out even if I lack drive. All these challenges I expected to face have indeed taken its toll on my well-being. Accepting that most if not all of my energy, resolve and time be dedicated to the pursuit of top results and extracurricular credit in order to enter my dream course is something that I have done at the start.

It is embarrassing to me to find out now that the grit I looked to possess, the small sacrifices I have had to make or even the syllabus contents have become second-rated worries and inferior challenges to overcome to a host of things I have not tried to cope with in 17 years of my life to the extent I want to do so now :

Actual ANGER, FRUSTRATION, HATE, IMPATIENCE, AGITATION - directed at nothing else but myself and my abilities in mind. I have never felt remotely as mad as this, EVER.

My results, per se, are not what infuriate me. (I feel that I attempted my SEs adequately, grades ranging A-C, PCMH. My PW progress has also been on time and my group is fine.)

But rather, I find myself being absolutely enraged at times where I absorb material slower than I want to, times where I find myself under-perform quantitatively, etc. I think of what I am doing vs my ideals and get extremely mad. **Now, thinking of how I am getting overly, irrationally frustrated over such things and myself not being able to MANAGE MY ANGER infuriates me even further.**

Yesterday, I flung my desk and chair at the wall in class without much care for my own safety - and much less for the others around me - just because I was so consumed by my own rage. Right now, I am taking the opportunity to vent and ask for help while I am in a relatively calmer state. I have been increasingly scared of the things I do. Very often, I would say several instances daily, I find myself thinking about tearing people and things apart and trashing things around me to relieve myself of all this anguish. 

I hate it, I absolute hate it - I want to crush it, smash it, rip it apart, blow it to smithereens and rip them out before stabbing it with its own organs. My thoughts are along those lines, day in day out, whenever I find myself agitated by the smallest of things. I have become irritable to the point where small inconveniences and troubles throughout my waking hours cause me to think of these things regarding myself. 

I do not display my emotions to others around me. The vexed feeling I get when I bottle up these destructive thoughts is like I am **battering my own brain** with a club while twisting it everywhere. My heart aches and I wish I could burn my own flesh to live through this faster. 

To those reading, how can I help myself? I feel that managing my internal tantrum is important for my health and my performance. I just don't want to be so furious ANYMORE, FOREVER because it feels HORRIBLE. I used to be the kind that tolerates everything and can patiently, objectively face arduous processes but for some reason now, I am so vexed. 

How can I be patient once more? How can I learn to be indefinitely patient?

1,singapore,129436,"Help me, I have been sexually harassed by my neighbours for three years",949bo1,pekyj,1533300739,262,1295,"I spent the last three years being harassed, having my modesty outraged by my neighbours and getting ignored by the authorities. Here’s my story.


For years, my neighbours have been provoking my family and me. My mother, a frail hawker who has to wake up at 4:30am for work, has been greatly disturbed by the noise pollution created by them. Kids running around, teenagers singing loudly. My younger brother was once afraid of taking the lift because the boys threw their football at him.


Little did I know the rowdy boys were just a prelude to an avalanche of problems. As they grew up to become teenagers with raging hormones, they started catcalling me. They hauled me derogatory names whenever I entered or exited the lift. They dared each other to look under my skirt, speaking in Malay, thinking that we do not understand the language.


It is a common occurrence. Every day since the first incident three years ago, I enter my lift in a befuddled state and prepare for the impending deluge of verbal abuse. The surge of fear that rises up my throat as the lift approaches my floor is an everyday occurrence.


If they are not hanging around the lift lobby when I walk out, I wonder when will I bump into them again. Possibly the next day. If they are present, I hurry from the lift lobby to my house, hanging my head in shame and avoiding any eye contact. What am I ashamed of? That I’m a girl, therefore, I deserve to be harassed? I grew afraid of going out or returning home because that meant volunteering to be abused.


I trudged past them again last night, with a look of continual defeat. The verbal abuse and sniggers continued. They knew that I've about given up all hopes. It finally dawned upon me that my house is no longer a home I can happily return to.


I've had enough of being irascible and irritable by the time I make it to my gates. I detest the fact that the excitement of seeing my mother after a long day has been replaced with me growing increasingly frustrated at her, as if she landed me at my predicament because she picked this estate.


I’m sorry, mommy. I now realise that my mother does not have it easier either. She never experienced uninterrupted rest since the day my neighbours started harassing us. If she's not worried about them harassing me, her sleep is disturbed by the mob of kids that insist on playing at my corridor dead at night.


If you are a parent, I am sure you know how helpless my mother felt. That her own daughter was getting bullied in a way that is illegal in some European countries yet the town council and policemen would not step in to help. That she, as a hawker, has no means of getting us out of this estate until either I or my brother gets married.


Even my friends who visited are horrified by the image presented to them. My girl friends get harassed as well. No one can bring themselves to believe that this part of Singapore — a fully developed country — exists.


We threatened them with law enforcement and for a while, they stopped. But when they realised it was all but empty threats, they started again. So we stuck to our words and called the town council. After my first call, they promised to look into it and I was given a number to call lest they create a disturbance again. Nobody picked up the phone when we called in.


The same happened when we contacted the police through the non-emergency number, who said they will be coming in 10-20 minutes to investigate the matter but nobody turned up. Now I see that even civil servants are unwilling to help us.


I only saw a glimmer of hope when I contacted the People's Association of my area. We set up a meeting during which, they assured me that my MP was concerned. They reassured me that they will be conducting routine checks. Let’s be real here, the noise pollution and harassment happen after office hours. Who would sacrifice their family time to deal with this issue? Still, I placed my trust in them.


They emphasised that I should lie low while they liaised with the town council and police station. Well, it’s been one year since, and the situation has not changed. Not even one bit.


I turned to other options. I compiled a video of the times their siblings/cousins/friends disturbed our neighbours to send to my MP for his perusal. (I’ve lurked on reddit for about seven years now but I’m pretty new to posting stuff so I’m unsure how can I embed it here. The video’s on my Facebook account, accessible at fb /pekyj. Please let me know if linking this way isn’t allowed — I can remove this part immediately)


The video shows just a few, and the least severe, instances I managed to capture with my phone — all the catcalling incidences went unrecorded because I do not feel safe taking a video with their piercing stares on me. The video is a shortened, censored version. I censored their faces before posting because these kids, while disruptive, were not the source of my torment.


The video was shown only to prove a point: that there was an issue of disturbance and overcrowding. Before you ask, yes, the video clips were taken well after 10pm.


The last straw was a distasteful reply I received from my MP(’s PA, I assume), dripping with sarcasm.


It reads:
""You can consider a variety of different possible Court orders if you are of the view that there has been nuisance or harassment or that your neighbours are denying you quiet enjoyment. Since the Town Council or the Police is not an option which you wish to consider, and if you wish to consider your legal options, you can consider consulting with the Law Society for recommendations.""
I refuse to even reply to that atrocious email. Consider my legal options? If I had the money, I would not be living in a rented two-room flat. I do not understand how they can’t see that it is not about the peace, but my safety. Why should I feel unsafe in my own neighbourhood? What happened to Singapore being the safest country in 2018?


I could shout something back and pray that it will stop the abuse, but should I take the chance? I am a petite girl — just a little beyond 150cm — and they are a group of guys. Sometimes up to 10 in a group. Forget about whether it’s legal or not to have that many people living in the same house, what are my defences if they were to gang up on me? If I take up self-defence classes, what are my chances of winning a fight? I don't know, and I'm afraid to ever find out.


I have reached a dead end. I am done. I do not have the intention of intimidating anyone but I have had enough of being ignored. I am sick of being objectified, I am exhausted, I feel vulnerable in my home — my supposed safe haven. I just want to feel safe in my neighbourhood. I want to be happy about returning home to my family. Just once. I sincerely hope it is not too much to ask for.


I want to emphasise that this is not about race — the last thing I want to read are racist remarks. Don’t make this about any race. I just want to know if there are any other options can I consider. If you connections or solutions, please let me know.


This is a real cry for help, it is truly my last resort. The more shares I get, the higher my chances of it reaching someone who might be able to help, and maybe relevant authorities will start paying attention to my case.


Please, I’m begging you, please share this. It’s been three torturous years, and who knows how many more.

At the end of the day. I'm just trying to make the best of my situation. Life sucks but maybe it's worth living for the little moments. 

My story:

“HOW MY LIFE ALMOST ENDED BEFORE IT BEGAN...”

I’m currently 22 and my peers are traveling the world, representing our country in sports, going on fun adventures with their friends or simply enjoying a meal. Many, if not all of them, have the energy, health and money to do so. I used to be able to enjoy most of these too. Unfortunately, I can’t say the same now.

Getting diagnosed with a chronic illness, Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), changed my life forever. From being a floorball athlete and a coach, to being homebound with frequent trips to the doctors. IBS is basically having spasms in your colon. Without going too in-depth, the easiest way to describe it, would be like suffering from food poisoning 24/7. The severity of IBS varies and sadly mine is on the severe end.

The problem with being homebound is getting a job that allows me to work from home. Coupled with the fact that I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder &amp; depression seven years ago, my future was looking bleak. I spent many sleepless nights thinking of what I can do to support myself financially. 

3 years ago, I founded Bens Leather Crafts. This year I started running it full time. This job allows me to work from home, even when there’s a flare-up and I feel unwell. This way, I am able to work towards my dream - selling good quality handmade products and supporting myself financially, despite all my health issues.

I've been feeling down lately mainly due to university, and I've become more and more stressed out. I've also become more irritable, and I've noticed that I'm eating only once a day on some days. Severely negative thoughts began forming since end of March, and got better during summer holiday (June-July). However, it got worse than before since September due to a year-long college research project that seems to be failing. And it doesn't help that my neighbors are noisy even at night, especially the person living in the unit in front of me. Whenever that neighbor comes to his unit, I can't help but to feel distressed and uneasy. I've tried multiple times talking to him to keep his voice level down, and every time he keeps on commenting that it's not his fault that I can't stand him and it's a consequence of living in a flat.

I decided to do some online depression/anxiety quizzes you can find online and found out that I am almost definitely suffering from a high level of depression, and moderate-high anxiety. The sites I used are: from whatsmym3, 7Cups, NHS, and a couple of other sites which I have forgotten.

And to the people here, I hope you don't mind answering some questions:

- To people familiar with the premise of depression/anxiety, are those online tests to be trusted?

- To people who had suffered/are currently suffering depression, what small things can someone do to to maintain emotional wellness? When is it appropriate to seek a professional, and what kind of professional should you see (e.g. psychiatrist, psychologists, therapists, etc)?

- Where in Singapore can a student have himself mentally diagnosed for cheap?

I don’t know if I can live through ns with unbearable headaches and Stomach Pains 24/7. 
I’m Currently PES B4 ( They don’t know about all of these new symptoms) 
I don’t know how to get my medical documents",https://www.reddit.com/r/NationalServiceSG/comments/eijb1d/about_pes/,0.0,['I’m curious about how you have constipation and diarrhoea at the same time?']
