When there's people going all the way to senoko industrial area to purchase disinfectant, you know things are getting ridiculous. We all should take extra precaution, practice good hygiene and exercise common sense during this period




Overnight in Asia, we hosted a call with Professor John Nicholls, a clinical professor in pathology at The University of Hong Kong and expert on coronaviruses. He was a key member of the research team at The University of Hong Kong which isolated and characterized the novel SARS coronavirus in 2003. He has been studying coronaviruses for 25 years. Below are my notes transcribing the call. 

Quick summary: 

Look at the fatality rate outside of Wuhan - it‚Äôs below 1%. The correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a bad cold which kills people who already have other health issues. This virus will burn itself out in May when temperatures rise. Wash your hands.
 
My notes from the call below:
 
Q&amp;A Session with Professor Nicholls:
 
What is the actual scale of the outbreak? How much larger is it compared to the official ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù cases?
 
People are saying a 2.2 to 2.4% fatality rate total. However recent information is very worthy - if you look at the cases outside of China the mortality rate is &lt;1%. [Only 2 fatalities outside of mainland China]. Two potential reasons: 1) either China‚Äôs healthcare isn‚Äôt as good ‚Äì that‚Äôs probably not the case, 2) What is probably right is that just as with SARS there‚Äôs probably much stricter guidelines in mainland China for a case to be considered positive. So the 20,000 cases in China is probably only the severe cases; the folks that actually went to the hospital and got tested. The Chinese healthcare system is very overwhelmed with all the tests going through. So my thinking is this is actually not as severe a disease as is being suggested. The fatality rate is probably only 0.8%-1%. There‚Äôs a vast underreporting of cases in China. Compared to SARS and MERS we are talking about a coronavirus that has a mortality rate of 8 to 10 times less deadly to SARS to MERS. So a correct comparison is not SARS or MERS but a severe cold. Basically, this is a severe form of the cold.
 
You mentioned a shortage of testing kit can you talk more about that?
 
There are two ways to detect a virus: 1) Through the genetic material ‚Äì DNA or RNA or, 2) to detect the protein of the virus. The rapid tests used in a doctors‚Äô labs look at the protein. The problem with that is that you need an antibody to pick it up. And it takes 8-12 weeks to make commercial antibodies. So right now for the diagnostics tests they are using PCR which give you a turnaround in 1-2 hours. But then you need to run a machine and run 96 runs in 1 hour but then you have to a batch of samples so there‚Äôs another delay of 5-6 hours for patient presentation. So that will lead to some problems you can‚Äôt turnaround in 5-10 mins which is what you want when a patient shows up to the emergency room. Because right now you also have influenza going around so what you want is to be able to rule out influenza so you can treat the patients correctly for coronavirus. So that may be why they missed some of the earlier cases.
 
Your colleague at HKU estimated that the size of the infected population on Jan 25th was 75K with a doubling time of 6.4 days. So by Feb first we would have 150k infected. How accurate do you think these models are and how accurate have they been in the past?
 
Those figures did not take into account restriction on travel, quarantine etc. These reports are likely on the high side. This is not taking into account social distancing. Historically, these models have not been all that accurate.
 
When do you think this thing will peak?

Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity. To make you guys really worried. A coronavirus can survive on a stainless steel surface for 36 hours. It hangs around for quite a bit.
 
Sunlight will cut the virus ability to grow in half so the half-life will be 2.5 mins and in the dark it‚Äôs about 13 mins to 20 mins. Sunlight is really good at killing viruses. That‚Äôs why I believe that Australia and the southern hemisphere will not see any great infections rates because they have lots of sunlight and they are in the middle of summer. And Wuhan and Beijing is still cold which is why there is high infection rates.
 
In regards to temperature, the virus can remain intact at 4 degrees or 10 degrees for a longer period of time. But at 30 degrees then you get inactivation. And high humidity the virus doesn‚Äôt like it either. That is why I think SARS stopped around May and June in 2003 ‚Äì that‚Äôs when there‚Äôs more sunlight and more humidity. The environment is a crucial factor. The environment will be unfavourable for growth around May. The evidence is to look at the common cold ‚Äì it‚Äôs always during winter. So the natural environment will not be favourable in Asia in about May.
 
The second factor is that of personal contact. With SARS once it was discovered that the virus was spread through the fecal oral route, there was much less emphasis on the masks, and far more emphasis on disinfection and washing hands. HK has far more cleanliness (than China) and they are very aware of social hygiene. And other countries will be more aware of the social hygiene (than China). So in those countries you should see less outbreaks and spreading. A couple days ago the fecal-oral route of transmission was confirmed in Shenzhen. In China, most of the latrines are open-  there‚Äôs more chance of phermites (?) being spread. But in other countries the sanitations systems tends to closed. My personal view is that this will be a bad cold and it will all be over by May.
 
People talk about the vaccine and this is the big problem that people get from movies. Where in the movie they come out with a vaccine and then three days later it‚Äôs all over the world and everybody is saved. In reality this does not happen because for a vaccine you need to go through clinical trials ‚Äì is it safe and will it work. The last thing you want to do is rush a vaccine too early. If you get any severe reactions, then the anti-vaxxer will just say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù. You are talking about a working vaccine in 1 to 2 years. With SARS, in 6 months the virus was all gone and it pretty much never came back. SARS pretty much found a sweet spot of the perfect environment to develop and hasn‚Äôt come back. So no pharmaceutical company will spend millions and millions to develop a vaccine for something which may never come back. It is Hollywood to think that vaccines will save the world. The social conditions are what will control the virus ‚Äì the cleaning of hands, isolating sick people etc‚Ä¶
 
What do we know about the transmission rate? It‚Äôs been estimated around 2.2 to 2.68. What percent of the patients are transmitting while being asymptomatic?
 
This is a big problem when you talk about asymptomatic that means you have a good diagnostic test- where you can say they are asymptomatic (which we don‚Äôt have with this virus).
 
We actually looked at this with MERS where people were saying it had a high fatality. We went to camel abattoirs and took serums from the abattoir workers and found that quite a few had low infections with no symptoms. This is what should have been done at the initial stages at the seafood market. But to do that you need a good diagnostic test. A good diagnostic test is necessary to determine to the transmission rate. Now we have normal human airways and we can now look at how long it takes the virus to replicate in that environment. And that will be very useful to determine those who are asymptomatic carriers.
 
Any sense of whether the estimates of the reproductive number the R0 of 2.5 or 2.7.  Do you think that is high or low. What does that mean?
 
Measles was about 10-15 and influenza is just below 2. I think it‚Äôs about 2.2 as it‚Äôs being transmitted within the community.
 
Have we seen any super spreaders? We saw that with SARS and MERS.
 
There‚Äôs talk about that but the epidemiologists are still overwhelmed so no clear answer. But I don‚Äôt think there are any super spreaders.
 
What is the percentage of people transmitting the virus while being asymptomatic?
 
Unlike SARS, patients were symptomatic at about day 5, some of these cases may be asymptomatic until about day 7. That‚Äôs based on the first publications. Asymptomatic is probably the first 5 days.
 
There‚Äôs a paper published looking a familial cluster with a boy who was shredding the virus and he was asymptomatic.
 
That‚Äôs something about kids and we saw this with SARS. Very few kids had very severe disease. We are trying to determine if this is a virus which we call low (unintelligible) kind of inducer or high (unintelligible) kind of inducer.  SARS is high [unintelligible] kind of inducer. This means that when it infects the lower part of the lung, the body develops a very severe reaction against it and leads to lots of inflation and scarring. In SARS what we found is that after the first 10 to 15 days it wasn‚Äôt the virus killing the patients it was the body‚Äôs reaction.
 
We are doing testing on this now. Is this virus in the MERS or SARS kind picture or is this the other type of virus which is a milder coronavirus like the NL63 or the 229. I think this will be a mild (unintelligible) kind inducer.
 
Case fatality is about 2.5% or so? Do you expect this to change over time? And are you seeing any difference among the young population and older population in terms or mortality rate?

SARS went really for people in their 30 or 50 years. And MERS on the other hand basically is if you have co-morbidity ‚Äì try and find somebody in the middle east who does not smoke or does not have high blood pressure etc.. The data coming out of China seems to indicate that it‚Äôs those with the co-morbidity are most at risk. For the seasonal influenza that‚Äôs also what we find. It‚Äôs the people with the co-morbidity that have the increase mortality rate.  Having said that there‚Äôs a guy in the Philippines who died in his mid-30.
 
I think this looks more like the seasonal influenza where those who die have to co-morbidity.  Now that we have better case control definitions outside of mainland China, we will get a true assessment of the fatality rate. I would now put it at about 0.8% to 1%.  When you look at all the death reports ‚Äì separate out the deaths from mainland China and outside China.
 
Mortality rate in China ‚Äì is much higher? Why?
 
Its related to the environment. In the high income countries you don‚Äôt have as high a population density, higher level of environment control and hygiene. In Indonesia ‚Äì it‚Äôs unlikely to spread much as it‚Äôs very hot and humid. Would this virus move to Africa? I think that‚Äôs unlikely ‚Äì too hot there‚Äôs not a lot of travel there. Europe ‚Äì possibility higher transmission but environmental care is higher.
 
At this stage it‚Äôs a really bad cold which can cause problems in people. People are talking about the ‚Äúlethal virus‚Äù but seasonal influenza can cause deaths in elderly but we don‚Äôt call that ‚Äúthe lethal influenza‚Äù.
 
There‚Äôs news reports that antivirals are being used and that it‚Äôs working what are your thoughts on that?
 
With SARS it didn‚Äôt seem to work at all with the commercially available antivirals. But there seems to be good effects with the case in Washington with the Gilead agent. And it sounds like China will be using it.
 
Interferon works and it has quite a bit of benefit.
 
The problem with the antivirals ‚Äì because the virus has different ways of replicating within the cell, finding a nice common target has been difficult. But the Gilead agent appears to me to be very promising. We now have the virus growing in our labs/cultures so can now test it to see what will work and not work.
 
Would the opening of the hospitals in China change anything?
What we found with SARS in HK was that a contributing factor to the spread was the overwhelming of the HK healthcare system. Hospitals and doctors were overwhelmed. When China built these Wuhan hospitals ‚Äì it‚Äôs to take the work load off the staff which is likely exhausted.  
 
In HK with SARS we found quite a lot of infection of healthcare workers as they are close and doing invasive procedures. But this time around there is not much evidence of the healthcare workers getting sick or dying (but maybe China is not reporting it) so this may suggest that I think it is not being spread by close aerosol contact but more by the fecal-oral route or with droplets. So it will not be as contagious within hospitals. So getting the two hospitals built it will take a lot of the work load off the other hospitals so it should be a big benefit.
 
The recovery rate now higher than the deaths rate? Thoughts on that?
What we found is that in HK with SARS we didn‚Äôt know how long to treat a patient for. Now in China they are using the SARS model but treating patients for shorter time periods so that they don‚Äôt get the secondary problems that they did with Sars. Getting actual data on recovery from the mainland is still a bit of a challenge.
 
I‚Äôd consider a patient recovered if he‚Äôs been discharged. The problem is that with SARS, there were quite a bit of people where the steroid were very beneficial to treat the acute stage and we didn‚Äôt know how long the virus would live for so we kept them on the steroids for a long period of time and they came out with all sorts of secondary problems due to the immunosuppression.
 
I haven‚Äôt seen any data on the quality of life of those who have been discharged.
 
Evidence of E-coli?
Secondary infection are most likely the cause of deaths of the patients in the Philippines and HK.
 
What does it mean for a patient to have recovered?
That means the patient has been discharged from the hospital. That‚Äôs the criteria for Hong Kong. But there‚Äôs no good data or guidelines on this.
 
What is the probability that this will be contained and eradicated or will it be endemic in the human population?
If it is like SARS it will not be endemic. It most likely will be a hit and run just like SARS. People talk about mutation but what we found with SARS was that there was no mutation and we have been tracking MERS and we have not seen any severe mutation. This is unlike the common coronavirus which when they replicate they don‚Äôt have a ‚Äùspell check‚Äù so they mutate. So if this virus follows the same path as SARS or MERS it won‚Äôt mutate.  This will not be endemic. I think it will burn itself out in about 6 months.
 
Does mortality rate or fatality rate typically increase over time? That was apparently the case with SARS. 
With SARS we didn‚Äôt know how long the virus was alive for. So with SARS in the later stages people were not dying of SARS but of the complications of SARS which is why the mortality rate increased. But now people are much more aware of the dangers of over immunosuppression. So the death rate shouldn‚Äôt be more severe. Especially with the new hospitals being established which should take some of the workload off of the healthcare workers from Wuhan.
 
If we look at the serious cases being reported it‚Äôs about 13% of the total cases being reported. If we assume a 50% mortality rate for the severe cases than we are looking at a mortality rate of 5-6%. Is that a fair assumption?

In Hubei, the milder cases are not making it to the hospital. Because they are so overwhelmed that milder cases are being sent away. So that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs important not to look at the mortality rate in Wuhan but to look at the mortality rate in Shanghai or Shenzhen or outside of Wuhan. It‚Äôs very important to dissect it out.
 
Would it be too early to make conclusion outside of Wuhan? It‚Äôs still really early days outside of Wuhan? Are we making assumption with very little data and very early data?

That‚Äôs all the data we have to work with. When you are dealing with an epidemic at the early stages ‚Äì there‚Äôs such a variable. But now for political reason people are far more aware of the virus so it won‚Äôt be as epidemic as it was early on. There‚Äôs far more awareness and controlled environment and changes in social behaviour. Which I‚Äôm not sure is taken into account in the models. So it should spread far less outside of Wuhan.",https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f06uuc/clsa_conference_call_with_coronavirus_expert/,0.0,"['&gt; Three things the virus does not like: 1) sunlight, 2) temperature, and 3) humidity.   \n\n""Really meh...""  \nTime to fit in more outdoor exercise in the next month or two.']"

* Amongst the new cases today, 1 is asymptomatic, while 4 were symptomatic.
* 2 community cases, both are school students who were already on quarantine:

&gt;There are 2 cases in the community today who are contacts of a previously confirmed case. Cases 58045 and 58047 had earlier been identified as contacts of Case 57947. All 3 cases are family members residing in the same household. Cases 58045 and 58047 were placed on quarantine from 3 October, after Case 57947 was confirmed to have COVID-19 infection. They were swabbed on 3 October and both tested negative for COVID-19. They later developed symptoms during quarantine and subsequently tested positive on 13 October. Both cases are school students, and had last been at their respective schools on 2 October.

* 3 imported cases:

&gt;Amongst the 3 imported cases, 1 (Case 58043) is a Singaporean who returned from the UK. Another (Case 58044) is a Short-Term Visit Pass holder currently employed in Singapore who arrived from Russia. The remaining case (Case 58046) is a Student‚Äôs Pass holder who arrived from India. They had all been placed on SHN upon arrival in Singapore and were tested while serving SHN.

I've never actually posted before, hope I am doing this right.

2 days in a row without dorm cases.

The small victories are getting more common, signifies that the trend is good. It started showing up as 0 community cases, continued days with 0 community cases, 0 cases in PBDs, 0 cases in dorms, continued days with 0 cases in dorms, plus the massive 0 in both the dorms &amp; community on 13 Oct 2020. Hope to see all of these happening even more frequently.

We've come a long way because of our collective effort! Really, kudos to everyone as the healthcare workers &amp; government really can't do this alone. Unfortunately I think safe management measures are still here to stay for quite a while.

0,NTU,4943,To that guy who thought I was a fucking creep,iv2j39,GoFvckUrself27,1600419184,21,14,"I was walking from a certain hall which I live in to a certain canteen to get lunch, when this couple walked in front of me. At first it was no big deal, they were relatively far away from me. However, the guy turned around shortly after noticing me and stared at me for a good five seconds before continuing to walk. I didn't really think it was a big deal because I gave you the benefit of the doubt. Then you dragged your girlfriend and turned the corner, waited for me to pass and then continued walking while muttering somewhat loudly ""who is that guy"" and implying that I'm shadowing you or your girlfriend.

At this point it crossed my mind that you would have concluded I was creeping around your girlfriend by walking a good 5-10 metres behind her. Mind you I was only minding my own business and on my way to get lunch, while you implied that by walking in front of me, I'm creeping around both of you. That incident bugged me out because prior to this, I assumed that most guys who live in hall are somewhat level headed and wouldn't be impulsive at these kinds of baseless accusations. I could have very well turned your own words on you had you been walking behind me.

I guess your behaviour is symptomatic of a bigger issue that is 1. Your insecurity and 2. People assume that most guys are creeps. To point 2, I understand that the conclusion can be hastily drawn just because there are many cases of perverts in NTU. Its really shortsighted to say that all guys are criminals or potential criminals because of a few bad apples. Its important to take this issue seriously but once you start being paranoid and accusing random people, maybe you need to get yourself checked out.

And to the guy, you could have confronted me directly if you thought I was peeving around your girlfriend. It can save a lot of misunderstandings and wouldn't make yourself look cowardly or paranoid if it was someone else that was in my shoes. In the end, my impression of you is that you're just an insecure and impulsive person.
