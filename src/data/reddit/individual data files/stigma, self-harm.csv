At least for myself. \n\nBehaviour is so relative anyway..."", 'not all assholes are siao lang\n\nnot all siao langs are assholes', ""> # Commentary: When we call people with strange behaviour mentally ill, we reinforce mental health stigma\n\n> Ridiculing those who disturb public peace or break the law by saying they’re “crazy” assumes mental illnesses will lead to destructive behaviour, to the detriment of people living with mental health conditions.\n\n> SINGAPORE: There was a silver lining amid the grey cloud of the COVID-19 pandemic last year.\n\n> Much was reported about how working from home frankly made it hard to separate work from life, causing more burnout among employees.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> In our private circles, it became increasingly common for friends to share refreshingly honest confessions about having bouts of anxiety and a general sense of ennui.\n\n> There has been much forthright talk of collective pandemic fatigue and acceptance that such commonplace challenges should lead us to cut each other some slack.\n\n> Blindsided by a pandemic that changed life as we knew it to be, and the loss of lives and livelihoods globally, we struggled to cope - but that struggle saw a beneficial rise in mental health awareness.\n\n> The resulting, urgent focus on mental health felt like a tiny but significant win.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> (Mental health groups have seen a surge in calls since COVID-19 hit. Who are the people tirelessly manning these helplines? Find out on Heart of the Matter.)\n\n> \n\n> \n\n> \n\n> THEN SOME INCIDENTS HAPPENED\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Yet, two videos that went viral on social media this year suggest we may still have some way to go in understanding and talking about mental health.\n\n> The first offensive clip was a woman making race-related comments on the MRT, where she asked commuters about their race. When a commuter responded she was Malay, the woman said, “Malay, is it? Okay, no wonder.”\n\n> Later in the video, she added that she would “never mix around with you guys because you are so different”.\n\n> The second and more recent video featured a woman without a mask in Marina Bay Sands. When a safe distancing ambassador asked her to put on her mask, she refused and asked instead for the ambassador’s credentials.\n\n> In both incidents, several online commenters called these women “crazy”, “with a hole in the brain” and “confirm mentally ill”.\n\n> Invalid email address It looks like the email address you entered is not valid.

By clicking subscribe, I agree to receive news updates and promotional material from Mediacorp and Mediacorp's partners.\n\n> The actions in the videos were problematic, but these comments left an even more bitter aftertaste.\n\n> MENTAL ILLNESS IS NOT A PUNCHLINE\n\n> While some commenters explicitly mocked them, others seemed to have jumped the gun to assume these women had mental illness and urged others to understand.\n\n> Either way, such assumptions seem to reinforce the dated stereotype that those with mental illness would necessarily behave in “crazy” ways, and cannot be taken seriously - a fundamental reason for the prevailing stigma around mental illness.\n\n> “I still believe there’s a portion of Singaporeans who are not well-versed or have limited knowledge of mental health. That’s why they’re making such comments,” Porsche Poh, executive director of mental health non-profit organisation, Silver Ribbon (Singapore) said to me.\n\n> She cautioned against knee-jerk reactions to label others. “Some people might have unpleasant encounters, and they might draw conclusions based on those encounters. They have not attended any talks or workshops or learnt much about mental health issues.”\n\n> The comments also implied that mental illness must have caused their disruptive behaviour caught on camera.\n\n> Yet, psychologists have often pointed out that the symptoms of mental health conditions are more varied, sometimes subtle but serious for the patient - like decreased motivation, poor appetite and fatigue.\n\n> “Many mental health organisations have been working hard to collaborate with the media to raise awareness. It is a setback every time we come across such negative comments,” added Ms Poh.\n\n> If all this sounds familiar, recall the case of a woman in Shunfu Market who refused to wear a mask last year, because she was “a sovereign”. The circulating video captured her in a heated argument, and commenters were quick to assume that she, too, had an underlying mental health condition.\n\n> She was remanded at the Institute of Mental Health for two weeks with no mental disorder found, and recently sentenced to two weeks jail and a $2,000 fine.\n\n> Judging by similar reactions to that case a year ago, it seems more awareness has not translated to less stigma.\n\n> SO WHEN DOES MENTAL ILLNESS FACTOR IN?\n\n> Thankfully, this complex relationship between criminality and mental illness deserving of delicate, careful treatment is one our courts have recognised.\n\n> In fact, the criminal justice system in Singapore has a system for situations where criminals potentially have a mental health condition. It enlists the professional advice of psychiatrists in deciding the extent to which a mental health condition plays a role.\n\n> “Doctors will make an initial assessment on several things. One, what type of psychiatric condition this person has. Two, whether the conditions have anything to do with the offence. And three, does the psychiatric condition allow for this person to understand his plea,” Mr Shashi Nathan, a partner in criminal litigation at Withers KhattarWong, said.\n\n> “There are cases where someone’s condition is so advanced or debilitating that they might not understand the nature of the offence or the consequences of his actions.” On the other hand, some might be fit to plead, but still have some form of psychosis, he added.\n\n> The law takes into account nuances in judgment and sentencing. In less straightforward cases, two people might have the same condition but behave differently, while another two might have a different psychosis yet behave the same way.\n\n> “Everyone is an individual, so how psychosis affects them is also individualistic. The psychiatrist will make an assessment whether the psychosis affected the ability to make judgement, whether he fully understands the consequences of his act, and whether he’s unable to control his behaviour,” Mr Nathan said.\n\n> “As a defence lawyer, we’re relying on someone’s psychosis to mitigate a sentence or explain someone’s actions, so we have to show the court that there is a causal link between the condition and the offence,” he added.\n\n> For example, a shoplifter with a history of kleptomania would have their condition taken into consideration during sentencing, because kleptomania affects decision-making and has a “direct causal link” to shoplifting, he shared.\n\n> EVERYDAY ACTIONS MATTER\n\n> Our laws recognise how anyone living with a mental health condition deserves a closer look based on their unique circumstances and health.\n\n> One in seven people in Singapore will be experiencing a mental health condition in their lifetimes. (File photo: TODAY/Nuria Ling)\n\n> Yet our mindsets continue to assume some level of uniformity of people living with mental health conditions - as a group of unpredictable individuals who cause harm, are prone to law-breaking and should be isolated far away from society.\n\n> For people who struggle with mental health or live with mental illnesses, these comments are a sobering reminder that just because they have found the courage to seek help and speak about their condition does not mean the stigma no longer exists.\n\n> \n\n> For all those who think words have little consequences, think again. One in 10 in the Singapore resident population live with a mental illness, according to the Singapore Mental Health study 2010.\n\n> Your friends or family who are secretly fighting difficult, personal battles might see such comments including yours - and in worst case scenarios, conclude that they have one less person in their corner who they can share their struggles with.\n\n> Ultimately, no amount of mental health awareness campaigns or policies can override our daily words and actions.\n\n> Campaigns and policies might enact widespread shifts within systems, but everyday action is how we ensure the change needed in our mindsets is deep-rooted and authentic that go beyond lip service.\n\n> And perhaps, we can start by refraining from calling people “crazy” or “confirm mental illness”.\n\n> Otherwise, this COVID-19 silver lining can very quickly turn grey.\n\n> Grace Yeoh is a senior journalist with CNA Insider.\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)"", 'Agreed.

This is in contrast to if the action was part of free-will and due to a person's psychology. We believe these people should be corrected and possibly suffer punishment.\n\nHowever, these assumptions are often faulty. Mental-illness is defined by a set of behaviors or thought patterns that are maladaptive to society. Associations with biology or pathology may or may not be known.  And when we call people with strange behavior mentally ill, well they are maladaptive to society, so they are by definition, mentally ill. But that is simply a tautology and tells you absolutely nothing of value.\n\nHowever, there is still a lot of truth to biological underpinnings causing maladaptive behavior. There's a case of a man who underwent brain surgery who developed a compulsive addiction to child porn. The part of his brain that is removed normally inhibited our wild desires, and similar operations on monkeys led to hypersexuality and deviant behaviors. We would in this case attribute this behavior as a medical pathology, that it was outside of his free will.\n\nBut this argument of free-will becomes shaky. How much free will do we actually have? Our behavior ultimately stems from our biology. We tend to associate behaviors to free will until we determine a biological underpinning for them. If you went back 500 years ago, we believed epilepsies were caused by demonic possessions, until we learned that was caused by aberrant firing patterns in neurons. If you went back 100 years ago, we believed schizophrenia was due to poor parenting, until we discovered antipsychotics. There's a trend in which we shift our association of behaviors from free will to biology as we understand more about how biology leads to behavior.\n\nMaybe it's possible that we would eventually be compassionate people treating biological conditions to manage behaviors as we build our understanding. On the other hand, creating social/cultural norms and a societal system to keep people in check has practical means to managing people's behaviors to create an adaptive society.\n\n[https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/revising-fault-line](https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/revising-fault-line)"", 'Isn’t the issue more that people don’t understand what is mental illness and the full array of different conditions that one could have that may affect one’s behavior to different degrees?

Only after expert assessment then we can try to empathize by assuming the root causes (family issues/lost all money to gacha/hamster died).', 'No.. the ideal reaction is to not jump into assumptions until the full story is out.', 'The point of the article is that we should stop frivolously reaching for the term \'mental illness\' as an easy reach blanket term to describe people who express behaviour harmful to society. The main argument being that throwing around the word \'mental illness\' as a catch-all term for any deviant and destructive behaviour devalue the experiences and struggle of people that are seeking treatment, while also harming the movement toward greater mental health awareness.\n\nIt\'s not merely about how you make people feel, and neither is it only about confusion over a manual of symptoms and behaviours. It\'s about reinforcing the stubborn stigma that exists within society. People who suspect that they may have a mental health condition may not seek out treatment based on the idea that they do not want to be associated to people such as the woman who refused to wear a mask at MBS who was called ""crazy"", ""mentally ill"", or ""has mental health problems"". These mantras, when repeated, make it easy for those unaware of mental health discourse to continue to pay no attention to the issue because it is linked to the undesirables of the community.\n\nI very much agree with the author of the article, and happen to also agree with the idea of educating people. My main gripe is that I do not get why people are so averse to recommendations of being more mindful & responsible with the words we choose to use. Words are affective, they generate associations. I don\'t think anyone is taping peoples\' mouths to stop them from uttering the words \'mental illness\' . What both myself and the author of the article is saying is to stop using these words so flippantly because they have consequences.', ""I feel that the main point is about discouraging people from unconsciously/sub-conciously adding to the stigma surrounding mental health, as this further discourages those with mental health issues to seek the help they need. For most physical ailments, people are less likely to think twice about seeking help unless they're unable to access medical treatment. While it can sometimes be obvious as you pointed out, perhaps we need to be mindful not to make blatant judgements (e.g. on platforms like social media) as we risk perpetuating negative stereotypes about mental illness even further."", 'I only see one person crying here tho....', 'ah i see thanks for correcting  \ni remembered generally mental health services were disrupted, at least those at the tip ends of the spectrum (very serious cases) had continued care', 'I agree that mental illness is no excuse for racist tendencies as there are many people with mental health conditions who aren\'t racists.\n\nBut I feel a number of people who put out ""mental illness"" in this case, are doing so to draw attention to the fact that this is a person who is ill. And to pick on people who are unwell just ain\'t right. Maybe when she is on her medications and not in relapse, she is a perfectly functional member of society who holds a 9-5 job and takes care of her elderly mother. She could still hold racist views, but no one would know. (Whether it is morally right to hold racist views as long as you don\'t enforce it is a another can of worms altogether)\n\nI feel when people say ""hey, she is mentally ill"", they are saying ""hey, this person isn\'t well, she needs treatment"" more so than ""hey, she isn\'t racist, this is the mental illness talking""', '“Muslim” and “Chinese” are not attributes that are causally linked to terrorism or viral illnesses though. \n\nIndeed, mental illness is neither necessary nor sufficient to explain odd social behavior either, but there is a potential causal link here.', 'Just to highlight the absurdity in your statement.

On a personal level, I generally don\'t like gossiping and gawking at the bad behaviour, that\'s why when I (at least, within my peer group) bring stuff like this up, the context is always ""well let\'s withhold judgment, it could be this, it could be that"". It goes the other way too - if someone suggests some person acting out is mentally ill, often the conversation goes ""well also it could be other things"". Hell, the root cause could just be ""he\'s an asshole"". \n\nWhat I\'m trying to say is, at least in my peer group when this is brought up, it is never with the intention of labelling. And I think if you keep quiet about things for fear of the unintended conseqences of implying mental illness, that is a net loss. Not only does that keep things in the realm of ""let\'s not talk about it"", but you also let people cement their personal judgments in their mind, leaving it unrebutted. \n\nI think ""it could have been something else (and mental illness could be one of the something elses)"" is a perfectly fine way of bringing the topic up, and while I agree with the article to the extent that it condemns the ""eee that one crazy"" crowd, I don\'t agree to the extent that it suggests we don\'t bring it up for fear of perpetuating negative stereotypes.', ""That would be ideal, and should be the default line of thinking.

whothisthisme,n97gg5,How bad is the stigma around mental health in Singapore?,2021-05-10 23:22:48,askSingapore,44637,50,126,"So, i think the fact that Singapore is still a rather 'conservative' asian country meant that discussions on mental health is not frequently talked about enough? And by extension, the stigma around mental health issues still exist. 

I was wondering to what extent is this mindset prevalent in Singapore? 
For example, if you were in a ""professional"" industry (e.g. Law) , how poorly would your employers regard you if you had a history or record of poor mental health? (E.g. depression etc)

Am asking because i am contemplating joining the legal profession but at the same time i would like to seek therapy for my overall mental well-being . However, i wonder if doing so will affect my potential career?",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/n97gg5/how_bad_is_the_stigma_around_mental_health_in/,"[""I would say... Don't tell your employer or anyone at work you can't fully trust. Just to be safe. If you find your company is quite open minded, go ahead. A lot of ppl especially those who are older don't usually understand this concept. And most of the time (from personal experience) it's difficult to get them to even consider the possibility that mental health is a real thing. Of course, things are changing (I hope). If you're going to use your company insurance to seek professional help then you might have to talk to your HR. Ask them how much you're covered.."", 'For me, I seek professional help without informing my employer. Minimise risks, some people just think mental disorders are just attitude problems.', 'When I was younger, my parents denied me mental health help despite me being extremely suicidal and told me I would never get employed if i sought professional help in Singapore. My parents had always held high expectations of me and they wouldn\'t accept, god forbid, for anything to be wrong with their daughter. At first I understood it as their ignorance alone, but I quickly realized that many employers would likely share that same ignorance that stems from the same older generation, so my parents\' reluctance was warranted to an extent. I forced myself to be logical and understanding of their perspective, despite how heartbreaking it was to reach out to my parents and be put under fire for it.\n\nI did eventually start treatment but only from private establishments - my parents did not want anything to be on public record. This led to almost constant guilt tripping about the stupidly high cost it incurred to my family and it made me feel worse, honestly. Although I am proud of my parents for acknowledging my need for help, I could see that they still carried a heavy stigma around mental health & treatment as they would deny official diagnoses and deny me the use of medication (because they didn\'t, and still dont, believe in it but that\'s another conversation) etc. \n\nIts taken long, painful years of hard conversations with my parents to try and shift their mindset and it\'s an ongoing journey to this day. I can say that compared to 5 years ago, they are now more understanding and accepting of the importance of mental health while there are still lessons to be learnt. \n\nSo yes, Singapore/ the older Asian generation has a rigid mindset regarding mental health but steps can be made, no matter how little. Conversations can be made even if they seem like worthless attempts. I, for one, will not shut up about it if it means a better, safer future for the people around me. I fully understand that jobs (and therefore lives) are at stake if mental health is flagged up but times are changing, albeit very slowly. If we can\'t force change in the generation above us we can at least promise to try and break this cycle for ourselves and future generations.\n\nTo be frank, I am fucking sick of this ""it is what it is"", ""you can\'t do anything about it"" mindset, especially in Singapore. But, I can\'t really blame anyone for thinking that way in this unforgiving society. I hope that we can someday all realise: Your life should not be traded over some employer\'s (or anybody\'s) ignorance \n\nIf you\'re reading this, realise that you have a bigger role than you think in the lives of people around you. In our community, acceptance and acknowledgement of mental health is the first and perhaps hardest step we have to make.

There have been attempts to speak up about mental health and the younger generation is generally accepting and open to discussing it, but not so much in a professional sense, I'd think.\n\nI echo what the other redditors say: seek help, but don't disclose it to your employer as it can hurt your chances of getting a job. I'm not in the workforce yet so I can't say much about the stigma about mental health in a professional setting, but I've had acquaintances whose applications to school were severely delayed because they disclosed their mental health issues.\n\nEdit: many people shun from discussing this because it's taboo, mostly because the older generation. My dad dismisses the idea of mental health, he says it didn't exist in his time, so why now? And I think that that's a very good explanation for why Singapore is so uptight when it comes to such issues. It's snowballed into a situation where many people are ignorant."", 'Based on experience I feel that (most) Asian culture perceive mental illness as a symptom rather than an illness. Before modernization people live moment to moment going about their daily life and facing challenges are necessary to progress.

Another way to put it, gaining perspective of how differently each one of us view life helps realign our thoughts.

I say this from first hand experience, as someone who's lived in Singapore and Overseas, and has struggled with mental health issues. \n\nThe stigma is worse than in some Western countries, where mental health awareness (and acceptance of those with struggles) is far greater. As others have pointed out, there may be some (especially the older generation) who might react negatively towards you should you disclose that you are seeing a psychiatrist/psychologist/counsellor.\n\nSadly we live in a world where a lot of people attack or ostracize others who are struggling, rather than be patient, understanding or helpful. Ideally, it would be best to have support from those closest around but unfortunately that's not always the case. Nonetheless, your health and happiness is the highest priority and you should absolutely get the help you need. Others may not love you, but no matter what happens you can love yourself! If you don't feel comfortable sharing about it then perhaps it's best to keep it to yourself for the time being. (Therapists usually have a patient confidentiality agreement and won't disclose it unless your life or others' lives are at risk.)\n\nTherapy was the best thing I ever did for my health, and indirectly, for those around me too. Your health and happiness has a strong influence on your productivity and relationships too. There's no shame in getting help. People fall ill and visit doctors. Likewise, sometimes our mind falls ill or goes through too much and we need some help too.\n\nIf you do decide to get therapy, it's important to ensure that you are fully comfortable and confident in your therapist. It's absolutely fine and common for people to switch therapists if they find that things aren't working out. (For example, you wouldn't buy the first car that you see in a dealership. It's important to test drive first and then pick the right car.)\n\nAll the best and I hope you feel better eventually :)"", ""I am someone who has gone through a long way about this topic with high functioning autism,  depression, and exemption from NS.\n\nFor 23 years of my life, I couldn't fit in or get any mental health support available for me.

It can be really tiring, but I know that sharing my story is helpful, both to others and for myself in getting clarity about my own story,” she said.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> But Sabrina noted that this candour about anxiety and depression doesn’t always extend to another mental health condition she lives with: Bipolar disorder.\n\n> This condition causes extreme and unusual shifts in mood, energy, concentration, and activity levels that affect one’s ability to carry out day-to-day tasks.\n\n> “While I've been open with talking about anxiety and depression, I'm still very careful about the term ‘bipolar disorder’ because people tend to freak out and make their own assumptions about the condition,” she said.\n\n> “I've had friends completely wash their hands of me. They decided they didn’t really understand it and couldn’t support me in this part of my journey.”\n\n> The circuit breaker almost broke Syazwan.\n\n> Like Sabrina, 30-year-old Syazwan Rahmad, who is also diagnosed with bipolar disorder, is no stranger to a fear of judgement.\n\n> This partly stems from his own “shock” when he got the unexpected diagnosis recently, he explained, as he thought he only had depression.\n\n> “I don’t want people to think that I’m crazy. I’m scared they don’t want to be around me because I have a disorder. Till today, I have this thought in my head,” he told CNA.\n\n> Syazwan has since disclosed his condition to family, close friends and even to the public in a CNA Insider story that tracked the economic impact of COVID-19 on his dance career. But he admitted that he still struggles with criticism.\n\n> “About 20 per cent respond with negative comments about my career and me as a Muslim (when I talk about my mental health). But ultimately, I’m so open because I want people to know it’s okay not to be okay. Be true to who you are and that’s where healing will start,” he said.\n\n> SOME CONDITIONS HARDER TO DISCUSS\n\n> The COVID-19 pandemic revealed a need for more mental health support, with an increase in people calling in to mental health helplines.\n\n> Suicide prevention agency Samaritans of Singapore saw an increase of more than 22 per cent in the number of calls attended to on their 24-hour hotline in March 2020 as compared to that of the same period in 2019.\n\n> Likewise, the Singapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH) received an increase in helpline calls by 50 per cent in February and March 2020 compared to the average calls from April 2019 to Jan 2020.\n\n> Yet, despite more people seeking help for their mental health over the past year, and the increasing awareness around conditions like anxiety or depression, other conditions remain difficult to disclose, said seven individuals who spoke to CNA.\n\n> Some of these conditions are bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD), borderline personality disorder (BPD) and schizophrenia.\n\n> The traits of people with BPD include a feeling of emptiness, fear of abandonment, intense anger and irritability, unstable emotion, idealising and devaluing people, possible psychosis when stressed, and even binge eating, said Dr Roger Ho, an associate professor and senior consultant at the Department of Psychological Medicine at the National University of Singapore.\n\n> (Photo: Unsplash/Cristian Newman)\n\n> He added that there is also the possibility of physical self-harm among those with BPD, which is also known as emotionally unstable personality disorder (EUPD).\n\n> “Another symptom we pick up is they will cut themselves. In the emergency department, when you see someone with a lot of scars on their forearm, the patient might have BPD,” he said.\n\n> “But society doesn't know much about BPD; they think it’s just depression. The self-laceration is a very unique sign. When you ask someone with BPD why they cut themselves, they usually don't say they want to end their life. They want to experience the emotional pain they’ve had in the past.”\n\n> Dr Ho, however, reinforced that while some people might possess the traits of BPD, having a personality disorder is more than just checking off these traits.\n\n> “Having a personality disorder means that the traits become so strong that the person has interpersonal problems. These problems affect their life, whether it’s family, work or study,” he said.\n\n> Similarly, the stigma attached to schizophrenia - a psychotic disorder - prevails in Singapore.\n\n> According to a 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study released by the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) on May 21, about one-third of the population who have been diagnosed with psychotic disorders had a diagnosis of schizophrenia at some point in their lives. This makes schizophrenia the most common psychotic disorder here.\n\n> The results were part of the first nationwide study to examine the prevalence of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders among those living in Singapore aged 18 and above, their associated factors, and the treatment gap of the disorders.\n\n> \n\n> Despite the prevalence of schizophrenia, public understanding is lacking, with people with the condition being perceived as “dangerous or as individuals incapable of managing themselves”, said Ms Lim Lay Keow, a senior case manager at the Early Psychosis Intervention Programme at the Department of Psychosis in IMH.\n\n> “Schizophrenia is still sensationalised by the media. The accessibility to smart phones allow for photo or video taking of a person in distress, subjecting them to be judged online.”\n\n> This behaviour, Ms Lim noted, doesn’t just make it difficult for those with schizophrenia to disclose their condition for fear of discrimination. It also results in self-stigmatisation, where the person with schizophrenia finds it difficult to “differentiate themselves from the condition”.\n\n> The deeply entrenched stereotypes about schizophrenia also make it harder for the public to understand that schizophrenia is “not a personality flaw but a disease of the brain”, she added.\n\n> YOUTH MORE CANDID, BUT STIGMA REMAINS\n\n> Even before the pandemic last year, younger people were increasingly open about their mental health on social media, with some talking about therapy sessions or situations where their mental health conditions might flare up.\n\n> But Ron Yap, who was diagnosed with OCD three years ago, said this conversation doesn’t translate into less stigma for all conditions.\n\n> “While there has been more conversation for disorders like generalised anxiety disorder and depression, there’s still stigma surrounding more uncommon disorders, like OCD,” the 23-year-old said.\n\n> “Even though non-sufferers (of anxiety disorders and depression) will never experience the depths of pain and discomfort those conditions cause, they can at least get a rough, if imperfect, idea of what it’s like to suffer, by taking the times in which they experienced anxiety or sadness and amplifying the intensity and duration.”\n\n> But with OCD, the 23-year-old said, “It’s harder to fathom how and why someone would wash their hands 50 times to the point of breaking their skin, go to the bathroom 20 times before bed or dwell on a distressing thought for a whole day to the point of paralysis.”\n\n> To a non-sufferer, he added, such behaviour is “simply irrational, and even insane, and this impression hinders one’s ability to empathise with the sufferer”.\n\n> Ron, who runs the Instagram account @mentalhealthceo, believes misconceptions about OCD don’t help, such as that there’s only one type of OCD “exemplified by someone who obsessively washes their hands or clothes over and over again”.\n\n> “OCD and its rituals can manifest in countless different forms.

While we experience sadness and anxiety in our everyday life, depression and anxiety disorders lead to significant impairment and distress in someone’s life. It affects their ability to go to work, to sleep, and for a sustained period of time,” she said.\n\n> Public education about the diagnosis would also help, she added.\n\n> “This involves highlighting to people that mental illnesses can be managed with the right treatment and support, and those living with mental illnesses can lead fulfilling and meaningful lives.”\n\n> Besides managing symptoms, Sabrina, who has depression in addition to bipolar disorder, believes it would be better to look deeper at what causes them.\n\n> “Usually the triggers stem from your childhood trauma, environmental triggers, and even biological factors. So it’s good that we start talking about anxiety and depression, but we need to take it a step further and understand the root cause,” she said.\n\n> (File photo: AP)\n\n> And while media campaigns like Beyond the Label aim to change public perception around mental health conditions, some said labels actually help them make light of what they go through.\n\n> Sabrina, for example, doesn’t mind that some mental health conditions are more prominent than others, because it helps her “reshape her perspective” on what she’s going through.\n\n> “I’ve had people tell me they honestly don’t know what bipolar disorder is. And I realise I have to link it to depression or something more familiar to them for them to understand,” she said.\n\n> “So at least the increasing awareness of anxiety and depression has helped me talk about my condition.”\n\n> Where to get help: Samaritans of Singapore operates a 24-hour hotline at 1800 221 4444, or you can email pat@sos.org.sg.

In real life, regardless of youths or elderly, there is so much hate for people who didn't even do anything wrong or bother them. I don't get why these people are so open about their hatred towards a bunch of innocent people - actually makes me very scared to see normal people I know in my every day life find hatred for them like that"", 'i hope dana teoh finds this useful', 'They also face shitty Today articles.', ""SINGAPORE — Even though information about transgender issues has proliferated across the internet and become more accessible, people in Singapore who are diagnosed with gender dysphoria still find it difficult to find resources here and get adequate medical treatment and acceptance, experts and transgender youth said.\n\nGender dysphoria refers to the psychological discomfort or distress experienced by an individual who believes that there is a mismatch between his or her sex and his or her gender identity.\n\nNon-governmental organisations (NGOs) who support transgender people told TODAY that gaps still remain even though healthcare accessibility has improved over the years. Many healthcare professionals still lack the knowledge to treat transgender people, and public information about the resources available remain scarce and inaccessible, they said.\n\nTransgender youth who were interviewed said that they face inadequate support at home and in school, and struggle to gain acceptance.\n\nUnlike many other social taboos that have been shed, the taboo associated with transgender issues is still there and it has contributed to some of these problems, the NGOs said.\nRead also\nMOE denies stopping transgender student from getting hormone therapy, says it is ‘in no position’ to interfere with medical treatments\n\nThey added that this stigma and the inadequate institutional support is damaging to students with gender dysphoria, some of whom have even resorted to buying hormone replacement pills from unauthorised websites.\n\nThese gaps were thrust under the spotlight two months ago, when a transgender student named Ashlee alleged that the Ministry of Education (MOE) had prevented her from obtaining a doctor’s referral letter to begin hormone replacement therapy, the treatment recommended for individuals diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \n\nIn a 2016 study by medical journal The Lancet, estimates suggested that about 0.3 to 0.5 per cent of the global population are transgender. There is no official estimate of the number of transgender people among Singapore’s population.\n\nHEALTHCARE ACCESSIBILITY\n\nOpened in 2017, the Gender Health Clinic under the Institute of Mental Health (IMH) is believed to be the only public hospital in Singapore to have a team of medical professionals specialised in treating the transgender community, after the gender identity clinic at National University Hospital closed in 2008. \n\nTransgender patients who wish to seek help from the clinic can get a referral through public hospitals or polyclinics.\nRead also\nReview of Singapore’s mental healthcare system underway, as MPs highlight existing gaps\n\nHowever, Transgender SG, an organisation that collates resources for the transgender community in Singapore, said that getting this referral is not that straightforward, because many public healthcare workers do not know what to do when a person with gender dysphoria approaches them.\n\nThis was the case for Kaeden Lim, 17, who sought professional medical support from regular psychiatrists at a public hospital when he was 12 due to struggles with gender dysphoria and his mental health.\n\nIt took more than a year and four psychiatrists before he was finally referred to IMH’s Gender Health Clinic.\n\nTODAY spoke to Kaeden’s parents, who confirmed that Kaeden is a patient at the gender clinic and was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2018.\n\nThe teenager recalled how even after he had told the doctors that he identifies as a transgender male, they continued to use female pronouns when addressing him.\n\nIt was only at the IMH Gender Health Clinic that Kaeden received the support he was looking for when a doctor at the clinic validated his experience as a transgender person.\nRead also\nDecisions on use of hormonal therapy rest with clinicians and their patients: MOE, IMH\n\nAll three transgender students whom TODAY interviewed said that their experience at the gender clinic was affirming and positive. \n\nTheir frustration, though, lies with having to wait around three months between appointments because there are only a handful of doctors servicing the clinic.\n\nWhen contacted about the issue, IMH declined to comment.\n\nThere are options available for patients to go to a private doctor for medical support, but many choose not to because the prices for private consultations can be up to two to four times higher than public consultations.\n\nProfessor Tsoi Wing Foo, a psychiatrist in private practice who has treated patients with gender dysphoria for 50 years, said that some patients choose to go to him for treatment first while waiting for an appointment in the public hospital, which can take a few months. \n\nSince 2007, he has seen 1,000 patients with gender dysphoria. Most of his patients are between the ages of 18 and 30.\nRead also\nGender dysphoria: Schools can work out ‘practical arrangements' with students if there are valid medical grounds, says Lawrence Wong\n\nThe young people interviewed by TODAY said what makes matters worse is that information and resources for healthcare support is not easily accessible.\n\nFor instance, they found out about how to get a referral to the IMH gender clinic through a private online community and the information was not available publicly.\n\nTransgender SG has a list of healthcare providers that cater to transgender people, but it does not make this information public due to fears of societal backlash. \n\nLACK OF SOCIAL SUPPORT\n\nThen, there are some young transgender people who are unable to begin hormone replacement therapy due to lack of support from family.\n\nThis was the case for Lexi (not her real name), who was diagnosed with gender dysphoria in 2019.\n\nLexi let TODAY see the appointment cards, receipts and correspondence from a hospital showing that she is a patient at the IMH Gender Health Clinic and has been diagnosed with gender dysphoria.\n\nIn Singapore, individuals below 21 have to get permission from their parents before they can be referred to an endocrinologist, who specialises in treating conditions related to hormones and hormonal glands.\n\nBecause Lexi’s parents are against her medically transitioning, the 18-year-old has resorted to buying hormone pills off unauthorised websites without a prescription. She relies on the accounts of other transgender women to figure out how much to take.\n\nThe NGOs told TODAY that this is a common occurrence within the community for those who do not have support to transition but are desperate to start the process.\n\nDoctors are warning that buying and using hormones from websites can be dangerous. \n\nDr Abel Soh, an endocrinologist at Mount Elizabeth Hospital, said that there are many unbranded hormone treatments available online that may not necessarily provide the same concentration of hormones stated.\n\nTaking hormones without monitoring their levels in the blood via blood tests may potentially result in excessive usage, he said.\n\nAgreeing, Dr Ben Ng from Arden Endocrinology Specialist Clinic said that gender transitioning is a complex and multi-pronged process. Professional evaluation from a medical doctor is necessary to ensure that the therapy prescribed is appropriate and safe.\n\nBoth specialists said that taking the wrong prescription of hormones could lead to significant health problems, including increased risk of blood clots, heart disease and stroke.\n\nEven when transgender students have family support, they might feel alienated in school because the institutions often are not equipped to help them, the patients and experts said.\n\nFor instance, students face hurdles over which uniform they can wear or which toilets they can use.\n\nThis was the case for junior college student Jules (not her real name), who started hormone replacement therapy last year.\n\nTODAY confirmed with Jules’ parents that she was diagnosed with gender dysphoria and is seeing a doctor at the IMH Gender Health Clinic.\n\nDuring a disagreement with the school over which uniform she should wear, the 18-year-old was asked to wear a lab coat over her physical education attire during science practical class.\n\nJules said that this has made her feel more anxious because she now stands out among her peers, who wear either long pants or skirts during these lessons.\n\nShe has also resorted to drinking as little water as possible and holding her bladder to avoid using the bathroom in school.\n\n“If I could describe it in one sentence, it’s like I’m going out with an extremely bad haircut every day… just constantly being self-conscious because of this issue,” she said."", 'Cannot la, later people say we cyber bullies.\n\nMust continue to worship our NS-exempted heterosexual female overlords and kowtow to their judgment.', 'is this article bad?', 'WHAT NGOS, TEACHERS AND PARENTS SAY\n\nTo deal with the lack of social support in schools, NGOs said that teachers need to address matters of gender identity and sexuality in the classroom so that students are aware and know how to treat their peers facing gender dysphoria with more empathy and compassion.\n\nMr Ryzqiin Rafah said that this can be done through sexuality education. The 46-year-old is a volunteer with the TransBefrienders, a peer support service for transgender youth in Singapore. \n\nThe group has started a study support scheme for transgender students who have dropped out of school for various reasons, including bullying and lack of support.\n\nTo help teachers better navigate transgender issues in school, Mr Rafah said that schools may invite LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer) organisations such as Oogachaga or The T Project to guide teachers on how to navigate sensitive topics. \n\nMs June Chua, the founder of transgender shelter The T Project, said that schools should implement a zero-tolerance bullying policy so that all students have a safe and inclusive learning environment. \n\nThis could include ensuring that transgender students who experience any kind of bullying can approach trusted school counsellors, who have a set of protocols on how to handle such cases.\n\n“Schools should be a safe space for all students regardless of whether they are transgender or not,” Ms Chua said.\n\nA former educator who wanted to be known only as V Loh, 51, agreed that teachers and school counsellors should receive specialised training so that they are better equipped to help students navigate gender issues.\n\nShe suggested that school counsellors collaborate with medical professionals who are specialised in treating patients with gender dysphoria, so that they have the knowledge and skills needed to handle such cases.\n\nMs Loh, who left the school system three years ago, said that these policy changes still need to come from the top, and gender and sexuality issues remain a taboo in the school environment. \n\nMOE, which issued public statements on Ashlee’s case including a joint statement with IMH, said in response to TODAY’s queries that it does not have anything to add on the issue. \n\nEducation Minister Lawrence Wong said in Parliament last month that schools can exercise flexibility and work out practical arrangements for students with gender dysphoria, where there are valid medical grounds.\n\n“For students with gender dysphoria, our main focus is continuing to provide them with a conducive learning environment and to support their overall well-being. Recognising that the issues are complex, and that there are diverse opinions among students and their parents, we strive to deal with these situations sensitively and with compassion,” Mr Wong said. \n\nKaeden’s father, Mr Victor Lim, 59, said that the schools his son attended could have been more accepting and accommodating of his son’s needs at the time.\n\nKaeden had experienced taunts and bullying from peers and teachers when he came out as transgender. He has since left the public school system and is studying at an international school.\n\n“I can imagine if the school had accepted him from the beginning and nurtured him amid all of this to focus on what he is good at… he (would have fared better).”\nRead more at https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/living-gender-dysphoria-transgender-youths-face-stigma-and-inadequate-institutional-support', ""u/anakinmcfly: Hey Dana, here's an article that I thought would help you understand transgender issues. \n\nDana: The attempt on my life has left me scarred and deformed."", ""Think they are referring to Dana's article.

aaaaReigns,jc3x91,[Rant] [O Levels] The Negative Stigma surrounding Unrealistic Expectations,2020-10-16 13:19:46,SGExams,77673,28,275,"hey all, as o's looms closer and closer and many of us are panicking over this exam, i wanna take some time to vomit out what ive taken away from this horrifying experience of prepping for o's.

i see many people here pushing themselves to the brink of insanity and the sheer pressure they put on themselves. there is a strong weightage to do well in this exam, and many of my peers shoot for the sky with L1R4s of 8s and 9s. thats great that you wanna aim high! but id like to remind you that grades DO NOT define you. no matter what anyone tells you, be it parents, teachers, heck you yourself, that number on that piece of paper IS NOT YOU. i dislike seeing people demoralise themselves for doing less than expected. why not look at it from a different angle? instead of a ""i got B3..."", why not try ""hey! i got a b3!"" it does wonders when you look at things in a more positive light, as it pushes you to do even better for the next one. i myself am not a top scorer, im more on the lazy side tbh, and i got L1R4 of 22 for prelims. i aim for an L1R4 of 15 for o's, and low as it may seem, i work within my limits. i know this is the most realistic and highest standard my level of knowledge will take me, and it makes the task seem less daunting as the bar isnt so high up. the real magic comes when you set your expectations realistically, taking into account how it affects your social life, and your mental and physical health.

i can see in my friend group that some of them are losing their shit over this, and its more apparent here. the most common occurence of this weakened mental strength is due to the unrealistic expectations they put on themselves. take me for eg, im a lazy bum who would while away an entire week doing nothing but playing games. is it possible for me to get A1 for all subjs? can. but at what cost? i'd have to muster up 1000% of my energy into learning these useless topics and toss my life out the window just to see a good number on a sheet of paper. you could retaliate, ""there is no choice in sg, do well now to do well in the future."" while i agree with this statement, is it worth pushing your mind to the extreme? i think not. the stigma that we are competing with the whole of sg and bell curves shouldnt be this aggressive in the first place. why not worry about yourself first? 

healthy competition exists to push us to do better. but when its taken too far by external pressures eg. teachers, etc. it creates a domino effect and WE start having that mindset. what began as a seemingly harmless method of getting students to do well is now what makes them go crazy. so i urge everyone, its still not too late to change up your expectations. you can aim high, but is it within your limitations? do you have to sacrifice your social life and mental health? i urge everyone here to think through this carefully, for your own sake. it sucks to see so many ppl in my cohort burning away their lives for one exam.

with that i close this post. while hefty to read, i assure you that if you change up your actions now, things will look up. regain control of your life and dont let this seemingly daunting exam crush your efforts in other aspects of life now. if you need someone to vent to, this subreddit is the perfect place, and if its too public, shoot me a dm. id be more than happy to hear you out.

nameless9123,nmajvb,Prevalence of Herpes in Singapore (HSV-1 & HSV-2),2021-05-27 23:55:07,singapore,378760,40,24,"Lately, I have been reading up on sexual health matters as I find it intriguing given my previous lack of awareness on such matters. 

The common herpes conditions are HSV-1 (also commonly known as cold sores or genital herpes) and HSV-2 (genital herpes). I am amazed as it was reported that close to 80% of the adult populations have HSV-1 while 20% has HSV-2 (Genital herpes). 

HSV-1 can be transmitted via kissing or oral sex. Commonly transmitted when its symptomatic but asymptomatic transmission is possible too. I read that a lot of ppl do get it when they are kid, by being kissed by their relatives and etc. With the huge prevalence reported, I don't get why there is such a stigma of HSV-1 in particular in Singapore when the majority of the adult Singaporeans would probably have it just that they could be asymptomatic. Personally feel that there should be more sexual education and awareness done in Singapore (eg. HPV vaccination and use of condom and etc).

I\'m Bengali (meaning I speak the language Bangladeshis speak) and my parents migrated from Bangladesh to Singapore and we\'re all Singapore citizens (I was born here, after they converted their citizenships). Speaking Bengali and having travelled to Bangladesh has given me the ability to interact with the Bangladeshi foreign workers (some of them work for dad, and I\'m pretty close to them since young). I have encountered many times where many Singaporeans are astounded by the fact that I speak Bengali and have parents born in Bangladesh who\'d be considered white-collar workers, and they scratch their head and wonder since when did non blue-collar workers who are Bangladeshi exist?

I\'m also low-key annoyed by most of the mosques having their Friday sermon in Malay other than, maybe in English.

One would have to work extra hard against their prejudice to be considered “one of the good ones”.

Recently there was a video of a truck driver being arrested by police - the commentary from the uncles taking the video was along the lines of “must be because of drugs since he’s Malay”. Even good stereotypes like Indians being good speakers can be easily twisted to become “They’re **only** good at talking, that’s why they are promoted quickly”. \n\nAll this seems like “not a big deal”, but these micro aggressions can build up over time and cause frustration and anger.

yaappyyap,nrcoop,[Uni] Journey of an EM3 student to NUS,2021-06-03 20:48:08,SGExams,77673,13,285,"**Shared my journey in NUS subreddit and was encouraged to post it here too. Such a pity I can't post in Singapore Subreddit.**

&#x200B;

Would I see myself where I am right now as an EM3 student in the past? Certainly not.

We are placed on a defined education track depending on our academic achievements in school. In the eyes of society, Express students are seen as ‘Smart’, Normal Academic (NA) as ‘Not bad’ and Normal Technical (NT) as ‘Cannot study’. Most EM3 students progressed to NT Stream in secondary school. If you performed well with stellar PSLE score, you may choose to go into the NA stream in certain secondary school. Express stream was out of the question for an EM3 student. With a PSLE score of 107, it wasn’t enough for me to go into NA stream. Hence I applied to one of the top secondary schools during the 2000s. Thankfully, my score was just one point above the minimum for the NT stream. My journey as a NT student began. I met amazing people in this school and I started to ‘wake up’ from my nonchalant approach towards education. I would say this is the pivotal moment in my education journey. Guess it is a blessing in disguise not going into the NA stream.

Most secondary school students moved on to Junior College and Polytechnic. However, as a NT student, the defined pathway is Institute of Technical Education (ITE). Polytechnic education was not something I even dreamed of. I would be lying if I didn’t feel demoralised, beaten and see myself as a failure in the education system. It didn’t help with the stigma on NT students and ITE. Naturally my self-worth diminished over time and I told myself to go with the flow and see how things pan out for me.

2008 was the pivotal period for me. For the same passion for football, I met a senior, 3 years older than me when I was in Secondary 2. He was from same secondary school in the Express stream, held leadership position and was embarking on his polytechnic education. We got along pretty well and hung out frequently over the next few years despite the stark differences in our education background and social economic status. Knowing that I will be entering ITE after my ‘N’ levels, he introduced me to his polytechnic classmate who was an EM3, NT and ITE student and made it to polytechnic. I was impressed and inspired to follow his footstep. This was the moment when I knew that polytechnic education was still possible for me.

At some point in 2008, my dad passed on after battling cancer for more than a decade. I questioned myself, ‘was my father ever proud of me when he was around?’. I could not think of any moment that would have made my father proud, none at all. I was mischievous during my primary school days, loitering around and education certainly wasn’t my priority at all. The timing was perfect for a change in outlook and my priorities. I was determined to do well in my studies, progress to ITE and moved on to polytechnic. This would be an achievement my father would love to witness if he were still around and hopefully he would be proud of me, for once.

I entered ITE with the goal to focus on my studies and progress to polytechnic. University at this point was not on my mind. 2 years later, I graduated with a Nitec with Merit and moved on to a polytechnic. Initially I was afraid I could not cope with the curriculum in polytechnic as the ‘O’ level cut off point was about 13 and required a good command of English language. I did not have any ‘O’ level credentials unlike most of my peers and the English syllabus in NT stream was definitely not as comprehensive compared to the Express stream. Fortunately, my first semester GPA was about 3.6 and I felt relieved and motivated. At the same time, I thought this is going pretty well and I continued to be driven to maintain the GPA, hopefully get a placement in a local university. During my time, the GPA cut off point for some university courses were about 3.6. Fast forward 3 years later, I graduated with a Merit and a GPA of about 3.7 and I was extremely delighted because it meant that I could apply for local university.

However, I applied to National University of Singapore (NUS) 3 times and failed all 3 attempts, during my polytechnic graduation year, 1st year in NS and ORD year. The cut off point for the university course was about 3.6 – 3.7 if I remember correctly and one of the requirements was a pass in ‘O’ Level English. I was clueless and pondered to myself, ‘could the rejection due to my lack of ‘O’ level credentials?’. I even thought of sitting for a ‘O’ level English exam in order to fulfil the requirement. I appealed and thankfully I was invited to a discretionary admission interview. I am glad that the interviewers had faith in me and were inspired by my resilience. I was eventually offered a place in the university. Now that I have unofficially graduated (With a second upper class), I guess it is worthwhile to look back on my education journey.

‘I believe you will make it to a local university. When you graduate, I will be there.’ – From my secondary school teacher as I was preparing for my ‘N’ Levels (NT) back in 2010. Such a simple encouragement but had so much meaning.

SlipInternational593,nwo4wj,Graduating later than others,2021-06-10 21:50:10,NTU,13643,10,53,"Hey guys, I just want to post this to vent out some of my feelings concerning my predicament. As the title suggests, I will be graduating later than others (28-29 ish) because of my mental health. As a result, I am feeling like I’m really behind others and derived of all the good things in life. On top of that, I actually desire to do my masters (maybe work a few years before gaining entry?) and all these circumstances have made me feel quite inferior about myself. The thing is I have a lot of dream I hope to pursue but factors such as mental health, age and stigma are big stumbling blocks. These send me into a deeper depression. 

I dunno if there are out there who are kind of in the same boat as me. But I just want to share it here so I can feel less alone. Hope you guys here don’t mind the negativity. Feel free to PM me if you know of anybody or you yourself who can relate.

chxrchxi,nrbs96,[uni] got rejected by 4 unis,2021-06-03 20:01:36,SGExams,77673,20,20,"hi, i finished my As last year and was going to enter uni this year, but my applications to nus, ntu, sit and sutd were all rejected. my uas is a sore topic that idw bring up but to put things into perspective, i got 60. i didn’t apply to smu and suss but with how early i got my rejection letters from the other 4 i can’t help but think i wouldn’t have stood a chance even if i did. i got a job immediately after results were released and it was honestly my excuse to escape the reality that my results were so shitty i probably can’t make it to a local uni. i guess i should have still tried for smu and suss, but the stress from work and from the pressure i put on myself for getting such bad grades made me very reluctant to get my applications done, so i only managed to send in 4, and didn’t properly look at smu or suss courses. i guess logically, if i did take a gap year, it would be best to research more and not procrastinate like i did this year and apply for the unis + smu and suss again? sadly while i was moping and holding onto false hope i missed the appeal deadlines which was 26 may, though i’m unsure whether appealing would have made a difference. 

i honestly want some advice because i’m not sure if i want to take a gap year, apply for an overseas uni, or go to poly. to me, they all have their disadvantages, but realistically i know i shouldn’t be picky, since my results don’t leave me with many choices. ideally, i would want to take a gap year, but because i was a repeat student in jc, i already struggle with the insecurity of being left behind by my peers. also i can’t guarantee i’ll get accepted next year, even if i get more experience in the field i wanna apply to. and that’s another problem. i’m interested in mass comms / media, but now i’m not sure whether i should continue on that path or try for a less competitive course. if anybody could give me some advice on that i’ll really appreciate it a lot.

if i don’t take a gap year, overseas unis are kinda expensive, plus i’m not keen on going overseas, regardless of the covid situation. i did consider going to poly, maybe try for exemption so it’ll be 2-2.5 years, though i’m not sure how my parents will react to that, when i’ve already spent 3 years in jc. i’ve seen some of the other posts and the comments are saying stuff like you’re still young so no need to worry about age, but while that may the case i guess i’m just overly paranoid on whether i will face the stigma of not being the same age as my classmates. if there’s anybody who’s been through this situation pls let me know too because idk why i keep having this deep seated fear within me that i won’t be accepted. 

i still do need advice on what to do, but i guess summarising it into this post made me feel a little better, because earlier i thoroughly felt like shit, and i kept feeling like i have no one to talk to about it, because all my friends are either in uni or have been offered. 

tldr; what steps should i take now that all my uni apps were rejected?

So depending on the courses that u choose and if u are able to do well in poly, u will not be that far off from others.

Miyukara,n4e4a8,Quitting Job of 2 Years Without A Job Due to Boss,2021-05-04 10:39:13,askSingapore,44637,55,101,"Hello everybody, have been thinking about leaving my job for the past year, will be finally doing it some time this week and I am looking to get some advice here on the subreddit.

I have been working at this organisation for close to 2 years now. The colleagues here are great and everything aside, I would say it is still a pretty stable job, while it is not a permanent one and the contract renews each year. The major problem would be my boss, who is somewhat of a control freak and their expectations have been weighing me down quite a bit over the past year. Periodically, I would have to play guessing games with my team leader on what they want in a certain task. The unsuspecting me would just follow their instructions as I do normally, and had accusations shot at me when things turned out different from their expectations.

I am not alone in getting accused as there have been other instances where I heard really nasty things that are about other people. Some of these people are no longer with us, some of them are higher ups.

Things were already pretty so-so when we were in office. It just got worse when CB and our semi-permanent WFH started. I would get phone calls, when I did not reply their e-mails for 20 to 30 minutes (at times it would be 10 minutes). Some of these e-mails were less crucial and it could be something I dealt with after finishing the task on hand. Once when I missed a call from them because I was working on something urgent and did not hear my phone vibrate, I received my first nagging session, and it went on even after I explained + apologized.

Another time I submitted a task late by a day (and really, it wasn’t late… it was still within the window they gave to me), I got a call where I got interrogated. The same thing happened – they were not listening to me, even after I explained. They continued going on about how they could finish this faster than I did.

My last straw would be how I’m made to list down specific details of my check-in/check-out time at work + the exact time I went out and come back from lunch + what I do in my day (e.g., reading the company bulletin e-mail.

Due to all the constant grilling, venting and narcissism, I admit that I have gone from very productive to “I don’t have the energy to do anything anymore”, because it does feel like they’re never really going to be fully satisfied with how I am. I do also have to ask them for permission before I can do anything and by that, I mean almost everything under the sun that is about work.

As much as I do want to land another offer before I quit job, I do realise that my mind isn’t really in the best place and I have been flunking my interviews. If I do leave my job without renewing my contract this year, I am looking to take a break to find myself while fully devoting myself into job search.

Another thing I feel unsettled about would be that I’m leaving close to a major event at work, but it means I will have to re-contract but break it off after this project ends, which I doubt looks good on my resume either. Though I did read on most online forums that they will learn how to get by without me and I should take care of myself more than anything else. 

With that, I am curious to hear from fellow Redditors (and also hopefully from those who have posted about similar issues before) on your experiences in leaving such environments and how is/was your job search after that. Do employers really have stigma on people who left organisations on their own accord without another job lined up?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/n4e4a8/quitting_job_of_2_years_without_a_job_due_to_boss/,"[""If you really don't like and cannot stand such boss, just quit.\n\nBut before you decide to throw in your towel, you need to consider these.\n\n1.

I actually told him I will resign and write him as the reason for leaving, he didn't believe me. I took my pending leave (38 days), came back from leave and resigned just before going for lunch and told him. He didn't believe me and didn't check his email ( he actually used to delete all emails from his team without reading them,told us all himself), I kept going to work but he got a call from HR after 2 days about my resignation, it's then that he realised I wasn't joking and came to ask me in front of the whole team making a fool of himself. He went on emergency leave the next day after emailing me with a copy to HR that I have to complete my notice period ( 2 months) but HR called next day followed by an email that I don't have to complete my notice period and just hand over the company assets ( laptop, cellphone, access card etc) and leave.

Finding a job can take a while, and I would save up to get to the point where I can live 6 months without worrying too much. Having this financial burden and rush to find a job can lower your chances of finding a job due to the stress (which motivates some people or completely obliterates others).\n\nOnce this is done, I would go right ahead and leave your job.\n\nWhilst looking for a job, it's always a good idea to try and:\n\n1) Up-skill (take courses in things that you're interested in and that you think will make you more employable) \n\n2) Starting a side-hustle/small business from home (I'm not sure if you have any skills but offering some small services on Fiverr or finding any other way to make a bit of money whilst waiting for the right opportunity is a good idea, that'll also make you more employable). \n\n3) It is also not a bad idea to take on a smaller, part-time job to help alleviate some financial burdens whilst you are still focusing on finding a proper, stable job.\n\nThe reason why I've mentioned these is because finding a job full-time can be a really tiring/annoying process, I wouldn't spend more than 5 hours a day on it (after that, my Cover Letters just become horrible and I'm not at all motivated to keep applying), as such, I think it's important to find other productive things to do.\n\nBefore applying, I'd go and seek help/advice from friends that work in the industry you're applying or in recruitment to look over your LinkedIn profile, your CVs and CLs templates, doing this before applying will save you a lot of time and stress. Feel free to reach out if you need another set of eyes to look over your CV or whatever.\n\nLastly, I think it's good to realise that leaving your job is the best thing you can do in the long-term, there are plenty of jobs out there that will inspire you to work and will be fulfilling, with amazing leaders, and I'm sure you'll find one :)\n\nI'm graduating in June and have been in the job market for a while but finally managed to get a nice job in London.

Of course in an ideal world, it would be better if you had another job lined up (in a more ideal world, there won't be bad bosses). However, since you already have enough savings built up and your current boss is affecting your ability to interview well for other jobs, quitting now is definitely a good option for you to consider."", 'OP, are you my ex-colleague? LOL. I just left an environment exactly like you described even though I hadn’t been there for long. \n\nAnyway, I’d just like to say that there is absolutely nothing wrong with quitting before you land another job. Especially since you mentioned that you haven’t been at your best during interviews due to stress from your situation, I think the best thing to do would be to take a break from work and interviews first. \n\nYou sound pretty burnt out and I’m so sorry for what you’ve had to go through. Please have a good rest before you go back to your hustle!\n\nAs for the stigma you brought up, I don’t think it’s that common anymore (or it really depends on your industry tbh). \n\nYou WILL find a place that wants you and appreciates you eventually.

As a hiring manager, it doesn’t bother me that you’ve left without a plan. However, I’d definitely ask what made you leave without a plan and assuming that’d be gaps in your job history (as you take time to do interviews), I’d also ask what you’ve been doing in your free time. The tricky thing is to explain your previous job situation without sounding petty or bitchy, sometimes your next employer will also call up for references. And to make sure you’re using your free time productively - eg taking courses, upgrading etc. Hope the above helps, all the best!', 'So sorry to hear about this. \n\nI’ve had exactly the same experience. I worked as a creative in a startup. My boss knows zero shit about design. My colleagues were fantastic. But my boss would breathe down our necks (eg threaten to reduce our leaves if we were late for meetings), make decisions purely based on his mood (eg approve this today, tomorrow see the same thing again and flip), knee jerk reactions to small comments (eg when I designed the new logo he loved it, then some friend of his said smthng minor and he doesn’t like it anymore and made me change it), send angry messages scolding my colleagues into the company chat on saturday midnight, tell me how to design without knowing anything about design and have extremely unrealistic expectations (eg expected high quality writing and photography content from student volunteers whom he didn’t even want to pay). The last straw was when he asked me to cancel my holiday (he approved it already) because some project (the one mainly done by unpaid student volunteers) didn’t go according to his unrealistic expectations and it wasn’t my fault at all. And there was another incident that was caused by him not making the leave policy clear from the start (it was a very young startup with no proper procedures).\n\nFrom the start of that job, I’ve already noticed a few red flags about him but I took the offer anyway because I didn’t have much choice and the job was honestly interesting. I already knew I can’t stay forever in that startup. I burnt out so fast because dealing with his temperament took most of my energy. To the point that I was angry and down everyday. And my old health issues resurfaced. I still bore with it for 2 years because I loved my colleagues. But I’ll tell you now that it’s not worth to stay on purely because of your colleagues. Colleagues will never be your close friends or loved ones. We kept in touch maybe for a few months after I left, but now they dont even text me to chat or catch up. One of them only texts when she needs something from me. Everyone’s busy with what’s in front of them. Why care about the person who isn’t there anymore. \n\nBy the way i wasn’t the only one who wanted to leave. Before me, someone left for pretty much the same reason. Another colleague was telling me how much she hates working for him and planned to leave but Covid came and she stayed on for the salary. During Covid, someone else left, seemed like he couldn’t take the stress.\n\nI left in early 2020 because I had another opportunity that wasn’t a job but still greatly beneficial. After taking a few months to finish that opp, I took teacher training as i was planning to upgrade myself to leave the country anyway. So I advice you to think of new skills you want to learn to maintain your competitiveness and prepare for the next door to open, while taking a break to enjoy doing what you love. If you’re Singaporean you can use skillsfuture so it won’t be a huge financial impact. It’ll look good on your resume too, so future employers won’t question about that gap too much. You can just say “I wanted to upgrade myself and explore new paths so I took time off to learn _____”\n\nI’m doing a part time job as part of my attempt to switch careers, now under another boss who isn’t great but at least she doesn’t expect a ton from me (cuz I’m\nnot experienced) and my contract is till July. I can bear with it because I dont need to see her everyday. My current position is tons better and I’m much happier than before although I’m not out of the country yet due to Covid. Not where I am yet but much much happier than before. Guess I dont have good luck with bosses but maybe thats because I keep ending up in startups where bosses just want to see results no matter what. I really hope you have better luck than me.

code8child,mybgcc,[Uni] Coronavirus disruptions and feeling lost,2021-04-26 00:12:22,SGExams,77673,36,35,"To start of, I was initially studying my first year in England until the pandemic broke out in the UK. I came back to Singapore immediately after finishing my first year. I was since forced to take a gap year and assumed that it would be safe me for to go back to England in September 2021. 

Currently, it seems like it is still almost impossible for me to return to England this September. (My family is worried about racism and factually it's just so much safer in SG than UK)

So I have been applying for local universities, hoping to enter the July/August 2021 batch. But so far... I've been rejected by 3 schools (NUS, SMU, SUSS) and my application is still processing for SIT... but I haven't gotten any shortlisted interview for it, and I am loosing hope.

I know private universities are a thing, but I was a Lasalle graduate and I absolutely hated their teaching methods there. NAFA recently changed their degree courses, turns out non of their courses are remotely relevant to what I want to do. To add on, my family members are successful graduates who all has strong stigmas for private schools like SIM, MDIS and Kaplan. So privately unis are out of considerations for me.

I feel so lost. I very much would like to return to my original path and complete my studies in the UK, but it is still not safe to do so and I know that I should stop thinking about it any further (P.S please do not tell me stories about how your family/friends/people you know who went back to the UK despite the pandemic. I'm so sorry if I sound rude, but I'm really sick of people giving me inputs that will only cause me even more dilemma. The fact is my family doesn't think it's safe for me to go back, and I'm not really in the position to argue with them.) Also, I am not allowed to request for another gap year, because it is according to the schools rules there that any student who needs to defer for more than one year will be automatically dropped out. So I'm about 99% sure I cannot go back to thr UK this year, nor in the near future. (Btw online studies are not a thing for UK)

Following this, I tried to fix my situation by searching for a different path, which is to attend a local university instead. But despite that, it seems like I don't stand much of a chance and I feel really disappointed in myself. I really thought that I would have at least had the chance to be shortlisted for an interview, but I have already been mostly rejected, just through my application itself.

And I cannot even bring up the idea of going to private universities because it is 1. Not relevant to what I want to do 2. My family finds that it is a shame on me

I thought I could just take another gap year and stay in SG while continueing to work, while also apply for local universities again. But I got into a huge fight with my family when I brought up this suggestion. My family is very insistent on me graduating a degree ASAP and will not accept anymore gap year. 

I'm frustrated. This entire situation isn't my fault. I never had wanted to leave UK. I never would have wanted to defer my studies. All the more I would never even have considered to drop out of my studies. But I'm placed in a situation, with little options. And even though I keep trying to find solutions to my problems, I still keep failing. I've come to a point where I feel so hopeless and so lonely. My situation is so long winded and weird that barely anyone understands how I feel.

I've started to seek professional help but I feel that as much as it helps me keep a better control of my emotions, my problems are still not being solved. I feel even more and more horrible as each day passes.

I'm sorry if I sound spoilt, irrational or dramatic. I'm not really here for advice, I really just wanted an output. I'm tired.",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mybgcc/uni_coronavirus_disruptions_and_feeling_lost/,"[""Sorry to hear about your situation - it must have been tough for you during this period of time.

Lasalle is notorious for giving their students low marks (as a result, borderline GPA), and I swear it isn't because the students there do badly, it's just school culture. Most Lasalle students take the private route all the way, so it is rarely a problem for most students there. I really do regret going to Lasalle. I was mentally prepared to go through some rough times when I chose to apply for local universities, but so far the process has been a lot more brutal then I expected haha. I am really sure my Lasalle certificate caused a huge impact on my application for local universities. \n\nAlso, yes I did talk it out with my family - I understand many people thinks that it is because I don't convey my worries to my family enough, but trust me I communicate with them everyday, but they still put in false expectations on me despite being aware of my circumstances. \n\nSo to answer your second question - Yes I did ask my family what they want me to do if all the local universities reject me. And you're about to hear something that's absolute bonkers.\n\nThey do not want me to work. They want me to keep studying. So if no local universities accept me, they want me to attend private universities, either NAFA or SIM.\n\nHOWEVER - I cannot end my education path with the private degree certificate. i MUST, keep trying to apply for local universities until I get accepted.

Your subsequent applications to local universities are much stronger.

I was doing okay in life till I had to drop out of Poly for a very bad mental health episode, and then took a diploma from LASALLE and then got stuck in a pretty traumatising work experience to the point where I just wanted to go back to studying to avoid working. 

I currently feel stuck worrying I can't get into a degree, and I realised I'd be graduating relatively late, with not much income earned throughout the years. With my mental health conditions I just find it really hard to get a full-time job I can feel safe and stable in, and I'm not sure what work I could do to support myself without getting quickly overwhelmed. I feel trapped knowing how much stigma there is against the conditions I have and not feeling like I can safely disclose them without losing an opportunity for work.

Right now I want to take time off to focus on therapy but I feel like I'm a waste of space to just be spending up to a year just in therapy to work on myself while I'm seeing my friends get employed and move on with their lives.

Zyeus,cgbisy,Stigma of PMD riders,2019-07-22 18:32:16,singapore,378760,39,0,"Let me start by introducing about myself. I am a student, and I work as a delivery rider for side income. My escooter is LTA compliant and registered. I follow traffic rules though I would occasionally cross the road when it's safe to do so despite the red light (and I assume most of you jaywalk too).

Anyway, I can't help but notice the prejudice against PMD riders. On here and in person itself. Most pedestrians would give me a dirty look even when I did nothing wrong. Wasn't speeding. Not blasting any music. Gave way. Yet they stare at me as if I'm doing something horrendous.

On here, it's like a bunch of you are just sadistic jerks. Wishing accidents, even death upon PMD riders to happen. How nice.

My point of ranting this is to ask for tolerance. Most of us use it as a source of income. Working a honest job. Sometimes we tend to run lights because we want to fulfil our incentives or increase our KPI. Some of us also fear getting scolded by the customers for being late. You only notice the bad riders because you want a reason to hate them. You would only think ""what a nuisance"" when you see a dangerous rider. You don't see a good rider and go ""such a safe rider"" do you? I understand, there are an awful lot of reckless riders on PMD's. But so are motorists and cyclists? To outright ban it is such a foolish idea. Let's look at statistics, shall we?

There were 590 cyclists related accidents in 2015. There were only 196 PMD related accidents in BOTH 2017 & 2018. Meaning there were 98 PMD related accidents in a year. Cyclists related accidents are 6 times higher than PMD's, yet we are all treated like shit even if you are a safe rider. 

This brings up my next point. The ban on escooter will cause most PMD riders to shift to bicycles instead. This in turn, creates an influx of cyclists and doesn't solve anything.

My suggestion to solve this issue is to either mandate all PMD riders to take driving lessons and allow them to ride on the roads. OR widen up pathways to ensure ample space for both pedestrians and cyclists / PMD's.

As of now, the main issue is that pathways are too narrow to walk on, let alone sharing it with cyclists and PMD's. Another thing is that people tend to walk in the middle of the path. When I sounded my horn, they became frustrated and annoyed. One old man even scolded me and told me he hoped I get hit by a car.

We are stuck in a limbo. Pedestrians feel entitled to walk on the pathways, thus they don't feel a need and actually find it irritating to give way to cyclists / PMD's. Drivers find us a nuisance and a burden on the road.

It upsets me that some Singaporeans are this way and not as tolerant as I thought they were. I hope you can understand the predicament we're in and let's share the path for now until the government has a solution.

The pedestrian walkways were built with walking people in mind, who could sidestep or stop immediately if a collision is imminent. Even Joggers or Runners could sidestep without causing many issues. PMDs and Bicycles cannot. They behave like vehicles and should be treated like one. They should be on the road where the roads are designed with vehicles in mind, catering for higher speed.\n\nAdd to that the dangers of having vehicles on pedestrian walkways where children, elderlies and handicapped individuals are walking just makes it a very very bad idea.', 'It’s not entitlement, pedestrian has the legit right of the way to walk on the footpaths.

bit of bg story: been sh-ing for 5 years now, suspected depression (was never diagnosed), no major traumatic events happened in my life so i don’t exactly have one root cause to all of this, just some events here and there that built up over the years i guess. i have trouble sleeping, when i do sleep i occasionally get nightmares that cause me to wake up sweating slightly. i either sleep too much/too little, but either way i still feel tired throughout the day. i feel like i’m worthless and don’t really think it matters if i’m alive or not. i have poor appetite. i’m “fine” through the day, but at night or anytime i’m alone, sometimes i just break down for no reason and i think about how meaningless my life is and everything hurts and i get the urge to sh bc the physical pain takes away the emotional pain sort of thing? i have no motivation to do anything. i feel that nothing makes me happy, if anything, only distracted. and then over time it builds up and i break down all at once randomly. have had multiple serious suicidal thoughts through the years 

the reason i haven’t gotten any help all these years is because 
1. as mentioned i don’t have any major traumatic events that happened, so i keep thinking maybe my case isn’t big enough to be worthy of help? like if i go for therapy i don’t have specific root causes to give them? or maybe i’m just over complicating my situation when it’s really not that bad? 
2. i can’t let my parents know, we don’t have a terrible rs but they have strong stigma against mental health and it’s just really not a good idea. therefore i didn’t know how to afford it or do it under the radar. but now i think i have sufficient money of my own and i’m old enough (above 18) to afford to go through the subsidised imh route, so i’m really considering going for it but i’m not sure. 

so if anyone can tell me how the process is like and the fees of everything (including meds) please do :) 
and if you could let me know if you think my case is you know, big enough? to be worthy(?) of getting help

I read a post few days prior that getting officially diagnosed with depression will affect you getting insurance coverage , even after getting cleared/cured from it after x number of years.

Personally, I think you can try this service, CHAT, who can give you some advice on where you can go if you do not want to go to IMH just yet. So you can the counselling help that you need, and talk it out. Though it might not be enough because there could be a chemical imbalance in your brain, then maybe you\'d need to see a psychiatrist, even so it\'ll still be a tough journey to  recovery. \n\nbut I think the most important part is to take the first step.

Normally they will ask you to come back after you finish your course of medicine.\n\nAs for the psychologist, you cant choose your psychologist, but I had a really good one, who helped me through just about everything, I remember as a subsidised patient it was 50 dollars per hour session. I am very grateful for her :)"", ""I first asked for a referral to IMH because I'm on some psych meds prescribe from my psychiatrist when I was overseas.

For example, if you go to geylang polyclinic, they might refer you to Geylang community wellness clinic. However, if you go to another polyclinic somewhere in the central like toa payoh polyclinic, you will probably be referred to IMH directly. It kinda depends on proximity to the nearest psych clinic and how big the psych department is. It gets kinda confusing but imh has the largest cluster of psychiatrists and psychosis which is why most polyclinics refer patients to IMH\n\nOverall, I would say that you don't have to be afraid of IMH and the stigma. It's mostly because of stigma that people are afraid of IMH."", 'I think you should ask the polyclinic what are their options for referrals.', 'thanks! i’ve put in my contact details for CHAT already and i’ll see how it goes from here.', 'All the best.

I'm a **Year 3 NUS Nursing student,** and I'm here to share **everything you need to know about the course and the school!** I can understand how daunting it can be - especially since you’re signing up for a specialized course / professional degree where you know exactly what you’ll be at the end - **a nurse.**

I just wanna say that contrary to whatever stigma we may have been led to believe: *nursing is an incredible profession.* We managed to bring my dad home from the hospital to spend his last few days at home, despite all the medications and machines he needed, [all because of the things I learnt in nursing.](https://www.todayonline.com/gen-y-speaks/gen-y-speaks-through-tears-i-used-my-nursing-skills-give-end-life-care-my-dad-home) I owe it all to everything I learnt in this profession.

Initially I didn't really wanna be known - posting anonymously every year. But since I'm not doing anything bad, there's no harm introducing myself now right! Hi y'allz my name is Paula, and I'm the author of [ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING 2.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f8pvec/uni_all_about_nus_nursing_20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3), 1.0, and [this personal post.](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lnf4ij/uni_a_levels_hey_you_you_are_more_than_your_grades/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) Every year, I only use reddit to post that super long NUS Nursing factsheet :p

This year I wanted to change it up a little. I know some people are more auditory/visual learners, and I am a little tired of typing. So instead of doing another SUPER long post, I did a series of videos instead! They are split into 5 parts, namely:

1. [NUS Nursing **Curriculum:** Lectures, Lessons, and is it hard?](https://youtu.be/F10-23u_HBo)

I'm also going live on the [NUS Nursing IG](https://instagram.com/nus_nursing) and [**my own**](https://instagram.com/nursesays) account on 6 March 2021, 2pm onwards.

If you prefer words, you may read my **ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING 2.0** **post, which I copy-pasted below.** I also shared more about nursing in general in that post (towards the end, section 4), which may not be in the videos. But the **vids are packed with the most updated information** about NUS Nursing itself + many tips from me :) so I think check out both hehe.

**\*Disclaimer:** Contents of this post and the vids are **based on my own personal experiences.** For those asking, nope I am not part of the NUS Nursing ""student council"" nor am I paid to do this. **I do this willingly, on my own accord.** I just like to provide some insights and information every year during the admissions season, because I know how confusing this period is for most people, especially those who aren't sure what course to pick. That's what nursing is about too - helping without expecting anything in return :)

See you guys on 6th of March! Get your vaccines when offered, ya!

Edit:
It’s not my intention to romanticize nursing, because as amazing as it is, I can’t even begin to explain the shotcomings that the society (and many other stakeholders) has towards this profession. Going through clinicals, even as a student, you see how under-appreciated, taken for granted, and abused nurses are. Some days after clinicals I rant to my friends and have a whole existential crisis why I’m in nursing, and if it’s all worth it after a day of being scolded by patients, family members, and dealing with a lot of undesirable bodily fluids and materials 🙃🙃

That’s why I ABSOLUTELY DETEST when I see people posting things like “i got a low rp, should I go for nursing?” or others suggesting to apply for (whatever school) nursing just because someone got a bad grade. Nursing is not supposed to be a “dustbin” course where people go to if you scored badly and you don’t know what you wanna do with your life. There may be some fortunate people who develop genuine passion for the course despite that less than ideal start in nursing, yes. But unfortunately, more often than not, these people who said “screw it I just wanna go into uni just gonna put nursing” end up dropping out of the course or leaving the profession prematurely upon graduation.

Don’t waste those years, guys. Retake As or go to a private uni and pursue something you’re truly interested and/or passionate in :( I also wanna say that even though the IGP is relatively low, that doesn’t mean that the course is easy.

# ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING 2.0

# 1 Curriculum

# 1.1 NUS Nursing

# Curriculum overview

Generally, the first 2 years we focus on learning the different body systems, how they function (Anatomy \&amp; Physiology) and dysfunction (Pathophysiology), coupled with each condition’s nursing management and hands-on skills. Interesting modules will also be taught such as communicating effectively and being culturally sensitive in the clinical setting, basic psychology for nurses, mental health nursing, and even ethics and law. The 3rd (and final year for most) will focus more on gearing us for eventual practice in the clinical setting with modules tackling leadership and community health. Finally, we will embark on a 3-month final clinical placement to emulate the real pace and nature of work, ensuring that we are competent to practice as registered nurses upon completion.

For people who can and choose to finish with an Honours degree, they embark on a year-long research project usually in their area of interest. Faculty staff members and hospital staff will act as mentors for these projects. Some examples of research projects can be found here: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf)

***Difference between honors and without honors:***

* Basic monthly starting pay for some hospitals are different, may vary from $50-100 according the the annual graduate employment survey here: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)
* Some overseas masters/PhD programmes require either an honours degree (directly)  or a normal bachelor’s degree with at least a few years of clinical experience
* Some hospitals/employers may view an honours degree more favourably in terms of salary and/or career progression

Complete information here on the NUS Nursing website, subject to changes every year: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/)

# Day-to-day lessons

Fun! We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins that can breathe and have pulses etc. We also have these people called standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills. They act like real patients with real symptoms and real family issues!

# Lectures and tutorials

Some lectures are video lectures - can watch at home at the pace you want! School is only around 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs. But of course, there are e-lectures to watch and tutorials to do and textbooks to read, so it’s not like you won’t have to do much studying outside those 2-4hrs/day. But if you manage your time well, it’s alright!

# For those worried about having no bio background:

There are people in Nursing who haven’t done bio since sec 1/2, and from poly who did non-science courses such as international business or mass communication.

The kind of bio that we learn is different from H2 Bio. H2 Bio deals with the very minute things like oxidative phosphorylation and ETC and Krebs cycle and all its small molecules. However, we deal with humans here. Human anatomy and physiology, the human body and how it dysfunctions. The anatomy and physiology mods are pretty similar to secondary school bio - you learn about the heart and how the blood flows in general, as well as how it dysfunctions. However, we don’t delve too deep into the molecules at all - that’s for the medical students to do. Yes, there will be a LOT of medical terms, and you have to be ready for that if you join nursing or any healthcare-related field, honestly. It’s hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will come naturally :)

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn’t delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries.

# For those scared of blood

During nursing school: We have cadaveric sessions - this means that you get to see real, preserved human bodies and you are required to touch and observe them, texture and all, during those anatomy sessions. They don’t look like normal fresh organs anymore - you can search some “science cadavers” to see what they look like! As for blood, generally you have to be alright with the sight of it as your first lab session will already have a finger-prick glucose test that you do on your friend (and vice versa). During clinicals, you will be exposed to wounds that may be huge and bleeding, etc, so you have to be okay with it. I do have some friends who enter nursing and medicine who are afraid of blood and needles and things like that - you can get used to it, through repeated exposure.

As a real nurse: You have to be alright with these sights as there of course may be some instances where the patient vomits blood/starts bleeding from somewhere and you have to manage the patient. If you are scared of blood and get posted to the operating theatre as an OT nurse, then you will be assisting doctors in surgeries where you WILL see these. I suggest you try to watch some youtube videos to see if you can take it. Do know that you can get used to it!! Bottomline is, you can’t be afraid of your own job.

# Lecturers/tutors

All teaching staff in ALCNS are previously doctors, nurses or pharmacists (for pharmacology). Usually, our heavily science-based modules are taught by previous doctors (eg: anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology), whereas more nursing-based modules are taught by previous or current nurses. This honestly helps a lot as our lecturers and tutors have had vast experiences in the clinical world, and therefore better able to relate what they teach with the clinical setting.

# Clinical placements

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards). But you will be reimbursed (paid) for the whole duration of placements!

# 1.2 Nursing degree vs diploma (polytechnic)

Main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around $800-1000 monthly, depending on the hospital (based on this [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278) and this [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)). You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last year, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about $3100-3300 a month on average (just refer to the MOE website above).

# 2. NUS Nursing student life opportunities

# 2.1 Unrestricted Electives

You are required/allowed to take a minimum of 2 (for bachelor’s degree) or 3 (for honours degree) unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the nursing curriculum.

# 2.2 Local and Overseas Community Involvement Programmes

The Faculty of Medicine (Medicine and Nursing) has a lot of student-initiated CIPs both locally and overseas. You can join many things, from conducting free basic health checks in the neighbourhood, to volunteering with patients with dementia at a community hospital, to teaching basic first aid and english lessons to kids overseas - there’s really a lot of opportunities for us to give back to the community. Furthermore, you get to work with the medical students too as most of these projects are jointly planned and executed by both nursing and medicine students.

# 2.3 Student Leadership Opportunities

Similar to “student council” in secondary/JC, you can join the Nursing Subclub, Mednurse Club or SNASC to champion your peers’ causes and hopefully make a difference in their lives and in the profession of nursing. Other leadership opportunities include but not limited to: leading CIPs, organizing freshmen orientation, nurses’ day etc..

# 2.4 Exchange Programmes

ALCNS partners with several universities in different countries worldwide for student exchange programmes. Some countries include: Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia, Korea, etc. The exchange programmes may occur during school time or vacation time, and usually lasts 1-4 weeks. Selection process is through application and is based on the student’s own merit (academic and portfolio, contribution to the school).

# 3 Admission Information

# 3.1 Indicative Grade Profiles

# A Levels 2019

10th percentile: CCD/B

90th percentile: AAA/A

# Polytechnic GPA 2019

10th percentile: 3.33/4.0

90th percentile: 3.86/4.0

# 3.2 Admission Interviews

Not for everyone. Usually only done for people with rp near the cut-off point, to prove that you are not joining nursing purely because you can’t apply to any other course with your grades. This will weed out people who have absolutely no idea about nor passion for nursing. There are people who get in with lower rp than the IGP, but please put Nursing as 1st choice as that is a factor too. The format is somewhat like a panel interview, with 1 or 2 faculty members as your interviewers. 15-30min each.

# Tips

Be prepared but do not memorize a script. Just think through the usual interview questions and some of these additional questions below. I came up with this questions, it is in no way supposed to be representative of what the school will definitely ask. This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: Why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: What have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks and where you intend to go.

# 3.3 Scholarships

There are 2 kinds of “scholarships” - one is called MOH Scholarship and the other is called hospital sponsorship. The differences are below. There are also available financial help from NUS and ALCNS itself. Please refer to the NUS/ALCNS website for more information.

# MOH Scholarship

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (given in 6-monthly basis)
* PROS: money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get (requires excellent A Level grades (usually \&gt;85 rp from what I heard) and \&gt;4.0/5.0 CAP for mid-term scholarship.

# Hospital Sponsorships

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates want to work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, easier to get.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else, just monthly allowance

You don’t need to decide whether you want to take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they want to get sponsored by.

# 4 Nature of Work

# 4.1 Job Scope

As for job scope, you go in as SN I as mentioned earlier, which is more senior than SN II, Enrolled Nurses, healthcare attendants, etc. The implication is that you will be usually the main person in charge of a cubicle, for example, with around 4-8 patients at any given time, updating the family members, doctors, other healthcare professionals.

# DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?

I love this question about the stigma hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers MAY not be done (or not usually done) by staff nurses - it is usually done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses.

Staff nurses’ \*main\* roles are as follows:

1. Dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr’s orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are THE EYES. IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. Side effects of medications. Psychological state. Family/patient concerns. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: “nurse! Why does my father have an IV drip???” - have to explain that it’s because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

Sometimes SNs may get assigned (or just do) the “cleaning” duties due to reasons such as understaffing or skin integrity assessment. That’s honestly good, to remain competent with basic nursing care of the patients such as helping with activities of daily living (bathing, toileting, etc).

# 4.2 Salary

Nursing is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market. 

As mentioned earlier, refer here: 

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)

# 4.3 Career progression

There are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor’s degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take an advanced diploma or master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. 

They are: management, clinical and education tracks. 

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff problems etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like “mini doctors”. If you don’t know, some clinics in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds (must take extra course) without doctors. The only thing they cannot do will be surgery. 

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach. 

Occasionally, some people do clinical and education for example, this is called joint appointments. So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

\&amp;#x200B;

# 5 Other common questions

# 5.1 Medicine vs nursing

**Know that: doctors cure, nurses care.** So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer for theory: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics, good enough to catch mistakes but not deep enough to the point that we are able to treat diseases with multiple complications for example!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look at the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children? What will the side effects of the meds/surgery be? Will he be able to cope?

So ask yourself, which role do you want to play?

# 5.2 Why NOT nursing?

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there’s anything that made me want to turn away from Nursing. From my convos with many nurses in the wards, it’s mostly these:

1. You will inevitably get attached to some pts, especially if you work as a community hospital nurse where pts there stay for 3 months or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)
3. Nursing is an extremely tiring job, physically and emotionally. Be prepared to work long hours with limited time for your own needs such as food or even simply toileting. While it is my intention to elevate the profession of nursing by addressing stigmas, I do not intend to over glorify the profession and give everyone the false hope that nursing is very fun and easy. It takes real guts and strength to be a nurse, and you should only join if you think you are up for the challenge to learn and push yourself.

# 5.3 Overseas nursing

I think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, are trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a fresh grad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.

There’s also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I’m not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fast food meal in the US can easily cost $15. 

I think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes, you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues.

Bottomline is, it’s up to you, and what is the most important for you :)

# 5.4 Dealing with deaths as a nurse

I haven’t personally experienced it as a nurse as I haven’t been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals.

1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.
2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it’s a death after all, I know that she’s in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.
3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it’s your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It’s alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.

I am from Malaysia and I just received a scholarship to study NYP nursing followed by NUS nursing degree. (With bond to a public hospital in SG for 6-8 years). I am excited to read nursing 3.0 (have read 1.0 and 2.0 in the past ) and I'm even more excited to come to Singapore to study! I can't believe I actually won a full ride. Now, I get to study something I would really love. Thank you so much for all of your posts and for always explaining things so well. I thought you'd like to know that you also have an international reader here too ><"", ""hello, i would like to first show my appreciation for these posts and your constant engagement with potential and future nurses! with this, i would like to add my two cents as someone who views nursing with a different lens: a tired, burnt out nursing student who loves nursing, as a registered nurse from poly and currently in sit. this is not to say that paula's viewpoint is wrong, but it is just to show that even within nurses, our motivations and styles differ as well. \n\n‘That’s what nursing is about too - helping without expecting anything in return :)’ - this is why i mentioned even within nurses, our motivations can differ. i urge those who are considering to not let this statement weigh too heavily in your heart. if someone told me this when i was making my choice to enter nursing, i wouldn’t have. nursing is so taxing, and humans are inherently selfish. this is an idealistic view i wish i had, but realistically had to give up. the kicker is in the 'anything' - is it materialistic needs? or emotional expectations? i learnt quickly i needed to set boundaries in this profession in order to protect myself and my patients. \n\nto further our profession, we have to fight for materialistic things to better support ourselves \\[higher pay, more benefits (tangible or not), higher education, laws to protect us\\]. without these, nurses who love the job will leave with hatred in our hearts, and no one to fill these gaps. when covid first broke out and there was a online discord regarding temporary swabber pay vs nurses pay - was it really wrong for the nurse to voice out their unhappiness in the truth of the situation - which is that their pay was really lacking? we sucked it up due to logistics, economics, but our silence shouldn’t be taken for granted (and it hopefully wasn’t, as per 2021 budget). i completely agree on your point that nurses have a good starting pay (especially from uni, hence i am in uni now), but the pay ceiling can be quite disappointing as well. our lack of autonomy can be quite disappointing in the international landscape - if we don’t expect and push for improvements, will anything ever change? apns only recently gained more autonomy - a move that is likely influenced by nurses who had expectations to be bigger than they are now.\n\nis it wrong to have expectations of others to be a decent human, for them to offer a word of thanks for your hard work? i don’t think so, but we just gradually let this “basic manners”, which our parents taught us, go because they are sick and suffering. it’s on the nurse to manage such expectations, but to the budding nurse: don’t think that just because you’re not altruistic, you’re not selfless, you can’t be a nurse, or that you’re not worthy of being one.\n\nok now that i’m done addressing the above point, other things i would like to add on!!\n\n**career progression**\n\nclinical - nurses in the clinical track don’t always end up as an APN and many are ok with that! as a nurse who is in the clinical track but not an APN, you will be consulted on procedures not common to the generalist nurse - eg. u are an oncology (cancer) trained nurse, and a medical-surgery trained nurse have a patient with a port for chemotherapy. oh no! how do i maintain this port until he can get transferred to the appropriate ward? call the onco nurse! \n\neducation - nurse educators are also in hospitals to provide in house training for student nurses and nurses. you will be trained in education and can help design the in-house curriculums. \n\n**up and coming tracks**\n\nresearch - nurse researchers!! nowadays basic research are taught in our curriculums, for those who want to specialise in this field, would eventually be part of the nursing research department who will find and evaluate new care processes and methods. \n\ninformatics - super duper new kid in the block, but nurses in informatics manage medical equipment and everything related to the electronic records and applications. however, still has much room for development in terms of job scope. \n\n**why not nursing**\n\nnursing school is tiring guys.\n\nseriously though, don't get me wrong, all courses are taxing in their own ways. but for those who aren’t passionate in this course or motivated enough to get through it, you might really not get through it.\n\nthere were many drop outs back in poly. as someone who wanted to be a nurse, i had a drop out form in my laptop at all times to get me through. it made my mental health issues surface and worsen. \n\n**but i still love nursing**\n\n...and majority of us graduated with our blue cards (license to practice). for those who want to be nurses, get ready for a good ass whooping (not literally, don't worry - but i’m thinking it’s a different kind of hell compared to As, not sure if people from JCs in nursing now would agree with me) but you'll come out of it a better person, loving it more and more anyway. after all, there are many hardships, but there are also many happy moments, and these are the moments we live by."", 'Thank you for this post! i have been following since 0.1 and it really helped alot. \nHowever i have a question and it really have been making me sit on a fence for very long.\n \nSIT or NUS nursing?\nIm not really sure of their differences but i heard that SIT doesnt repeat what u study in poly hence it is only a 2 year degree however NUS is a 4years where they teach u the basics again.

I agree with all your points wholeheartedly, though I didn’t include those in my post cuz it’s all about nus nursing and not nursing in general hehe 🙏🏻\n\nIt’s not my intention to romanticize nursing, because as amazing as it is, I can’t even begin to explain the shotcomings that the society (and many other stakeholders) has towards this profession. Going through clinicals, even as a student, you see how under-appreciated, taken for granted, and abused nurses are. Some days after clinicals I rant to my friends and have a whole existential crisis why I’m in nursing, and if it’s all worth it after a day of being scolded by patients, family members, and dealing with a lot of undesirable bodily fluids and materials 🙃🙃\n\nAnd omg yes. I was also one of the very vocal ones about the whole nursing vs swabbers pay. Elrgh.\n\nThat’s why I ABSOLUTELY DETEST when I see people posting things like “i got a low rp, should I go for nursing?” or others suggesting to apply for (whatever school) nursing just because someone got a bad grade. Nursing is not supposed to be a “dustbin” course where people go to if you scored badly and you don’t know what you wanna do with your life. There may be some fortunate people who develop genuine passion for the course despite that less than ideal start in nursing, yes. But unfortunately, more often than not, these people who said “screw it I just wanna go into uni just gonna put nursing” end up dropping out of the course or leaving the profession prematurely upon graduation.\n\nDon’t waste those years, guys. Retake As or go to a private uni and pursue something you’re truly interested and/or passionate in :( I also wanna say that even though the IGP is relatively low, that doesn’t mean that the course is easy.\n\nAnyway thank you for this!

TheStateOfIt,l1pxv6,One thing worth discussing with recent Covid-19 community cases: Working while sick,2021-01-21 11:26:53,singapore,378760,67,258,"So, I bet all of y'all have seen the news of [recent Covid-19 cases](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/covid-19-cases-jan-20-4-community-bs-industrial-cluster-13999170), namely how it spread through workers that attended work despite having a few symptoms of Covid-19 without realizing they carried the disease, leading ministers to urge Singaporeans to *not hesitate* seeing a doctor if they fall ill.

However, this raises another issue, one that I don't see addressed a lot: **Why DO we hesitate to see a doctor when we fall sick?**

Think about it. How many of you have showed up to school/work with a headache or fever before 2020? How many NSF's // Uniformed personnel here are afraid of being labelled a '*chao keng*' when we need to visit the doctor/get an MC?

It definitely feels like a thing in Singapore where falling sick is a sign of weakness, or at the very least there's a stigma behind it. If we fall sick, be it through our own fault or not, we're afraid to fall behind. I've attended school with mild symptoms a few times in the past because, academics-wise, I'd miss out on a key lesson or need to hand in a key assignment, and though I'm not in the working world just yet, I suppose it's the same situation with deadlines, attendance requirements, and pay situations in working environments.

This entire culture, I feel, is systemic in Singapore. It goes against what we've prioritized in our national narrative, which is expanding our capacity to work to increase productivity. This results in inequal effects down the social/working/military hierarchy, where those that fall sick often are seen as disposable and replaceable because they are incapable of *working* to a certain standard expected of them. Through no fault of their own, they're at greater risk of being replaced/ignored/left behind because they fall sick, and falling sick also carries a *stigma* of being weak and slackish in a world where we're expected to be strong and hardworking to succeed.

So it's a new age, right? It's been a year, we should have changed and started reporting sick all the time, right? Well...no. In this crisis, we've stuck to old systems of hardworking and definitions of success. And just imagine if you step into the police para-vetenarian's shoes, the one that 'started' all these cases. Imagine being under pressure to perform your job with expectations from those higher up in the hierarchy. Imagine the surrounding stigma for falling sick, and the key work you'd miss if you take an MC. And that's just one person in this web. Imagine the pressures other people are facing. And some have resorted to labelling their cases and pointing blame, which is sad to see without understanding where they are coming from.

**It's been a norm for a long time, to work while sick.** To keep to deadlines, to avoid work piling on after we're better, to avoid getting fired/getting a bad grade/mocked by peers and higher-ups. To expect us to get back to norms of work and life means this norm also creeps back in. We can't expect to recover without questioning the norms that introduce danger in our lives, and addressing the systems that drive these norms.

So, let's not point fingers at those that have worked while sick, and thus inadvertently reintroduced Covid-19 to Singapore. Instead, let's listen to them, and question why these situations even exist, and what we can do to change that. Otherwise, I doubt we'd ever get back to normal. 

And if we do, a normal where we're expected (or even celebrated) to work while sick *should not* be the normal we aspire for our future.

**TL;DR:** It's been normal for a long time to work while sick, and it's not our fault. Don't blame current Covid spreaders, and question why it's normal in the first place.",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/l1pxv6/one_thing_worth_discussing_with_recent_covid19/,"['For 4/5 of my previous jobs, my superiors went to work sick with a flu, sore throat, cough, fever etc. They claimed to be hardworking and dedicated to work, and said that the workplace couldnt operate without them.\n\nThen, when you fall sick and take an MC (which typically happens a few days after they fall sick because they spread it to you), they would tell you that they didnt even take MCs when they were so so sick, but how dare, a weakling like you not be dedicated to your job enough?

You only have a certain number of paid sick leave days available a year (as if people can control how long they fall sick for, how this is even a thing is beyond me).

drollawake,l8ibmm,MOE's policy on gender presentation: recalling the female students who went bald for charity,2021-01-30 17:45:33,singapore,378760,31,350,"In light of the upcoming parliamentary discussion on MOE's policy on gender dysphoria, I was reminded of another incident which tested school policy on gender presentation.

In 2013, participants in the Hair for Hope fundraiser shaved their heads to raise awareness for and show solidarity with children who had cancer. Among these participants were 5 female students from St Margaret's Secondary School who were told to put on wigs to adhere to school policy of not having ""punk, unfeminine and sloppy"" hairstyles. Other schools, however, had no problem with letting their students stay bald. All 5 girls had promised to put on wigs but 3 nonetheless showed up bald in school. Less than a week after it made the news, the school relented and allowed all 5 girls to go wigless.

What's relevant about this incident is that:

1. The school allowed health concerns to override the rules. 2 of the 3 girls were allowed to forego the wig wearing because of doctor's notes about the rash they would get from wearing wigs. 

2. The school recognized that going bald would not disrupt the school environment because it was not a frivolous act but a brave one that required great commitment. It went from the principal saying ""Can you imagine if I were to say yes, I'd have everybody coming to school with a bald head. Sometimes it's a fad, so they would take advantage of the situation."" to the then Education Minister HSK commenting that ""It is not easy for a teenage girl to shave her head - I fully appreciate and applaud the commitment it shows."" 

3. One of the parents disapproved of the girls going wigless. He said that ""whatever the girls have agreed, they have to abide by,"" referring to the promise they made to wear the wigs. Nevertheless, the school did not fall back on the excuse of lacking parental consent for not permitting that student from staying bald. (She was allowed due to the doctor's note.)

Here are the parallels I see with the gender dysphoria case: 

Taking the doctor's advice trumped school policy on gender presentation. Allowing the student to transition also isn't a loophole that would disrupt the school environment because of others easily joining in. Not only would transitioning openly in school expose the student to the stigma of being transgender, access to hormone replacement therapy for gender dysphoria through our healthcare system also requires going through the hoops of psychiatric evaluation. Finally, unlike the Hair for Hope incident, Ashlee obtained consent from both parents for starting transitioning, including HRT, which already requires both parents' consent for patients below 21.",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/l8ibmm/moes_policy_on_gender_presentation_recalling_the/,"[""For posts flaired as such (by OP), we will be exercising greater moderation in the comments section against joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion.

One would have to note the context of the 5 girls having shaved heads. It was not to be punk or unfeminine but a show of support for a good cause. \n\nFrom what I can tell about the rest of the post, I notice there\'s an inconsistency where health concerns can be overridden if at the school level they decide its inappropriate and clashes with their personal take on the issue.', ""Pre-2000: secondary guy shaved head, kena sent home\n2013: girls shaved hair need doctor's letter to go to school\n2021: guy hair too long, kena sent home\n\nSia la MOE, what u want?"", ""So is MOE is going to fight parents now?

You can be transgender, but you are required to keep *diam diam* and don\'t kick up a fuss.\n\nFor Ashlee, it is pretty obvious they accepted her gender but felt that her transitioning qualifies as kicking up a fuss.

kenpang,lwn3dc,"[A levels] For those in low-middle tier JCs, you have every opportunity to do as well.",2021-03-03 14:23:40,SGExams,77673,10,92,"I am writing this post in response to a post that I read from u/myfatherisconfucius, a fellow J1 student in a lower-tier JC. I myself am not foreign to the stigma that comes from being in a low tier JC, and was previously from IJC (i.e the worst JC in Singapore), before it merged to become YIJC today. As IJ-ians, wearing the school uniform itself with the school logo sometimes pre-occupy our minds, fearing that we would be deemed as an 'inferior' or 'cannot make it' try hard Alevel student.

And while I cannot change what the rest of society labels students like me and you, i hope this post keeps whatever little spark is left in you to fight for what you want at the A'levels. Whether being in the current JC was a choice or the lack of it, know that no one and nothing can stop you, *only* yourself. I am currently a graduate from NUS mathematics, a course where I rival peers from elite JCs like HCI and RJC. And I hope that while the road ahead can seem like the odds are stacked against you, *hardwork and grit* will compensate for whatever disadvantage you may have started out with originally.

Of course, it's not all pep talk. I understand that some J1s in low-middle tier JCs feel that their materials furnished by their schools are ineffective or unhelpful, and fear asking their peers for how to improve for fear of being rejected or 'looked down'. Here is some advise that I would like to dispense that hopefully you can use, to add to your arsenal of weapons to fight the battle towards Alevels:

1. Try to get your hands on this book ""A'level complete H2 Maths Guide"" by Lois Chee for both Statistics (green cover) and Pure Math (yellow cover) ([https://www.carousell.sg/p/a-level-complete-h2-maths-guide-by-lois-chee-198091241/](https://www.carousell.sg/p/a-level-complete-h2-maths-guide-by-lois-chee-198091241/))

\*however what I must caution you, the above book is effective if what you are aiming for is a comfortable learning pace to getting a B/C at the Alevels. The guide book above is structured in such a way where it gives you the *Formulaes, Questions that are tested surrounding those formulas and practices.* This is effective in helping you route learn the formulas. If however, you are not a student willing to settle for an easy B/C, it is crucial that you first ***understand*** how and where these formulas came from. Without this, should Cambridge morph the questions into killer questions, route learning would serve as no benefit, and only those with strong fundamental understanding will triumph. And that is how the A students are distinguished from the average.

For most students in JC, it will dawn upon you that most of your peers are getting extra help from JC tuition in the hopes of boosting and securing the chances of success at the Alevels. And you will ask, ""do I really need a JC tuition teacher too?"". The answer to this depends only on what you want at the final hurdle: the Alevels.

What a JC tuition teacher does for you is break down the concepts, to bite sized understandable pieces of information that you can make sense of. In otherwords, a competent math tuition teacher will be able to translate the foreign language of math into *your* language. Only by gaining a strong grip on every concept, to the point of strong mastery, can you guarantee a sure A at the A'levels.

I hope this tip helps and encourages Alevel students across all JCs and backgrounds! If you want something, nothing can stop you in your tracks. Feel free to DM me for more advise on how you can improve your chances at the Alevels.",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lwn3dc/a_levels_for_those_in_lowmiddle_tier_jcs_you_have/,"['The books are blue for pure maths, and red for stats now.\n\nAnd yes the above mentioned books is not a easy read, but it breaks down each concept down well and in a structured manner.\n\nJiayous!', 'my cousin was in IJC too ! i think she did mathematical sciences at NUS as well :) thankyou for sharing your story with us ☺️', 'Untrue.

razxchrome,kvf5m4,"[O-Levels] Congratulations, those who received their results today.",2021-01-12 07:36:07,SGExams,77673,36,265,"[Repost because I accidentally violated some rules in the subreddit. I'm really sorry, mods =w=]

The title says it all. Congratulations.

I didn't do greatly on my exams. I failed four subjects ahha. I have six recorded subjects. Or rather, had. I passed two of it. A C5 in English and a B4 in Design and Technology.

How do you say this..? I can't really blame anyone but myself. I'm disappointed, but also rather happy that I have at least courses to apply for in ITE.

=====================

A list of some of the things I did in 2020.

- After three years of slacking off, I decided to just study at the last moment. It worked in the common and semestral assessments, so it should work in O-levels, amirite?

No, it doesn't. My work ethic was nonexistent, and I had a serious addiction towards gaming.

- I got my EAE Application, nice. I don't need to study.

Yes, you do. Thinking back, EAE was more of Plan B than Plan A. Don't rely on it *too much*. I couldn't tell the difference between arrogance and confidence, but this serves as a wake-up call.

- Online lessons = holiday

No, no and no. Sleeping through important lessons are detrimental to your studies. As boring as it seems, listen. Down a mug of coffee if you have to, because it's difficult to mug with the presence of Covid-19. Sure, they took out last common topics, but it probably won't be the same this year.

Trust me, it's unpleasant to wear masks during the exams. Your ability to think on the fly will be halved because the other half of it will be concentrated on your breathing patterns. Uniform's already thick enough as it is. Wear mask even more sian. Singapore already so hot then mask amplify the effect.

=====================

So, what do I do now?

To start things off, I'm two years older than my batchmates, because I had to pause my studies in my home country.

Yeah, I had a great family and all, but outside of it I was ostracized pretty much everywhere for not knowing how to communicate, and for being too reserved. The environment I was in, if you aint talking, get the fuck out of here. It's the same in the academies I attended until Primary 5. We don't have the same ideas? You're excluded. You're lying to us? You're excluded. This and that, and more things to be annoyed at.

As a result, I'm always on the defense. Both mentally and emotionally. If I had emotions, I'll just suppress them, no problem. If someone was going to approach me, I'd be super suspicious and push them away as soon as possible.

What individuals would normally experience in their secondary school years, I had only experienced after leaving it (I don't know. I mean, what's the norm of secondary school's social life?). I let my guard down in front of some strangers, and they went in not to lunge at me, but to hug me instead. They're my best friends now.

I'm a failure now, but not in the future. Fuck the chances of taking O's again and the stigma that comes along with attending the Institute of Technical Education, I'm heading straight to ITE and I'm not looking back.

I scored 30 points for my O's (ITE ELB4-A, ELR1B3-B and ELR2B2-C all 30 points ah) and it isn't going to feel nice when your mother decides to tell the rest of the family. I disappointed her, and it's completely fine if she decides to tell them. She's a single mother, and the rest of the family is back 'home'. Still, the feeling of knowing that your family is aware of your results, it's suffocating to say the least.

It's nothing compared to what my mother is feeling right now, because she had placed her faith in me, only for me to destroy that. I have serious problems regarding my attitude. For the first time in my life I'm owning up to my mistakes, and it's literally in the lowest point in my life. I always had it easy, so I find it hard to take in all of this. Still, I think it's better for me to take this all in *now* instead of neutralising the effects of the hit, in order to condition myself.

To my juniors, or rather those who came after us. Don't be like your senior here. If you're looking for someone to laugh at, laugh at me if it makes you feel better. Don't end up like me. Failing is alright, but don't fail until you have no more room to fail. Online lessons are boring as fuck, and sorry if your teacher abit the guai lan, but the moment I failed o's looking back I should've just paid attention to my teachers. I legit just went back home to get told off by my mom, and probably by the rest of my family soon. I kena sai already so what more can I do right?

In this world, where your results define you and dictate where you go, save for the few outliers who broke everyone's expectations, your only option to be set free is through education.

That being said, congratulations if you made it to this point in the reddit post, and if you took the O-Level exams. Whether you passed or failed, I care not. And just to confirm, my intention is not for anyone to feel bad for me. As pathetic as I am right now, my end goal is to improve.

Interestingly enough now that I\'ve got the company up and running and having LinkedIn connections though my various business deals meant that I was actually being headhunted for corporate jobs that I was *definitely* underqualified for. \n\nBut to answer your question yes, that ""local uni degree"" paper will get you that much needed head start and I\'ve been passed over many local-U graduates during my job search in my first few years of the startup (just to get some extra cashflow and such).

Every company works differently and have different procedures so you may learn some project management skills and even some programs but not all companies use them or follow the same type of procedures. \n\nIn terms of pay, as a private grad at my first job I had a starting pay of $2,600. A diploma grab that joined a couple months afterwards got a pay of $2,300. So in terms of start it’s not a massive difference. The fact is as a private grad you can’t look at the figures of NUS SMU NTU grads with their expected salary of $3,000-$3,800 and then expect something along those lines. Likewise if you look at the hiring figures that say 90% of graduates find a job in 3 months, those aren’t applicable to us as well. Personally it took me almost 9 months to find some relevant work and that was after exhausting all applications on Job street, jobs db, etc on a monthly basis. \n\nCurrently I’m working in an MNC with pretty good pay and I hold a rather senior position that I wouldn’t have seen myself having 5 years ago. Sometimes you just need a bit of luck along your graft to get the right jobs to make you shine better for your next job and who knows where you’ll be ending up.  \n\nOne important thing if you want to be somewhat successful, learn. Always learn. Just because you’re an operations executive doesn’t mean you don’t need to learn some people management skills, because one day a job may open up in sales, likewise, if you’re in sales, try to learn some operations or project management skills because there may be a bigger company that is looking for a person with multiple skill sets to step into some sort of management role.

Some will take this chance to lowball candidates by saying it’s a private degree and they require local certs. \nSo, think carefully before spending your money on a degree', ""Private uni grad from Kaplan-Murdoch here studied computer science. \n\nBeen working for a  year + now as a software developer. \n\nJoined a startup for my first job, worked there for a year with a starting pay of $3500. \n\nJust jumped company to an MNC recently with $4000, not too far off from local grads. \n\nFrom my experiences, \n\nYou have to put more than just a degree to standout. A degree is only one part that you can show to potential employees. There are a lot of other factors that you can work on to showcase to be a stronger candidate e.g portfolio, volunteering, etc that are relevant. \n\nWhen I was still studying in school, I spend a lot of my time outside school polishing my skills picking up relevant programming frameworks that are commonly used by the industry, and build my own side projects. I never stopped learning things, even now I still do self-learning after work, things like digital marketing and UI/UX design, its things like this that help build up your profile in the long run. \n\nWhile qualifications and skills are important, it's also about supply and demand. Right now tech is hot and there is more demand than supply. So it's not uncommon for companies to hire people below the standard bar if you have the skillsets they look for. I have a friend who only has N levels qualifications but managed to secure a job in one of the tech startups.\n\nNetworking is important, Linkedin is the best online tool that lets you network with recruiters and other professionals and they can be a great asset in helping you land a good job offer that goes above applying through a job portal.

cats_work,m03lkw,Mental health quiz answers,2021-03-08 08:29:55,singapore,378760,13,16,"Ok the title could come off as misleading but I have no idea how to word it any other way, so I hope you take the time to read what I'm about to say.

This happened last year during one of my classes, where we had to participate in a lesson about mental health. Of course, with schools being schools, they decided to give us a quiz. On one of the questions, the quiz asked something along the lines of,

""Which of the following are true?""
1. People suffering from mental health issues should seek help
2. [Insert completely wrong answer]
3. Some people pretend to have mental health issues to seek attention

So I've heard many stories of people faking their depression so that they can stay home, or just posting a bunch of suicide-ish posts on social media so that they can garner sympathy from their followers. So, knowing all that, I immediately selected 1 and 3. And I guess in hindsight, it shouldn't be a surprise, but to my surprise back then, number 3 was wrong, and only number 1 was the right answer. Unsurprisingly though, I wasn't the only one who selected it. At the end of every question, the percentage of people who select each answer will be displayed, and the facilitator that was in charge of the lesson will go through each question and elaborate on why each answer is right/wrong. The percentage that was displayed for option 3 had a decent amount from what I remembered, which prompted the (surprised) facilitator to explain why number 3 was wrong. He mentioned something like ""people will never fake having mental health issues, and you should always look out and be there for anyone you know who may possess it.""

Which finally brings me to my question.

Have you guys known anyone to fake having mental health issues before? What do you think about the idea that people can never fake having mental health issues?

Since I've never witnessed it first hand, do you think that the stories I've heard were completely untrue and that they were a product of the stigma surrounding mental health? Or are those stories 100% possible and have happened to you before?",0.79,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/m03lkw/mental_health_quiz_answers/,"['Usually if you are going so far to get attention that you try to mimic health issues of others, that in and of itself is a mental health issue. So someone who “pretends” to have depression because they want attention is probably having a far far greater mental health crisis than you realize. It’s just not a healthy mechanism for seeking attention and would pose a lot of red flags for me that they need serious help in a way that they don’t know how to express. Does that make sense?\n\nALSO mental health looks different for everyone - never assume you are getting the full picture of someone’s life. I went through life with an undiagnosed anxiety disorder for over 10 years because I’m high functioning and able to succeed in work despite feeling crippling anxious thoughts. I’m very open now about having anxiety because getting diagnosed changed my life. If my colleagues or friends looked at me now they’d say - “there’s no way that person has a mental illness”. But it’s precisely because I have a mental illness that is hidden most of the time that I talk about it so much.', 'I worked with someone who always talked about how he hated life. He told a close friend that he wasn\'t really depressed but wanted to get out of one onerous task or another as people will pity him. I think most people felt he was doing this and ignored him.\n\nThen one Frisay night he threw himself off the block he was staying in. It taught me to take mental health a lot more seriously. People who are ""faking it"" often have deep underlying problems.', ""Argh.\n\nAright thing is\n\n1. Mental health issues are stigmatised enough already. If schools are to teach students to consider that it can be faked it will deepen the stigma further and bar potential people who really need the help the help they need.\n\n\n2. You are not trained. Fake or real you also cannot diagnose. Mental health is complex illness with varying intensity; different people shows different symptoms. Who is to say that a the suicide-ish posts are not real thing? (In any case suicide ideation/harm exists on a spectrum).\n\n\n3. So yes, ppl may be able to fake. But it's not your call to make. Treat it like a real one and let the professionals decide."", 'Pretending to have a mental illness to attract attention could be a sign of other issues like parental neglect, low self esteem etc. They probably need help too.', 'Have in army to chao keng lor but the best action is always to give someone the benefit of the doubt unless proven otherwise', ""Isn't pretending to have a mental illness a symptom or sign of having one ?"", 'I get that idea of automatically seeing people as attention seeking when they did that - I did have that mindset during my schooling years with a kid in another class notorious for blogging regularly about r/s drama. Cutting & suicidal thoughts for what we presumed were ‘brownie points’ was pretty common. That’s probably exactly what those stories you’ve heard are on about. But by treating her as just a drama queen everyone basically let her spiral off on her own for years to not give her the attention she seeks, and it’d have potentially become some hindsight 20/20 material had some classmates not finally reported the posts to a teacher who could connect with her. She started having more healthy relationships after that too after getting help. Win all around for everyone. \n\nIt’s better to encourage someone to be dramatic and open about their mental illness so people can help them, than having people bottle it up until the watergates burst and they throw themselves off a building to the surprise of everyone. That’s more likely the intention of the teacher when they’re telling you that. Like others have said, them doing this likely indicates an underlying mental illness that even the person doing it isn’t aware of it. Family neglect, messy family circumstances, abuse are huge contributing factors especially if you’re talking about kids in school. \n\nIt’s nice that the school is organising classes like these for yall though. I don’t remember having them growing up just 10 years ago. I know yall probably think the class is a complete waste of time because you could be studying or going home earlier and whatnot, but it is one of those more things you’d appreciate more over time.\n\nEdit: I thought I should mention, thanks for asking this question. You’re going to get ratioed hard because what you’re asking perpetuates the stigma around mental illness even more than it already is, and people online around here are going to be more easily irked. But it is an important unpopular question to ask so that people can see the responses to it and learn too, and I can tell you’re asking to challenge that notion. It’s not an easy topic to talk about in our society either so these are baby steps towards it. \n\nSo good on you for asking. Thanks. It’s so easy to be a cynic when it comes to this.', ""Mental health issues and mental illness are two different things. \n\nhttps://www.beyondblue.org.au/the-facts/what-is-mental-health\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/mentalhealth/learn/index.htm\n\nPeople complaining that they're stressed, sad, and 'depressed', are having mental health issues.

unicorn36000,lnf25t,[A Levels] How I Came To The Decision Of Retaking As A Private Candidate Part I,2021-02-19 20:47:59,SGExams,77673,7,99,"Some of you may be considering pathways after the release of results today. I would like to share my story of retaking As as a private candidate plus tips on how and if you should choose this path in Part II.

**Background:**

My situation was kinda unique. At the halfway point of J2 in 2019, I was perpetually plagued with anxiety, fatigue, sadness, coupled with the increasingly frequent panic attacks, to the point that it was a challenge to even form sentences for my GP essay, let alone recap and revise concepts that I desperately needed to master. My brain felt like a pool of water every time I started to sit down and do work/revise and my situation fails to improve even after going for counselling. I had tension headaches every single day, backaches for no explainable reason, horrible insomnia, and panic attacks so bad I felt like my heart was beating out of my chest. Towards Sep/Oct, it got so bad I was skipping school everyday, and it was a challenge to get out of bed/carry out daily activities. My concentration was like water, I couldn't pay attention to everyday conversations. After visiting the GP, I was referred to a psychiatrist at my local polyclinic, but it was too little and too late. By then, the talk therapy barely helped and my parents didn't know what to do, initially believing that I was lazy and then terming me as an early case of burnt out. Till today, I'm not sure if what I experienced was mild depression or simply my body's response to the high stress situation that I was in, I was never diagnosed despite going for therapy. And because of the stigma towards mental health problems in my family, my parents didn't know how to help me, and I didn't know how to help myself get out of the sticky situation that I was in. The school counsellor hardly helped and simply told me to get anti-depressants, but who should I approach, which doctor should I go to, who can even help me? At that point in time, the best option to me was to escape and that was by sleeping it off and skipping school most days. I submitted blank papers for all of my subjects at the A levels, dragging myself to school for the As just so I could be there and classmates wouldn't be asking and wondering why I was missing the important exam. After As, I was lost and hopeless. There were so many options for me to explore. 1) Use my sec 4 results and go to poly 2)Retake As as private candidate 3) retake As as school candidate 4)Go to private uni and take a bridging course 

**Steps that I took:**

I told myself to take it one day at a time, and it seems like once I made the decision to give up on As(as in submitting blank papers for As since I didn't have the time to focus and revise anyway and it would be hoping for a miracle if I expected to at least get decent results given that I didn't study for the last six months), my anxiety decreased. The insomnia, racing thoughts, sadness were all still there, but panic attacks decreased in frequency and I felt more comfortable. I focused on small wins, like moderate exercise(walking) daily if I could, getting myself out of bed etc. Im not saying that this is a guide to treating mental health, and I definitely recommend others to seek help from medical professionals for mental health issues. However, at that point in time, I was just doing what I could to help myself given my family situation etc.

Of course, I was still lost in life after feeling like a failure with the conclusion of my JC journey. I began to research on my options, went to polytechnic open house to view the courses, and researched private degrees and uni in SG. Overseas wasn't an option for me. 

**The decision to retake As as private candidate:**

**Factors that I considered:**

1) I had no strong interest/passion in the poly courses that I viewed

2) I knew that I didn't give A levels my best shot the first time round 

3) Because of 2, I wasn't willing to simply go to a private uni and settle for a bridging course(since a bridging/foundation course takes a year as well so might as well use the year to retake As)

4) I focus and work better at home and on my own pace, unlike going to school and going at a predetermined pace, so that settled the decision for me to retake As as private candidate vs school candidate

**The light at the end of the journey:**

I was definitely in shock when I viewed my results online, and didn't expect myself to get a rp of 87.5 when I had no checkpoints(school exams) or lab work to practice on. It wasn't exactly a smooth journey, but it was well worth it and I have no regrets choosing this particular pathway. 

I'll be posting another post on what I did as a private candidate in 2020(part II), but it wasn't an easy journey and if you decide to go down this route, you will definitely be faced with lots of naysayers, with even tutors and seniors believing that retaking As as school candidate is better than private candidate. But I just gotta say that you know yourself best and your working style, and if you think that a route is better for u(even if its private uni/poly), trust yourself and have confidence that there will be a rainbow after the storm. Don't let the opinion of others sway you in your decision, though definitely consider if these opinions are valid for your particular situation. But remember, whatever route that you choose, complete that path no matter the tribulations that you may face.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lnf25t/a_levels_how_i_came_to_the_decision_of_retaking/,"['good job!!!', 'Huge congrats to you!

I’m looking to retake A levels as a private candidate, but I’m not sure given that I’ve only heard NS boys do it and I’m not confident that I can do it...

Hisokamahidol,iwxae7,[Poly] =/= ITE for JC rejects & [ITE] =/= it’s the end,2020-09-21 17:42:07,SGExams,77673,27,335,"It’s just so upsetting that people perceive poly to be “ite for jc rejects” and ite to be “it’s the end”. Why does this social stigma still exist? I could recall the time last yr where my L1R5 score for my Sec 4 MYEs was 41. The vp told me with such results, ITE wouldn’t even want me. Coming from the “best class” , yerpz my classmates laughed at how even if I went to ITE, it would be the end for me. (One mth aft results release, my vp asked me which ite I was posted to, I swear I had the urge to rub my results slip on her face) but yeA I manage to get into the poly course I want and what I wanna say is - times have changed guys, please do not discriminate against poly/ite students. These institutions cater to our varying strengths and weaknesses, and we may not be as academically inclined as compared to JC peeps. If you have not experienced what it’s like being in ite/poly please do not assume. It does not mean we’re in ite/poly means that we have more free time or wtv. Yes, we may have more holidays than compared to those in JC , but we use the time to finish our projects and assignments as well. I feel that we should create more awareness about this “issue” in Singapore. Well, there are people with single digit scores gg to poly bc they feel that the poly curriculum suit them better. Besides, ite is NOT the end. Have you seen former ITE students getting into local Uni? Yes you’d prolly have. It’s all up to whether the student is determined to do it or not. Some students take more time to flourish as an individual. 
Such pathways should serve as a platform for us to recognise our strengths and not be discouraged by our flaws. It should not serve as a platform where we are being “ranked” based on academic ability. My parents “disowned” me for being a “poly student”  and a “disgrace to the family” but I’m rlly thankful for holding onto a scholarship to pay off my sch fees :,) Being the first in the family to enter poly does not mean I cannot succeed. What really matters is believing in oneself. In fact, I’m doing much better compared to Sec sch.

However, as Singapore mainly predicates on post-industrial ideologies, high emphasis on efficiency results in many to shift their focus on acads.

fluffyfunky,mbyu1d,[uni] Should I take up a Real Estate Degree if my passion is Creative Marketing?,2021-03-24 14:02:37,SGExams,77673,5,6,"Applied for undergrad courses at NUS, it’s most likely I’ll end up getting RE or PFM (poly gpa 3.4x). However, I’m someone who’s more a creative individual, and have taken up multiple internships, leadership roles, volunteer as a marketer. It’s also what I envisioned myself doing in the future (social media, marketing campaigns, PR...). Hence, if I go into RE but don’t intend to build a future in RE, would it still make sense (just for the sake of gg into NUS)?

On the other hand, I am also currently enrolled in a globally-ranked Australian university, but bc of covid am leaning towards a local placement. Am pursuing marketing there. 

Not sure in which situation I’d be better of — 
study in NUS but not a course I’m passionate about/not my niche 
OR 
continue studying in my overseas uni, what I’m passionate in, only thing is smh there’s always a stigma against Aussie/Overseas grads (like only rich kids go/not legit degrees/idk)...

Both courses are very built environment focused and is absolutely not linked to marketing at all and I can probably say you would probably hate what you will be studying because the content can get pretty dry and technical at times. Enrolling to PFM/RE for the sake of entering NUS also does a disservice to the Built Environment industry because what the industry really needs are people who can really invest their time to improve the state of things there - if you do intend to do something else and go into a totally different field then what is the point?

Honestly, what you've learnt in poly is enough to start off a career in PR/Marketing. And I always think that it's useful for people in the creative industry to have knowledge outside of this expertise. You never know what kind of clients you'll get, and studying something different on top of media can give you an extra edge! Just make sure that RE/PFM isn't something you're completely disinterested in, or going through it for 4 years can be hell."", 'would recommend SUSS/SIT FT programmes if you wanna study locally as opposed to enrolling in RE/PFM, these two courses are vastly different from marketing in general, plus there’s no guarantee that you’ll get into either since the upcoming IGP will probably soar due to covid. \n\non a side note, since you’re currently pursuing a marketing degree in OZ, why not just complete your degree and go for masters upon returning to SG?', 'I would prioritise my interest.']"
DankTroll800,kqc3qo,SPF enlistment tips & tricks (updated for 2021),2021-01-05 00:29:57,NationalServiceSG,11078,54,35,"**INTRODUCTION**

&#x200B;

Eh Mangkok! First off let me welcome you as being one of the lucky/unlucky few to be posted into the police force. Not many people do get into the SPF and your experiences will be vastly different from your peers in the SPF.  This guide is created to help you mangkoks settle into training in HTA and to give you an idea on what to expect.

Before I begin this guide. I would like to give a shout out to u/LF149 on reddit and Parmesean from HardWareZone. These individuals have made their own respective guides for SPF enlistment in 2017 and I will link their guides below ( and those guides helped me greatly for my own enlistment). It is now 2021 and certain policies and procedures in SPF have changed, so this guide will mainly be an update on what has changed since then and a few other stuff that is not covered by those guides.  May your 2 years be safe and sound and may you come to understand the challenges of policing in today's Singapore!.

LF/149 guide: [https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4wp3am/a\_guide\_on\_how\_to\_survive\_spfs\_basic\_police/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4wp3am/a_guide_on_how_to_survive_spfs_basic_police/)

Parmesean guide: [https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/national-service-knowledge-base-162/guide-spf-enlistment-5604516.html](https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/national-service-knowledge-base-162/guide-spf-enlistment-5604516.html)

( **NOTE:  To those that are about to POC or have POC not too long ago, pls do let me know of anything that is incorrect with this list or any changes to POBC that I am not aware off so edits can be make to make this guide as accurate as possible. Your assistance will be greatly appreciated. Thanks!)**

&#x200B;

**EQUIPMENT LIST**

( I will be using the  Parmesean version, but adding my own comments to some important items and changes. My comments will be listed in **BOLD**)

**things to bring/wear on enlistment:**

\- Wear a decent shirt & jeans for oath taking- enough underwear for 10 days-

Singlets (3 white to wear under your no. 3 **and no.4** as well as book out attire) (**Your bookout attire is going to be thin and its going to be white. This is why you will need an undershirt and it is also a requirement anyways when u bookout)**

\- Qualification certificates- Pen & paper (writing materials, recommend bringing a small notepad) **( A pen is REALLY important. I will explain more later. They do give you 1 pen but if you are scared of losing it just bring a few extras. Notepads are not too important since everything is digitalised but if you learn better by writing by all means go ahead)**

\- SHAVER, DEODORANT\* & other toiletries

\- A basket for your toiletries (very important)

\- Magiclean Wiper Dry Sheet (And if you have room to spare, the stick as well)\*# **( this will really make bunk cleaning a lot easier, and your bunkmates will thank you for it)**

\- Kiwi & lint-free cloth\* **( boots do not need to be shiny now but they still must be black. They provide kiwi but not the cloth in enlistment so up to you)**

\-8 hangers at least (if you like being neat, if not 6 will do)

\- Plastic bags for storing your used clothes (there will be a lot)

\- A torch light\* **(not important, I never used torchlight in camp and see no reason for you to do so, and some ppl tell me the torch will get confiscated nowadays so don’t even bother)**

\- Home clothes to sleep in, one or two sets (not a must, but personally I found it more comfortable)

\- Febreeze (Any scent will do, I personally found the double strength one smelling the best)\*

\- Washing powder, stain remover & scrub\^ **(if you are lazy like me, you can do with just febreeze but make sure you sun your shirt and manage your clothing appropriately)**

**-  powerbank NOT exceeding 20k Watts , wire and camera phone. You are now allowed to bring camera phones into HTA but don't misuse it.**

\- **Any other item that is listed in the enlistment letter but not mentioned in any other guides.**

\* indicates this is not mentioned in the enlistment letter.

\^ I recommend bringing washing powder, stain remover and a scrub to hand wash your clothes.# Do not cheap out and buy the $2 ones from Daiso, they do not work as well and will really impact your room's cleanliness

You will be issued all your items on the first day of enlistment. There isn't a need to bring a lot of change of clothes.

&#x200B;

**YOUR CONFINEMENT PERIOD**

Nvm you think SPF good life right? Well think again. SPF life can be good, but you will have to earn it. Your enlistment day is going to be slow as hell with a lot of waiting, a lot of settling logistics and a lot of yelling.  From the second day onwards, there will be more yelling, more water parades ( if u know u know), learning the dos and don'ts of being in SPF, being rushed around, doing many left/right pumps down etc etc. Some of you will cry after a certain motivating / wake up  speech,  but that is ok and is part of adjusting into the life of SPF.  This is also when you will get to know your buddy and squad, and they will be your family for the next 3 months (6 months for PTP batch). You will be confined for 10 days.

IMO confinement is the hardest part of POBC, if you get through it life will get easier down the road. Encourage each other ( and legit **DON'T BLAME EACH OTHER.** The whole squad will kenna punished because of one person and there is like 30 of you. There is no point) , see the light at the end of the tunnel and take it one step at a time. Once the second friday comes around and you bookout, life will slowly get easier not only because you adapted but also because you start earning more rights unless you or someone in your squad fks up BIG. (eg. vending machines, more rest time etc)

&#x200B;

**MENTAL HEALTH**

If you got a physical health issue. Easy just go and see the MO for check-up and let them do their assessment, or sound out whenever you need to your FI/ PTI/ CM and they will refer you accordingly . Mental health on the other hand is a tricky subject especially in national service across all 3 NS organisations. If you feel that training is really bogging you down, please do seek help with the FIs and CMs, and see the MO ( or even hospitals and IMH if serious)  if you think it is necessary to do so.  If you want to be completely anonymous and find everyone including your FI and CM unapproachable. There is a hotline similar to the SAF counselling hotline. That is:

Police Psychological Services Division:  **1800-255-1151**   and it runs 24/7.

In my experience SPF generally takes mental health issues quite seriously, especially when you go frontline where you might be subject to PTSD and nightmares  if you are unlucky enough to deal with really serious incidents. So pls do seek help when you need to,

For the Chao Kengs out there, I do not blame you for choosing that way of life as NS can be quite shit. However no matter what you do **please do not fake mental illness**. It is really hard already for the legit cases to seek help due to the stigma in our society and you faking mental illness  does not help them. At the worst case scenario, you will have blood on your hands.  Think about that.

While this section is mainly about mental health, I want to touch a bit on the physical side as well. If you are feeling ill, do sound off and don't be a chiong sua. Rmb that its not only you, its your squadmates, your FI and CM and your loved ones . No one wins if you suddenly faint during training and many people will get fucked/ get their hearts broken. While it is good to be motivated and dedicated, it is selfish on your part if you do not sound off.

&#x200B;

**APPOINTMENTS IN POBC**

Staff appointments:

**FI = Field instructor -** these guys are your NSF  trainers in PT, drill and discipline. Your FIs will tekan you the most, but they are also the first point of contact of any issues you face in POBC

**CM = Course Manager -** These guys are regular officers that will be teaching you law, dealing with admin matters behind the scenes and your second point of contact of any issues you face in POBC

**Coy Com = Company Commander -** NSF inspectors that conducts your water parades, tekans you, gives briefings to the entire intake and also does settle admin matters behind the scenes too but it is more towards the running of HTA rather than individual admin issues like your CM

Trainee appointments:

**Coy IC = Company IC -** Tbh  I do not know much on what this appointment does, but it does involve assisting your Coy Com with various taskings during your time in HTA. There will usually be a Coy IC and Coy 2IC

**Water Parade IC -** When you guys spend enough time in HTA your Coy Com may allow the intake to conduct water parade on its own and only showing up to brief the intake on latest news  . This is usually conducted by the water parades ICs.

**Media IC -**  help gather footage for your intake, editing videos into an epic compilation by the end of POBC. Do take this appointment up if you have experience in  anything to do with media

**OB IC = Orderly Barracks IC -** helps manages the Orderly Barracks. When you get into POBC you will learn more about it and I do not think I can share much about this on a public forum. However part of it involves rostering ppl for OB duty and working with the squad ICs

**Estate IC** \- helps with liaison  with coy com , bunk IC ,OB IC  and contractors in regards to any bunk faults and ensuring all bunks are in good condition for trainees to live in.

**Squad IC/2IC -** helps manages the squad and commands it during drills to march from point A to B. You will also be the guy to report strength during water parades to the water parade ICs and will work closely with the Comms IC

**Comms IC = Communications IC -** A weird role. Officially you are meant to be the liaison point of contact for your FI and CM to disseminate instructions to your squad, but your CM/FI could message your squad ICs direct or the ICs chat group itself.  Putting it simply you are the squad 3IC but also making sure your ICs  and CMs are aware of the latest info at hand.

**Classroom IC -** Leave before everyone else does to set up the classroom for law lessons, and helping your CM with a few of the admin stuff.  You will be working very closely with your CM and may be tasked to assist in setting up  classroom and training sessions/venues

**PT IC = Physical Training IC -** helps lead warm ups before every PT session, ensure that SPF gets best value of its money by confirming sessions with F21 and helping FIs with physical training matters.

**Bunk IC -** Ensure the bunk is in good condition, reporting to FI/CM and estate IC of any bunk faults, and ensuring bunks are good for bunk inspections

**MO IC = Medical Officer IC -** Accompany your sickly  ( and possible chao keng) squad members to the MO. This that an IC role that was added rather recently according to the discord peeps.

As you can see there are a good number of leadership appointments you can choose to take up during POBC. Some are at company level ( Coy IC, water parade IC, media IC, OB IC, estate IC) and some are at squad level ( the rest of the IC roles)  If you want go give 150%, then take up one of them and help make the life of your squad easier. The benefits of taking up appointments is if you do it well enough, you will get a good peer appraisal + supervisor appraisal while also developing your leadership skills. botch it up however and the opposite will happen so there is some risk involved.

If you are unlucky enough to be arrowed, just do your best anyways. People will not purposely make your life difficult and might even help you out in your IC role if you are not an asshole. If you do not have an IC role, you are still very important and  please do help out your ICs whenever possible and not make things difficult for everyone especially considering some of them did not want the role in the first place.

In short, don't be an asshole and help each other regardless of the role you have in the squad.

**ASSESSMENTS AND GRADING**

You got no outfield, No SOC, no route marches, no stinky mosquitoes biting you. Nice right? Well if you hated school you will hate the law lessons. The milestones are different compared to SAF and these are ( **Bolded  assessments** are stuff you MUST pass ) :

1. **IPPT**
2. **Formative law exam (MCQ)**
3. **Summative law exam (MCQ)**
4. **Scenario Based Assessment  (Practical test)**
5. **Revolver marksmanship**  (SPF is moving to the Glock pistols so you might be trained in that instead of the revolver)
6. **Police Defence Tactics** ( learn how to ~~fight~~ defend  in hand to hand and baton)
7. **Psychometric Test**  ( This is a special case as you can't really study for it nor prepare. No one knows how to ""pass"" or ""fail"" it but do take it seriously as you will not be able to go frontline or officer cadet course if you fool around with it, even if you aced every other assessments. )
8. Drill Test ( test on your drills and how you command the squad)
9. Police Standard Obstacle Course ( heard its piss easy compared to army SOC)
10. Swimming ( lol just enjoy your dip in the pool)
11. Peer Appraisal
12. Supervisor Appraisal

Rmb earlier I mentioned a pen is needed? **You will need it for your SBA and your practice for it**. I cannot share much as this is going into OSA territory, but bring a pen and your CM will remind you about it. You will also need a pen to fill up some important paperwork here and there.  A black and red pen should do but multicoloured pens are better.

If you do want to win an award or go into Officer Cadet Course, then obviously aim to get good scores for everything. If you want to go to a frontline vocation, passing the bolded assessments is enough but do try to get higher scores to increase your chances.

&#x200B;

**VOCATIONS:**

This guide is getting really long so to make things simple, **refer to the other reddit guide I linked above.** Majority of the descriptions are still accurate. The only changes I am aware is that there might be no more PIC or SSO as APOs took over their roles ( but this is unconfirmed so do not take my word for it).  I will give a brief description of PROCOM as it is not mentioned in the other guide.

**PROCOM ( Protective Security Command)  -** Easily compared to security troopers of the SAF. You basically protect key installations from any who dare to harm them. Those wanting to be in SAF but couldn't should consider joining PROCOM ( or SOC) as IMO it is the vocation that has the closest training and job scope to a typical SAF security trooper.  The best can join IRT and perform petrol's in public places with your full gear and MP5 ( they look quite cool).

&#x200B;

**CONCLUSION:**

Welcome to the start of your National Service. It is going to be a quick 2 years for you. While you might never get to shoot the SAR21 or the many weapons SAF has to offer nor learn about advanced squad manuevour and tactics, you will learn more about the Singaporean society , the laws and the enforcement methods to keep the country safe. You might see and touch some nasty things and you might save a life. You will be hated yet appreciated by the public you will interact on a daily basis. Whether you love or hate it, it is an experience that is going to be different from your peers.

The learning content is the exact same as the NS GRF course tough. In saying this do not underestimate the training as it will push you physically and mentally, and come in with an open mind.

conflicteddude_76,ld949a,[Rant] Tired of the rat race,2021-02-05 23:09:47,SGExams,77673,11,68,"Hey there. I'm a JC2 student(gosh still can't convince myself that it's my A level year) and I've been through (like what?) 11-12 years of schooling in the mainstream system. I believe that all Singapore/S'porean students would understand and acknowledge that we are born into a rat race. Since P1, we've been through hurdles and checkpoints; think GEP(gifted education programme) in Primary 3, the process of streaming, and streaming and STREAMing us students into different classes based on our academic results alone, till we got used and accepted the flow and system. Then came PSLE, which split us 12 year olds into different streams. Did the less academically inclined students (Normal Acad and Normal Tech) deserve the stigma that was often associated with their stream? I don't know. I reckon that there were definitely unpolished gemstones in the mix that were dying for their chance to turn the tables. Sometime in Secondary School, your identity would have been moulded and shaped in one way or another and you start to understand who you really are. For me, a kid in the express stream and still being very naive, I never understood the importance of streaming. Judging from my reckless spending habits, I liked to live a day at a time, not knowing what tomorrow would bring, or planning for the events that would come. Homework was often cast aside in favour of playing video games with friends, or put into the back burner as I simply had little interest in Maths for example at that point in time, and I frequently questioned my capabilities. Then came the streaming exercise at the end of Secondary 2, which was 'to give us an opportunity to select a pathway/subjects that we wanted to pursue.' Well, if that was the goal of the streaming exercise, I was definitely a failure in the system as I was not given the choice to select the class/combi that I wanted in Secondary 3. As you can prolly' tell by now, I was placed in what some like to call 'the last express class'. Telling my seniors this matter of fact revealed how some students from ""better"" classes thought of us-- half a step, or a full step below them. Recollecting about this now, I realise that I frequently avoided the level where the other express classes were on, as I felt that I was simply an outcast in the mix--unwanted. I remember this particular day, where Eunoia JC came to my school to attract students to join EJ in their sparkling and majestic Bishan Campus. Peculiarly, it was not the presentation or the high achievers from EJ that remained etched in my mind. It was the fact that the students from pure science classes, looked at us with scorn and bemusement as we strolled into the auditorium on that day. Perhaps they thought that us students from 'the last express class' had no rights to sit in the auditorium with them, or as I draw reference to the inherent rat race--no rights to fight for places in Junior Colleges after the O levels.

(Fast forward a bit to make this rant a lil shorter) Many of my classmates chose poly and I was one of the few students(and only guy)from my class to enter Junior College. If you thought that I was now on even footing with the pure science students who too chose the JC that I'm in, you're wrong, because a particular legacy of being in 'the last express class' never left me. Not having taken Additional Mathematics in secondary school (was weak in math anyway), I only had 4 subject combis to choose from(I would have had even fewer in some other colleges), non which involved H2 math(sounds like hell to me). And that brings me to the catalyst that initiated the reaction(get it?)-- the fact that I chose to take H2 chemistry and the frustration that it has brought me which led me to rant here on reddit. Honestly, I am yet to pass a single chemistry test(scoring 50% and above) big or small, long or short. This is in spite of me completing tutorials and trying many practice questions. Now, I question everything. Should I have gone full arts and saved myself from looking at one more E/S/U grade on my results slip? Why is it that I cannot seem to score better for Chem? Why am I simply clueless on what is going on during some tutorials? What. am. I. doing. wrong? To all who made it this far into my rant, give yourself a pat on the back. I am tired of learning chemistry as I now have this tunnel vision that I'm going to be seeing more E/S/U's for chemistry down the road. I want to withdraw from this rat race and head to an overseas university to complete a foundation year, before officially entering university. I mean, isn't this the end goal for all JC students? Unfortunately, I do not have the financial resources to escape this rat race through the method mentioned above, which means that I'm stuck in this position. ""Nooo Why????"" \*echoes\*

Since you've read this, it would be kind of you to provide study and revision tips for chemistry as I need them very very much. Thank you for reading my rant and I will likely continue to study in a place where I am constantly reminded that I am in a rat race against other students from other JC's and even my own classmates.",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ld949a/rant_tired_of_the_rat_race/,"[""Considered tuition? If money isn't a concern, I feel personally feel that tutors do help a lot if you can afford them as at the end of the day, teachers spend only so much time with us. 2hrs and maybe an additional 1hr for staying back but the 2hrs is spent divided across 40 students which leave about 3min per student max so maybe having another teacher spending a full 1hr+ with u will help, for me, I went from D7 to B3 in my o-levels as I had a tutor who would analyse my mistakes together with me which really help me remember and ingrain things not to do in my exams and practice papers.  \n\n\nSide note: I personally made a agreement with my parents that if I did manage to make my grades better, they would pay back the fee for me or else I'd have to eat it all up myself so I can definitely that made the difference and made me more focused during lesson LOL HAHHAHAHAH"", ""Have to agree with the whole rat race thing. It's an unfortunate social strata bs that is deeply ingrained into people's minds. Honestly it's toxic.\n\nHow to improve in Chem: go through every question, every test, every practice paper. Ask yourself what you got wrong (formula, understanding the question, or just lacking memorization). Work on that. More than just read the answer and think 'so that's the right answer', ask yourself where it went wrong. A levels moves beyond pure memorization and digs into application (especially for the organic chem sections). Bug your chem teacher for extra consults if need be, and if you have the cash, tuition if you're comfortable with it (not everyone is comfortable with tuition so up to you). Start asking yourself what you don't know rather than what you know.\n\nFor memorization, after you read the notes, go take a 15 min break, then quiz yourself. Quizzing yourself right after you close the book never works, since whatever you've just studied is in your short-term, not long-term memory.\n\nAll the best, sincerely, someone who got screwed over by bell curve for Chem and still holds a grudge against Cambridge."", ""Reading this post just summarises my entire experience with the education system i experienced. So it is really really relatable for me. I was from the NA stream and as you have mentioned we were streamed over and over again multiple times during the course of our education journey. And this definitely had a huge impact on me even till now. The idea of streaming has really set me back so much behind as compared to my peers. It made me indulge in this self fulfilling prophecy that i will never make it or be as capable as those who are more intellectually gifted than me. I also had similar experiences whereby i feel that i do not belong in a talk/programme that includes both the Express and NA stream in an auditorium setting. I was just so ashamed of my identity and i always felt inferior whenever i pass by the classroom block of students in the Express stream. There was always this air of self confidence they had which i didn't. \n\nFortunately, i worked really hard towards the end of that journey and i managed to do well enough to choose any course i wanted. And as of now i believe the impact of streaming still exists in my life. Seeing my peers in JC signing up for math/chem olympiad competitions was something that i seriously envy about. Whatever content i learn theoretically can never be as deep/challenging as my peers in JC. I have never personally done well in math because i was always constantly stigmatised by math. But after graduating with a distinction in O levels in emath as a 4N student who wasn't even supposed to take that exam + when all my peers and i have always failed this subject, this profound confidence i gained from really proving myself wrong that im fated to never achieve a distinction changed me entirely. With the new fascination i have for this subject, im currently hoping to take on the challenge of doing additional math by myself and take the exam as a private candidate this year.This is something i have never imagined myself to be able to do but its surprising that im actually coping really well. However, It is saddening that my peers in J2 are already graduating and are taking A levels this year whilst i am in Year 1 this year trying to tough it out with school and taking an O level exam. Which is why the effect of streaming is still affecting me because no matter what i do, i will always be slower than my peers in this race. However, what i learned the most is that this race isn't about who finishes first. It really is about how you are able to take these setbacks and mould yourself into a more disciplined individual with a never quit attitude. Honestly, what is the point of finishing first in this race but you were too intellectually gifted till the point you have never really taken anything away from this journey? Falling behind in this rat race is inevitable. But i believe it really is what u make out of it. All the best 👍"", 'Go and buy the Chemistry guides written by Tan Kim Seng.

jamemh,iry4ee,My experience as a male preschool teacher (pre-service),2020-09-13 21:18:41,singapore,378760,139,967,"I saw a post by [u/LolPlsDONTfollowme](https://www.reddit.com/u/LolPlsDONTfollowme/) on men's rights in Sg, the examples he gave on male preschool teachers subjected to limitations e.g. cannot do showering, diaper changing and toileting is spot on. There were others that mentioned that having such guidelines is to protect men in preschool industry, and I 100% agree with that statement.

A little bit about me, I'm a pre-service teacher, so the experience I'm sharing would be from my internship, practicum attachment and part-time work. When I first started teaching, there were some ah ma and aunties watching me sternly from the windows (It's one of those preschool at a void deck). Most centres I've been to, there's usually one parent who would request for me not to INTERACT with their child, so means I wasn't even allowed to say hi to them.

My mum was not 100% supportive, like she always tells people during CNY that I'm doing child psychology (normal cny stuff lah HAHA), or say I gonna become a primary school teacher next time. Then my friends always joke around call me pedo/gay, or say I'm damn lucky (I'm the only guy in my early childhood cohort for uni).

**As a male preschool teacher, we do have many restrictions such as:**

* No physical contact with children which includes hugging, sitting on your lap or holding hands (although I feel alot of centres close one eye on this rule).

* No routine care which includes diaper changing, toileting, showering, you're not allowed to be in the children's toilet.

* Cannot be alone with the children, i.e. if you're the only teacher in the classroom, you're advised to remove yourself from the classroom (not all centres enforce this)

**How I feel about this:**

It sucks because in poly/uni we're taught that we need to have some physical contact with children, such as when a child is crying, we can give them a hug to make them feel better. Even for toileting and showering, we can make use of routine cares to educate children on self-help skills.

Honestly at times I feel like a burden in the classroom since I can't help out with the routine care, very shag for the female teachers one leh. But I can help out by taking care of the children who are waiting for their turn to go shower. Some more you need a female teacher to look after you when you're teaching, makes me feel like an extra child in the classroom.

I personally feel that although the early childhood sector is very welcoming, e.g. my colleagues, poly lecturers, uni profs and classmates, parents may not be so nice to you. Some parents (a small minority) would make your life difficult, but this is what all preschool teachers male or female has to deal with.

Overall I still like what I'm doing lah, it's really a fun and meaningful job to me. Seeing children improve over weeks makes me happy :')

You are facing this right now because you are placed in a childcare centre for your industrial attachment. To be honest, being in this industry as a guy gives you many advantages because children, teachers and parents tend to listen to you more, provided that you know that you can stand your ground. I hope you did not give in to that parent who specifically asked you to not interact with her child because that is incredibly wrong. What my husband does when a parent is being unreasonable is literally to assert his dominance as a guy and explain everything in a logical manner, never back down if you are not in the wrong. A lot of female teachers find that very hard because parents tend to just treat us like nannies or maids instead of real teachers. Some people are suggesting you to push for the managerial positions in preschool, and as someone who also worked in a preschool with a principal and a director who are both males, I noticed that the parents in there were generally more understanding and chill compared to other centres with traditional female leaders which I've worked in. I remember when I had a difficult parent in that school, the director told me that he would handle it. He immediately asked that parent to withdraw her child when she continued to be unreasonable, something that I wouldn't imagine my current female principal say, no matter how hard they pushed their boundaries. At the end of the day, different genders have different pros and cons. Routines and having physical contact are not the main part of your job scope as a teacher. If you feel like a burden in class because you can't change diapers and wash poop, just fill in the manpower outside and take over the class for the teacher who is doing the routine.

Since I see that you know Mr Lobert, I\'m sure he gave you a talk about being a guy in this field before.\n\nGenerally speaking, I do not share your views regarding being involved in routine. I don\'t know why you\'re so shoehorned over it as if it\'s the most important aspect of ech. Routine is not the only way you can interact and bond with children, daily interaction is what sets the bonding. When I did my internship in a childcare, I read storybooks to children who are done showering, help auntie setup the beds, blow dry children\'s hair, and bring them to the sleeping area. If you feel like a burden then you are doing something wrong. I did everything I could so the rest of the teachers can focus on making sure children don\'t escape the toilet and dash around the centre like a soapy, naked Flash. Lots of female teacher dread doing routine, you mean you like to get your clothes wet and soapy from shower time, catch children trying to escape the toilet, changed soiled clothes, change diaper? Sorry but the whole thing just sounds like a complain because you feel like you missed out something that\'s seen as part of the job, when the truth is teachers have no choice but to do it because it\'s a must. I do agree that hugging should be allowed when a child is distressed, denying a child comfort when they specifically asked you for it shouldn\'t be disallowed. Most centres close one eye for a reason. As a guy growing up, even with ech background I still wouldn\'t trust another guy to handle my children during routine; interacting with your own guy friends should make you understand why. It does not matter how you think or trust yourself, to parents you are at most an acquaintance and they don\'t know who you are. No one knows who you truly are except for yourself, nobody is going to risk endangerment to their children over giving people a chance to prove the status quo wrong. As for this\n\n>Cannot be alone with the children, i.e. if you\'re the only teacher in the classroom, you\'re advised to remove yourself from the classroom (some centres actually enforce this).\n\nThis is a childcare thing, kindergartens do not have that rule.\n\nI know several male teachers who\'ve since left the industry and some who stayed. The problem goes beyond what we can do and cannot do. Aside from the hellish work hours, I\'m sure all former and existing preschool teachers would agree that helicopter/fake parents are the biggest problem and one of the main reason why there\'s high turnover rate. No offense but I don\'t know how threatening you look to warrant parents being that guarded towards you, personally no parents have ever warned me to not interact with their children. I have a full sleeve tattoo and I\'m 175cm. Granted, I wear long sleeve when I work. But parents are informed before hand about it during the first PTC and again with letters. The only few guys I know that had to deal with guarded parents either looked threatening/naturally creepy, or it was a conservative helicopter parent. Parents I usually see at the window are there to laugh at me handling crying children with separation anxiety trying to climb all over me so they could be carried, I am sorry for your experience. Biggest issues I faced are parents acting like they know better than teachers and forcing us to give their children special attention, or complaining over the smallest issues so they can blow it up even further.\n\nYour entire post sounds like a giant complain for the wrong reasons, a lot of male teacher who studied ech stays preservice solely because of ""muh restrictions"".

I always sing song and read story books to children waiting for their turn to shower, or I would prepare the lunch area. \n\nPerhaps another reason why I mentioned about routine care is because i recently completed one of my uni modules called ""Birth to three curriculum"". From that module it kinda drills into me the importance of routine care for the young children for several months. Maybe that\'s why my posts came across as a complain for routine care.

The textbook answer is that in Asian societies we tend to prioritise family, society and then the individual, in this order. Thus when it comes to my child, I, along with many others, would take care of one child’s interests first and if have a male caretaker goes against that interest there’s no argument to be had. After our child’s needs have been taken care of only then does the empathy for OP take precedence. \n\nImo there’s really no easy answer.

As someone working at a start-up that\'s had an insight into the hiring process that goes on at my own company and a lot of our clients\' companies, it was actually shocking to me how the fact of being female is something that would catch the recruiter\'s eyes more!

I have a friend in one of the gov IR departments and the only female out of 20+ people is a lady who handles the admin/ office matters. \n\nJust saying that stereotypes and restrictions exist for a reason. Unless society makes a huge reform, they will continue to exist. Can\'t really blame people for being ""prejudiced"" against male childcare workers because the implicit biases exist for a reason (I.e. over 95% of child predators worldwide are men). Can we ignore statistics and do away with safeguards in the name of pure equality? Or better to have safeguards and protections in place to protect both the childcare workers and the children?

They love hearing army/police/scdf stories hahaha\n\n4) Be very active, I rmb last year when we brought the children outside to play, most of the teachers were standing in the shade, while I was the only one playing catching with the rest. The children really enjoyed it, and it helps to improve your teacher-child bond\n\n5) Read stories to children!

In a KN is mostly teaching, and doesn't require routine care such as showering.\n\nAs for CC, it's a full day program, means parents would place their child at the centre from 8am-5pm.

You mentioned several different points so I talk about it point by point! I do apologies if I give a negative image of the job.

Dude I don\'t think I\'m shoehorned on routine care leh, I only shared like 3 sentences about it (1 on restrictions, 2 on how I feel). It\'s not like if I don\'t do routine care that I would melt or die or something hahaha. I feel not being able to do routine care is a double edge sowrd for me? Like yeah no need to clean children\'s poop or change diaper is a perk, but im afraid other teacher might be unhappy about it. \n\nMy point is that I felt like a burden as I wasn\'t able to help out my colleague, since I imagine showering the children/cleaning their shit/diaper changing is a damn shag thing. You even mentioned most female teachers dread doing routine, so personally I feel a bit of a burden for not helping them out in this shag work lah. That\'s just my experience and honest thoughts of the situation.\n\nI agree routine is not the most important aspect of ECE, but it is still considered an important aspect, as we can teach children self-help skills. Dude I have my professors in uni coming to observe my classmates handle routine care only. I did share in my replies like how I adapt the situation by having a dressing board in my class for my children to practice how to use a zipper/buttons, that\'s me trying to make lemon into lemonades haha.\n\nYou mentioned about my point on: cannot be alone with children and ""kindergartens do not have that rule"", I\'m really not sure about this man. But tbh I would concede that not all centres enforce this ""cannot be alone with children"" rule. The rules can be very subjective and different for each centres, and I do apologize for the confusion.\n\nIf you think about it, there are more childcare centres than kindergarten (1.5k CC as compared to 435 kindergarten), due to growing demand for working parents. I would make an educated guess that some kindergartens would phased out or re-brand themselves as childcare & half-day program (e.g. PCF).

You also score brownie points that you can cash in when dealing with other businesses/clients, similar to the whole eco-friendly/carbon-neutral agenda.\n\nLike what u/Neptunera said (this [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iry4ee/my_experience_as_a_male_preschool_teacher/g54er9e?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)), sometimes the pursuit's primary objective is to maintain PR and image.\n\nI'm not questioning the ability of women; I'm just questioning the motivations when corporations play the gender card (for good or evil)."", 'Instead of equal opportunity, I feel like people are striving towards equal outcome', 'Yep social stigma and legal actions are two completely separate issues', 'Nice!', 'I’m a male unker lah. I’m just saying from the female point of view, the male teacher comes in, have what they perceive to be an easier life, but then get a higher pay...', 'This sounds like a most excellent idea.', '[deleted]', '>Childcare do take in male teachers, and I met a lot of male teachers from places like NTUC first campus. During my uni, I was attached to 2 childcare for practicum, 1 childcare for internship. But I get what you\'re saying, I would suggest for male preschool teachers to teach at a kindergarten since there\'s less emphasis on routine care.\n\nYes, that\'s why I said ""Childcare don\'t usually take male teachers due to routine restrictions"", and not ""Childcare don\'t take male teachers"". Childcare taking male teachers in despite the routine restrictions is exactly why I say routine care is not actually an important job scope of a preschool teacher.\n\n>Dude I don\'t think I\'m shoehorned on routine care leh, I only shared like two sentences about it (1 on restrictions, 1 on how I feel). It\'s not like if I don\'t do routine care that I would melt or die or something hahaha. My point was that I felt like a burden as I wasn\'t able to help out my colleague, since I imagine showering the children/cleaning their shit/diaper changing is a damn shag thing. You even mentioned most female teachers dread doing routine, so personally I feel a bit of a burden for not helping them out in this shag work lah. That\'s just my experience and honest thoughts of the situation.\n\nMaybe I\'m reading too much into it since it was a sizable chunk of your post, my apologies. You should never feel like a burden at all as long as you are contributing, even just simply getting the children to sit down with you is very helpful to the teachers doing routine care. Their biggest stress is not just the changing or showering, it\'s also the excited children running around because it\'s hectic. Here\'s an example, I had multiple times where I have no choice but to reactive grab naked soapy children because they pull a full quarterback run and escaped through 3 teachers. It\'s either I grab them or they are about to slip and face plant. It is not fun to be looking up while you wait for routine care teachers to carry them back, because the children will start pressing their soap all over you.\n\n>I agree routine is not the most important aspect of ECE, but it is still considered an important aspect, as we can teach children self-help skills. Dude I have my professors in uni observing how my classmates handle routine care. I did share in my replies like how I adapt the situation by having a dressing board in my class for my children to practice how to use a zipper/buttons, that\'s me trying to make lemon into lemonades haha.\n\nEvery teacher I worked with the short 3 years, none have ever considered it as an important aspect to teach self-help skills. The important aspect of routine care to establish the concept of a routine in children\'s life. But if you think that way then, let\'s agree to disagree. You will find out yourself as you work the 4 years in the industry. Self-help skills can be taught and are mostly taught in the classroom in the first place, not in the toilet. You making a dressing board to practice using a zipper/buttons is a very good example of contributing. Play kits, roleplay, story telling, those are used more often to teach said self-help skills. As for professor observing how your classmates handle routine care, I can safely tell you that most of the things you learn in class are borderline useless once you\'re out in the field. Things like psychosocial stages and Pavlov\'s theory are of course applicable and useful, but most of the knowledge you will pick up are used in more managerial roles than teaching role. As for professors observing, they have to observe so nobody can complain that they didn\'t do their job, in-case there are teachers who claim they weren\'t taught to do routine care. You know the ""What your school teach you that you don\'t know XXX?""\n\n>You mentioned about my point on: cannot be alone with children and ""kindergartens do not have that rule"", I\'m really not sure about this man. But tbh I would concede that not all centres enforce this ""cannot be alone with children"" rule. The rules can be very subjective and different for each centres, and I do apologize for the confusion.\n\nI say to ask your professors about it, but most of them haven\'t taught in a preschool for a long time so I doubt they can give you a definite answer. End of the day, all anchor abide to ECDA regulations. Some anchor play it safe by making their rules stricter than what ECDA dictates, now it make sense that you are faced with such restrictions since you say you worked for MFS. The lines were blurred in the past when KN/CC were pretty similar minus the hours. Now kindergartens are under MOE regulations and there is minimal routine care outside of the occasional soiled pants. We\'re essentially no different from primary school due to the heavy focus on academics. Spelling bees, math quiz, you name it. Which is why KN doesn\'t have that ""male shouldn\'t be in class"" rules. I\'m(was) the main teacher, who else is going to teach if I leave? \n\n>If you think about it, there are more childcare centres than kindergarten (1.5k CC as compared to 435 kindergarten), due to growing demand for working parents. I would make an educated guess that some of the kindergarten would phased out or re-brand themselves as childcare & half-day program (e.g. PCF). Which means if you\'re male and you want to work at a preschool in the future, you\'re more likely going to end up at a childcare. But that\'s my guess ah.\n\nI guess you can say that it\'s half true and half false? You are correct to say that there are more CC to accommodate the growing demand for working parents, but KN aren\'t being converted to CC because of the demand... not that they are mutually exclusive since the demand is probably why MOE did the restructuring.\n\nKN are essentially forced to convert to CC because preschool education was restructured by MOE about 4 years ago, all kindergartens must now be under MOE directly to streamline how the education progression looks(KN>PS>SS>Tertiary>Uni). Existing kindergartens under public anchor do not have a choice, they have to get SPARKS certified and convert to CC as soon as possible. I worked at a KN 2 years ago that had to go through sparks accreditation, it was pretty eyeopening ngl.\n\n>Eh none offense taken about my appearance HAHA, some male preschool teachers also encountered this btw. You had a positive experience with the parents, other male preschool teachers may not so fortunate, e.g. if you watched Mr Lorbert\'s story on CNA, half the class wanted to withdraw their kids at the start dude. Let us agree that finding a good centre in an environment with accepting parents is a heng suay kind of thing.\n\nYes I mentioned that I know people who faced it and I also mentioned that I faced some myself, stand firm **because you are not in the wrong for being a male preschool teacher**. You\'re a teacher, not their maid. You interact with children because you must, you are there to nurture and educate. If they are so concerned by the fact that you\'re a guy, inform them that they should raise it up to your principal to either get you reassigned or withdraw their child. I know Mr Lorbert and have friends who worked under him during internship, he would bite your head off if you just let them say something so insulting to you without responding. I hope you do look threatening and buff like a bear, it is useful to shut down ridiculous parents.\n\n>It\'s not a complain post, more of sharing my experience. I do apologize if it sounds like one tho. Thank you for your frank comments m8!! Don\'t worry man I won\'t stay pre-service, I need serve my 4 years bond :( Anw, hope you don\'t mind if I drop you a pm for tips on how to survive in this industry!!\n\nI don\'t want to call it a complain in the first place, as a fellow (former) male teacher I completely understand where you\'re coming from. It\'s just that, routine care part really isn\'t that important outside of establishing routine in children. Restriction of physical interactions is mostly because of parental concerns rather than on us, you shouldn\'t feel so dejected about it neither. Sure go ahead, I can answer you to the best of my abilities. I absorbed lots of knowledge from fellow experienced male teachers.', ""Meh. Expected the down votes. Reddit can't handle unpopular views\n\nWhat's so sexist of this? Would you let a male stranger undress your daughter and even see her privates?

Nobody said anything about hugs BTW. Hugs are fine because the children are clothed. \n\nYour argument is absolutely flawed simply because I am the parent whereas the childcare teacher is a complete stranger.\n\nThe rules are there for a reason. This is one of those cases where we don't want a precedent. Can you imagine suppose we allow male teachers to start bathing the girls and one day. Just one day, a girl get molested.

Do a national survey or research study to find out the perspective on parents' view on male preschool teachers. How do they feel if there's a male teacher in their child's class? Which generation differ in their perception? e.g. Maybe parents from the millennial generation are more accepting, and find out WHY are they accepting.\n\nOnly through proper research then we can find out possible reasons on the negative mindsets, and try to adjust them e.g.  could it be due to mediacorp portrayal of guys? I grew up watching shows on mediacorp, and some shows would portray a male predator. Maybe there can be TV shows from mediacorp to portray male preschool teachers in a positive light, similarly to what they did for male nurses several years ago (the show is called You Can Be an Angel Too).\n\n2) ECDA can include male teachers in their marketing for preschool teachers, e.g. during teacher's day can feature more male figures.\n\n3) Maybe MPs can speak out for male preschool teachers, e.g. talk about the benefits of having a male figure in the classroom for their children.

1. as a jae, will it be difficult to integrate with the ip kids there? really hope to make friends (which is quite scary tbh LOL) and in terms of acads, is everybody there really muggers and just study? i'm definitely a work hard play hard type of student so.. 
2. honestly speaking, is competition very fierce there? raffles definitely has a stigma around them, and my friends keep telling me that there is very toxic competition there but i feel like that's quite extreme. i know it'll be stressful, i mean it's jc but is it really quite a lot?
3. what are some popular club ccas there? won't be joining sports or performing arts haha.. quite interested in ri interact and raffles press but not sure just yet!
4. what's orientation like?
5. what are the school hours like for sci stream? and also roughly how many bcme classes are there?

i think that's it, thank you! also, just let me know any other cool things about raffles haha!!",0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kybjwp/junior_colleges_ri_questions/,"['1. Usually it depends on the batch but I had a pretty solid group of IP friends. IP vs JAE only really matters to the adults so nevermind it. It only exists if you think it does. As for the work hard play hard thing, I made it through JC with a cycle of doing 1 essay, playing one or two Smash Bros Ultimate with my friend, and rinse and repeat. It’s possible if you’re mission-focused and have the discipline to focus (especially if you have a friend who’s committed to doing the same). \n\n2. Yep. Admittedly it would be pretty competitive but again I’m reasonably sure it’s all in the mind. Find a small group of friends to have healthy competition with or just shut yourself off completely. I had the fortune of finding a friend with whom I could compete and the only consequence of losing was just a bit of bragging rights for the winner which motivated the other to work harder. It’s entirely possible to distance yourself from the toxic culture as long as you don’t want to fit in so badly that you start mixing with the popular crowd. \n\n3. Raffles press is great, go join it! Tell Mr Wong I said hi :D. In all seriousness, the clubs generally have a pretty good atmosphere and people just do what they love.

Not sure how covid has affected orientation since I graduated in 2019, but it was really just interacting with your house and most of the time you don’t even stick to your orientation group.

Idk how much covid would have changed things but I’ll answer to the best of my ability as I remember from my own school experience :)\nDon’t stress out too much over J1 though, that’s the time for you to branch out and focus on things other than studies, make friends, volunteer, have fun, go to CCA, etc. You’ll have more than enough time to study in J2, trust me', '[deleted]', 'jae from ri who graduated last year!\n\n1. really this is the question u hear a lot and once again: it rly isn’t unless you’re waiting for others to spoon feed you your friendships. imo as long as you’re open and friendly, a jae making friends in ri is not much harder than an ip kid making friends in ri. def there are some ip cliques but with orientation & subj combi-based classes theres a good chances these ip cliques are mixed up anyways so don’t think too much just go there and have fun and make some friends. and once again, no we are not all muggers. yes every school has that handful of kids who mug like that’s their life purpose but as a student who plays cod during lesson with my classmates i can assure you most of us are the work hard play hard kind but def we get more serious during exam seasons\n\n2. the idea of competition just stems from the fact that people are a strong mix of naturally smart and hard workers so there’s definitely peer pressure to do well! but if you’re talking about toxic competition then i didn’t rly experience it during my years there so. ultimately just rmb that your A level grades are wholly dependent on you alone and just go at your own pace and if you make a healthy group of friends it’s enough to get you through your jc years!\n\n3. ri interact is quite a big cca and its q a popular club so you can def give it a shot! raffles press you can dm me for some personal opinions/experience!\n\n4. not sure how this year’s orientation looks like due to covid but usually orientation is house-based and its a mix of dancing, playing bonding games etc. last years orientation was cut short due to covid so i rly have no idea how this year’s ori looks like. have fun tho!\n\n5. sci stream hours are dependent on a few factors such as if you take h1 cl (will def end later like 5pm from my friends experience), and whether you take a usual combi. i took bcme too and i was lucky cus i ended 1230 on 2 days and 1pm+ on 2 other days, with the last day ending at 3pm+. iirc for y6s (ie j2s), everyone(? or most) ends at 1230. not sure if y5s have that since it used to be on wed but i heard wed became hbl so! my estimation kinda bad so i can’t est how many bcme classes there are my bad.', 'Graduated in 2014 here coming from JAE, things may be slightly different now.\n\n1. Generally, just remember the batch is like ~1250 ppl so there’s more than enough people of every kind to go around. There will definitely be IP cliques brought over from secondary school that most likely won’t expand, but I that doesn’t mean that IP kids won’t make friends outside of them. A third of the batch will come from outside Raffles so you can connect with them too! There will be plenty of muggers, plenty of people who barely care and plenty of people everywhere in between, though if you work hard + play hard you’ll fit in. People tend to assume that RI is full of muggers but there are plenty of people who do struggle as well.\n\n2. It’ll be competitive in the sense that you might think you did very well but in the end you’re nowhere near the top (but still above average), though this is something you’ll feel in most good schools. You’ll certainly see many people who don’t appear to study but do well anyway because they’re either closet muggers or simply smart. Keep your head up and don’t compare to the top echelons and it should be manageable, much of the stress comes from the content of the subjects themselves. Personally I never met any toxic people (e.g. give you wrong answers on purpose) but it doesn’t mean they’re not out there.\n\n3. I don’t know/remember much about this considering the popular ones I know are sports/arts but I think interact is pretty popular?\n\n4. I think it depends on the people you’re grouped with honestly. First day will always be awkward, but some groups warm up and grow close (like mine) or simply fade away quickly. Because my OG was close I tend to look back at orientation with rose-coloured glasses but it’ll generally be pretty awkward unless you decide to do something about it, so go talk to people! The IP kids will naturally stick to each other more (especially since they won’t know the JAE ppl yet) so you’ll have to take the initiative to interact with them and they should open up to you too.\n\n5. Hmm school hours will be shorter if you don’t take weird subject combinations, but for J1 you might end around 2+ on average? J2 will end earlier at 1+ because there won’t be PW/MT. For my year, there were about 20 classes taking BCM, most of which take econs, and about 3 classes taking bio hybrid.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have any other questions! I can even send photos of my old timetable haha.', ""hihi im a j2 from rjc this year and here's my take on your questions :)  \n\n\n1. im a jae, and id say, dont be too scared about the ip people HAHAHAHA they are noice people and as long as you are open to making friends and talking to people, theres definitely many chances for you to integrate and get to know people and become a normal rafflesian :) furthermore, ip people are also generally friendly and are open to expanding their social circle. although initially, you may be intimidated if you see ip people already knowing one another in orientation, thats a gap thats easily bridged as long as you are open to getting to know ppl and making friends!\n2. the competitive really depends on you as a person. if you are someone who is always aiming to be on top perhaps just like how you may always be one of the top scorers in ur secondary school, it is definitely going to be very competitive. on the other end of the spectrum, you have people who cant really be bothered with their studies and just spend all their jc days like a holiday perhaps cause they are rich and can already easily get a good spot in uni overseas. who knows. so its as competitive as you make it out to be\n3. club ccas really depend on ur interests! can always consider learning or taking up smth new. im actually in raffles interact right now hehe hope to see you if you do come :)\n4. im an ogl for orientation but hmm shall not leak too much HAHAHA it's 4 fun-packed days filled with games and events, as well as an epic batch dance which looks pretty kewl this year imo. though there are some restrictions in place due to covid, i think you guys will enjoy it :)\n5. if you take chinese, expect to end 440 on at least 1 day and 330 on 2 other days. you will only have 1 early day ending at 1230. if you dont, then your timetable shd be much shorter and easygoing, with like maybe 2 later days a week and early days for the rest of the week. (early as in 1/2ish?) idk how many classes there are but yes theres alot of classes HAHAHAHA a batch consists of up to 1200 students if that helps \n\nhope to see you around next year :) hope you enjoy ur raffles life and everything goes well for u haha if you still have any qns feel free to ama in my dms. cheers!"", 'im going ri too!!', ""Hi, I just graduated from RI last year so I can answer some of your questions!\n\n1. As a JAE student, it really wasn't difficult for me to integrate with the IP kids. There's this preconceived notion that the Raffles kids would all stick together and ostracise the JAE kids, but that's simply not true! I can't speak for all JAE students, but personally the Raffles kids I know didn't ostracise the JAE kids. Overall they are really friendly and approachable. Trust me, they wouldn't look down on you simply because you're a JAE student. They might already have their own cliques and friend groups brought over from secondary school, but most if not all of them are definitely open to making new friends. In terms of acads, I would say most of us are the work hard, play hard type. There are definitely some super intense muggers but ultimately what really matters is which learning style suits you best! From my experience, everyone moves forward at their own pace. Some score straight A's right off the bat, while others take some time to get used to the rigour of the curriculum. I think most students will struggle a little so don't be too discouraged if you can't seem to catch up at first. Take it in your stride. You will definitely get the hang of it eventually if you put in the hard but necessary work.\n2. There is definitely some level of competition, but it isn't as intense/extreme as you might think. It's subtle. Don't listen to those old wives' tales / Kiasu Parents' absurd claims that people will steal and sabotage your work lol. A small handful are high flyers with all sorts of accolades and achievements to their name, but most are just regular students like you and I. In terms of stress, I think it all boils down to your mindset. At times you may find yourself constantly comparing yourself with others. It's inevitable, but try not to stress over where you stand relative to others. The support system in RI is pretty robust: you have your friends, you have a bunch of really supportive and caring teachers, and there's the Raffles Guidance Centre which you can just walk into whenever you're feeling upset or need to rant. There are also student-led initiatives like the Peer Helpers' Programme you can turn to in times of need.\n3. I wasn't from a club CCA, but I think Raffles Interact, Community Advocates, and Raffles Press are the most popular and sought-after club CCAs. The selection process is pretty rigorous (if I'm not wrong, don't quote me on this) because hundreds of students will apply to these CCAs.\n4. Not sure if COVID will impact the orientation programme, but mine was a 4-day programme (no overnight component). You'll be sorted into 5 different houses, and each house has about 10-ish orientation groups with about 20 students each. There will be plenty of fun icebreakers and group activities, and also some House activities where you learn the House cheers and stuff like that. Also your orientation group will not be your class because everyone will select different subject combinations.\n5. In J1 the hours will be slightly longer than in J2 because you have Project Work and other stuff. Lessons start at 7:50am and end between 1:30–4:30pm (roughly). If you are taking Mother Tongue lessons you'll probably end school around 5–6pm (not too sure about this one because I didn't take Mother Tongue lessons). As for J2, the school made some COVID arrangements such that the J1 and J2 reporting and dismissal times were staggered. Lessons for J2s started at 8:50am and ended between 12:30–2:30pm. If you decide to take up a H3 you'll have one 2-hour H3 lesson each week. There are about 15 BCME classes if I'm not wrong.\n\nSorry for the long post and let me know if you have any other questions!"", '[deleted]', 'heyy I’m planning to go ri too hehe', 'Hi, may i ask what are the starting hours for school?', '[deleted]', 'ahh thank you so much for this detailed reply, appreciate it :D', 'thank you!!', 'thank you for the detailed response! i’ll dm u about raffles press, i’m quite interested hehe :)', 'What does bio hybrid mean btw?', 'thank you!', 'ahh thank you! excited about orientation :)', 'yay omg!', 'no omg thank you for this! i appreciate it :)', 'thank you!!!', 'hope to see you!', 'Not sure about this year but last year was 8:20am.', 'Like 8', 'Nope!

OldProtectionism,j8jt52,Sharing my thoughts on mental health in Singapore,2020-10-10 20:42:00,singapore,378760,23,68,"In light of World Mental Health Day 2020, I thought I'd just share a few of my own thoughts on all things mental health in the Singapore context.

**Discussion and efforts to promote mental health awareness shouldn't just be limited to one day.** I feel that this happens too often with these commemorations, including other 'days' such as Teachers' Day and International Migrants Day. While the situation has improved over the years, mental health stigma is still awfully prevalent here in Singapore, and few are aware and sensitive of such issues.

Those who don't believe, just ask around. There'll still be folks out there who believe that ""it's all in your head"". The acronym ""IMH"" still elicits a certain response from some, as if seeking help there is the same as going to prison or something. So on, and so forth.

The fact that [one in seven people in Singapore have suffered from a mental disorder](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/more-people-singapore-have-experienced-mental-disorder-their-lifetime-study-finds), according to the 2016 Singapore Mental Health Study, suggests that mental health isn't a small or trivial issue. Students will agree with the [statistics indicating that Singaporean students are more likely to suffer from anxiety and stress from their peers](https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3017171/singapores-stressed-schoolchildren-show-human-cost-city), given how competitive, rigorous, and unforgiving our education system is.

Our adults aren't much better. In 2019 Singapore was identified as the [second hardest-working city in the world](https://mothership.sg/2019/12/singaporeans-hours-per-week-work/), with adults working an average of 45 hours per week, only behind Tokyo. We are commonly referred to as a nation of workaholics, and rightly so.

The circumstances are so favourable in causing people to develop mental health conditions, or even to amplify existing ones. And the fact that we aren't talking and doing enough with regards to mental health makes this worse.

We should try to talk more about mental health, and also at the very least interact with those who may be going through conditions with empathy.

Cheers!

momochan14,hrorgl,[Trigger Warning] Singaporeans who fell through the cracks of society... How are you now?,2020-07-15 22:40:12,singapore,378760,337,2134,"**Economic downturn is here and more Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. I hope we can share our experiences with each other.**

**Here goes my story...**

Ever since early 2000s, my family struggled financially after my father was retrenched, due to the economic downturn. No companies wanted to hire him, despite his experience and capabilities, because he was deemed too old (in his 50s) and over-qualified for junior roles, couldn't even get past the recruiters.

After my father's start-up attempt failed, he took up any jobs possible that barely keep us afloat (Warehouse Executive in the day, Cook at fast food restaurant at night), because if he didn't, we would not be able to cover HDB loan, bills, debts and other expenses. He put up with the bullying from his boss (heavy workload, deducting his pay whenever something goes wrong) because he really needed the job. When he went to Social Services for financial help during the most desperate times, he recounted that the process was very demeaning and felt like a beggar. We got some financial aid, but it was far from enough.

Prior to that, I was blessed to have had resources (for enrichment classes, tuition etc..) for development, went to good schools and received good grades. As a result, my parents pinned high hopes on me that I would be the one to ""rescue"" the family, that kept them going during the difficult times. During the worst period, we nearly lost our home and had no money for our meals.

During my JC years, I was giving tuition to earn my pocket money. My parents didn't know I was struggling inside, I couldn't tell them, they had already crumbled under the immense pressure. They were miserable and started buying 4D, because they thought they could buy ""a hope"", they were happy only when they strike. I was crumbling under their heavy expectations, stress of going hungry, sense of shame from not having enough money to eat, maintaining my grades in a top JC. I was exhausted and had no one to confide in, even though I had people to hang out with.

I was falling into depression and couldn't absorb what I was studying. As expected, I didn't do well for the A levels, that sense of failure spiraled me further into depression. (I internalised the stigma of seeking therapy, because I thought the record would become an obstacle in my future, and if I hang in there, it would go away) My parents told me it was ok, but I know it's not from the way they behaved.

I refused to go down like that, I started working while my friends enter Uni. I thought I can save enough and pay for my own education (no one could be my guarantor for school loan), I was very clear about what my strengths are and what to study. I survived on less than $5 a day and enrolled in part-time degree after work. My mother would ask me for money for family expenses from time to time, I would give it to her to see her worry less. I was pushing myself very hard, lack of sleep and irregular meal times, my physical and mental health deteriorated. I went to Feiyue for free counselling service, the counsellor was kind but the only thing he could advice me, was to leave my family. It's impossible because I couldn't afford anymore financial burden to myself (rent. get my own household items etc..).

One day, my mother told me my father was going to get into big trouble, if I didn't help him pay off his debt. I didn't have the heart to let more misfortune befall him. I was totally crushed, that was my last straw. Even when I worked so hard to save, I couldn't study as I wanted, all my savings gone, just like that. I was very dejected and lived like a zombie, my parents said I should pull myself together and pressured me to do something productive.

>!I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just too overwhelming. I was standing by the window, almost ready to take a dive. My sibling pulled me off the window, we hugged and cried. I know I need professional help immediately (because if I don't, there is no future to talk about).!<

I went to the polyclinic and got a referral to see a psychiatrist at KTP Hospital, diagnosed with depression and given medication. Experience with my doctor was poor, he was uncaring and insensitive, but I carried on, took my medication because it worked for me. I asked if there was any support group I could join, he said ""nope"" and that was it.

I returned to work after I felt ready again. I had a hard time looking for a job, the recruiters questioning about the gaps in my resume, the tone as though there I did something wrong. I was especially afraid of a section on the form that required me to declare whether I have any mental illness. (thankfully this section is no longer around) When I finally found one, I cherished it and did my best, got praises and then the bullying from co-workers started. I hanged on and stood my ground, but gradually it took a toll on me, and my depression relapsed. I told myself that I have to fight the right battles in life, and I quit my job.

This break is the turning point in my life, as I started going for psychotherapy and working out issues that I had. **I strongly recommend anyone who is suffering from any trauma to seek therapy ASAP, don't bottle it up until it becomes debilitating, because the body keeps score and it will always win.**

I'm in recovery and felt better than before I had depression, with a newfound understanding of myself. I convinced my parents to seek help for gambling addiction, and the financial situation improved. I am very proud of them for doing that.

However, I'm struggling with fears of being asked about the gaps in my resume when I apply for jobs, how people feel about working with someone with mental illness. Now in my early 30s, my struggle is far from over, I have problem finding a sustainable job without degree, and now I also have to worry about my parents' medical bills. I want to love and marry someone, have my own family, but I don't think I can afford to do so (My bf of many years broke up with me because he saw no hope in my situation).

A very big part of my life revolved around my personal battles that I cannot put onto my resume to add value, and too afraid to tell others because I don't want to be labelled as a failure by societal standards, or that I'm trying to get sympathy. Life is about spending time with your loved ones, having enough food to eat, a place to stay, doing meaningful work. I still want to work towards it.

I don't know how the future will turn out for me, I'm lost now. I was unemployed before Covid-19 hit, and did part-time job on and off, now my source of part-time jobs is gone too.

My situation was not as bad as yours though I suspect it\'s only that way due to the efforts of my mom to hide most of the nastiest stuff from me. So instead, I\'ll share my story regarding the application of financial aid.\n\nI can attest to the fact that seeking financial aides from govnt is very demeaning and strips your of your dignity, so I can understand how your dad felt like. Certain things happened after my dad passed while I was in poly and we had to seek financial aid to deal with massive medical bill and living expenses. I will always remember the counter lady asking, ""Have you considered getting a loan from bank?"" It was as if I didn\'t know such a thing exist and she made me felt like I was a moron for troubling her with my issue cause *surely* I haven\'t thought to explore all other alternatives before coming to them for help. That moment—filled with sense of shame and indignity—was carved into my mind forever. So I told her we didn\'t qualify for bank loans because my mom\'s income wasn\'t even in the range of min income req because my dad has just recently passed and we needed help. Mind you, all of these happened in public ah. Not in a private setting. They didn\'t offered us that option. Anyone sitting beside us could hear us spill our guts to some stranger about the most trying time in our lives.\n\nIt was only later that I realized they expect you to perform your poverty. To them, unless you were picking cardboards off the streets or wearing dirty clothes with holes in them, you don\'t *look* like what they imagine poor people look like. As such, you\'re not poor enough for them to be understanding towards you and your situation.\n\nTbf, my memories of that day is tinged with resentment so maybe she didn\'t meant to have it come across in that condescending manner but it did.', '[deleted]', ""I screwed up my A levels (but not bad enough to retake).

Tried to get him to wear adult diapers and he will take them off in his bed then shit on the mattress. He would walk out of the house and go missing until some kind soul found him and brought him to the police. He even lost all his clothes once. We couldn't even apply for aid because they counted my sister's income into my family income, even though she was newlywed and still paying for her own bto at that point.\n\n\n  \nHonestly the best thing that happened to me was that my father passes away only after a couple of years with dementia. I felt no emotions when it happened. He wasn't a good father to begin with. Was physically abusive to my mother and did not had a stable income so my mom basically had to work and take care of me and my sister by herself.\n\n  \nRight now I'm almost 30 and working in a low paying job for 3 years, Missed out on increments due to covid.

Been looking since early last year so i\'ve been really working hard to deal with my discomfort.\n\nMeanwhile, my current job is quite depressing. I took on additional roles because the team was rapidly downsized due to people leaving. We were promised manpower but it never came. My boundaries and conditions for taking on the additional roles were not being respected. There are way too may last minute demands that ends up with ""someone with pay if it is not done and it is probably you"".\n\nThe pandemic brought lots of people in the country together...but it has also made a lot of people show their true and worse colours. People in the management overwork the bottom line to rush for a good show for *their* management. A lot of ideas and initiatives that came out to combat and manage the pandemic may seemed innovative. However, they were mostly born out of the desire to impress and score points. Nothing wrong with that, except that the top scored the points earned through the efforts performed by the bottom.\n\nI actually made up my mind to leave the company back in March...then the circuit breaker came. I stayed not for the fear of drifting around but i thought it is bad to leave and create a gap that might burden my colleagues. The top are the scum, my horizontals have nothing to do with the problems...mostly.\n\n...i couldn\'t count the number of Saturdays i returned to office since the circuit breaker started. I couldn\'t count the number of favours i did for others since i\'m ""in the office today anyways""...but when it is my turn to ask for help while i am working from home, i am told to consider how busy the other guy is in the office.

Another month of thinking ""just another month more""...what if it got delayed again?\n\nAnd the family is not exactly helpful during this period. In fact, if anything, it amplified my desire to get out of this house. Parents are making noises in the living room without giving a damn. The sister takes her 30 minutes shower at random odd timings and blocked out the common toilet. The nocturnal brother kept the lights on late at night, sometimes locking himself in the same toilet deep in the night watching videos. I don\'t even have a sanctuary at home. Slowly i found myself brushing my teeth earlier and earlier, only to close the door to my room and isolate myself from them.\n\nYou know how when you perform a good deed for someone and they thank you, you feel really good? I recently covered an old man in the rain, offering him a bigger share under the umbrella while getting half of myself wet and he thanked me really hard while holding my hand.

Then again, I\'m not well educated on their work ethic so I won\'t say more.\n\nThe pressure from the education system still sucks anyway. I\'m Sec 4 and a very arts orientated person, and I have been thinking of pursuing a career in visual or performing arts, but with the stigma around artists being useless, how you can\'t find a job and all really puts the pressure on me. They put a lot of focus on our other subjects anyway so any chance of developing art skills is just non-existant because of academic pressure.\n\nI come from a low SES family, so I\'m really worried that I can\'t provide for my parents, especially since both of my parents are elderly. But at the same time, I can\'t and don\'t want to force myself to do something I\'m going to despise anyway.\n\nI can\'t study by reading or revising, I can only study by ear. I can\'t go for a job in the science, accountancy or engineering field because I don\'t work well with numbers or heavy concepts.\n\nI compare my condition to the previous generation and I would think I have it easier, but the mental pressure to be ""useful"" is just stuck in me. \n\nI\'m really glad you\'re still here, OP. You really had it rough. I really hope you\'ll be able to get through this.

(TLDR: Bipolar, PTSD from near-death experience. Zero support network earlier in life because of various reasons. Pressures from everyone to be somebody, from Day 1. Anything less than 91/100 was deemed a failure.)  But here\'s the bit that may be relevant to you - the path I took to reinvent myself and build a new career.\n\nWas life science student in JC. Didn\'t get a scholarship, but that\'s ok, because I had a bunch of research internships under my belt. I\'d find something once I finish uni. But, I knew I had zero passion for the field, and would thus either flunk out at uni, or just be super mediocre and unhappy forever. (I only went into that field because it was what ""good students"" did.)\n\nThen, I watched a whole lab get fired at my research institute. Watched the phD students scramble to find new labs; some of them were young parents and the stipends they earned were hardly generous to begin with. That sobered me up and jolted me out of teenagerhood real fast. (Note: This was at a point in time where the govt was driving everyone to life sciences.)\n\nSo, I postponed going to uni. (Pretty much unheard of at a top JC. So, I\'m sure you can imagine how everyone responded.)\n\nI had a decent design portfolio by 18, so I found a job with that. Worked for 2 years, while studying part-time and doing multiple side gigs. Just so I could figure out what I wanted to do in life, and to finish uni with minimal debt.\n\nHad near zero personal life, it was 9 am to 10 pm of work/studying 7 days a week. There were days where I felt so burnt out I simply teared up silently at the back of the bus on the way home. (What helped: Knowing my goal, and spending so many hours out working away from judgemental parents.)\n\nKnowing what I know now, I\'m glad I did it.\n\nThe clue lies in what you do. What you\'ve always done.  \n**What do you do when you\'re sad? What is the one thing you do well?**  \n**All day, every day?**\n\nIn my case, it was writing. (I started with fanfiction writing almost 20 years ago.)  \nSo, basically, I found a way to **monetize that skillset.** (I\'m now literally a professional keyboard warrior.)\n\nRather than jump at the free courses out there, I suggest you look at what you have a real talent for and build from there. (Data analysts & coders are the new PMETs.)\n\nThen build a portfolio. (Since getting a degree is out of your reach.) It will get you either paid freelance work, or proper employment.\n\nIt won\'t feel like it while you walk through the tunnel, but the tunnel does end.  \nJust set a direction and keep going, u/momochan14.

Since I was a child my parents have been moving to and fro from Singapore to study, work etc. So this is my 2nd time coming back to Singapore. Unfortunately I was rejected for government school entry, because my scores for the AEIS exam were less than other people. My parents found me a small private school so that I could continue schooling. My dad found a job in 2018, and my mom found a job at the start of 2019. All was good for about 2 years, and then at the end of 2019, my father quit his job because of coworker harassment and pressure, among other issues. Now, my Dependent's Pass was tacked onto my dad's Employment Pass, so since he was out of a job, I was out of a Dependent's Pass. My dad and I have been passless since the start of 2020, and before Covid started, we were moving in and out of Malaysia to reset the visit pass duration (tourists are allowed to stay in Singapore for 30 consecutive days and 3 refreshes, so in total 90 consecutive days). After Covid started, we started to apply for visit pass extension, and surprisingly we got to extend until 150 consecutive days as of now, presumably because of Covid. Now, we're suck at home, but my education has been put on hold. I was already demoted to one grade lower than my actual grade when I went into the private school, and now I am 2 whole years behind my peers. My dad, disillusioned because no one has hired him yet, began to dabble into investment again with my mom being the sole breadwinner, so naturally my mom disliked that. He had lost copious amounts of money to investment scams before, and even got my grandma's money scammed by a fake trading company. But he's not stopping. He's already too deep into the rabbit hole, and he and my mom argue everyday about this issue. To add more bad news, we've been renting a flat (relatively old one with squatting toilet) to live in since we came to Singapore, and the owner just informed us that when our lease expires in 2021, she wants to sell the flat, so we need to move out and find another place to stay.\n\nIdk, I know tons of people have it worse than me, such as OP, but for my background and upbringing, I feel like Im in the worst situation in my whole life for now. I'm scared that I wont be able to graduate on time, I'm scared that I wont get a place in Uni/College, I'm scared that my parents will divorce, I'm scared that we'll be homeless, I'm scared other people will look down on me for my upbringing, I'm scared that I wont get married because I've always been rejected and I've never had a good first impression to anyone(I've asked), and most of all I dont know what to do. I've been trying to bury all that stuff by playing video games and learning languages and other stuff, but these questions always nag my mind. My mom asks me why I've looked so down recently and I just say I'm just tired coz I dont want her to worry about me.\n\nI've thought about suicide tbh, but I'm afraid of the pain and also of the suffering it will bring to my parents.

I’m not successful per se but I’m in a better place so I hope you guys can continue being resilient.\n\nI grew up in a upper middle class family. My father wasn’t born rich but worked hard to become an entrepreneur and had a thriving business. Up to the age of 14, I was living comfortably, had a helper in our house, always got what I wanted, and at one point of time was living in a condo too. Only issues I had were perhaps toxic communication issues with my parents. My mum is overbearing and my father is simply the stereotypical silent distant figure.\n\nThen my father’s business failed and everything went downhill. He was in debt, got my mum involved as a guarantor and before I could process what happened, my family was homeless and both my parents were bankrupt when I was 14. Our apartment literally got re-possessed and we had those officers coming in placing stickers on whatever was valuable so they could sell it. It was pretty traumatising & I remember my mum asking me to hide my laptop and tech stuff so they can’t take it.\n\nMy father then “semi-abandoned” the family with ‘business trips’ to China where he would fail and not send us any money at all. My mum was in a senior admin position earning about $3K which wasn’t really enough to single-handedly pay debts, rent, and raise 2 teenagers. But she also didn’t qualify for a lot of subsidies because they deem her salary as “too high”. This is where I think gov policies can be more flexible in helping families with different circumstances but, topic for another day.\n\nMy mum fell into depression and would threaten to commit suicide everyday. Both parents couldn’t make a decision about where to live and I literally went through the classifieds section to find rental apartments, dragged my mum to viewings, and we finally settled in a rented hdb flat. My mum also struggled to give us expenses and she would go hungry at times just to make sure me and my sister still had meals and tuition. By this time, I was already jaded about school. I was a decent student but with so much going on, I did poorly in sec 3, scored single digits for tests, and had to repeat another year. I didn’t really realise it then but I was depressed because I had insomnia and was constantly unhappy and angry. \n\nAll repeated students were made to attend compulsory counselling sessions in my school and this only made it worse. As a teenager, the last thing you really need is extra attention drawn to you when you have to skip classes for your counselling sessions. The counselling itself was horrible because I don’t remember much of it. I just remember feeling disconnected from everyone and distrusting everybody so much so that I don’t think I had a proper conversation with the counsellor. The last 3 years of my sec school education are a blur because I think my brain is trying to protect me from trauma by blocking things out and I’m still working on processing them till today.\n\nEventually me and my sister motivated each other and I did well for O’levels to get into a decent JC. But it was tough focusing cause my mum lost her job, had a new one which paid lesser, then Singapore’s property market entered a crazy boom and the rented hdb wanted to increase rent by 2x & we couldn’t afford it. Throughout this period, my dad was just absent. I honestly didn’t really cared much about him but it fucked my Mum real bad and she was emotionally abusive and manipulative to me and my sister. We were almost going to be homeless again until an aunt(dad’s side) decided to let us use a spare room in her hdb.\n\nWorst aunt ever. She charged us high rent for that space, was stingy, turned off the main aircon switch in the night to get us to use less electricity. This made JC stressful and I did badly for A’levels, couldn’t enter any local uni courses based on my grades (B,C,D) Luckily I got a B for literature and my JC teacher helped me with a recommendation letter to NTU where I managed to major in literature! I worked as a teacher to support my expenses for Uni, had some help from grandparents for Uni fees, helped my mum with her divorce, and eventually she managed to apply for a BTO so we are no longer homeless.\n\nCurrently, I’ve been working for 5 years in the digital marketing space. It hasn’t always been easy but I’ve found my niche and have had to forced myself to adapt (I’m bad at math but I work with data and analytics now). I also managed to land myself a job overseas and was based there until...COVID-19 happened and I was taking a holiday in singapore and am now stuck here while working remotely for my employer based overseas. I’m living out of a suitcase, and have uncertainty about my employment. For years, my goal has always been to migrate out of Singapore with my partner as it’s not LGBTQ-friendly so I was working really hard towards that (making calculated career choices and saving hard to migrate). With COVID-19, my overseas residency application is in jeopardy so it’s been a shitty time but I still have my job and I think I’m in a privileged position compared to many others.\n\nI’m just taking each day as it comes, and still looking to upskill because I want to stay relevant & competitive.

Not all of them include a professional too! But it depends on your situation and, in short, how long you've been suppressing your feelings etc.\n\nFirst, I recommend you either verbalize your feelings, or write them down. That too in coherent sentences. When you put your feelings into words, you realise how your situation may not be as bad as you initially thought. We humans normally magnify our problems and think the worst situation possible through everything. Once you put it into words, often times you'll see how skewed your thoughts would have been before.\n\nNext, I'd suggest you could try to talk to someone about your situation. It doesn't need to be someone that'll give you solutions to every problem, we often just need someone to listen to us. This could be one of those online helplines where you don't know the people you're talking to so it's more anonymous and you won't feel pressured to put on a front for them. But I should tell you first that this isn't a long term solution. Once you feel comfortable talking about your situation and you reach a situation where you just need help, it might be time to see a psychologist or professional. \n\nThe simplest solution I have is for you to talk to your parents or close family in general. Family, above all, will look to act for your betterment. Therefore however your situation might be, if you're able to put it into words and tell your family and ask them for help, it can only get better from there. This does not discount the fact that they might not see eye to eye with your choices and decisions, they might be angry initially. But they will help. \n\nA word of caution though. If at any point you feel like you might end your life, or something along those lines, please do seek professional help. Once it gets to that point, getting help from a professional will make the process easier for you, because they will guide you through your recovery. \n\nThese are just some ways that you can reach out.

On the other hand poly’s gonna take three more years and I’m interested in early childhood education (ece) but my parents are not very supportive of it + from what I’ve heard, poly has many presentations and projects to be done too and everything counts so I cannot screw up anything either.. and there’s still stigma about falling behind your peers no matter how much we deny it zzzZz and then after poly, the only ece related course is in SUSS isn’t it? 
in the meantime, I’ll still try to apply for SUSS and apply to retake A’s as a school candidate.

You do not compare with others and conclude that you fall back. There are def major takeaways & learnings from ur A lvl results. One could be that of dealing challenges with grit. Yea ik u would want to work asap and be independent, but sometimes life really doesnt go in our way. We have to just make improvisations along the way.\n\nDont feel too bad for getting that A lvl score. Its our attitude and actions taken during these tough times that shape our resilience.\n\nWould suggest you take the poly option as your chances of succeeding here is higher than retaking As . The most important part is, u will likely be happier and motivated in poly since ece is your passion, plus it is something meaningful too.\n\nI do hope you make a wise choice soon yea! Atb"", 'Wait, what\'s your family opinion? What r they not supportive of? The course or that it is poly? \n\nThen there could be immatured poly mates who\'ll forever make fun of u w a ""Jc drop out"" label. Can u handle that? I was the rare few who went to poly from a v reputable sec sch - first wk of sch already people whispering that i came f Xxx sch, so atas. U can handle? \n\nBack to now, my kid didn\'t do well for Alevels but can probably get into university courses if he is not fussy but he is fussy n v determined to live his own life so to speak. I have discussed w my husband that diploma is another option because not going to subject him to hell again to re-live alevels. N not gonna fork out pte university fee for him - only local ones. I\'m still waiting for his ""report"" on what he gonna do - give him 2 weeks to organise his research n sell us his idea. \n\nOk, back to your situation. Ece is a step towards education industry. It is not easy course, before u start sch, do try to find temp opportunities as an assistant teacher to gauge if that\'s what u want to pursue long term. There r other forms of childhood education branch, including specialisations into special education next time.   Passion is key. If u really want it, I\'m sure u can convince your parents w a well researched presentation of your findings on course modules, education pathways, future opportunities, possible upgrades or other specialisation within same industry etc. \n\nAnother thing i have been thinking is, go poly only if it eventually leads to one of the 4 bigger local universities which have a more vibrant student/campus life landscape. U need to reward yourself w an end goal. If u intend to continue to Suss or Sim after poly (i took this route minus jc part), u can consider to work n take part time Suss degree. If Ece is your calling, it won\'t be difficult to get bonded sponsorship as demand for gd childhood educators is there. Discuss w your parents or see if there is a mutual friend of your parents whom u can link up w for further discussion.', 'iirc if you go to poly as a JC grad, you’ll be exempted from one year of poly and will only have to do 2 years.

Still kinda unsure of my own future right now but i wish you all the best!', 'Hmmm yes yes I know I am accountable for my own decisions, but at the end of the day I am also left with this many options because of my results zzZz I’ve been thinking a lot recently, and trying to discover more about myself, so hopefully I will not regret whatever happens next because of my final decisions.

For two years before the event I was living in fear of a violent father. At home, my only childhood memories were being jostled awake to the shouting match, the yelling, the screaming, me and my brother looking at each other in silence confused and frightened, the police visits afterwards, and the image of my mum sobbing on the floor.\n\nThey separated a year later when I was in P6.\n\nDuring primary school, there were so many times I was hustled to the teacher’s room to hide under a table, shaking in fear—during the middle of a class just so that I could be safe and hidden when my dad barged to school angry, demanding to see me and my brother. \n\nAt the end of P6, the divorce was final. My granny later told me my mum contemplated suicide then not knowing what to do. With zero interest in school thereafter, I scored 192 for PSLE and got in a neighborhood secondary school.\n\nIn secondary school, gang fights and public canings were the recurring theme. I literally couldn’t care less and didn’t mix around with anyone much. Retained a year in secondary three and scored 25 as L1R4 for O level. Couldn’t land a place anywhere and ended up at ITE. \n\nAt ITE, I was bewildered why didn’t the teachers give up on us hopeless bunch. I somehow did well enough to graduate to a polytechnic. In polytechnic, I somehow again found a passion for what I was studying. Did well enough again to land a spot at a local university afterwards.\n\nIn university, I did really well in my first year, made the Dean’s list and was questioned by the school administration during year two why didn’t I applied for any scholarship. Well, I didn’t knew I could. I was just a stupid kid with a single-mum who did not graduate primary school and whom kept her head down working 12 hours a day trying to put food on her two sons’ table. As luck would have it, scholarships helped pay half of my study loan which would have amounted to $40k+. I guess that was my first lucky break.\n\nTo cut the story short. The luckiest thing that happened to me post-graduation was finding myself in a great job with promises of a better future.\n\nNot sure if this is the atypical late-bloomer story you wanted.\n\nThe most distinct memory out of those adolescent school years was remembering looking into my form teacher’s eyes at the end of secondary three (and feeling the overwhelming sympathy) when she asked if there was ANYTHING she could help me with.

One incident where some hokkien peng with gang affiliation got the whole company into trouble because they were smoking outside of the designated times. They have this happy-go-lucky approach to life which is not wrong but it was constantly getting the platoon into trouble. Like legit they have no higher thoughts other than to have fun at that moment in life. I was a very bad student, took O levels twice and fail but still I could see shades of myself in them and I realised I did not want to be like them. It got me thinking I will probably end up like them if I dont do something about it. \n\nAfter BMT I post out to unit and met people from a higher social class, one of note was a scholar who was from RI and RJC and had just finish doing further studies overseas, he was much older than me and surprsingly he had no airs unlike what you read about those people from RJC.

People may just think that early childhood is like a nanny job, just take care of children, wipe ass and shower them but NOO.

The pay sucks and I\'ve been through more discrimination that I care to admit.

NurulSyafiqahBiss,jtj660,[Rant] The only one in the class who pass geography exam . It isn’t always sunshine and rainbows.,2020-11-14 00:45:33,SGExams,77673,22,204,"Sec 3 NA.

When I kinda did well in geography and was the only one who pass in class. When we pass around the score sheet to sign on it to acknowledge that you get the correct marks, my geography friends told me, “shut the FK up at least you pass” 

I hate sharing my marks as people keep asking me how much I got, I would tell them and they get so fking pissed.

I was at least trying to be grateful for scoring that marks but with all the remarks that I received that just 📉📉😀.

Take note : On the exam day itself, there were two papers. All of them were focusing on chemistry paper instead and said this before geog exam while the examiner ( my form teacher) was there , “FK geog,my humanities is already FKed so fk it .”Did y'all study geography?” 

Studying for geog was never easy as I would have mental breakdown constantly.
I spent months prior studying for geography as the content is quite heavy, my parents won't be happy if I'm one mark away from getting an A :) . When will I be good enough for someone?

There's always this stigma when I did well. 
Every time an exam comes around, they would say ”confirm she would do well”, I said no (wasn't trying to be humble but I had very low confidence in doing well ) and people say ”Aiya, she confirm will do well, look at her notes la” ”stop lying that you won't do well la”🙃 

The thing is I took some time out to consult my geography teacher 3 days in a row to ask vital questions, ask for tips, clarify my doubts, ask my teacher to mark my 6 marks essay and I told her to go through with me and tell me how I can do better and what content I was lacking. 
All the questions I ask did come out for the exam💚(there was no hint given by the teacher or whatsoever)

I was happy. But no one clapped. But when someone else who added marks into his paper, 2 girls were screaming, GOT ANOTHER TOP FOR CHEM. Everyone clapped. Which was even more demoralising since he always gets top for most science and maths subjects.\n\nDuring Sec 4, it was my first time topping the class for an English exam, no one clapped. But when another guy who came in second, everyone clapped. The even effed up part was that he consistently did well for English. \n\nThere was always the stigma placed on me, especially since I come from a 199 pointer school, that I would end up with A1s for Maths and Science. I felt pressured.\n\nThe same thing happened in JC as well. People thinking that I would score well. People thinking that I would get As and Bs. People judging me for how I was studying for A levels even though it was term 2 or 3. I had people telling me ""Walao you studying now, you demotivating me from studying sia."" I felt pissed. Of course we are supposed to srudy hard, IT WAS A LEVELS AND PRELIMS??? I felt guilty and nvr studied in the classroom. I never went for consultations, never felt comfortable studying with friends, never show that I wanted to do well.\n\nThe feeling preceeded on to NS. The concept of the ""cock sucker"" or ""slut"" to superiors trickled down my mind. I felt uncomfortable exceeding my tasks. I felt uncomfortable to show my leadership skills. I always act blur just to pretend that I am not the teacher\'s pet.\n\nIf you are reading this, I want to let you know that the reason why they are doing this is because they are unmotivated to pass. It is their belief of them not passing which causes them to pass on the negativity. Really, the only way to do this is 1.to ignore 2.to help them score well for geog. Although you will not receive any benefits, at least you would have helped them boost their morale towards the subject.', ""Omai gosh exactly the same story as mine. In sec 3NA I just passed my geog in term 1 and everyone was very annoyed that I passed. I got even more annoyed that they didn't give a shit but for me I just studied even harder and got full marks for my eoy which was amazing. Be happy you scared high for your geog. Don't believe what others say of just passing. Aim high and score A1"", ""their understanding and validation is not required for your progress :) focus on what you're doing and I'm sure you will manifest most of your dreams!"", 'not really a similar story but still related,, i\'ll try to keep it short! \n\nnot to brag but my grades have always been pretty decent (i\'d always be aiming for As in secondary school though sometimes i\'d slip up and get a B/C) so yea talking about exam results to my friends has always been awkward? it\'s like getting an A puts you in a bad light sometimes...\n\nNow that I\'m in JC the conversations about results just seem to become even more uncomfortable? maybe it\'s because academics are alot harder in jc hmm like for example during this round of promos i got mostly Bs whereas some of my close friends were scoring Es and Ds and struggling to promote to j2. So when the topic of promos results came up i was always very hesitant to share,, like i\'d say ""oh yea they were okay"" and people would be like ""you say this confirm get B right"" and i\'ve never had a good answer to that so i tend to laugh and change the topic :""\n\nonce again, i\'m not trying to flex or anything but yea OP while i\'ve never really been in the situation where i was the only one who passed, i definitely relate to what you\'re feeling. \n\njust a word of advice though! honestly you\'ve worked hard and it\'s good that you\'re putting in the effort so don\'t let what anybody else says affect you alright you deserve the grades you got :-)', ""I think mine wasn't like that\n\nI wouldn't call mine a stigma but whenever it comes to sciences, well everyone already knew who scored the highest because it has always been a trend. I think the only person telling me to stfu would be my physics teacher LOL\n\nTook me a long time to stfu when I did well and complained I didn't do well(okay back then I was legit complaining abt stupid stuffs) \n\nAlso can I just say, LOL kinda funny that people think making notes means A when I think some of your classmates prob made notes. I rmb when I was in 3na, nobody gives a flying fuck and came out with a relation that notes->do well for exams\n\nSide note, geog isn't about making notes or whatever blah blah. You gotta understand and appreciate(if can) to do well for it. Also na geog essay is really just spitting out content and if I'm not wrong, schools usually teach 3 pts 2 examples and well if you're not scoring 6 it means your elab/content isn't that strong assuming you memorised the examples. So to summarise, notes is good (imo not rly for geog but eh) if you just need a quick recap but more importantly is to understand the content"", 'The reason why people try to bring you down is because they’re below you :)))\n\nKeep your head and spirits high, this attitude of yours will bring your far.', 'hi! i’m in sec 3 NA too :-) i would say that i’m above average for most subjects in my class but definitely not the smartest, and my class is quite intelligent too so most people usually pass everything. but since i would usually score better than most of my peers, whenever i tell them my score, they would roll their eyes at me and sometimes i feel so disturbed by that because not only are they not happy with my successes like a friend should be, they show it in front of me. & i get that they didn’t get the most ideal score, and i try to comfort them but i don’t really get anything in return(i don’t need anything in return, but maybe just don’t roll your eyes at me??? for the hard work that i put in???) and i get the part where you said that friends would always say “you’ll confirm do well” i do get that as well, it’s just fucking pressurising most of the time lol. & similar to you, how i do well is through hard work and lots and lots of consultations. we’re not naturally smart. and some people in school also mock me for studying so hard. in class, one of them would always say “ah you confirm study damn hard last night right” or like “you study so hard for what sia” and i would just sit there and not have any reaction. this is pressurising too. i never felt good about it, when it’s something i should be proud of. i can never show happiness for getting the marks i wanted because my friends are never happy with theirs. \n\nsometimes i like the pressure, i am also a person who is fuelled by competition(my class is extremely competitive), i’m also fuelled by pressure at the same time. but other times, it gets too hard to handle. \n\non a happier note, we are graduating next year!! (not me, as i want to continue with sec 5) but most of us are. so let’s just work hard for sec 4 and not let others’ actions or words affect us so much(easier said than done, i know) but that’s what we can do right now. continue working hard my friend!! if you ever need to rant to someone about this, or anything else for that matter, you can always message me!! all the best❤️', 'I try not to let that get in my head ... cause important to know who you are up against ... if your class all dun study and you study ... u should expect that you beat them', 'Screw them', 'Hello! It’s okay, they’re just jealous ignore them. In secondary school, everyone hated me because I was always the person who was never satisfied with her grades. For one of my Geog exam I scored 21/25 and nobody clapped lol everyone was just shocked and disgusted at the fact that I was the one who scored so high. Another classmate blatantly told my anther classmate that she’s happy at least she got the overall highest and not me (because we had other assignments counted on top of the test) Another is my SS SBQ where I passed the whole paper just by my SBQ section lol. \n\nTbh, really just ignore them because their greatest downfall will be your succeeding while they brood over the fact that you are better than them.', 'A bit hard for you to be the only one that pass tbh. Probability is quite low', ""Thank you for writing a story that I could at least relate to! I will ask them whether they need assistance with the subject. Here’s the thing, ask for help means asking for my notes / my answers to a specific assignment. Generally, I would say that I need to explain for you to understand but they told me I read, I can already understand. Either way, I feel culpable for not explaining to them as my answers were sophisticated and will be very fearful  if teacher ask to explain but they don't know how :<"", 'Your sec sch class was shit honestly', 'Not trying to be negative here. This is my far share of my point of view  \n\n\nIt voice down to your attitude, the way you view your goals is just one sided. What i am trying to say is that you are only look at yourself. Have some empathy and feel for others. Being alone can get you far but going as team you go further   \n\n\nI use your NS and Secondary school as an example  \n\n\n**NS:** In NS, why people say you ""bootlickers"" reason is because you dont stand with your fellow mates. If you are always going to just follow whatever the commander says then it just shows how bootlick you are. (example, if there is a quarrel in the bunk, no commander is present, then you sabo your bunk to tell your commanders)  \n\n\n**Secondary school**: 2 reason of that happening  \n\n\n1. You getting to much first place, which is not wrong but you ""humble brag"".  No ones like people that humble brag\n2. You are selfish, you dont help people that need help to achieve good grades (Good grades dont refer to A\'s or B\'s sometimes is just C\'s. To you getting A is good enough, to some other people getting a pass is good enough. If you managed to help that person, i believe the person will remember you for life', ""First things first, TWINNING 💓and I finally found someone who knows that feeling. Secondly, I always believe that when you work hard > your results will prove to you. I said that to my friends. Never is a good idea😀, they got infuriated. When my friend didn’t even bother to study for geography \n> fail > cry. I feel like you have to expect that your results will be terrible . It’s either from then on you try to improve,seek help or get worse. I'm aiming to get an A1 for geog next year that's why I'm preparing all the notes now during the holidays, I seriously need to know my self-worth more 🤧but anyways have a happy holiday!🌿💚"", ""ur class doesn't seem nice lmao u worked hard for ur results and they prolly didnt work as hard"", 'Oh, btw good luck with Sec 5! I have some thoughts about going to Sec 5 > JC too! \n\nOn a side note tho, people tend to see only the highlight reels and ignore all the behind scenes. Yes, feeling pressured 😩 and the remarks given by your peers are so relatable! It feels like a backhanded compliment when they say when you improved on your test “Of course, I did not expect you to ace that exam. Good for you."" When you are scoring well   - >\n”Wow, SO not expected of her to get those marks already ” 😃😀\n\nBut Jiayous! 💝', ""There were about 17-20 students in geography class, not a big group as many took literature instead but yeah the score sheet had every student names so all of them can see the names of students who pass as it is being highlighted with pale green !😁 \nyou're right tho, the odds of being the only one who pass are quite low 📉"", 'Ya lor if it smells like shit everywhere you go, maybe it’s time for you to check your own shoes. Cannot be OP so unlucky everyone from sec school to army pick on him unless his own attitude is obnoxious', '1. I did not humble brag at all. The teacher were the one who said the results. Besides when people ask me how my grades were, I only told them the number. Will I lie to them? maybe but I would not brag to them.\n\n2. I actually helped them out when they are in doubt. So really the second statement is really a false statement. Besides, even if I did help them, I can\'t get them to pull up their grades, because some of these people are addicted to gaming and hang out consistently without ever studying or doing hw. Sure you can tell me that the hw could be ineffective but the fact that they are unattentive in class especially during O level period, I cannot help them wake up, they need to wake up for themselves. And before you start assuming again, they don\'t even have part time jobs in sec school.\n\n3. I never even said people called me bootlickers but I kept on feeling pressured to not do well because of fear that people will see me as a bootlicker and the fear that I have to put up with high expectations occur again. \n\n4. You claim that I am not empathetic but really the fact that you claim that I did not help people, that I was selfish and that I was a ""humble brag"" was all assumptions made, who are you to say that I am not empathetic in the first place? I am only merely trying to share part of my experiences that have occured because of me being top in class for the sake of letting them understand that they are not alone and that these experiences are common, especially with people who clearly do not even understand that all they just want is to do well for exams, go to a nice course/jc and dont want to pressure themselves by setting high expectations. And the people I mentioned are not even people who are lower than me but rather scored at the same level as me for Maths and Science as well as better for English.(Note that I clearly said that I was top in English, I never said that what I got was a B and it was my first time receiving even a pass for English compared to the other person who scored Bs and passed consistently). \n\nI know that you are not trying to be negative, but really, this is a legit common feeling that I always have to see. People hating on other people who study earlier. People congratulating their own friends and not just classmates who did well for exams. People who look at nerds in disgust and just assume that they would do well when inside they don\'t feel like they would do well. I have people who ask me ""Why you study so early, why study so hard?"" The most screw up part is when people go like ""OMG I GOT HIGHER THAN YOU"" when actually I suck at a subject like humans or chinese. And then you telling me I am a humble brag. I only want to pass my exams and get high grades to go to good schools and courses and yet I have to feel anxious about how people view me if I screwed up something people view that I am good at.', 'Hahaha yeah thanks. If you need any help with geography, I can help you get A1 :)', 'Yea I did not really experience this but this attitude and mentality is SUPER common among students for some reason. Honestly nothing you can do about it apart from just ignoring the comments. Maybe try to find a group that will actually appreciate the work you put it for your grades, rather than spitefully telling you to be grateful/apathetically saying ""aiya you always get high mark one"". Those people that pressure you to study are really toxic, just ignore them. They just dw study and feel guilty when they see other people mugging hard. Even worse is those who purposely tell you to not study then mug hard at home to pull down the bell curve.']"

11475131,iwj13q,[Rant] - Discrimination towards N Level Students,2020-09-21 02:16:48,SGExams,77673,42,382,"I just felt like ranting anonymously and getting things off my chest. You may skip this post if you’d like to. 

 I’m perpetually tired of people discriminating N level students saying things like “you’ll never succeed in life” “ITE student ah?” “N level score 40 points?” “study so hard for what?” I’m sure that when we were 12, many of us did not see the importance of PSLE. When I was 12, I did not even know PSLE was such an “important” examination. I feel extremely livid when people create a stigma of us being low and are seem as less intelligent as compared to students from the express stream. 

I have friends who are in the normal academic stream, grappling with their parents divorce, facing financial difficulties at a young age. Despite all of that, they still work their hardest in their academics. People do not see the efforts and sacrifices they make and instead of encouraging them that they are doing well, they criticise and label all Normal (T) and (A) students as “lazy” or give hurtful remarks such as “useless” 

In schools, I would really appreciate it if teachers could also spare a thought for us N level students. I do know that Os are much more difficult than Ns and teachers would need to prioritise O level students more. But we are constantly being neglected. Just from my own personal experience: there was this once where I proposed the idea of having extra lessons for the n level students because Ns are usually earlier than Os. I’ve heard Teachers saying things like “the class confirm noisy, not productive” and Teachers preferring not to take the N level classes because they already have the perception of us being boisterous..

Do I feel hurt when people perceive us as someone who will never succeed in life? Yes. After all, it is the O levels that matters because it very much determines one’s future.... 

If you have made it till this far, thank you for reading this... I just needed a place to rant because I feel hurt :)

What I do hope tho is that people could possibly change their negative mindset and attitude towards N level students 🙂

**EDIT**: I have read all of your comments and I am eternally grateful for it. Thank you all for sharing your experiences and I am sure that N level students who are reading this will aspire to do better. Thank you once again. It is really heartwarming to see so many compassionate individuals in our society! ☺️♥️",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iwj13q/rant_discrimination_towards_n_level_students/,"['Educator here and the level of expectations for N Level students is negligible and it infuriates me to no end. \n\nWhen I was a student, I was in the equivalent of the IP stream. Teachers would constantly fuel us with elitist fodder that we’re the top of the nation while trampling upon the other streams. It was a mantra repeated constantly and I inadvertently became an elitist snob. It was only when I started teaching was I cognizant of the absurdity of it all. \n\nThere is no such thing as a stupid student, only a culmination of adults who have failed him/her along the way.\n\nI believe that students are self-fulfilling prophecies. If students are constantly told they aren’t good enough or that something is beyond their standards, then they will cease to maximise their potential.\n\nThat said, invest in speaking English well. \nWatch CNN or BBC & try to repeat certain words to get the intonation right. Enunciation leaves an instant first impression and it is something that can get you ahead without anyone knowing your qualifications and judging you for it.

My GPA was high enough to get into this programme called Stars (all the 4-Pointers got into Aces). The programme allows students to increase their GPA by doing community services or attending workshops and talks. So, I decided to join a talk about how Youths in Singapore can help in the future of Singapore. When I arrive at the talk, I was assigned into a group. I was intimidated as everyone there got better ideas than me whenever we held a discussion. Then there was a break, and my group decided to catch up on everyone. I was so surprised that most of them were in JC and Poly (handful of them were Uni students too). I felt embarrassed because I felt like an outsider due to me being in ITE.

As teachers, it’s literally their job to help out the students that they are teaching. I really hope that people will stop treating people differently based on their streams man, but it seems that there is still a long way to go.', 'From an N(A)-Level student perspective, I do understand how you feel. I want to share my personal experience with hopes of shining some lights upon students on the same boat.\n\nYes, I am a student from the Normal Academic stream. Sometimes, we do get criticism from students who are better than us. I am not going to mention who, but you would have guessed it by now if you are smart enough! Honestly, **I do feel it is up to us to either be a baby and cry over all those negative comments or grow stronger from those criticisms.**\n\nFrom what I read, I would like to compliment you for being able to realise what you did wrong when you were younger. Trust me, I used to game a lot during primary school times and always failed my mathematics, with the worst result being 21/100. I remembered being extremely nervous during the day when my PSLE result was given out. You know, young people don\'t really know what are the pathways back then, so we just got in what we got. I got posted for the Normal Academic stream. I remembered one statement which my uncle said, ""Don\'t worry ah boy, start afresh in secondary school. Learn from your PSLE experience and remember the emotions you had. Chiong for the best!""\n\nAs for why I think people look down on N-Level students, the biggest reason for it would be ""N level student cannot go polytechnic"". Well, that is true in the past, not now. **People, we have to move on with the times and adapt to the current education system.**\n\n4 years later, I received my N-Level results. I am actually surprised that I am eligible for the Polytechnic Foundation Programme (PFP). I defied all odds and made those who made fun of me drop their jaws. Some even came and ask how I did so well even though I am an N-Level student. My reply was simple, ""We are all humans."" Some cried happy tears during result day, while some cried the other type. We all have emotions, controlled by either ourselves or the situation regardless of who we are. Remembering what my uncle told me, it moved me to tears during that night when I was about to sleep.\n\nIt is the criticism which motivated me to work harder to prove them wrong.\n\nThere is a reason why we are separated into different pathways. This is to allow us to gauge what type of leaner we are and helps the Ministry to decide which stream to put us in so that we can learn at a comfortable pace. *Imagine if every student were to be placed in the same stream, what would happen to those who cannot cope with the demand? Really, I must emphasise that the stream you get into does not matter so long as you do your best. What matters most is your final pathway; diploma/degree etc. Your GCE examinations are only there to gauge you for the second time how you fare with your studies.*\n\n*Remember, at the end of the day, no matter N- or O-Level, we represent the same crest. While it is completely normal for humans to be insensitive from time to time, it is abnormal for us to look down on others as if we are entitled just because others are in a lower-tiered stream.*\n\nFor those taking the national examinations, I wish you all the best and hope to see you pass with flying colours! There is zero time left for you to cry over those negative remarks you have received. Focus fully on your paper and give your very best shot at it. This is your final lap, don\'t give up! **YOU CAN!**\n\nAt the end of the day, you should feel proud of what you have achieved and be grateful to have such a wonderful education system in Singapore. Remember to thank those who have journeyed alongside you for 16 years of your life: **Parents**. Don\'t forget your **teachers** too. In Chinese, we call this, ""别忘恩负义"". This simply means don\'t be ungrateful.  \n\n\n**For parents/guardian:**  \nYour child/ward really requires your support during this stressful period. Do your best to assist them with their needs to reduce their stress level. Monitor them closely but not to the point where they felt annoyed/irritated by your actions. COVID-19 may have tweaked the topics tested, but that does not mean they are not prepared for anything in their way! They are trained to challenge the setter of the paper by conquering the odds. Give them your best support no matter what. Remember, do let them decide on their pathway. If they are unsure of what pathway to take, encourage them to speak to the Education and Career Guidance (ECG) Counsellor.\n\nAll the best!  \n加油！', 'From someone in the express stream from an express/ip school, it also happens there but this time it’s the express students being dumb cause the ip kids are the “cream of the crop” and better than us cause they can go jc without Os.

I am very grateful that all the teachers from my sec school are very motivating and are willing to do so much for everyone no matter what stream they are in.', 'it really makes me soooo damn upset when my classmates gossip and discriminate against NA students and esp NT students, like there’s always smn btr than u like stop being so disrespectful. i feel like taping their mouths shut omg because personally i’m in express stream and my sister was once in NT stream. she wasn’t academically inclined, but she excelled in other aspects like IT stuff, social skills etc. these were things i could never figure out! \n\nas my sister was in sec sch, i could see how demoralised she was everytime she did badly in school or whenever smn in the exp stream said smth mean or looked down on her or what not, and it really broke my heart to see her like that, this really lowered her self esteem that even now she is in a considerably well known uni in aus after working hard, she still constantly beats herself up for being in NT before as it can never be erased and whenever she mentions it people will immediately view her differently or give weird looks and this is because of these social stigmas. \n\nI really hope people’s mindset change because altho i may not experience it first hand, i can only imagine how bad n level students might feel constantly being torn down. Honestly people, grades aren’t the only thing that define whether you are “smart” or not, n level students may excel in other expertise, like my sister is good in IT stuff, and honestly it’s so much more relevant in tdy’s context than what i’m able to do better at than her, which is just studies, also, everyone does sch so it’s nothing special anyway.\n\n hopefully schools will also try to avoid being discriminatory as well, tbh in my cca which is choir, so many NT students auditioned, yet none of them got in, what are the chances??? it has been this way for like my whole 4 years in choir and it’s rly sad to see that. also when my sister wanted to go media club, which requires no audition, and it’s p low demand among students, she didn’t even get it like ???? all her classmates were placed in either library club, red cross, npcc or like GB cus no one wanted those and not a single nt student got in media club either until my mum fought for her place, then they let a few nt students enter. that’s what i hate abt my sch, like what example r u setting wth\n\nto be fair there are also some super caring people and teachers that look beyond grades, i see some teachers being super patient but ofc there are some teachers who like still suck. also the school manages to make it seem like everyth is going well for the NA and NT students on the surface, like oh nice teachers but honestly my sister’s experience rly made me notice these rude little things people do', 'hi, i was an NA kid as well and graduated back in 2015. fully agree with what you brought up, and i hope that by sharing my story with you, it can inspire you and maybe change others\' impression of NA kids.\n\ni scored 199 at PSLE and chose to go to NA because i thought my school was pretty reputable in the North area (CCHY). wrong move. the school was disgustingly discriminatory against NA students.i couldn\'t take HMT/comb. bio/chem, pure humans (lit/hist) and music **because i was in NA**. i was stuck with comb. phy/chem and POA. got 13 raw for N\'s so teachers advised me to go for Sec 5. however, i only passed three subjects at O\'s, my L1R5 was 33 raw. \n\ni went to MI and told myself that it\'s a new start and i won\'t let my subject combi restrict me. i took the subject combi i wanted and did well for A\'s (4 dists), and i\'m now in NTU doing my dream course. i know that nobody can stop me from achieving my dreams, even if PSLE and O levels and some teachers along the way did not approve of me. \n\nsome words to the NA kids here: believe you can go far in life, don\'t succumb to the labels of our education system. it doesn\'t matter how long you take, as long as you get there. and as A.A.Milne puts it, ""rivers know this: there is no hurry. we\'ll get there someday.""', 'tbh as a sec five student\nidt o level is very difficult compared to n levels\nstudents with 187 can only go na streams and students with 188 can go either express or na\nidt that one mark gap is that big\nfrom what ik my pri sch classmates with 183 made it to pfp and my schoolmates with scores of 199 had a emb3 of 18 points\nbut some express kids clearly don’t understand the fact that they are just slightly better\ni know of people with psle scores of 193 discriminating na kids and ite like ??? ik you got into your sec sch as a express kid but you are nothing different compared to people who scored the same but chose to go na', 'Current secondary school student in express stream. I definitely can see the discrimination towards students in NA and NT stream, but in my school at least the teachers care.\n\nThe teachers focus a lot in both express, NA and NT streams, and I do see the students in other stream having fun, being stressed out and yet, studying hard.\n\nThe teachers encourage consultation lessons (I see many of my NA and NT friends regularly ask for consultation) with students that they think  need help or have anything to clarify.\n\nThey voluntarily accompany students to help them as well, despite leading busy lives.\n\nHowever, as OP shared, I can see the discrimination. On the flip side, we have certain teachers in the minority that think of teaching NA and NT as degrading and not worth their time. I hope this discrimination will be lessened in the future.', 'Hey, I’m also a student. First, we just gotta accept that this is the nature of our education system. In our result-oriented society, we tend to pay more attention to the best performers. This is the sad truth of our education system and also our society to some extent. I strongly suggest for you to strive to be the best you can given what you have. Maybe your teachers don’t want to help, I sure there’s still your friends, your family and many other people who are willing to lend you support. You can’t really do a lot to change the elitist mentality of people because it’s just ingrained in our society, and crying over spilt milk doesn’t help but only demoralizes you further. So yes, strive to bring out the best in yourself in these circumstances, life’s too short to worry about these things. All the best mate 👍', ""Hey, uh...so many wonderful folks have shared their experiences on this thread, but I would like to bring an alternate and more positive experience of the interactions between N-Level students and the other streams. Gonna get a little nostalgic here, hope everyone doesn't mind 😅\n\nMy secondary school's culture was...unique in many good ways. When we first came in, there was a slight awkwardness, with 4 Express classes, 2 Normal Academic classes and 1 Normal Technical class. As time passed through CCAs and inter-class challenges like cheers and camps and all that, not to mention various school outings where Express, Normal Academic and even Normal Technical students get 'campuk' together helped us to bond pretty well. I am from the Express Stream and yet some of my closest friends are from the Normal Academic Stream too thanks to the fact we share the same CCA (in fact we still keep in contact with each other to this day). \n\nThe teachers too, now that I look back on it, were fortunately not like those that OP described, but in fact, quite focused on the weaker students, regardless of stream. To give a perspective, one of the Math teacher who taught an Express class E Math and A Math was also the form teacher of a Normal Academic class. And he was equally invested in both classes to help them do their best when the time came. \n\nAnd you know what's best? Some schools segregate the various streams, but my school does not do that. In fact, all streams in the same cohort get to interact and mix together freely with no such restrictions. And through these interactions we understood each other much better than ever before, seeing beyond just a 'stream' that doesn't really affect us in the long term. \n\nAs an East Zone school, we have indeed drawn quite a bit of flak from other (ahem, atas...)East Zone schools for doing this sort of thing, so sometimes even the Express students get discriminated against. Luckily, it's all worked out. If there is anything to prove, is that we are after all human beings with our own aspirations, dealing with an imperfect educational system and trying to find our place in the world. Stuff like 'streams' doesn't mean much at all in a bigger scheme of things, because it is just a label-a useless one in determining one's character and morality.\n\nAnd this is probably a long shot, but to all my fellow Crestians who might be reading this, I'm sorry I took this all for granted back then, I realize how fortunate we all were to know one another on a deep and personal level. Wherever y'all may be, I wish nothing but the best for ya. \n\nAnd to OP, don't let those haters get to you. Always remember that in the long run, labels aren't gonna matter at all, break free from the system's chains and overcome through your own effort and tenacity. No matter your plans for the future, keep in mind to always maintain a healthy mind, body, heart and spirit so that you can face the challenges ahead on your special path. Gambate! 💪"", ""Only slightly related but I've heard that some of the calculus questions for N level Add Math are more difficult than that for O level add math\n\nIt's genuinely aggravating that some teachers are like this.

And they had ever allowed the fact that they had to spend one more year in secondary school to hold them back.\n\nMany did well for their Os, even better than some of their peers from the express stream. Quite a number went on to finish their degrees, one even won academic awards in poly and in university.\n\nDo not let how others view you affect what you can achieve.

So is the complete opposite of your situation. \n\nYet, I can relate to the place you are in because I was in a express/IP school and the school clearer cared a lot more about the IP kids than us.

When in fact they were as kind or if not even kinder then the express students in my school. As an express kid who was in the lower banded class, my teachers would always use the phrase “later y’all demote to NA and NT. Do y’all better bark up now and don’t go down that route” and it never sat right with me. I never understood what was so bad about taking N-Levels and then going onto ITE and at Sec 1 I was always asking “whats so wrong with ITE” I mean. It’s a school, they teach and students learn different skills, the teachers are nice, they have better facilities and they gain experience. \n\nBecause of CCA I made friends with many of my cohorts NA and NT students and they were always working hard, I remember one time when i studied with them before CCA one friend was having trouble solving the question and I didn’t study that subject so I wasn’t sure how to answer it and I just asked “why not go consult the teachers” and she just replied “as if they have time for me. They’re all busy helping the Os students” and I was confused because I mean Ns were coming up first and Os were further away so shouldn’t the teachers be prioritizing the NA and NT students. \n\nbut ofc this was the handful of teachers that were in school (that generation kind of teachers) and my friends clarified that with me and said it was mostly the older teachers with that kind of mentality so I was glad that the younger teachers in my school were at least more fair. But the problem with it was that because of the phrase some of these teachers tell us, express students sometimes look down on the NA and NT students in my school and because I had so many friends from the stream I would try to put in a good word and stop them from bad mouthing the NA and NT students. But they would just reply “why you protecting them for what.” (I’m not friends with them anymore but I was always angry with those instances.) \n\n\nBut one of my NT friend came up to me and said “don’t need to stick up for us, they won’t change their mindset anytime soon, there’s no use, don’t create trouble for yourself” and it made me cry. \n\nI mean I know how hard y’all study I’ve seen how hard y’all study to do better, to get to where you are and to make yourselves proud. \n\nAnd I’m sorry that y’all have to go through this, I wish there was a way that I could help out more (I’ve graduated now) but I hope you pull through, no matter where you end up.

pessimisticdaisy,ke6nq8,[JC] [Poly] Deciding my future,2020-12-16 18:14:12,SGExams,77673,16,16,"hi its been awhile since i made a post, but after olevels its time for me to decide my next path.

for context, im in the 90th to 100th percentile in a neighbourhood school. im someone who studies when theres a need to, but not the type to go all out and revise after every school day. 


firstly, JC. in my friend group and family, im probably the smarter few and due to the stigma of the whole jc going to uni issue, friends and family encourage me to go to jc. but for me, i never really enjoyed studying especially for subjects that i dislike, (chinese, humans) which ill obviously have to take in jc. theres also this constant fear that since my motivation drives on being better than others, ill have a terrible mentality going into jc as there will be others who are far smarter than i am

POLY: im mainly looking into the computing courses, and i do have an interest in that but the only reason im not leaning towards poly just yet is because im not 100% committed. im wary of the group projects and all that, and i think ill be fine. however it just haunts me to think that ill be missing my “mugging” attitude by not taking up a jc and having to work doubly hard in a poly to get to a uni. 

so all in all, im leaning towards poly because i have a push factor from jc and a pull factor towards poly, but no definite answer just yet



so, i wanted to ask. what was the deciding factor that ultimately lead to your current choice? was getting to university taken into account? thanks!!",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ke6nq8/jc_poly_deciding_my_future/,"['Do note that computing majors in local universities are very competitive and difficult to get into. So you might want to consider which option will give you a higher chance of admission into a computing course in NUS/NTU.', ""Who said humanities is compulsory in JC? Yes a contrasting subject is needed but u can take econs which I don't think shd be considered a humanities subject. And u don't really know if there will be many people who u think are smaerter than you until u go to a JC."", 'Hey first of all, congrats for a milestone reached ! I know how tedious it can be to make such a decision, especially at such an age. \nLooking back about a few years ago, I am too at your position making my choice, just that I knew for sure that JC wasn’t at all my fit and the only thing I am thinking about are the choices among the different Polytechnic and also courses. \n\nFirst of all, take what I’m about to say with a pinch of salt. I just graduated from Polytechnic and this is my view and reason why I didn’t regret one bit of my decision. \n\nIf you were to ask me the main thing that I lose out from my JC friends is definitely time. The 1 year of extra time. \nBut I would say there is a lot to gain from going to Poly. \nFirst would be exposure. \n\nIt’s more towards the opportunities that Poly put us into. The environment as well as the lectures that has mostly been in the industry that you are studying in. \nSo that make them not just our teachers or lectures but most importantly our mentors. And I see that as valuable as connections that we make for ourself as we step into the society. \n\nGoing beyond exposure, there are also more opportunities for us to interact with people from different “fields” or courses through CCAs or compulsory modules such as (General Education) or (Innovative project). Some way or another, there will definitely be some compulsory Modules in Poly (no matter which course you are taking) that requires you to work with people from other courses. Again, that give you more exposure and connections to people from different places. \n\nNext, would definitely be more time. As straightforward as it is, since We have 1 extra year compared to the JC path, we too have more time to think about what we want, where we want to head to. \n\nLast but not least, it’s a buy 1 get 1 free package. As you mentioned, yes, we might not want to stick with our course that we are studying upon graduation, and it’s totally okay. I can say almost 80-90% of the people in my course (or seniors) end up going to another field when they go for a degree. The downside ? We need to learn and pick up\nMore as we transition to a new field. And I’m sure that is totally okay and cool. Hey, we need to keep learning. Learning doesn’t stop. \nAnd the thing is, we get a diploma in a field, and a degree in another. That’s a buy one free one bundle isn’t it? Unless you do plan to specialise in something, then getting the same diploma as your degree will be a plus. \n\nAll in all, it really depends on what you hope to achieve out of your tertiary education. There is no wrong or right path. Only one that best suit your needs and your wants. \n\nI would like to remind you, don’t bother about what other thinks. Know what best suit for yourself and go for what you want. \n\nFor me, Poly has been one of the best few years of my life. Go join CCAs, go interact and make friends. Of course, GPA also Works on consistency, so don’t forget to balance your social, leisure time well with your academic life. \n\nAgain, take what I said with a pinch or salt, but I hope this gave you a better idea of how Poly is like! All the best in your future aspirations !', 'The deciding factor to choose JC over poly would be my learning style. I prefer a more academic rigorous way of grading and the environment. The lecture tutorial and then assessment methods is more suited for me.\n\nAlso, I am also not as clear on the course I want to enroll in. So JC provides me 2 years time or clarifying this. \n\nGetting into university is also taken into account. To me , taking the JC route is a shorter and easier route to get into university. \n\nso I chose JC at the end. Took HELM combination. Mugged a lot as I have to practice my answering techniques and familiarise myself with the neccessary content and concepts. Apart from that , the school life in JC is more enriching with new friendships and more engagement in CCA.\n\n*_In my opinion, when it comes to decision on going to JC or poly, clarity of future aspirations and related course to take, preferred learning style are key factors to consider._*U might want to find out more from those who take computing courses in poly for a better understanding of what to expect for it.', ""Well for me, it was the fact that it was 2 years in JC compared to the 3 years in poly and also some part that wasn't very sure with my poly course that I wanted. I'm not sure about poly. but JC does provide the quickest and most direct way to Uni in my opinion (I maybe wrong, so take it with a grain of salt :)) \n\nAlso I graduated JC and took PCME 4H2s with GP, MTL (Chinese) and H3 Chem. I also came from a neighbourhood school and didn't do too bad in exams so i hope my experience in JC can help you decide.\n\nI have since graduated JC, but I can say that it was kind of a mess for me. It wasn't too tiring but it wasn't the most enjoyable either. In my first year, I was more prioritized on my CCA as we had an event, but after that I felt kind of empty as I grew close to only my CCA mates and not my classmates, so I spent most of that time studying at home which helped to pull my shitty grades from the mid-year exams. But in year 2, it was a bit more tough with COVID and stuff. So I did spend majority of the year studying. But usually the first half of the year would be more enjoyable with activities before rushing through to exams. \n\nSome people do mug all the time but tbh we do enjoy some time away from studies too. But i think it depends on the school you go to as each school has a different culture\n\nThe syllabus is quite hefty and really sometimes it may seem daunting, but I personally did not have the most difficult learning curve as it was partially an extension from secondary school. But it could be difficult for some with the new concepts which are sometimes confusing. Also i think some schools offer computing, so you can take that up as a subject if you wanted to. \n\nBut this was my experience and why I actually decided to go to JC, it may not be true for everyone who enters JC so I hope this can give you some clarity. \n\nps. I didn't talk about poly as I have no idea how it is there, maybe someone else can give their experiences?"", 'wherever you go there will always be people smarter than you, so no point worrying about that. im also kinda in a jc vs poly dilemma, but mostly because i found things im interested in in both poly and jc. i suggest u spend some time and look through the poly courses and the syllabus to see if any of them interest you and u can imagine urself studying that for 3 years. you can also ask yourself whether ur top utmost priority is getting a degree asap then start working, or u want to gain work experience first before going into uni.', 'Wow your studying style and all is just like me!! I don\'t cram hard ( hell I never even touched those workbooks after primary school) but I do still do my own notes at my own pace etc\nFor me, I chose Poly. Not because I even like the course I\'m in (I\'m interested in it and I do well in it academically but it\'s not something I\'d like to do as a career) but because of my very own style of studying/work ethic. Poly life, you have to be an independent learner (although there\'s still a lot of support from your mentors) and do a lot of groupwork. But I like the fact that its all ""your time, your target"". You don\'t do the work, you bear the consequences~ simple as that. \n\nTbh I flourish in this kind of "" flexible"" environment because I\'m not required to cram or mug; I determine my own pace, my own targets and when I match them I get my GPA and I\'m happy. I\'m not told to do xxx amount of worksheets or told to cram, poly gives me the option and resources to do so but I set my own way of studying.\n\nThat\'s my take on choosing poly! If you\'re considering because it\'s not really a course you\'re passionate about then I\'ll just say that you can do well in it, maybe be the top 10% of your group, then maybe during poly you can think about what you really want. Then you can use university as that stepping stone with your ~top 10%~ badge of honour haha', '>for context, im in the 90th to 100th percentile in a neighbourhood school. im someone who studies when theres a need to, but not the type to go all out and revise after every school day. \n\n* For JC, it is more of you have to try and study every day but what matters the most is Promotional exams, PW and A levels. Plus you need to focus MORE on time management btw cca and studies compared to poly. However, for poly, although you may remain rmb the content for like a semester or 2 sems, you have to srudy consistently because each test you take will be part of your gpa. Once you screw up, it will affect your gpa.\n\n>firstly, JC. in my friend group and family, im probably the smarter few and due to the stigma of the whole jc going to uni issue, friends and family encourage me to go to jc. but for me, i never really enjoyed studying especially for subjects that i dislike, (chinese, humans) which ill obviously have to take in jc. \n\nAlthough there are humans like geog and humans, the most common subject people take is economics as a contrasting subject. Other subjects in this category that may interest you: China studies in *English*, Art(H1 only focus on study of visual arts so no need draw), Theatre Studies and Drama(only H2), H2 music(only H2). And there is MI which has commerce subjects(Managment of business and POA) instead of humans but do note only MI has it and it is for 3 years.\n\nAs for Chinese, I guess you cannot escape it. However, you can be able to drop to MT B though it will not be included in your rank points, but it depends on different JCs.\n\n>theres also this constant fear that since my motivation drives on being better than others, ill have a terrible mentality going into jc as there will be others who are far smarter than i am\n\nAs much as I want to say this is true, it can also happen in poly. I have a friend in IT and he said that he had to a course which has a combi of normal people and people who are extremely good at coding. It is more about grit, perseverance and positive attitude.\n\n>im mainly looking into the computing courses\n\nWe have H2 Computing in JC. But yea, poly computing courses are relatively better in terms of technical skills.\n\n>however it just haunts me to think that ill be missing my “mugging” attitude by not taking up a jc and having to work doubly hard in a poly to get to a uni\n\nI guess working doubly hard in poly to go uni is true but the ""mugging"" attitude still exists in poly. Just that is not consistent and not throughout the whole poly duration unlike jc. However, this can mean more time to focus on other stuff like CCAs and part time jobs.\n\n>so, i wanted to ask. what was the deciding factor that ultimately lead to your current choice? was getting to university taken into account? thanks!!\n\n* Aim to go to university AND whether the diploma I am taking can lead me to the course that I want. (Rmb benefit of poly is 4 years shorten to 3 years)\n* Interests, what prog do they offer, what cca do they offer, any volunteering opportunities/overseas opportunities, where can I internship etc.\n* Distance travelled(mostly for those in JC), School fees(Poly fees tend to be more expensive compared to low and mid tier JCs), Freedom(You can still enjoy JC but in terms of free time, poly is better but do note that you might accidently overdo it.)', ""I am a year 3 poly student in a computing course and personally, I regret taking this route. While my grades are sufficient to get me into any of the top unis (3.9 gpa currently, but still got 1 last sem to go sooo), I know of the difficulty ahead of me if I were to choose to pursue a computer science degree which is maths (i am probs choosing this course anyways but its a headache). \n\nPoly really doesnt give you much exposure to mathematics which is very important in uni cs and you will end up having a disadvantage in this aspect when compared to the jc students. Also, it takes like 3\\~4 years( since it starts like 4 months later than jc) to graduate and wastes a lot of your time and most of it is spent holidaying which is fking stupid but also shiok.\n\nFor group projects, it really depends on your luck on teammates and I was lucky to have a team who was strong and cooperative but I do know of many other people who were very unlucky and often had complaints. It is also important to be consistent in poly to get a high gpa, I know of many who scored badly for just one heavy credit module and it pulled down their gpa by a lot.\n\nHowever some advantages of poly I have experienced is that it made me more outspoken since I had to do a lot of presentations in my course and I was such an introvert before all this. It also gives you quite a lot of freedom but honestly for CS path, just choose fking JC for the maths. (Sorry for the vulgarities, just real pissed at myself for not having studied hard enough for sec :'))\n\nTLDR; Choose JC, gives you a better foundation of maths for uni CS, shortens the time you will spend on education, easier to get into uni."", 'Hihi! One of the reasons that I considered was whether I would be limiting my own choices of courses in university (if you want to go uni). This is because when entering JC, you are able to study a wide variety of subjects and are less limited in what courses you can study as compared to poly where you’ll be studying something more specialised. Imo, interest alone isn’t enough to take a specific subject in poly because I know people that ultimately give up on that course simply because they are unable to get into a course in uni (again, disclaimer) or there are already a lot of people with a diploma in that course from poly. So I think other than entering university, you must also consider the courses you want to take in university and the potential job prospects from obtaining said diploma in poly/degree in uni', 'I would recommend you to go to poly. \n\nReason being: \n1) You mentioned you do not enjoy studying subjects that you dislike >> if you do not enjoy studying the subjects in JC, you will suffer in terms of your results. Rmb if you are aiming for a spot in local Uni, esp good courses, you have to do very very well for A levels in order to secure a spot in a local Uni. \n\n2) You mentioned that you have an interest in computing, that alone is enough to go computing in poly. With hard work and sheer determination, I am sure you will be able to do well. Ok la even if you did not manage to do well to get into a local Uni, worst case scenario, at least you have your diploma as a back up compared to a subpar a level cert (if your a levels cannot bring you to a local Uni you are pretty screwed, I mean you can also consider taking priv degree but rmb that a subpar a level cert would not grant u a full time job compared to a local diploma, so die die have to complete Uni or reroute to poly. \n\nPlus I personally feel that the competition is JC is very strong. In National exams, you are and will be competing against the super smart students (A levels is unlike O levels, A levels have IP students as well) \nSince you mentioned that you have a terrible mentality going into JC as there will be others who are far smarter than you are. There you already know it. Of course, I didn’t say it is impossible to do well but are you confident that your a levels grades can take you into local Uni? \n\nIf I were you, I will go to poly and work doubly hard. Actually if you are aiming for local Uni, can go to JC first. JC students stand a higher chance to get into a local u as compared to a poly student. However, do note that A levels is extremely tough and only the best can make into competitive courses in a local u. \n\nIf you were to ask me what was the deciding factor that ultimately lead to my current choice (I attended poly instead of jc back then, took diploma in biz mgmt) \n1) I was not confident that I am able to do well for a levels (I suck at science tbh, I struggled with my sciences and I know H2 Chem is not easy ) so jc was out. I wanted to take up MI (3  year A levels course bc they offered biz as an A level subj but I was afraid of GP I heard Gp is rly tough???? And I knew if I don’t do well for a levels, i literally have no where to go (cannot get into a proper Uni or cannot work)/reroute to poly compared to a local diploma whereby even if my grades are v cui I still can use my diploma to work even if I don’t make it into a local u/ work experience to enter local Uni. \n\nBe smart and tactful in your choice that’s all I have to say?????? No doubt that JC is deem as more prestigious, but at the end of the day, you ask yourself what you want to achieve? No point listening to your friend group and family because at the end of the day, It’s you who decide your career path. \nFor me I didn’t regret the decision of entering poly; I can say that poly was the most fun time of my life compared to Os when O levels was just memorising content in order to be qualified for A levels.. and then local Uni when I clearly know I hated Chem and physics so badly I wanted to die) lmao. \n\nAll the best OP!! Evaluate the pros and cons of jc vs poly and think which suits u more (don’t have to conform to your friends and family). :))) \n\nMy take is 100 percent poly', 'LOL just go JC.  its not that hard. esp. when you think that you are smart\n\nEven if you fail, you are going to private university anyways, which is kinda the same end point as a poly grad.', 'In both options (jc/poly) one will need straight As for NUS/NTU computing. For NUS, the tenth percentile is AAA/A or 3.8+.\n\nThough I may be biased, I feel it would be easier to do well in poly as the competition is among your diploma cohort (100+ students), you will just need to be better than 100 people to be at the top. In JC, you’re competing against many many others, some are super scorers in math and sciences.', 'Here comes a future minister hahahahahahahhaaha', ""i dont know much about this but, what if they offer more spots to jc students than poly students? ie. for a total of 50 spots, only 3 are given to top poly students, 47 are given to jc students. then you'll need to be top 3 in your poly cohort compared to being top 47 in your jc cohort... :')"", 'You can’t compare absolute values in this manner fairly. My comparison for 100 students in poly to 12k students in jc was to get a 3.8+ gpa (AAA/A), not for uni admission. In addition, there’s no conclusive proof to say that poly students are disadvantaged in terms of uni places provided. \n\nEither way, one will need a straight A score for good computing courses. If OP feels that he can do well in a  one-off high pressure A level exam, it would be better as it takes 2 years compared to 3. Also consider that poly may be easier as the competition isn’t very good compared to JC. (Only approx 40% of poly students aim for uni. The others just want a diploma to start work)']"

Some background, I'm a girl in uni year 1, I got to know this guy (j2 taking As now) through a friend.

massivePP_123,ial45e,[O LEVELS] scoring 15 points but went to ITE,2020-08-16 11:04:41,SGExams,77673,62,507,"hello, this is a very sad case but i scored 15 for Os and went to ITE. The whole world was against my idea of enrolling into ITE after Os but i didn't had a choice back then. I failed my Math F9, Eng D7 despite getting L1B4 15. I only got 7 choices on my report slip and all of them were choices into ITE. I was devastated upon receiving my results on 13 Jan 2020 just because of that 1 or 2 subject. I got A1 for English in Literature (pure lit), A2 for combined humanities (geo/ss) but idk how i still failed my english. Yes i know it is super ironic because all my teachers were shocked, friends were stunned, and even O lvl private candidate invigilators for O lvl Oral exam 2020 (yesterday) asked me why i decided to waste my time in ITE when i could have just retook O lvls without stressing on both ITE and O lvls. My DAE application was rejected, so as EAE this year—what a luck hahaha sobs.... I did apply for retaking Os this year and am already in preparation. To be honest, i couldn't stand preparing 1 year just for O lvls it might drive me into su¡c!dal thoughts as I'm already very depressed. So i chose the harder way by managing both in learning ITE course(and scoring above average) as well as trying my best for O lvls. This year has been super hectic for me. Im taking a leap of faith and hope that i will do well and decide which path i will continue next year. Perhaps JC bc i can mug haha. ITE isn't as bad as people describe. I am making lots of friends in higher nitec and i notice they study harder than some of the people I've seen in year 1 poly. It's time to change your mentality everyone. Throw that stigma away.

As a hiring manager who literally spent the last 3 months looking for a replacement for the who left. It\'s not easy for us either. I am hoping to make it easier for both sides\n\nWhen you are going for an interview, what we are looking for is commitment, basic competency, understanding of basic concepts.\n\nFor the first one on commitment, it\'s very easy, the key here is to NOT BE A FKING IDIOT. Don\'t talk about work life balance and not doing OT. Show that you are actually interested in the job. Do research of the company and the job. These are very basic stuff and can be easily done. I face palm so hard about idiots bashing that thread on the guy complaining about some moron talking about work life balance and clowns defending those morons and justifying their actions. Seriously WTF. The hiring manager is not rejecting you because the job doesn\'t provide work life balance, he is rejecting you for being a complete idiot and not showing any hunger in wanting the job. Showing hunger is simply showing the interviewer you want the job and not being a complete idiot, it is that simple\n\nThe fact that you wouldn\'t even consider OT is a big red flag to us about your level of commitment. This is not to say you cannot ask about it or you need to resign to being a slave and work 12 hrs every day. Just be smart about it. During an interview you will ALWAYS have opportunity to ask questions. That those opportunity to ask about how much OT you can expect and what kind of compensation you will be getting if you do OT. You can judge from there whether or not that\'s too much for you and whether or not the compensation is fair. Alternatively you can negotiate this when HR actually makes an offer and starts negotiating terms with you. That\'s the clearest sign that the company has already decided to hire you and that\'s the time you make your demands. What is NOT OK is you start making demands during an interview when they are trying to ascertain whether or not you are worth their time\n\nFor the 2nd one of competency, know your stuff. Whatever you learn in school, make sure you know them. The things you put down in your resume, make sure it\'s not total BS or at the very least when asked you are able to talk about it with no problems. This is especially obvious to people in the tech field. Since we check on your previous work we will ask stuff that you would have learned in school or your previous job. As a hiring manager in IT, I have a set of tech questions I go through with all my candidates, whether or not they are BSing me, I can easily gauge from those questions. And if anyone is wondering why I\'ve not been able to hire anyone for the last 3 months almost ALL my candidates failed this part, it has nothing to do with their ""high wage demands"" because it never got to the stage of offering the position and negotiating terms\n\nFinal one, knowing basic concepts, research on the job and jobscope, go do your homework and study the skills listed on the job posting before you head for the interview. I recommended one of my interns to a friend working at the Big 4, friend of mine was so desperate to hire someone he literally sent him a list of stuff to read before attending the interview so he could breeze through the tech parts, the idiot didn\'t bother and he failed the interview. Don\'t be that guy\n\nAnd no don\'t bother about the whole local vs FT thing. It\'s a freaking myth to begin with. Most hiring managers prefer locals over foreigners, this is especially true during this period since no one can get FTs into the country anyway. If you didn\'t get the job you must have screwed up somewhere nothing to do with FT. If you are sending tons of resume out and didn\'t get an interview, work on improving your resumes. If you are getting interviews but not getting any offer, work on getting your interviewing skills. High wage demands is usually the least likely reason. If you think your wage demands might be too high, just say it\'s negotiable. Most times, HR will tell you whether or not they can meet or are able to match your offer\n\nAs with all my other comments on this topic, I fully expect this one to be downvoted to oblivion. You can listen to all the clowns in Reddit about the totally ridiculous BS how you should be the one making stupid demands during interview and blaming the POFMA worthy BS about hiring managers preferring FTs. Or you can listen to an actual hiring manager tell you what we are looking for and how hard it is to actually hire the right person.', 'Exercise', ""Animal crossing and Netflix.

CouteauBleu,jusgzn,"Do any of you go to Social Development Network events, and what do you think of them?",2020-11-16 04:09:04,singapore,378760,20,37,"Hello,

I'm a complete foreigner who heard about Singapore's Social Development Network from hackernews.

The idea sounded really interesting to me, and I've found some articles describing the principle of the institution (it's a government agency that coordinates private dating/social companies, organizes events and does general outreach), but I have found very little about how well it works in practice.

Have any of you gone to one of these events? What are they like?

Also, private dating sites normally have a common failure mode of attracting a lot of men and a proportionally small number of women, which means men end up competing for women's attention a lot. Does the SDN have this problem? Or is the gender ratio generally balanced?

Speaking more generally, what are the demographics of the people who attend here? If you go to these events, do you expect to meet people representing the general Singapore population, or are some subgroups more likely to show up? Also, I'm told that the network has had a bit of a stigma attached to it for a long time. Is it still the case?

*think of your darkest hour, and all the beautiful rays of light or the happiness and peace and laughter in between then and now, when perhaps youre beginning to struggle again. you got through that, and dude trust me it’s not easy to struggle through these things. you are going to get through this, as you've done before. and you’re never alone. rooting for yall*

i remember preparing for Os this time last year, and feeling like consistently suicidal w/ my crippling anxiety and cyclical emotional fluctuations. was stressed that my grades were slipping, especially in a particular subject X i used to like ascertain my value as a person and self-worth. a lotta my friends were like level 800 muggers. i was ridiculously unmotivated because of a sheer lack of energy. now, i'm absolutely failing subject X again after Os lol. but basically i'm realising more and more how trivial grades are. of course this won't stop you from stressing about that upcoming exam. but as i hear stories of just how truly and wonderfully people can make a suitably happy and fruitful life for themselves without desperately clinging onto a set of grades, esp as society moves towards like a less traditional route in the erm job market, i'm beginning to see that there are so many more paths one can walk down in life. the academic system is no longer as narrow and elitist (i say this in like a career opportunities sense not a social stigma sense)- no one cares if you got one set of good grades and entered a particular school years ago. i suppose it's also counterproductive to push yourself until you break or lose your grip on... the beautiful person you are?? because of grades, which are so, so fleeting and temporary. Olvl six pointers failing JC vvv common, i'd know... IP kids, GEP kids, struggling to promote, also vvv common. we try so so hard but ultimately, at the end of it all, this is imo haha if u guys would agree; but isn’t it a little bit of a chasing after the wind? grades cannot be traded for worth; it’s not guaranteed no matter how hard we push ourselves, and yet we still jeopardise our mental health for it. it's a life lesson we come to grips with slowly; in the same way, i encourage you guys to tryy to take care of you, a deserving and wonderful and strong person. take care of your mental and physical health. you'll be a tiny bit more refreshed and calm as you tackle the intimidating mundaneness of your course content. and for what it's worth, i'll just say again that you are not your grades.

** i feel like there's increased awareness about mental health, but i've personally yet to see a reduction in stigma. as someone with anxiety disorder and attention deficit disorder, i just wanna say i have gone thru years of school carrying mental disorders on my shoulders and my heart aches for u guys. i've seen judgment and i've seen a severe lack of understanding from teachers and classmates about this kinda thing. :( i'm also here to say that if you have a mental condition that affects your ability to concentrate in any way, don't let judgment from peers hinder you from getting the help u need, applying for the extra time that you need. those who judge you will never make for bosom friends.**

Glioblastoma21,iypk4z,[A Levels] What is the culture like in your JC?,2020-09-24 11:33:55,SGExams,77673,64,43,"I'm sure many of you have already seen the various posts enquiring on the cultures of the various JCs. I have a few questions of my own, please entertain them if you have your own/friends' experiences to share! I'm sure they will help many of us make informed decisions next January. 

**RJC** : Is it true that RJC is a ""mugging school""? Are students toxic and aloof towards one another? Is there an air of elitism among the top students? I come from a ""neighbourhood school with an elite name"", so my biggest concern is that I will be looked down upon and ostracized by my peers. RJC will likely be my first choice, unless the experience will be difficult for me. 

**EJC** : Many people on this subreddit have discouraged me from going to EJC, as they claim that the school discriminates JAE students, while they treat IP students like kings and queens. I'm well aware that 60-70% of the students come from CHIJ st Nicholas, Catholic High and SCGS, so it is expected that integrating into already-formed cliques will be a Herculean task. However, the ""toxicity"" that current EJ students speak of is far more severe than that. Some EJ students on this subreddit have mentioned that while the aforementioned IP students were still in their respective Sec schools, their teachers often aggrandized them and reminded them that ""they are the top 1% of SG"". They also say that EJ students ""look down on JAE students"" because of this brainwashing. So, is EJ really as elitist as some students make it out to be? Will I be able to integrate into EJC comfortably as a JAE student? What is the culture like in EJC? 

**NJC** : ""If you leave your study notes, phone and computer on a bench and go somewhere else for 5 minutes, only your notes will be stolen"" is an anecdote that I often hear. NJC is also another school that my friends have dubbed a ""mugging school"". Are the rumours true? What is it like to study in NJC as a JAE student? 

**Hwa Chong** : Despite being one of the best JCs, my sister (current JC2 student there) has described Hwa Chong as ""fun, playful and relaxed"". Students ""know when to play and when to be diligent"". However, according to her, there is a strong stigma against students who join the student council. I may not have had much leadership experience in pri+sec school, but the idea of becoming a student leader recently became appealing to me. My sister told me ""if you want to die then go ahead and join the student council"", because student councilors apparently get labelled as ""clout chasers"" or ""teachers' pets"", and they often get disrespected, ostracized and bullied by their peers. ""Student councilors only hang out with each other because no one else likes them"". Current/former Hwa Chong students, please share your experience in the school, and confirm the accuracy of my sister's anecdotes.

**NYJC** : My father lashed out at me when he heard that I was considering NYJC among my top 5 choices. He said that it was ""a school for uncultured hooligans"", despite my consistent reminders that the COP dropped to 6/7 points. I don't understand where he's coming from, and I am really skeptical. Some NY students on this subreddit have described it as ""fun but serious"", while others have called it ""the playground for China scholars"". Please share your experience/anecdotes about this school!",0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iypk4z/a_levels_what_is_the_culture_like_in_your_jc/,"['pls avoid cjc if possible. really toxic culture. thanks a lot.', 'Maybe you can consider DHS? I have friends and cousins in DHS and they’re a really overlooked JC that achieves amazing A-Level results (comparable to RI/HCI) but is forgotten by the general public. :’)))', '[deleted]', 'im an ip student from rjc. i feel like it depends what subj combi u are planning on taking and what class u end up in. usually there tends to be a few classes with just muggers and other classes who like to have a good balance of work and play, but when it comes to exam seasons u can really see the drive to mug to increase. i think the competitiveness is the same around all schools??? if ur unlucky and end up in a mugger class u may be used as comparison and ur classmates may avoid u cos of ur grades etcetc. \n\n\nif u are quite extroverted idt it will be an issue to integrate into the schl culture. i personally like hanging out with my jae friends cos they seem more mature than the other sheltered ip students. be mindful that most of the ip students come from wealthy backgrounds and have tuitions for every subject, enjoy flaunting their expensive accessories, so u really gotta buck up and try to be on task w everything and do ur tutorials. \n\ni know this is very brief, but if u have any other specific questions feel free to dm me :))', 'hwach j2 here! don’t think they are ostracised here.... they hang with each mostly because they’re genuinely bonded rather than because the have no friends HAHA but that’s based on personal experience! Have friends who are in HCSC and they’re doing p okay socially hahaa I would say the “if you want to die then join student council” part is more bc of the commitment, it can get pretty intense for eg because MAF (our mid autumn celebrations, which is a big p thing here) is held right before promos so you gotta balance that w your acacs', 'My friends are studying in NYJC. Hearsay the environment is ""mug hard, play hard."" People are generally really nice and helpful. Also, the idea that NYJC is ""a school for uncultured hooligans"" is really untrue.\n\nOn a side note, generally, your JC experience will be largely defined by mugging. It\'s either closet mugging or chao mugging because the end goal is to take A Levels. So, pick your poison I guess. Don\'t be surprised if some of your classmates end up topping the cohort despite ""not studying.""', 'just curious why u left out the other jcs HAHAHA', 'Ejc: heard from my friend that it’s really quite bad as JAE student. But it really depends on who you meet. If you meet someone who’s nice and from IP, they will constantly try to include you. But still, they alr have their own grp of frens and may be difficult sometimes. I do hear that the teachers are generally nice, and also the school events are quite fun. \n\nHCI: Frens in HCI from council and nope they were not ostracised. Instead, they were having supportive grp of frens. Also, it may be because there will be a lot of planning that’s why you tend to be away from your class/ group of frens and sometimes that makes you “detached” from them. Just make the effort to always catch up with them! \n\nNYJC: definitely not a school for uncultured hooligans. The A level grades have been improving and is actl v good in NY. I would second the “fun but serious”. There’s definitely “China scholars” but NY is not just for them. Actl, I’ve never actl have any China scholars in my class or my frens class, it’s not so bad? Also, the sch has caring teachers and also, “play tgt, Mug tgt”. You will see that when there‘a exam, literally everywhere u walk will be ppl studying, but that motivates you as well. Many teachers giving consultation. Then after exam, for sch activities, many people join in as well. It’a a great sch! Oh, I tink Ny is the only sch with no “houses”, Cos principal wan focus more on class bonding hahaha', 'J2 JAE student from ejc. Honestly for me, Ej is quite inclusive as a whole in a sense that, as long as you are willing to make friends with others, u should hv a great time here. The only thing I can admit is that getting a leadership position in CCA is gonna be challenging as the ip students are likely going to vote for the ppl they know better ( their ip mates) imo. Moreover, jae ppl only get like 1-2 months to prove themselves worthy of being a leader before exco selection takes place which is honestly not much time. \n\nRegarding the IP-Jae segregation, i have not really experience this myself cuz everyone seems really chill with each other and my teachers have never compared the jae and ip students based on my experience. I personally feel like most ip students dont feel elite whatsoever because some jae ppl perform equally as well or better than the Ip students so theres not much room for them to look down on us. My class is especially bonded and fun so that makes school life even better and wholesome. No one really cares whether your ip or jae to be very honest. I think it is up to you to try to expand your own social circle here in ej. \n\nThe school can be really hyped during special events like orientation, interhouse games etc but there also a little bit of mugging culture here especially nearing examinations. My teachers are really friendly and helpful as they often take time out of their busy schedules to reply to my queries.\n\nThis is just based on my experience and considering myself as a omnivert, it shouldnt be too difficult to make friends here as long as you step our of ur comfort zone.', ""EJC: I may not be the best person to speak for the school because I was from IP but I'll try to say what I've observed of the school's / students' treatment of JAE students. I'm not sure if it's like a batch or teacher thing but I personally haven't met a teacher who put IP kids on a pedestal and looked down on JAE students - on the contrary I've had teachers tell us not to get complacent because JAE students do have advantage over us, having sat for a nationwide exam while we haven't, and can certainly hold their own. During ori, my OG was inclusive of the JAE kids to the best of our ability when they joined us in February and definitely tried to help them fit in (went on outings and karaoke before CB happened etc.) even though we didn't have much time with them; however I did hear of other OGs who tried to exclude the JAE kids and created a whole gc without them which is not cool :( As for my class, we don't have many JAE students but we don't treat them differently because at the end of the day we're all classmates, so what's the point in fostering animosity for such a dumb reason as IP/JAE differences? I can't speak for them but they seem to have integrated well - one of them is even our class vice-chair by majority vote and I consider a few to be close friends. I have a few close JAE friends outside of my own class as well and they befriended several IP kids quite quickly into the school year. I do have a relative who is a JAE student but their class is apparently a lot more segregated and less bonded from what they tell me, not just for the JAE kids but for the IP ones as well because they're pretty unwilling to expand beyond their friend groups, so I think as long as you end up in a class that's friendly and mature enough you should be fine.\n\nHowever I  cannot guarantee your experience will be the same as mine or the JAE students I know, I definitely think your perception of segregation and the presence of elitism in the school depends on who you interact with and honestly sometimes it's out of your control unfortunately! All the best for your Os and I hope this helped somewhat in helping you get some insight into a potential choice for JC! :)"", '**NJC**: hello! im a j1 student through JAE and i would like to shed some light on how its like in NJ. do note that i only joined the school this year so my view may not be entirely representative of all NJC students.\n\nfirstly, never really heard of that rumour LOL. maybe this occurred in previous years but honestly only found out this rumour existed today.\n\nanyway, i honestly agree with the other person that commented that NJ is a mugger school lmao. before we got our classes, my friends and I were alr going to the library to like finish our homework together and study. i like this kind of environment because it really pressures you into working hard and doing well when you see your peers doing the same. it feels competitive sometimes because everyone is always mugging hard but there is also quite a supportive environment imo. however, this all comes down to who you are friends with.\n\nto address JAE-IP segregation, ive had a variety of experiences. mostly i found that those in IP are generally open to making new friends and are usually inclusive when it comes to meeting friends from JAE. however, it is a bit daunting at first because they are likely to stick with their old friends (which is normal i suppose) so you have to make some kind of initiative. for me personally, i found it easier to befriend and get closer to other JAE students but IP students are quite chill. usually we are past the labels of JAE/IP after a few months and just become friends with whoever we like :)\n\nin conclusion, school culture in general honestly comes down to who you mingle and interact with. we definitely have a mugging culture (tho i usually go out with friends during non-exam periods). aside from culture, i really appreciate the strong PCME departments in NJ because they generally provide a lot of support and the resources are extensive. NJC also provides a lot of research opportunities (which is probably one of the best parts about NJC) and other stuff in general. thus, it comes down to whether you seize these opportunities or not. so far, i find the environment to be generally supportive, while pushing me to do my best academically', ""Hey buddy! I'm from ASR. Initially, I decided to enter ACJC or NJC, as my score was supposed to allow it, but somehow I didn't get enlisted(probably cos of my lack of citizenship). Unfortunately, I WAS on the same boat as many who thought ASR is bad now cos of the merger but put it as my sixth choice when it would have been even behind if not for it's close proximity to my home. And unsurprisingly, I was shocked when I realised I got into it since I never expected to get into it, considering that I was eligible for my top 5 JCs(actually 4 according to the 2020 cut-off).\n\nAnd guess what, it is the BEST thing that has happened to me. 7 months have passed and I have been enjoying my journey here in J1. Big plot twist right here. Awesome friends from diverse backgrounds, as well as fantabulous teachers has actually allowed me to be more happy being in junior college as compared to Secondary school, ironically. I take PCME(Chemistry H1) and my time table is pretty awesome. We end at an average of 2pm each week(if there's no 1hr CCE on Wed the average becomes 1pm) and if you tell this to other JC students they'll think it's a joke. Furthermore, I have a friend circle consisting of friends from more 'elite' JCs, and we compare our notes. I got to say, our notes like for Physics is very competent. \n\nCulture wise, I would say in a single word-humble. Yes we mug as much as people in NJC but we have this sense of belonging and help one another alot(not sure whether this is a 'unique' culture cos it's a duty to help others as a human being). Teachers are excellent imo and there are still many AJC teachers (like my Math and Econs teachers) here if you are curious. The SRJC teachers are great as well but more towards the caring side than the serious side compared to the AJC teachers(haha may not be accurate but it's still a small comparison if you're curious). My chemistry teacher is so nice that my classmates kept telling that they complete her homework mainly cos they will feel bad cos of her kindness XD. \n\nIn a nutshell, ASR is deserving of more love and attention. If you really want me to say a negative aspect of it, I would probably say the campus. It's really really old but clean. If you want a more relaxed journey you can consider coming here. After all regardless of which JC you go to, you'll still be able to get 90rp if you put in the effort. \n\nOh and the food here is low-key awesome!\n\n\nAll the best for Os mate!💪"", 'ex-hcsc here and no, we have friends outside of council... we like to hang out with each other because our other friends don’t exactly understand the stuff we go through as councillors, and because we have a lot of planning to do together so there are loads of meetings, which help with bonding. there’s a certain stigma towards councillors who seem like they’re just doing it for the portfolio, but for the main part, i didn’t see myself getting ostracised even tho my class was quite rabak. i never got disrespected except when my friends tease me about me breaking some rules (like eating in class) even though i’m a councillor.\ndefinitely not a teacher’s pet here bc i sleep and eat in class and don’t hand up homework like any other student. \ni’m assuming the “join council if you wanna die” comes from the workload, because yes, i agree. if you join, expect your academics to tank unless you’re super good at time management.', '[deleted]', ""YJC: H2 math papers are hard af. Not sure if it's still the case (studied there 2014 for half a year)\n\nIn general, there's gonna be all sorts of people in JC imo. I used to think each JC has their own trait, but the truth is you're going to be swarmed with so much study, I didn't really see those 'traits & trends most of the time.\n\n This is my own opinion on this, people may see it differently"", ""RJC muggung culture is real, go to any public library during exam season(pre covid) like 40-50% of students are rjc. I personally think that it's a good thing? Cause it motivates me to actually study. (NYJC is also widely to be considered a mugging school in recent years). \n\nNo one would actually ostracise you for coming in as a neighborhood school student. People stick to people they are comfortable with, hence the ip kids will already have their friend group, people from the more 'elite' sec schools also have their sec school friends etc. More importantly, having similar interests is what brings people together. As I was a nerdy b*tch, most of my friends are the more studious type and I tend to 'avoid' (more like not likely to be friends with) those that don't value extracurricular academics, etc. Ofcourse there are elitist a** people in ri, one of my class mate is an example, but I just ignore them as they are such a small minority (they usually also have a much smaller friend circle, aka most people hate/dislike them anyway lol). People are very friendly here and I never tend to meet aloof people, if they seem aloof most likely they're just shy haha. \n\nAlso not everyone can survive rjc, those that tend to get bad grades will eventually start to compare yourself with the smart people around you, (I was last in class for most of my subject, and I knew that I will get a good rp at the end so I didn't worry uwu), but some can and will be upset over such situations, see if yoh would what to study in such a situation. I definitely didn't mind as I get to ask my classmates for homework help lol, free tuition OWO. \n\nOf course the most difficult thing for me is seeing all my friends going overseas to study and not being able to meet with them for another year TT, while I opt to stay in Sg."", ""The culture is dictated by the current batch of teachers in the sch.\n\nWhy so passive? You want to create the culture in which you want to live in. Experimemt and experiment some more. Hope you'll live well."", 'Rjc: experience really depends on who u hang out with and ur subject combi. If u are in those BCME PCME intense classes I Guess will be q stressful. But if u get a class that is chill like mine ur experience will be q good. And the point on elitism, everywhere also have elitists la tbh it’s part of certain individuals’ personality and how they were brought up, but personally I have seen v few in Ri.\n\nThere are ppl from all walks of life that come to Ri. The perception that people from Ri are rich and elitist is no longer true. But do note that ofc some people from the IP stream from v privileged families that can afford to send them for stuff like Golf and tennis. The IP Ri boys mostly also tend to stick to their ip friends.

I know as a JAE kid it might be daunting to join an IP school, but from my personal experience in NJC, there is very little segregation between the IP and JAE kids, the IP kids are very friendly, and are very very helpful. They really helped me improve my academics a lot!\n\nI think it depends on what class you get though, maybe I'm just lucky that my class is really friendly, people even give out free brownies and cookies to each other during breaks!\n\nDownside though, academically speaking, it is quite stressful still, (just like any other JC) which may be worsened by the mugger culture here if you're someone who tends to compare yourself to others, cuz you might constantly feel that you didn't study enough compared to everyone else.\n\nWould say that I highly recommend NJC, but i will give you A BIG WARNING on the PW department, ehhh i mean i think our PW department is pretty infamous already so don't need to explain lol"", 'NJC is 100% a mugger school but in my experience, it has been a v wholesome and supportive mugging environment\ni was an IP student and honestly in all my 6 years, i never experienced / heard of experiences where people stole notes or sabotaged anyone else.

We may be a mugger school but the onus is on the individual in finding your work-life balance. for me, mugger school didnt mean I had no life other than mugging, it meant that when i worked i really MUGGED HAHA (i guess the key with any school is that an individual’s experience is unique and ultimately dependent on the people u choose to surround yourself with)', 'JPJC best of the west', 'Hi, I\'m from RI here. Can\'t speak for the other schools so I\'ll just share my two cents worth about RI.\n\nPersonally I\'m a firm believer that you are what you make your JC experience to be, so I think it\'d be too big a generalisation to call RI a ""mugging school"". Sure, we have our own share of muggers who don\'t do anything but study their asses off (which honestly are just a very small minority), but we also have people who really don\'t care and just go out with their friends all the time. Ultimately you\'re gonna meet a huge spectrum of people (our cohort has like slightly more than 1100 people?) so you\'re guaranteed to find someone who can click with you.\n\nAlso the initial divide is mainly that of JAE-IP, not that of neighbourhood school-elite school. Honestly I think most of my friends don\'t even know which secondary schools their JAE friends come from LOL. Anyways after a few months the divide will go, just be open to making new friends and don\'t think that every IP person is judging you secretly (spoiler alert: they don\'t).\n\nWith regard to elitism, I honestly feel that there really isn\'t much elitism? I mean like you\'re already in one of the top JCs, I\'m not sure how far elitism can get. Sure, there are snobbish people around, but they usually don\'t have many friends.\n\nAll in all it\'s not really about the school but about how you create your own JC experience.

Though I must say that this a view of the school through my own lens that it may be biased of any sort, it is just for those who is unsure of whether MI is the school they would like to go to. ( Some considering to transfer from poly / coming from sec 5 / lack of A math knowledge )

I do realise that there is a lot of stigma surrounding students from MI , and some may not be as comfortable to comment etc. You can still drop me a private message about the questions you may have about the school and I will try my best to answer them.

MI doesn't really have lectures for classes, mostly is classroom based compared to other JCs. So it is does benefit those who do not learn well in lectures / big groups.   \nI took combined chem and physics and took H2 Chem, to me the jump for H2 chem was big however, as far as I remember, there are just small bits and pieces that involves Pure Chem.   \nThe teachers would definitely provide consults to clarify any doubts that you may have, given that you put in the effort to do work and ask. Personally, I didn't do very well for Chemistry and have considered taking tuition however, tuition for JC is expensive to keep up for months. Hence I opted for the option to consult the teachers weekly which they were willing to provide which eventually, I did score well in H2 chem. They would try to explain concepts in a different way if a certain of explanation doesn't work. Of course, all of this boils down to the personal responsibility to be able to study and ask the teachers on your own.   \n\n\nGP is essentially english and current affairs. Scoring for GP it really depends on an individual and their ability to be able to answer the questions requirements, its essentially english in O levels but on a higher level applying it to the real world.   \nGenerally, most people struggle with GP as the skills required may take time to hone and the content required to do well generally comes with continuous reading of news."", ""Just saying, CLB can go to JC haha.

However onus is still on you to pay attention in class la so they feel like they have an incentive to help you outside of class as well. \n\nI think MI's GP teachers are really more than capable of guiding you through the subject, but its not exactly a subject you can click with immediately.(I mean...I was failing GP all the way till Y3 prelims but somehow did okay for A level GP HAHAHA) I'd say make as many mistakes as you can for GP and spam consults with your teachers.

I think there's this rising stigma of people realizing how toxic their parents are in their upbringing, and contributing to their mental health issues such as anxiety and the likes. I'd like to push aside the negativity for a while and see what positivity there is out there. 


This story is not mine, but it was one i hadn't forgotten. Someone posted this somewhere,years ago.


There's this test that asian parents do where they'll place a few items in front of the child to somehow ""guess"" which profession they'd be interested in when they grew older. So stethoscope for doctor, shovel for construction, pencil for teacher etc. (i disagree with this ritual as events and experiences will shape the child's future interest as they grow older)

A dad once did this with her daughter who was still an infant. 

After placing all the items in front of her and waiting for her response, the daughter pushed all the items aside, and chose to approach the father.

And jiayou to those going for JAE",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/iot8gb/poly_eae_biomedical_science_rp/,"['hey im a year 1 student in rp, although not in biomed but i can answer most of your questions !!\n\n>How are daily assignments like \n\nin year 1 sem 1, you take modules such as bio, chem, math, lifeskills, lab safety and global communications. every day you start at 8.30am and you end at 3.30pm. you only study one module each day.\n\nalmost every lesson you have presentation unless its an interactive seminar. you will also need to submit deliverables by 11.59pm on the same day (except for chem and lab safety assignment). \n\nso your deliverables are like pop quizzes, practice questions, and sometimes assignments which are all graded. before the start of the next lesson, you\'ll be given a daily grade (from A to F) which will be used to calculate your gpa for that semester. \n\n>I am quite worried as rp does have a reputation but honestly is it as bad as what others describe?\n\ntbh may people think rp is a bad school just because thats where all ""poly rejects"" go to. but honestly, it doesnt really matter. if you are intending to apply for a university, they only care about your gpa and not the institution you graduated from. none of the polys are bad in my opinion. all polys have their fair share of bad students.\n\nand for the nus part, it isnt true. my cousin graduated from rp as the valedictorian from his course, nus and ntu then offered him a scholarship. like i said earlier, the institution doesnt matter. the gpa is the most important :)', 'Several of my coursemates made it to NUS/NTU/SIT/etc. Every institution under the government is recognised.\n\nRP has a reputation and stigma yes, but you\'ll find out it doesn\'t hold weight. I can\'t say the same for everyone, but the lecturers I\'ve had were some of the most caring, attentive and effective teachers.\n\nYou change class every semester, and usually team every 4 weeks, and by the end of your 3 years, you\'d have known pretty much everyone in your cohort. My first friends in semester 1 remained my closest bunch for my entire 3 years but I was on friendly terms with so many others. Won\'t walk around without at least saying hi to someone you know. SAS is damn lupsup. Wear the same outfit for an entire sem (like I did, alternating colours)? No one cares. Wear pajamas or whatever we don\'t care either. Of course there will be drama, just try to stay out of it and don\'t start it. There are very chill people and very \'on\' people like in every school.\n\nGroup work is a huge, huge thing here. Make sure to pull your own weight and don\'t be an ass in general or trust me, news will spread that \\_\\_\\_ isn\'t a good teammate and a \'bad\' person and once year 3 comes, no one\'s gonna want you for FYP. Every day is a different lesson, and every lesson has a daily Reflection Journal (RJ) and Quiz. Make sure to complete them as they constitute part of your grades. RJ question can be technical-based or completey random like ""How was your weekend?"" Depends on the lecturer.\n\nPresentation is pretty much a must for most modules. Honestly helps you build up your speaking skills and skill in creating slides. Along with the constant class/group changes, it\'s pretty much an easier (subjective) transition into university life (for NTU at least, every course is a different group).\n\nDaily grades can save your ass if your assignment grades aren\'t enough to pull you to that particular grade you want. Try to speak up during lessons and build rapport with your team and lecturer.\n\nEntire campus is air-conditioned unless you intentionally take a route that leads out of the main building. So that\'s a massive plus.\n\nMy RP experience was good and met some fun individuals. In reality, every school is the same, you\'re gonna run into many different types of people. Just make the best of it, and try to maintain a good GPA as pretty much everything in poly counts towards it.\n\nOh, and we have 3 canteens and a cafe by the library that sells bingsu and lets you play billiards. Convenience stores and mini food stores (sushi, wraps, etc) are also available. Pretty good food and the canteens are spread so every school has one easily accessible to them.', 'No such thing as an unrecognised Poly diploma, RP\'s  ""bad"" rep is basically built on prejudices and further perpetuated by them.

yikeswhatt,jktjhh,[O levels] acjc or ngee ann,2020-10-30 17:21:16,SGExams,77673,27,9,"I KNOW i shouldn’t be thinking about this and should probably focus on my studies right now but the thought of choosing what’s best for me after i collect my results stresses me out?? i’ve always wanted to go to acjc since like basically forever tbh HAHA but i suddenly had a change in mind this year and decided that maybe studying probably wasn’t for me. no i’m not bad at studying, i just find theoretical studying SO BORING and i definitely hate it. yes i’m aware poly needs studying too but my course definitely requires less than what is required in JC. i’ve found quite a few courses that i’m interested in and the most appealing one being in ngee ann. for acjc i would need 13-4 to get in and for poly i would need 11-2 (it’s elr2b2 so im confident i can get 11) i find a lot of benefits going to poly actually and i think i would enjoy myself there anyways but at the same time i feel so left out whenever i think about myself being in poly while everyone else is in JC?? ( most of the students in my sch go to jc,,, more than 80% definitely ) 97% of my classmates are considering JC too and NGL i still kinda wanna go to ACJC but i’m so afraid that i just wouldn’t be able to cope. initially i was thinking that “oh if i’m able to get into ACJC then it’s gonna be my first choice” but rn i’m literally struggling between whether i shld choose ac or ngee ann as my first. i’m scared that i wouldn’t be able to get into my course ( since like they only accept 75 students ) and that if I put acjc as my second choice, i wouldn’t be accepted either ( because they would prioritize the ones who selected them as first choice ??? ) and END UP SOMEWHERE I DIDNT WANNA BE IN 
idk tbh THE ENVIRONMENT for jc and poly is so different and although i love being in a classroom environment, i enjoy freedom and independence too which is why i’m kinda in a dilemma. i’m definitely wanting to go to a uni in the future and both poly and jc will lead me to the same destination and course because i kinda did research and planning already. the only problem is I CANT DECIDE which route i should take?! yea i know most of y’all might think “just get ur results then choose” BUT i’m pretty sure i would be eligible for both based on how i did so far and my prelim results PLUSSSS we don’t have much time to decide after receiving results anyways. there’s also this general stigma that jc is better than poly which kinda BOTHERS ME a lot and makes me wanna go to jc more because i know of so many ppl who look down on poly students. ngl i never considered poly before and even threw away all the posters before prelims because i thought “bruh who even wants to go poly sia obviously go jc better what” AND THEN SUDDENLY REALIZED THAT poly isn’t even that bad?? it’s just that general stigma and stereotype that poly is bad AND I GOT INFLUENCED TO THINKING THAT WAY. which sucks because now i know how people are gonna look at me. it’s like
“r u in poly or jc?”
“poly”
“oh... cool”
VS
“r u in poly or jc?”
“jc”
“WAHHH SO SMART AH WHICH JC” 
i think that’s a big part of why i don’t wanna be in poly too but ahhhhhh this has been in my head and bothering me for too long because i know i would probably be in a horrible mental state during As FOR SURE and i don’t really wanna go through that shit ton of theoretical studying SO

At the beginning of the year, I also wanted to go to AC, since it seems like everybody around me also wants to go right and if we go together at least got someone you know right? But then what changed my mind was my teacher telling me that if you want to study IT in university, JC is pretty much useless... and that really set me thinking. You see, I've always been interested in tech and all that, and wanted to pursue an IT-related course in Uni. \n\nSo I reconsidered, and eventually settle on Cybersecurity either in SP or NP (since I live in Clementi)... and if my results not good enough I'll try the common course and see if my GPA is good enuf. \n\nMy parents too also wants me to go to JC, since there's still that stereotype that poly is not as good as JC. Honestly I haven't told them that I want to go to poly... but we'll wait for my O level results and see haha.\n\nI also realised that I don't really like studying so much for that one test so I don't really fancy JC, but also on the other hand I'm not like a super social person so idk how life will be like in Poly haha.\n\nIf I were you, I'd choose Poly.

So originally i thought coming to poly was a huge mistake because its totally the opposite of being exam oriented? Im from a science course so naturally my course are mostly A level kind of content but the environment is so different from the ""exam oriented"" environment i was used to. However i realised since i wasn\'t ""really"" in this pressure cooker environment, i can actually appreciate what i study. Because even though the content is intense, there is some room for u to breathe and not actually try to study just because u wish to solely ""score well"" in exams but actually also appreciate and deepen ur interest in the content u are studying as well. Studying just to score well in exams isn\'t learning. Like sure u are definitely studying to get a good gpa but u are also studying for a course u are passionate for(u should be) and with that u are actually going school to LEARN and not just to score well in exams. I want to really emphasise this. Coming to poly was really the first time i started learning and actually deepening my interest in the content i was offered with not because i wish to score well, but i was genuinely curious because there are just so much opportunities to learn which will never be compared to an environment like in jc. Sorry for the horrible sentence structurws but i hope u make the right decision👍', ""up till 2 weeks ago, i was in your shoes. it was ACJC vs NP as well for me. i DSAed/EAEd into them and er...got rejected by acjc (fun!!). i did get my 1st choice eae offer so i decided to keep it until the withdrawal stage. \n\nimo the most important factors is WHAT YOU WILL STUDY IN JC/POLY and how it will relate to your uni studies, and WHAT YOUR PREFERRED LEARNING ENVIRONMENT IS. \n\nFor example, i know for a fact that i want to study business in uni. When i looked at the acjc subjects, i realised there arent many subjects that relate directly to my area of study (although i must admit, acjc's subject combis rock hard). so like for business sch in particular, all i could apply in uni were math and econs. In poly, my course literally prepares me for business sch/work from scratch so everything is very useful and applicable (as compared to learning history or bio in jc and not using it). Additionally, i know that i'll enjoy the freedom offered in poly and make good use of it, and i felt like ACJC's busy timetable will end up knocking me out (cant imagine having very VERY little time to myself for 2 years, my acjc cca has trainings on weekends). Also i rock at presentations. Thus, i decided to ignore any stigmas against poly students and accept my NP offer. Your education pathway should benefit YOU and only YOU. Dont make any discounts for other people. \n\nyou shouldnt worry abt coping in jc/poly, either way you'll suffer and succeed. you seem like a smart person whos done their research, no doubt you'll adapt to either institute and flourish there. Whatever decision you make for yourself, make sure that you dont regret it. Even if you do, just suck it up and tell yourself that this is what's best for you. All the very Very VERY best!!

For a very sociable girl like me and was well-known in my sec sch among the cohort and among teachers, I could not accept this drastic change and it kinda almost pushed me in depression so yea but now I am still alone but I kinda got used to it\n\n2) It can be a party sch. i was from a nerd class bfr anf everyone there used to be very discipline and good girls(was from a girls sch) the ac guys behaviour and all the thirsty bitchy girls running towards all the ac guys are very ra-ra and not my type(why i cant make frens) there are silent ones too but like not from my class. and I hate all the ra-ra ppl \n\n3) while not accepting the change, I could not focus in studies as I was very disturbed so when I kinda got over it I had kinda snowballed stuff but luckily I kinda worked my ass off towards promos and I am not going to retain and am going to j2 so not bad......compared to hci and ny pprs our sch pprs are eh I think?\n\n4) Most teachers like the ones who teach me are extremely boring like rlly rlly boring I hate their lessons and I don't understand what they teach but I at least have tuition so Ig that's that. my sec sch teachers used to be so damn gd and this sudden difference isn't great....others jcs still had lectures like physically at least once in a while (or at least the cher teach in class) however, in a you have to be independent and most stuff in own time own target. For ex, the next three wks they will upload all the lectures online and we have learn stuff by ourselves as it is hbl and they wont teach us and we gotts do tutorials which there will be online lessons the last wk of sch for us to go thru\n\ni guess these are the reasons i don't like acjc\n\nif i were to choose a diff path i would have nvr included acjc and one of my choices and might have gone SAJC or ASRJC. i listened to my parents and put the sch from lowest cop to highest cop (of courses the jc i was eligible for) so yea my life has been going downhill since this yr beginning and i hope my string of bad luck ends by this yr and next yr would be a gd start and it is the alvl yr for me. Atb for Os if you are taking\n\n**(P.s. everybody experiences vary. there will be ppl in every sch who don't like their sch. if you personally feel acjc is for you then go ahead. my cohort will be diff from yours and just because i don't like it means the sch is bad as it is an well-reputed sch as i heard from my cher like graduating from acjc puts u in an advantage compared to those from like TJC or smthg cuz of the AC reputation(not so sure but he kinda is a reliable source).

Instead all everyone can remember from him is his PMD ban\n\nThere are some MPs who wayang until cannot wayang anymore but the 3 that you named ah... Edwin Tong if anything is lowkey instead of performative, Grace Fu was the best thing to happen to NYC, and just google ""Tan Chuan Jin charity"" to see what he has publicly done.

They had a #HowRU tag on it, which I thought was a good one. I do think it does help to just ask someone if they are OK if you see them not acting like themselves.\n\nIf someone changes their mindset just a little in their perception of the issues raised or even their actions when encountering such matters in the future, such posts are not useless.

I have had the misfortune of working under tyrant bosses. Every position that I have landed into so far in my 2.5 years of working is actually a ‘hot’ seat - high turnover. 

I think I am spiraling into depression where self-doubt, anxiety, stress, fear are my best friends already. I am really not ok. 

Not sure if you can see it but here was what I had described [job situation](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ik7p59/rsingapore_random_discussion_and_small_questions/g3ly7r4/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)

TLDR: My mental health is suffering. Physical symptoms show. I experience dread and nausea just thinking about work. Working from home is bad enough but when I actually have to report back to office (where its just my boss and I in office)... holy shit the fear is real. I know I wont stay long in my current position (definitely before end of 2020)  but everyday feels like a torture. My boss sorta knows my intention to leave too. 

But it is covid-19 pandemic we live in. Everyone is trying to save jobs.... people I talk to tell me not to quit. Because it is practical. 

At this stage, I have a verbal offer from a Ministry but as you know, they take a hell of a long time (this Ministry took 3 months to call me for interview). Some people tell me verbal offers dont count. I also have a few interviews that I am awaiting the results for... 
To some people, the above accounts for naught. But to me, they are symbols of hope. 

For myself, my savings are sufficient to tide me through 6-8 months. But what strikes me is the uncertainty and the stigma that comes with unemployment.

beachhousevibes,dmubjm,You're screwed if you're mentally ill here and don't have money.,2019-10-25 16:14:56,singapore,378760,115,324,"I say this as I'm taking my 'A' levels this year in school, struggling with clinically diagnosed anxiety and depression. I'm a lot older than my peers doing the same.

But I can't imagine how I'd survive if I didn't have the resources I have - like therapy, medication, and so on. And a family who can afford all these (negating the need to wait forever for the help I need if I were to seek public medical help). I shouldn't complain for myself. It's hard for me, but it's definitely so much harder for others in my position, without resources that I have. 

The system doesn't recognise or 'bend over backwards' (as some call any form of help) for the mentally ill. It makes me angry that other people who are so capable are turned away from the system because they're only read by the scores they produce in a single, isolated standardised test. Those who can't cope with their anxiety and depression don't get help, they're turned away to get it together by themselves. Help, if given, at least in the public government sense, is so rudimentary it's laughable (from the POV of someone who's mentally ill). The mentally ill are seen as burdens. People's perspectives of each other's ability are aligned with prestige - if you're a President's Scholar, you're more entitled to respect than someone who's been struggling to get through national exams for 3 years despite being more than capable. Meritocracy is a joke here, but that's another topic for another time. 'Good' schools claim to be progressive and see beyond grades, but it goes without saying that grades dictate that first impression. Obviously this also goes for people not mentally ill, but who possess different kinds of intelligence/have attention deficit, or cognitive deviations from the norm. Also, not everyone gets to have copious amounts of tuition to supplement their ""intelligence"" as portrayed by the results.

And with no money, you can't just go to a university overseas either to pursue different opportunities not available here. You're stuck.

Not to mention work. You don't get employment, or sustain employment, if you're struggling with depression (chronic, usually). God help you if you don't know how to cope by yourself. You just lie in your bed paralysed by your own lack of serotonin with no income.

The system outs people with mental handicaps, excluding them from functioning to their best potential within this society. I'm not talking about the need for idealistic, overly liberal measures to give handouts or whatever is characteristic of a welfare state. I just wish people like me (non-neurotypical) didn't have to work so tremendously harder to be respected, and have the same opportunities. 

And that's the tea for today!

Edit: You get turned away from *some* insurance providers if you mention mental health. Don't tell your insurance provider that you see a therapist if you do (only if you are relatively high-functioning). 

Also, as other people have said: the stigma and lack of awareness. Depression is misconstrued as willful laziness, and the bandaid solution often offered is ""think happy thoughts and reach out to trusted friends and family!"". I mean it's good that we're acknowledging mental health more, but it's not enough to make the necessary changes needed. 

Depression changes the brain structure and shrinks the amygdala etc. depending on its extent, so obviously it's a lot more complex for layman ""solutions"" like that. We need better help, like the mental health support offered in the US/Scandinavia, in terms of social awareness, understanding, and real compassion.

Maybe the saddest thing is that I would not know a thing about mental health here due to the nature of education about it that's locally available, if I did not experience mental health issues myself. It is true that there are difficulties in gauging how to help the mentally ill, and what is best, but why not ask the mentally ill themselves? Why not engage a conversation and learn?

The SMC and its affiliated organizations are sclerotic and refractory to change, and therefore, behind the gleaming facade of our healthcare system, there's a few major problems going on - medical training, for instance.\n\nIt's just like Russia that used to have a spate of suicides because terminally ill patients could not access highly-restricted opioids. The Russian government did revise their opioid policy though after a high-profile suicide of an admiral who had terminal cancer.

laalaa849,jz00xe,[UNI] Seeking Advice for Taking a LOA in NUS Law,2020-11-23 01:56:17,SGExams,77673,6,11,"First off, thank you for taking the time to read this; I really appreciate it :) I’m a year 1 student in NUS Law and recently my mental health hasn’t been in the best state. We’re almost done with the first semester (currently taking our finals) and I’m pretty sure I’m going to fail every paper I’ve taken. I haven’t done most of the assigned readings/ watched most lectures and I’ve just been falling behind on work since the first day of school. 

Due to my poor mental health (upon encountering a few traumatic experiences this year) it’s been extremely hard to focus and study with brain fog/ ptsd symptoms clogging up my productivity. At this point I really know that it’s way too late for me to push up my grades for this semester and the thing about law is that your grades stay with you forever and might affect my chances to take the bar exam in future after I graduate. 

Right now I really want to take a LOA and come back next year to redo the whole year 1 again (so i come back in the first semester of 2021). I believe this would give me a good head start but I really don’t know if I’m just being “lazy” + there’s so much stigmas against people who have to ‘retain’ and I really don’t know if I’m ready for that. Repaying school fees for the first sem might be an issue as I’m paying for my school fees by myself. 

Does anyone have any advice towards taking LOAs in NUS specifically? I don’t know if I should just persist on (especially with my lousy grades) or risk it all and restart with a fresh mind (despite being a year later and having to pay an extra 9k for the repeated sem) :/ thank you once again for reading this!!!",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jz00xe/uni_seeking_advice_for_taking_a_loa_in_nus_law/,"[""Hello OP. Here are some recommendations:\n\n(1) **Sem's Grades**. If you wish, you can file for a Special Consideration (SC). If your SC is approved, you will receive an Incomplete grade, which does not affect your CAP at all. And, since you are suffering from mental health issues, you will need to visit NUS UHC to get your mental health assessed, and the SC form filled out. Do take note of the deadline for SC though.\n\n(2) **Mental Health**. I recommend that you visit a counsellor / psychologist / psychiatrist to talk about your mental health, if you haven't already done so. Speaking from experience, they have helped me tremendously. NUS UHC is a very good place to start.\n\n(3) **LOA.** When I was going through depression while studying at NUS, I was offered two options, (a) take an LOA; (b) take a reduced load per semester. I know that money is an issue (but see below), but please know that you have other options besides taking a full semester load.\n\n(4) **Finances**. I encourage you to speak with the financial aid advisors at NUS, and file for some financial aid. It is not a difficult process, and you might receive some finaicial relief. Every bit helps.\n\n(5) **Some Reflections**. I don't wish to overstep here. But perhaps you might want to think about whether law is suitable for you, and the reason(s) behind your wanting to study law? Sometimes, as we live our lives, our goals and expectations change. It is perfectly fine to take stock of our lives once in a while, review our options, before moving forward again.\n\nI hope this helps. And may things go smoothly for you! Fighting!"", ""Oh man I feel your pain... SLIC, contract and torts are a nightmare...

Year 1 is a foundational year with LARC (especially important for pretty much everything else), and I really cannot imagine doing it online as well as the stress that comes along with online learning. \n\nAll the best.', ""Hey OP,  I wish all the best for you.\n\nMy two cents about taking LOA since I took a year off my time in NUS too. Just something for your consideration:\n\n1. If mental health is the reason that you want to take LOA, then go to UHC and get it verified. If they accept your reason, you will be on LOA for health reasons (including mental health) and your grades for this Sem will be IC (Incomplete) and there will be no ramifications on your grades.\n2. Consider LOA and your course fees. I am not sure if you can still have TG for 8 semesters if restart from Year 1 again since it is already exam week now.\n3. If LOA is really the road you want to take, then make sure you can plan and do something productive during your break. SEEK PROFESSIONAL HELP FOR YOUR MENTAL HEALTH.

Care to explain PAP voters of Bukit Batok and Bukit Panjang? Is the Dr Chee stigma too strong for y'all?,0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hp594s/bukit_batok_and_bukit_panjang_results/,"['Bukit Panjang: Dr. Teo Ho Pin has been a really popular MP for this district since 1997. There is a reason why he was dubbed as the ""Auntie Killer"".\n\n\nIn terms of what Mr. Liang did for Bukit Panjang, he improved the infrastructure in Bukit Panjang in general as he was the MP for Zhenghua, the neighboring district, which is considered a part of Bukit Panjang Town. He has lobbied for new bus services, mainly service no. 972, which is one of the most used bus services in Bukit Panjang to connect BP to the downtown area. If Dr. Paul did not contest here, you will see results around the 35% mark like other SDP contested wards.\n\n\nBukit Panjang can be considered as a mature estate, being more than 30 years old. The newer parts of Bukit Panjang have been drawn into Holland-Bukit Timah. Therefore, it will always be a tough fight, not like newer districts like Sengkang who has a higher amount of younger voters which might swing the election, or Aljunied and Hougang where WP has a good track record in running the TCs.\n\n\n\nA close to 15% vote swing is a respectable result for SDP, coming from where it was in 2015. Even Dr. Paul recognised that it will be a miracle if they were to win. Look at the results since 2006: 22.82 -> 33.73 -> 31.62 (islandwide swing to PAP) -> 46.26.', 'from bukit panjang (i’m not old enough to vote yet). i was on twitter seeing users bashing bukit panjang votes and the main thing they don’t get is bukit panjang’s electorate is quite old.  my gut feeling about why PAP won again is 1. people are pretty comfortable with dr teo ho pin, who stayed with us for 2 decades, and liang eng hwa feels pretty similar to dr teo. 2. mudslinging of dr chee probably stuck with the older ones too, and iirc, in the chinese newspapers, it’s still continuing, and a lot of folks here are still reading that. 3. comparing liang eng hwa and dr tambyah’s videos, liang eng hwa was more appealing because he “stayed in the area for v long” and brought up his track record of contributions to municipal matters, like addition of bus services, whereas dr tambyah’s was focused on national issues (4 yes 1 no) that relatively, seemed intangible and out of touch with the constituency. however, the votes for SDP is a HUGE increase from 2015GE already (from 31% to 46%), so dr tambyah did well lah', 'Bukit Batok resident. I supported Dr Chee because I know what he would bring to the Parliament House. I was also disappointed in Mr Murali’s management of the estate, most notably the locked fire hose incident resulting in a death. \n\nI think the past image of Dr Chee still lingers amongst voters, especially the older ones. There’s still more Merdeka generation and 50s here as I’ve observed. Though I won’t be in this constituency in the next GE, wish Dr Chee all the best if he still decides to contest.\n\nEDIT: btw, both candidates did not do any house visit for my area/block in this GE. I’ve stayed here for almost four years. Whether that’s a dealbreaker, I won’t know. But considering Dr Chee’s image, I am more inclined that doing a house visit will do him more good than harm. Take the opportunity to speak and change their opinion on him. Being in popular hotspots like wet markets, food centres and MRT stations also help but not all patrons are residents of the said constituency.', 'not a voter in those areas but I think there were two big mis-steps from the SDP. To gain such a strong vote share is considered a big win for them, I expected somewhere around the high 30% vote for both.\n\nThe two big mistakes by SDP on the campaign trail imo: Sending Dr Chee instead of Dr Paul for the English Debate and focusing too much on their 1N of 10 million after the debate that it overshadowed almost everything else.', ""Can't speak for bb.

Why would we wanna vote him out?', ""Speaking as a Bukit Batok resident who stayed in this SMC for more than 20+ years, pioneer and Merdeka generations still take up the majority of the population.

And we really don't want a part-time MP. \n\nBut it's difficult to change pioneer/Merdeka generation's mindset, they still think voting for PAP is better than the opposition."", 'Liang Eng Hwa is a pretty decent MP. No reason to not vote for him however much you may dislike the PAP.', 'The mindset is like this: Many people don\'t trust CSJ\'s character. But of course you won\'t get this feeling from reddit or social media in general, because they\'d have you believe this guy is a woke king who everyone should ""stan"".\n\nCharacter assassination or not, there is no smoke without fire. From his actions in the past, a lot of people see that he is someone who isn\'t as upstanding as LTK, CST, as far as opposition leaders go. Integrity issues, ousting his mentor, making unproductive political comments, talking bad about sg to foreign media, etc. The younger generation might not remember, but the older generations do.\n\nGranted, he has certainly mellowed through the years, but people will be more inclined to see it him as a wolf in sheep\'s clothing more than a man who turned over a new leaf.', 'From bukit batok .\n\nSDP did not convince me with their manifesto .  Simple as that', ""Taken from my comment in another thread:\n\nAs someone who voted for Murali,\n\nMy family has benefited from Murali's assistance before. Everyone likes to highlight the accidents and call him a MIA MP here but to me he's done his part in making our lives better. You can check my post history for the long story, but it was an incident with my grandmother.\n\nI will never condone CSJ's actions of badmouthing Singapore to foreign liberal media for brownie points. In a game where its supposed to be SG vs the world, he's proven that his ego is far more important that anything else. I'm willing to give chances to new candidates if they fuck up their first pr incident like TPL in the past and Raeesah from this election, no matter how much I disagree with them, but CSJ has been here for so long and he still repeats the same destructive garbage every election. His previous incident with CST also sits sourly with me, as I really respected CST as an opposition old guard. For CSJ who has had a record of belligerent behaviour, I can only interpret his current actions as the leopard knowing how to hide his spots. One less day with CSJ as an MP, one more day with a proper parliament. Might not even matter if he gets NMP though. Hope TCB's team takes the offer.\n\nAgain, try not to downvote, call me ignorant, say that I don't use social media, only watch CNA or any of the usual drivel.

7seeds_,j5vwja,[O levels] Subject Moderation ~ E-maths help pls .-.,2020-10-06 09:08:09,SGExams,77673,11,7,"Hi I was planning to write about this later in the wee hours of the morning but isokay I’ll do it now so I can fully concentrate later.

I’m talking my O’s in less than 20 days and like most of u, Im also feeling extremely unprepared and exam stress/anxiety is starting to creep up to my doorstep and I’m really feeling the pressure but nonetheless, it’s something I’ll have to deal if by hook or by crude. (Kinda like it since it imposes a “study or die”situation)

pertaining to what I’m gonna talk about, let me just state my goals for my l1r4 this year ~ 12-1 or 17-1 nett 

L1: English A1/2

R1: Emaths C5/6

R2: Combined humanities (geog/ss) B3/4

B1: Combined Sci (phy/chem) A2/B3

B2: FNN A1/2

Chinese C5 :D

Wont be that disappointed if I got 17-1 nett for r4 tho since the COP for my desired course this year is 16-17 so yea. Really just want to do well because I have those typical Asian parents and if I actually got 17-1 I’ll probably get caned or smth but at least I’ll still be alive~

For the respective subjects, im wondering how will moderation affect me? I know there’s no bell curve per say but I just want to know to what extent y’all have been pushed back to Eg. Predicted an A1 but ended up with a B3 kinda thing etc. (Esp. For My L1,R1-2 and B1 if possible)

I’ll like to hear from seniors who have taken O’s previously about their personal predicted grades depending on how well y’all personal think you did and what they actually received so I know how hard I’ll need to be mugging (not saying that I’ll slack but rly want to know what I Shld rly focus on to make my r4 12-1 nett come through!

*****to add on , does anyone have study tips for emaths? Aiming for a like 50/80 for p1 and & 50/100 for p2. Can anyone also tell me which topics to focus on to score free marks and those COMMONLY tested ones? Xiexie 😿

*TO ANYONE THAT NEEDS TO HEAR THIS*
Dun let exam stress get the better of y’all and results dun rly define you as a person and always know that taking a longer route does not mean the end. Albeit there exists a stigma against people of lower education esp. in countries such as SG because of the educational rigour and the focus on academics, just know that puny grades on a piece of paper don’t define you but the morals and values you hold do. 

If you’ve read this far, thank you rly appreciate it and those taking any national exams, jiayou and push on, we’ll get through this tgt!!😸

protokj,jqydeh,[N LEVEL] Questions on DPP,2020-11-09 22:17:58,SGExams,77673,6,2,"I was so sure pre exam that i could get PFP, but maths paper 1 and ss was such a mess for me i gave up that dream lol  


First qn: Is DPP hard to get in? Not sure where I saw, but apparently theres very limited spots for DPP like only a thousand plus spots and this made me panic like mad because i am 0% confident in sec 5 if i get rejected for DPP  
Second qn: What do you do in DPP? Still have secondary sch subjects or just your course' hands-on stuff  


I had contemplated about sec5 for awhile, because of all that stigma surrounding ite  
but after my teacher confirmed that the topics that no changes will be made to next year's paper (bc this year some topics were taken out) im very sure i cant cope in sec5",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jqydeh/n_level_questions_on_dpp/,"['It roughly depends on your aggregate, I would say it quite easy to get in if you get like 17 points. For 19 I would say it harder but not impossible, I can say this for sure as during my cohort majority of my friends who gotten 17 points easily got in but if you got 19 I would say your chances are super slim best is nitec I guess.\n\nSo I who gotten 19 decided to go to Sec 5, so would I say it good? Uh no it cons>pros if your the type who studies last minute than you will really messed up. I took English,Math, Chemistry, Physic, History, F&N, Chinese and SS. Here are my views for the subjects from NA to Express.\n\nEnglish is just fucking wtf? Cambridge express English is like a joke istg, if you can’t get like A2 for N level/Prelims English taking O English is a pain in the ass. Like most people I am not even certain if I can pass, oso fyi I got B3 for N level English, jumping to Sec 5 it always borderline pass.\n\nMath I honestly can’t give a clear view since my N levels math(B4) wasn’t good. I found the Os paper quite doable but from my POV, but I did like 30 school prelims paper and I guess it just made math easier for me. Oh one thing for sure is O level math makes you think more and if your English is weak you will find some qns hard to do I guess, especially the 4-5M.\n\nChemistry is a really huge jump for me, more chemical formula to know and your basic must be really strong eg. Blast furnace, chemicals and etc. The memorisation is also a lot more compared to Ns, idk if you memorise blast furnace, solubility, molecular mass and etc but if you didn’t your gonna suffer.\n\nPhysic is... pretty easy I guess, it is more complex but it not by much. As long as you practice it quite doable. Uh i always managed to get B3^ for it soooo don’t take my words. One thing for sure is more memorisation.\n\nHistory is also quite easy to me... I usually score B3-A2 sometimes A1, mostly because I memorised majority of the stuff sooo don’t take my word for it again lol.(Time management is sht for me) \n\n\nSS is the friken pain in the ass, since it marked in SG the way you write evidence must be fuckin upgraded, like you literally CANNOT give them a chance to write why? Or is it related? Like it so fucking strict, in NA is more lax like and the marking scene too. Due to this my evidence is always length asf and my time management is really bad.(majority is same as me in Sec5) SBQ like usual, only need your skills to be known super well and it VERY strict. SEQ first qn can be done without background knowledge but the marks you will score is significantly different second qn as usual you definitely need the background knowledge.\n\nChinese I gave up lol.. the MCQ I did a Tic Tac Toe shape and the back page I just copy part of first paragraph first qn part of second paragraph second questions. I got C6 HAHAHA\n\nF&N was quite okay lah, the coursework was really easy and manageable(not gonna elaborate, for reasons) theory wise killed me, btw I didn’t study most topics so this year paper to me was okay I did find the essay doable. I could do some of the front questions due to my coursework but I would say the jump in pages in coursework isn’t really scary, you will do it and you won’t notice anything so yeah.\n\nI mostly elaborated on Sec 5 for you to understand to NOT go for it, most ppl here alrdy talked abt DPP so I didn’t bother to elaborate more. Oso fyi we had one topic taken out, so imagine with that one more. Math and chemistry the topics taken out was really god saving for me as those 2 are Lengthy to memorise and it friken hard especially vectors.', '[deleted]', ""came from DPP now currently in poly!! some info is my emb3 was 13 pts and i went to central. went for DPP bc i felt that i was unable to cope in sec5 and i just wanted get out of the school hahaha.\n\n1. wouldn't say it's hard. ultimately is dependent on which course maybe biz maybe hard cus more popular. my friends who entered DPP are ranging from 13-18, friends who got < 13 headed back to sec5 (ofc got some people who die die want go back sec5 no matter what score, got 19 pointer also go back sec5 hahaha). the score they indicated for DPP is the last student's score to get in. my year for the course i wanted to go in was like 10 i think but i still managed to get in hahaha...but my classmates score were around 7-14. most of them are in DPP bc english b3/b4 cannot go PFP.\n2. jan-march is a prep course so basically 2 years of nitec compressed into 3 months. i think secondary school subjects varies in which course you go, i went to engineering so i had math and physics. the math was like emath/amath. had subjects like lifeskills (sth like english...? basically those kind of communication mods) in april you will start your actual course mods!\n\nat the end of the day, DPP is still 2 years ITE and 3 years poly unless you really do damn well to jump to Y2 in poly (only if you are progressing to the same course of study eg engineering to engineering) going to sec5 means you'll be saving 1 year of education so yup, do think wisely! all the best!"", 'Depending on the course you choose, DPP may be difficult to get in. For example, choosing a Science or Business course with 17-19 points is almost guaranteed no chance to enter because those courses are very competitive, some of them have single point cut offs. So choose and rank your choices wisely.\n\nI can’t say for the different schools but for Business school, we learn like a bit of maths, business etiquette etc during the 10 weeks preparatory course. In April, you will officially start Higher Nitec which you will learn modules specific to your course.', '[deleted]', 'As a non-NA student, why do teachers discourage sec5?

The HIV virus can only be passed on if body fluids such as blood exits the body of someone with HIV and enters the blood stream of someone who does not have HIV through another open cut.

Keep in mind that the actual % if even lower if you consider that those on ART and with an undetectable load have effectively no risk of transmission. Then you have to multiplicatively factor in the probability of said HIV+ person having an actively bleeding wound, the chances of you having an open wound too and the likelihood of the HIV+ blood (mind you, it's generally agreed that it would have to be a significant amount of blood) coming into contact with your open wound.\n\nHonestly, at that point, you're far more likely to die from a brain aneurysm and you'd probably die from a lighning strike before you contract HIV via that route. Point is - it's your prerogative to be afraid of whatever, I just don't think the facts support that fear and stigma.

There's a reason why medical organizations like the CDC are updating their recommendations when they have access to newer data. [Notably, the chance of any HIV-positive person with an undetectable viral load transmitting the virus to a sexual partner is scientifically equivalent to zero, researchers confirmed at the 22nd International AIDS Conference (AIDS 2018) in Amsterdam. Results from PARTNER (2), the second phase, which only recruited gay couples, were presented. The results indicate, in the words of the researchers, “A precise rate of within-couple transmission of zero” for gay men as well as for heterosexuals.](http://www.aidsmap.com/Zero-transmissions-mean-zero-risk-PARTNER-2-study-results-announced/page/3311249/)\n\nAnyway, there was also another [meta analysis done in 2018](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6058263/) and here are the main points:\n\nFor HIV transmission to occur, certain basic conditions must exist:\n\n- There must be a sufficient amount of the virus in particular bodily fluids (i.e. blood, semen, pre‐seminal fluid, rectal fluids, vaginal fluids, or breast milk).\n\n- A sufficient quantity of at least one of those bodily fluids must come into direct contact with sites in the body of an HIV‐negative person where infection can be initiated. These are usually mucous membranes, damaged tissue or inflamed ulcers, but not intact skin.\n\n- The virus must overcome the person's innate immune defences so that infection can be established and propagated.\n\nThat explains why wound to wound transmissions are *incredibly* rare, with the third point also highlighting that exposure to HIV does not necessarily mean you'll become HIV+.\n\nMoving on:\n\n- Recent analyses from key studies (namely, HPTN052, PARTNER (1) and Opposites Attract) involving both heterosexual and male couples of different HIV status have not identified any cases of sexual transmission from a person with an undetectable viral load.\n\n- In 2011, the HPTN052 trial (conducted in Botswana, Brazil, India, Kenya, Malawi, South Africa, Thailand, the United States and Zimbabwe), which investigated the impact of early treatment initiation, observed no HIV transmission from 1763 people on antiretroviral therapy who had a stable viral load below 400 copies/mL. Partners of HIV‐positive participants were followed for the equivalent of 8509 person‐years. The only transmission from people on treatment occurred either early in treatment (before viral load was stabilized below 400 copies) or when viral load was above 1000 copies/mL on two consecutive visits.\n\n- The PARTNER (1) and Opposites Attract studies found no HIV transmission from people with a viral load below 200 copies/mL after more than 75,000 acts of condomless vaginal or anal sex.\n\n- In the PARTNER (1) study, heterosexual couples reported approximately 36,000 condomless sex acts and homosexual male couples reported about 22,000 condomless sex acts 30. No HIV transmission occurred between partners in the study.\n\n- The Opposites Attract study included nearly 17,000 condomless sex acts among men. No HIV transmission was reported between partners involved in the study.\n\n- Also, and this should be emphasized - HIV cannot be transmitted when a condom is used correctly because HIV cannot pass through intact latex or polyurethane.\n\n- HIV cannot be transmitted via contact with an environmental surface such as a chair, bench or toilet; from food or drink; or from casual human contact such as hugging, sharing household objects or eating together.\n\n- HIV cannot survive long in air and is unable to penetrate intact skin. No case of HIV infection from contact with an environmental surface, food or drink or through casual human contact has ever been identified despite many scientific studies considering this possibility.\n\n- Numerous studies have considered the possibility of HIV transmission via saliva but none has found any evidence, including a 1997 study of 34,000 cases in the UK.\n\n- Current evidence suggests HIV cannot be transmitted even when saliva contains small quantities of blood. Despite early research suggesting a theoretical risk of transmission if saliva‐containing blood enters a person's body through contact with mucosal tissue (for example, landing in an eye or mouth), no cases of HIV transmission resulting from the spitting of blood have been reported.\n\n- For transmission to be plausible in the case of biting, the HIV‐positive person must have blood in their mouth at the time of the bite, a sufficient amount of HIV must be present in the blood of the HIV‐positive person, and the bite must be deep enough to penetrate the HIV‐negative person's skin causing trauma and tissue damage. Even when all these conditions are present, the possibility of transmission during a single bite is negligible at most.\n\nThese are the takeaways from the meta analysis done in 2018. The individual studies can all be found in the link provided above.\n\n>what in the actual fuck are you even trying to say my dude?\n\nI'm just presenting the facts and data. You're free to form your own conclusions, no matter how misguided they may be, I guess.\n"", 'It’s in the straits times article ', ""Wah jammy buttons also doesn't read one.

laissezfairee,ipbwej,[POLY] NP BUSINESS STUDIES EAE WITHDRAWAL + other enquiries,2020-09-09 16:09:59,SGExams,77673,8,7,"Hello! I recently accepted an EAE offer into NP's business studies, it was my first choice so im pretty relieved. I am passionate about business, and everyone thinks I'd do better in poly, but my family wants me to go to JC. It's not a stigma, simply put it'd be better long-term + financially if I go to JC. I'm all for it if I can get into one tbh, I know I'd survive both jc and poly.

Beforehand, I had applied to many JCs for DSA (twice the average number) and got rejected by all of them so thats cool. I was really passionate abt a certain upper mid-tier JC and still am, so I'm planning to withdraw from EAE in october if I think I have a shot at JAE. 

1. Is my plan (withdraw from EAE to participate in JAE for a shot at JC) flawed? Am i just gambling away a perfectly good opportunity? My rationale is that the poly cutoff is higher than that of my JC so if i dont get in I can probably still enter NP via JAE, but this is if I don't screw everything up and end up with a 20 pointer. By giving it a shot I'm taking away a perfectly good safety net all in the name of my dream jc, I just need someone to validate this plan/advise me to stick w EAE. 

2. How different is poly life in this Covid-19 situation (more regarding cca, internships, non-academic poly stuff)? I'm hoping that I can study on campus by the time I enter so that I can experience poly life more authentically, but I think I should brace myself for hbl.

3. I overheard that although poly students can get credit exemption in uni (eg. business diploma to bachelor in business), uni modules are so hard that poly students end up retaking them, basically having to waste time + money on extra time in uni. JC students do not suffer as much as H2 math + a level rigour is harder than poly and thus sufficiently preps them for uni modules. Is this true, or is this a myth created to get sec sch students flock to JCs? 

4. In general, do JC students fare better than poly ones in uni? In terms of academics and starting salary? I hope there's no difference.

5. Once EAE students enter poly, are they differentiated from JAE students? Also do the lecturers/teachers reveal anything about the EAE process they went through (eg. reasons for offer)?

Thank you very much, I'm sure your responses will be very helpful! As for other people who have gotten an EAE offer, congrats! Hit me up if you're going to NP for business studies, who knows we went to the same group interview?",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ipbwej/poly_np_business_studies_eae_withdrawal_other/,"['oh hello, I’m another one of the people who lowkey wants to go JC, after accepting my EAE offer, sup fam :’D I’m also a bit confused on whether i really want to go poly/ jc or not but being a sec 5 student... >jc?????? I must be dreaming sigh... all the best to you tho, I can’t comment much, sorry :/', ""1. There is no perfect plan with absolute certainty. Do you feel more comfortable with poly or jc? It really depends on your approach to studying. With jc there's the possibility for more courses at uni level for you to choose in the event that your career interests change over the next two years.\n\n\n2. Old poly alumni so can't answer this.\n\n\n3. I got into second year directly in uni because of my poly modules relevance, but for business it's mostly module exemptions without skipping a year. The pros is that you can potentially have a lesser academic load than the jc peers but the modules you exempt tend to be the basic fundamental ones which are easier to score and get better grades. If you are exempted from these mods, you won't be able to get them factored into your GPA. I know of some peers who took on those mods even though they could exempt from it because they wanted the opportunity to get more A's to boost their GPA. Again its down to your preference.\n\n\n4. Employers generally don't look that much at whether you are from jc or poly if you have a degree. I've seen people from poly as well as jc having stellar grades so being from a jc doesn't guarantee and even for someone who came to uni via poly-ite route, it's still possible to do well.\n\n\n5. I doubt there's much difference (I may be wrong unless they have some programmes lined up for those through EAE before school starts). Once poly starts, no one is really bothered if you came from JAE or EAE"", ""I think you shouldn't worry much about affording poly, there's quite a few bursaries available and if you got in through EAE you probably also are eligible for scholarships/merit awards. Plus, if you're hardcore, you can work on the weekends or on the nearly 2-month long holiday. \n\n1. I think it's important to ask yourself what would you pick if you had to choose between NP BS and an upper mid-tier JC today. I'm partial to poly because that's what I chose and it worked out well for me because I've gotten numerous chances to develop myself.\n\n2. I've graduated so I can't really speak for this, but from what I've heard, my CCA juniors have been having online sessions and been meeting up causally in smaller groups. I think business courses are worst-hit by HBL though so take that with a grain of salt. Then again, you'll be starting poly next year Apr so things might be better by then.\n\n3. Bear in mind that some of those accounts come from guys with rusty brains because of army. But there's definitely some truth to it. I haven't start uni so I can't really speak for this lol.\n\n4. Again, can't speak for this since I haven't start uni. But in terms of being offered admission, I'd say poly gives you more opportunities to develop an impressive CV, which helps if you're aiming for uni scholarships.\n\n5. Not at all lmao. It used to be the case where early admission meant clearing module(s) before school started. Now it doesn't mean anything once you start school."", 'I’m applying to this course in NP too!', 'all the very best to you!', 'Thank you so much for your input, really appreciate it!', "">work on the weekends or on the nearly 2-month long holiday. \n\n\nas in work on the weekends even after poly starts? I'd like to,  but i don't know if i'll have the time. Do a lot of poly students work part time? \n\n>I think business courses are worst-hit by HBL\n\nHow so? Is it because of group projects or something else?\n\nThank you so much btw!"", ""Yea it's possible to work during the school term. I got a friend who even got a part time job on campus as admin staff. Will give you a contact if you're interested. It's not common but definitely not impossible. Definitely test water first, don't jump in your first sem with a job. \n\nI think because business courses are the easiest to transition to HBL.

giantvariety,hp9fw6,What most parties objective will be until the next GE.,2020-07-11 20:49:25,singapore,378760,11,42,"This is my personal view and I am taking this as status quota (Means no major scandal/event that might swing the vote drastically to the other side till the next GE)

# PAP

Main objective: Repositioning to be more acceptable/connectable to the younger generation.

Reasons: Most of the people that ride the LKY hype train is reaching their EOL, the younger generation that are less likely to vote due to nostalgic value. The results of the Sengkang GRC show that the younger generation are willing to take the risk by voting in opposition. Thus their need to reposition.

Secondary Objective: Accessing who is their powerhouse(anchor) in the 4G Roster

Reasons: Their 4G roster major player is supposed to be HSK which narrowly won the East Coast GRC. If the opposition managed to find more star players like Jammus Lim/Nicole Seah, they stand a high chance of losing the Supermajority once the 3G leaders were to step-down.    


# WP

Main Objective: To maintain the existing area and slowly expand from them

Reasons: Even though they won Sengkang GRC, they will not want what happened in 2015 GE to repeat. The ideal result for them is to win with a margin similar to 56% to 44% in the next GE. This will enable them to use it as a foothold to nurture candidates up to contest for other GRC and SMC.

Secondary Objective: Nurture 2 additional high profile candidates to field in MP and EC GRC.

Reasons: HSK moves to EC most likely spoiled WP initial Plan to take it. However, by having another high profile candidate fielding with Nicole Seah, it might force PAP to move more of their ever-shrinking A tier players to prevent PAP from losing their foothold. Possible Tharman Shanmugaratnam might move to East Coast if HSK fails to impress the public.   
Having a high profile candidate that can be their anchor in East Coast, is likely to do the same effect, lessen the PAP star power that could carry unpopular candidates in other electoral divisions.  

# PSP

Main objective: Becoming a long term and solid opposition party in the political arena.

Reasons: For a new party, they perform relatively well. The fact that they nearly won WC GRC and did put up a good fight proves that the citizen do not view them as a joke. Now they must solidify their position in the public view and prove that it is not a fluke for them. 

Secondary Objective: Finding a new face for the party

Reasons: Now everyone is likely voting them due to wokeness(firepower) of TCB. However, TCB is relatively old (80) thus they are required to have a new face of the party to ensure continuity as stated in the main objective.

# SDP

Main Objective: Continue to do what they are doing with Dr. Chee and Dr. Paul.

Reasons: They gained a lot of ground during this GE. Moreover, as the demographic of the population start to change, this will likely help in their flavor and they stand a relatively better chance of winning the 2 SMC. If Dr. Chee wants to, I think moving towards a younger estate might boost his odds even higher.

Secondary Objective: Change the main face of the Party to Dr. Paul in order to change the stigma regarding SDP 

Reasons: Dr. Paul is likely more popular than Dr. Chee with older audiences due to the events that took place as Dr. Chee younger days. By putting Dr. Paul as the face, they stand a higher chance of capturing older audiences which is possibly the Bane of Dr. Chee career. Dr. Chee could be positioned to capture the younger target audiences due to the way he presents himself.

Do to these areas what they did to MP in this GE."", 'for WP, I think EC is a bit of a lost cause, esp if HSK becomes PM. Probably better to just expand somewhere else.\n\na third goal for SDP would probably be to also find more credible candidates and not just rely on CSJ and PT for all their votes. Maybe they can throw CSJ, PT and some other quality candidates into a GRC together, they’ll probably have a high chance of winning then especially if they contest in an area with a higher proportion of younger people.\n\nas for the other parties, I hope they either combine (for the less incompetent ones) or dissolve and let their good members jump to another party (for jokes like RP or PV)', ""Wonder when will they broadcast the parliamentary sittings.

No one wants him but they body keeps bringing him up again', 'I think rapid expansion is too risky for them as they might spread their resources too thinly. It is a high risk/high reward. They will likely take the more risk-averse route by expanding slowly and drawing PAP resources while PSP and SDP are able to swing the votes in the various divisional areas to prevent a supermajority. PSP was 2% off from securing 5 in the parliament, 5% in Marymount while SDP was around 5% as well from securing 2 SMC. If WP were to win in EC, this will have resulted in 23 Seats in total for the opposition. The first goal for the opposition is likely to deny supermajority(to deny any change in the constitution). It will enable them to level the playing field. Using this momentum swing to deny a simple majority in the next few GE (Passing any bill without a vote).\n\nIf you play DOTA: Is like u waiting for your team AM to get items to hard carry you for the opposition.', ""I don't like the idea of a 2 party system.

Kowloonthrowaway,gsu0zf,Thoughts on STD / STI testing in Singapore,2020-05-29 22:30:41,singapore,378760,31,22,"Hi all,

I am currently working on a project to understand the difficulties of getting a sexually transmitted infection (STI) or STD test in Singapore. 

These includes chlamydia, gonorrhea, HPV, HIV, etc. 

From a previous post on r/Singapore 1 year ago, people were talking about how expensive these tests are and how only about 10 clinics offered anonymous testing. 

For those who had experiences or have friends who were looking to take/took any STI tests, could you share your/their experiences?

What do you think is the issue for the ""inaccessibility""? Is it the awkwardness to head to the clinic? The doctors and nurses who judge and impose their views on you? The price? Or just the social stigma in a conservative country? 

If there was a way to have the swab self performed at home and mailed out for test discretely would this be better?

Hope this thread will also be useful for those considering to get a test. 

Thanks",0.81,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gsu0zf/thoughts_on_std_sti_testing_in_singapore/,"['My work takes me overseas weeks and sometimes months at a time, and I take one every time after I come back.\n\nOnce, when I was collecting the results, the auntie enthusiastically exclaimed ""Your blood test all clear! No HIV!""\n\nDoesn\'t really affect me, but auntie, abo calm down a bit.', '>For those who had experiences or have friends who were looking to take/took any STI tests, could you share your/their experiences?\n\nI usually do my tests with AFA anonymous test service for HIV and syphilis. They also recently started a limited pilot programme for a few other common STI. (I volunteer for them btw) \n\nHave also tested before at a non-anon GP and DSC clinic too. \n\nSo far my main key experiences:\n\n\nAFA: anonymous, but limited rapid test types (hiv & syphilis only, limited pilot tests for other like chlamydia). Run mostly by volunteers. Provides hiv/sti risk counselling on top of testing.\n\n\nGP: the one I went to did not have much experience in STIs, was unable to give a definitive STI diagnosis in my case (I think is gonorrhea). Provided antibiotics which worked luckily and my symptoms went away. \n\n\nDSC: the pros/specialists. Professional and provide full suite of STI testing and treatment. Nurses+doctors with wide experience to answer your medical concerns. Cheaper than private clinic with subsidised prices. But non-emergency appointments may need to wait a bit, especially for evening slots. \n\n\n>What do you think is the issue for the ""inaccessibility""? Is it the awkwardness to head to the clinic? The doctors and nurses who judge and impose their views on you? The price? Or just the social stigma in a conservative country? \n\nI think its a bit of everything. Sex is an awkward topic for many. Have definitely spoken to people who are not upfront or lying about their sexual health history during my volunteering sessions. And a number will not test with AFA if it is not anonymous. But I work mostly with gay/bi men so I understand their concern of being marked as gay/bi in public health records. For private clinic it\'s easily 3-4 times or more than the price of DSC.. \n\nThen there\'s definitely social stigma. Did hiv outreach & testing on uni campuses and met students giggling or making jokes to each other like ""eh you need it leh"" in a negative way. And then some of them end up coming back alone later to get tested. \n\nThen there\'s institutionalised discrimination too. Hiv positive foreigners wont be granted employment passes even though with treatment, undetectable viral load is untransmitable.\n\nMy experience is more HIV focused but I believe it\'s a mix of everything. \n\n>If there was a way to have the swab self performed at home and mailed out for test descretely would this be better?\n\nFor HIV and Syphilis there\'s rapid test kits available which can be self administered. But there\'s some concerns of proper administration and test reliability. Other STIs need lab culture or physical inspection to be diagnosed..', ""My partner and I actually both took the test before we had unprotected sex. We both mutually agreed with it. So there was no difficulty, except the doctor questioning me way too much about why am I wanting this test? Like WTF? And then the doctor seem outrage on my behalf that about my boyfriend suggesting we both do this test. But I am glad he did. Because wouldn't you want to know that each other is completely safe?\n\nI simply went to one of those chain GP to do it. It was no hassle at all.  But perhaps it was because I was completely confident I was clean, so it didn't bother me and I didn't feel embarrass or anything about it, because, I thought it's just the most responsible thing to do and all couples should do it.\n\nBut I guess for people who have genuine concerns about it, they might be worried about anonymity incase of positive results. In that situation, I suggest, just go JB and do it."", ""I've gone down to DSC Kelantan over the course of a year initially for STD testing then later for immunisation. Here's my 2 cents:  \n  \nFor me personally, when I had my suspected exposure, I didn't even think twice about getting tested. Granted I'm a pretty confident person irl, I don't think anyone who suspects they have an STI would put their ego before their health.  \n  \nFor me, the real drawback here would be the availability and the cost. When I decided to first get checked (after the window period), it was during the peak test period of the year. The thing about suspecting yourself being exposed to an STD is the mental wreckage it causes the longer you stay untested. Just as my luck would have it, none of the appointment slots alloted to me by DSC could see me tested and confirmed within the month. Being a poor broke kid back then, I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown as the days past and DSC was the only clinic cheap enough within range of my savings. If there were any cheaper clinics, either I didn't know of them or I sure as hell would have jumped at first chance. But anyway, I finally got tested after a long ass wait and turns out, all was well.  \n  \nBeing the kiasu Singaporean I am, I got tested again 2 more times (over the next few months), thinking that they may have missed something. Now, I didn't know then how accurate the tests actually were, and again, as my luck would have it, I consulted the same doctor everytime I was there for a test. To me, that's the other kicker.  \n  \nEvery single damn time I was there, that doctor never once addressed me with patience or courtesy, taking up a snide and condescending tone with me right from the get-go. I understand the drivel and annoyance he goes through, facing majority of the patients that make a big fuss out of most likely nothing. But damn did he sure let me know how much more intellectually superior he was to me. All in all, I don't hold hate or grudge for that man, I just wished he handled me with more care. He contributed quite a bit to my paranoia by constantly blowing things off instead of patiently reassuring me, and was part of the reason I went back again to get tested for mild reasons; and also later resisted the idea of getting my Hepatitis B Immunisation for fear of running into him.  \n  \nThankfully, that's an episode of my life I can out behind but lmk if there's any question of yours I can address."", 'I personally think the real issue is social stigma, which is enhanced by the fact that only so few clinics allow anonymous testing.', 'My friend just started a startup called “ease” and it’s meant to allow u to get test kits mailed to you and mailed back to labs to get them tested! Lit idea, do support her! Her Instagram handle is ease.sg :D', ""(this was way before I got married) \n\nTwo times both at dsc clinic, aside from your own worries of seeing someone familiar or just in general what others think of you before you walk in, I'd say there's really nothing difficult about the whole experience?\n\nIt's easy to book an appt via their website.\n\nThe doctors I had were are mighty professional and only asked relevant medical questions, didn't probe or looked like they judged. \n\nCosts wise, not exactly cheap but not super expensive either (80 to 100? Depending on the tests you do), especially when you realised the peace of mind you're gona get after that.\n\nResults for hiv got it on the day itself, the rest were via sms so again, rather convienient.\n\nWorry of being discovered is definitely there but for me the thought of not knowing, living in fear and the possibility of infecting others beat any 'shame' that comes with being identified, so going to get checked was the right thing to do for me."", 'Foreigner here, I discovered a different world, directly or through friends. Yes there’s a lot of barriers, even though it’s easy if...\n- you have money. tests cost an awful high price. For comparison we get free tests in France for HIV in some facilities. I can get a full tests aerie like HIV+herpes+classic STDs in a clinic for 100-120SGD, give or take. Here it’s 3 or 4 times more\n- there are HIV tests at home at 15 euros in pharmacy. I found a French pharmacy that could deliver it here in the end so I keep some in my closet just in case, and for friends if they need some day, so that answers about at home testing\n- I got lucky to find a clinic testing HIV anonymously (so they don’t report you if you’re positive). If not, I wouldn’t get tested here. Like wtf\n- STD shame starts when you’re asked if your HIV positive in your arrival card\n\nMore on the culture, so understand it comes from foreigners eyes so I may not understand everything in depth.\nI think there’s many factors that creates a low public demand for STDs testing:\n- woman health care can be pretty shit in regard of sexuality from what my female friends or partners have reported here. Doctors patronizing, sex shaming, or just not acknowledging women’s right for a fulfilled sex life, like finding the type of contraception that would fit them (I even had to mansplain my female friends that there are 50 different pills in 4 generations, so it takes different tries to find what suits you). Of course you can find some good places for women, but you have to look for it, that’s the difficulty, and know that some exists in the first place . \n\nOne bad example: a female friend got unprotected sex, first time, on her period, not on the pill (yeah, wtf girl). Went to a doc who said no for plan B because she’s on her period so that must be ok, plus it’s her first time so she can’t be pregnant (science and accointances say both are wrong assumptions). Plus why refusing anyway. Then, back to your question, that doctor didn’t recommend her to be tested. What the fuck for a doctor. \n\n- side note, I think it connects also to the culture in nearby countries. Friends from SEA tell me that sex ed is very random where they’re from (or non exist at). Since many ppl here are immigrants or have origins in the region i believe it influences culturally the public demand in SG for testing. Just an adding factor. When I’ve been taking sex with other Western Europeans I pretty much found the same base sex education so it helps create a consistant baseline in the population’s mind. And some demand for adequate health care related to sexuality \n\n- I feel that fostering a culture of disciplined STD testing usually starts with sex talk between friends/accointances. How is this in SG youth?\n\nquestion for the locals: since young Singaporean lives mainly with their family and BF/GF sleep over is not a thing here, do you think it creates an atmosphere where sex has to be under wrap, like less talked about and even... less practiced? Like, how often a student have drunk one night stand after a party, «\xa0I was wasted, stupid me didn’t insist for a condom\xa0while we banged at his/her place ». The kind of crisis that leads to whatsapp chat with close friends about STD and all?\n\nAlright, these are my long thoughts on the various factors', 'People much prefer anonymous testing and by anonymous, I mean no info taken down rather than a mail in test. Some of the STI tests require a proper blood drawn or urine sample. You aren\'t going to mail that lol.\n\nThe younger age range 18-30 are actually more open to testing than once thought.\n\nI volunteered with AFA for years now and was part of the first ever outreach to university. Our first time at yale-nus, our contact estimated we would have 10 if we were lucky. We wound up having 80-100 clients.\n\nThe awareness of STIs is actually really low. The risk factor varies for HIV. For sexual intercourse, it\'s generally known that unprotected anal sex is the highest risk but it\'s riskier for the bottom partner (the partner receiving). \n\nThen there\'s also the debate about oral sex. While theoretically, it is possible but the odds are so low and the conditions need to be right for it to happen. The risk would require the person to be the giving partner and have the partner ejaculate into the mouth while having open wounds in the mouth. \n\nSo HIV alone has a lot of information that I haven\'t even given out so the awareness is very low. Unfortunately, I see quite a lot of heterosexuals not bothering to use condoms because of the perception of HIV as a ""gay disease"". \n\nDSC is the most affordable but depending on your luck, you may run into staff that are not as professional. There are private options like Dr Tan and partners but they cost an arm and leg.', 'My only experience was when my private clinic doctor suspected my UTI was an STD and took a test, but in the end was just UTI from an unfortunate accident.', 'I believe it’s my post I think.\n\nI still think the price is so damn shameful. 30 bucks for HIV AND another 30 for Syphilis.', 'Yeah! It would be helpful if you guys advertised:D', 'I did do the public one at DSC and cost me about $50ish for all test and medicine. Only problem is that I need wait about a month (2 weeks waiting time for the appointment, another 2 weeks for the test result). Overall is great, they have a counsellor who will talk to you if you are diagnosed with something. They will advise you to tell whoever you slept with to get tested also (I got chlamydia). \n\nThe second time I thought I caught STD again so I went  back DSC (all negative) but my piss still pain and feel similar to when I caught the chlamydia. So I just went to private clinic. Private clinic is like only 1 day settle everything doctor will give you all the medicine first and injection without waitting for the test result. mind you it cost me $1.2k though ugh. Then apparently I kana UTI. \n\nSide note the medicine for UTI, Chlaymdia and Ghonnorhea is the same one.

Although my parents logic is that, they prefer our significant other to sleep over, than we go sleep in their place so they can keep watch on us lol. But since us 3 siblings share the same room, really a sleepover by a significant other, doesn't translate to sex.\n\nI personally had an accident before, condom broke and panic, went for a Plan B at A&E at Thomson Medical, no questions asked, just told them condom broke and they issued it to me.

Anonimity is absolutely paramount when it comes to sensitive situations like these and such a service would simply not be viable (cost or otherwise).  \n  \nFor me and I believe a lot of people out there thinking of going for an std test for the first time, the real fear lies in thinking we're alone.

I still remember the days where I spent trawling and trawling on the internet for a Singaporean's view or experience with these tests, and found only 2 posts or so. As you can imagine, that was hardly reassuring.  \n  \nThat's why, if you really want to create a service that increases one's propensity to seek active testing, remove the fear first. If there was some form of a proper social group, anonymous or not, that actively discusses these processes at length, I believe that you assuage much of the fears many first-time testers may hold in their hearts.

Hello! I’m a current NUS Nursing student. This **LONG, INFORMATIVE post** is for those thinking about NUS Nursing but have some doubts regarding Nursing in general!

I can understand how daunting it can be - especially since you’re signing up for a specialized course / professional degree where you know exactly what you’ll be at the end - **a nurse.**

I wrote a post similar to this last year - see [ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING 1.0](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/azgfh5/uni_all_about_nus_nursing/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=web2x). **THIS IS AN UPDATED VERSION** of that post from the many more things that I learned the past year, during curriculum time and clinical placements.

\*Please note that I have made this post/factsheet as accurate as I possibly could, with hard evidence in some of the qns unlike the first version last year. I will \*try\* to answer qns here like what I did last year, but it is **better to hear from our teachers and fellow students straight during the open house! Links below.**

\*Edit: My friend has super kindly done a website sobs so helpful!! Here it is! [**https://allaboutnusnursing2020.weebly.com**](https://allaboutnusnursing2020.weebly.com/) **But continue to share this reddit post cuz discussion can only be here!!**

# 1 Curriculum

## 1.1 NUS Nursing

## Curriculum overview

Generally, the first 2 years we focus on learning the different body systems, how they function (Anatomy &amp;amp; Physiology) and dysfunction (Pathophysiology), coupled with each condition’s nursing management and hands-on skills. Interesting modules will also be taught such as communicating effectively and being culturally sensitive in the clinical setting, basic psychology for nurses, mental health nursing, and even ethics and law. The 3rd (and final year for most) will focus more on gearing us for eventual practice in the clinical setting with modules tackling leadership and community health. Finally, we will embark on a 3-month final clinical placement to emulate the real pace and nature of work, ensuring that we are competent to practice as registered nurses upon completion.

For people who can and choose to finish with an Honours degree, they embark on a year-long research project usually in their area of interest. Faculty staff members and hospital staff will act as mentors for these projects. Some examples of research projects can be found here: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/11/Project-list-AY2018-19.pdf)

***Difference between honors and without honors:***

* Basic monthly starting pay for some hospitals are different, may vary from $50-100 according the the annual graduate employment survey here: [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)
* Some overseas masters/PhD programmes require either an honours degree (directly)  or a normal bachelor’s degree with at least a few years of clinical experience
* Some hospitals/employers may view an honours degree more favourably in terms of salary and/or career progression

Complete information here on the NUS Nursing website, subject to changes every year: [https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/](https://medicine.nus.edu.sg/nursing/education/bachelor-of-science-nursing-bachelor-of-science-nursing-honours/academic-information/)

## Day-to-day lessons

Fun! We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins that can breathe and have pulses etc. We also have these people called standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills. They act like real patients with real symptoms and real family issues!

## Lectures and tutorials

Some lectures are video lectures - can watch at home at the pace you want! School is only around 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs. But of course, there are e-lectures to watch and tutorials to do and textbooks to read, so it’s not like you won’t have to do much studying outside those 2-4hrs/day. But if you manage your time well, it’s alright!

## For those worried about having no bio background:

There are people in Nursing who haven’t done bio since sec 1/2, and from poly who did non-science courses such as international business or mass communication.

The kind of bio that we learn is different from H2 Bio. H2 Bio deals with the very minute things like oxidative phosphorylation and ETC and Krebs cycle and all its small molecules. However, we deal with humans here. Human anatomy and physiology, the human body and how it dysfunctions. The anatomy and physiology mods are pretty similar to secondary school bio - you learn about the heart and how the blood flows in general, as well as how it dysfunctions. However, we don’t delve too deep into the molecules at all - that’s for the medical students to do. Yes, there will be a LOT of medical terms, and you have to be ready for that if you join nursing or any healthcare-related field, honestly. It’s hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will come naturally :)

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn’t delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries.

## For those scared of blood

During nursing school: We have cadaveric sessions - this means that you get to see real, preserved human bodies and you are required to touch and observe them, texture and all, during those anatomy sessions. They don’t look like normal fresh organs anymore - you can search some “science cadavers” to see what they look like! As for blood, generally you have to be alright with the sight of it as your first lab session will already have a finger-prick glucose test that you do on your friend (and vice versa). During clinicals, you will be exposed to wounds that may be huge and bleeding, etc, so you have to be okay with it. I do have some friends who enter nursing and medicine who are afraid of blood and needles and things like that - you can get used to it, through repeated exposure.

As a real nurse: You have to be alright with these sights as there of course may be some instances where the patient vomits blood/starts bleeding from somewhere and you have to manage the patient. If you are scared of blood and get posted to the operating theatre as an OT nurse, then you will be assisting doctors in surgeries where you WILL see these. I suggest you try to watch some youtube videos to see if you can take it. Do know that you can get used to it!! Bottomline is, you can’t be afraid of your own job.

## Lecturers/tutors

All teaching staff in ALCNS are previously doctors, nurses or pharmacists (for pharmacology). Usually, our heavily science-based modules are taught by previous doctors (eg: anatomy and physiology, pathophysiology), whereas more nursing-based modules are taught by previous or current nurses. This honestly helps a lot as our lecturers and tutors have had vast experiences in the clinical world, and therefore better able to relate what they teach with the clinical setting.

## Clinical placements

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards). But you will be reimbursed (paid) for the whole duration of placements!

## 1.2 Nursing degree vs diploma (polytechnic)

Main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around $800-1000 monthly, depending on the hospital (based on this [https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-poly-graduates-employed-six-months-after-graduation-with-12261278) and this [https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)). You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last year, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about $3100-3300 a month on average (just refer to the MOE website above).

# 

# 2. NUS Nursing student life opportunities

## 2.1 Unrestricted Electives

You are required/allowed to take a minimum of 2 (for bachelor’s degree) or 3 (for honours degree) unrestricted elective modules outside of the faculty for the duration that you are in NUS. That means that you can take almost any module of your liking, like French, Astronomy, Forensic Science, Drama, Philosophy, etc. This allows us to explore our interests outside the nursing curriculum.

## 2.2 Local and Overseas Community Involvement Programmes

The Faculty of Medicine (Medicine and Nursing) has a lot of student-initiated CIPs both locally and overseas. You can join many things, from conducting free basic health checks in the neighbourhood, to volunteering with patients with dementia at a community hospital, to teaching basic first aid and english lessons to kids overseas - there’s really a lot of opportunities for us to give back to the community. Furthermore, you get to work with the medical students too as most of these projects are jointly planned and executed by both nursing and medicine students.

## 2.3 Student Leadership Opportunities

Similar to “student council” in secondary/JC, you can join the Nursing Subclub, Mednurse Club or SNASC to champion your peers’ causes and hopefully make a difference in their lives and in the profession of nursing. Other leadership opportunities include but not limited to: leading CIPs, organizing freshmen orientation, nurses’ day etc..

## 2.4 Exchange Programmes

ALCNS partners with several universities in different countries worldwide for student exchange programmes. Some countries include: Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan, Indonesia, Korea, etc. The exchange programmes may occur during school time or vacation time, and usually lasts 1-4 weeks. Selection process is through application and is based on the student’s own merit (academic and portfolio, contribution to the school).

# 

# 3 Admission Information

## 3.1 Indicative Grade Profiles

## A Levels 2019

10th percentile: CCD/B

90th percentile: AAA/A

## Polytechnic GPA 2019

10th percentile: 3.33/4.0

90th percentile: 3.86/4.0

## 3.2 Admission Interviews

Not for everyone. Usually only done for people with rp near the cut-off point, to prove that you are not joining nursing purely because you can’t apply to any other course with your grades. This will weed out people who have absolutely no idea about nor passion for nursing. There are people who get in with lower rp than the IGP, but please put Nursing as 1st choice as that is a factor too. The format is somewhat like a panel interview, with 1 or 2 faculty members as your interviewers. 15-30min each.

## Tips

Be prepared but do not memorize a script. Just think through the usual interview questions and some of these additional questions below. I came up with this questions, it is in no way supposed to be representative of what the school will definitely ask. This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: Why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: What have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks and where you intend to go.

## 3.3 Scholarships

There are 2 kinds of “scholarships” - one is called MOH Scholarship and the other is called hospital sponsorship. The differences are below. There are also available financial help from NUS and ALCNS itself. Please refer to the NUS/ALCNS website for more information.

## MOH Scholarship

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (given in 6-monthly basis)
* PROS: money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get (requires excellent A Level grades (usually &amp;gt;85 rp from what I heard) and &amp;gt;4.0/5.0 CAP for mid-term scholarship.

## Hospital Sponsorships

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates want to work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, easier to get.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else, just monthly allowance

You don’t need to decide whether you want to take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they want to get sponsored by.

# 

# 4 Nature of Work

## 4.1 Job Scope

As for job scope, you go in as SN I as mentioned earlier, which is more senior than SN II, Enrolled Nurses, healthcare attendants, etc. The implication is that you will be usually the main person in charge of a cubicle, for example, with around 4-8 patients at any given time, updating the family members, doctors, other healthcare professionals.

## DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?

I love this question about the stigma hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers MAY not be done (or not usually done) by staff nurses - it is usually done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses.

Staff nurses’ \*main\* roles are as follows:

1. Dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr’s orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are THE EYES. IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. Side effects of medications. Psychological state. Family/patient concerns. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: “nurse! Why does my father have an IV drip???” - have to explain that it’s because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

Sometimes SNs may get assigned (or just do) the “cleaning” duties due to reasons such as understaffing or skin integrity assessment. That’s honestly good, to remain competent with basic nursing care of the patients such as helping with activities of daily living (bathing, toileting, etc).

## 4.2 Salary

Nursing is actually one of the highest paid degrees in the market. 

As mentioned earlier, refer here: 

[https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf](https://www.moe.gov.sg/docs/default-source/document/education/post-secondary/files/web-publication-nus-ges-2018.pdf)

## 4.3 Career progression

There are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor’s degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take an advanced diploma or master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. 

They are: management, clinical and education tracks. 

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff problems etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like “mini doctors”. If you don’t know, some clinics in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds (must take extra course) without doctors. The only thing they cannot do will be surgery. 

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach. 

Occasionally, some people do clinical and education for example, this is called joint appointments. So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

# 5 Other common questions

## 5.1 Medicine vs nursing

**Know that: doctors cure, nurses care.** So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer for theory: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics, good enough to catch mistakes but not deep enough to the point that we are able to treat diseases with multiple complications for example!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look at the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children? What will the side effects of the meds/surgery be? Will he be able to cope?

So ask yourself, which role do you want to play?

## 5.2 Why NOT nursing?

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there’s anything that made me want to turn away from Nursing. From my convos with many nurses in the wards, it’s mostly these:

1. You will inevitably get attached to some pts, especially if you work as a community hospital nurse where pts there stay for 3 months or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)
3. Nursing is an extremely tiring job, physically and emotionally. Be prepared to work long hours with limited time for your own needs such as food or even simply toileting. While it is my intention to elevate the profession of nursing by addressing stigmas, I do not intend to over glorify the profession and give everyone the false hope that nursing is very fun and easy. It takes real guts and strength to be a nurse, and you should only join if you think you are up for the challenge to learn and push yourself.

## 5.3 Overseas nursing

I think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, are trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a fresh grad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.

There’s also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I’m not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fast food meal in the US can easily cost $15. 

I think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes, you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues.

Bottomline is, it’s up to you, and what is the most important for you :)

## 5.4 Dealing with deaths as a nurse

I haven’t personally experienced it as a nurse as I haven’t been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals.

1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.
2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it’s a death after all, I know that she’s in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.
3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it’s your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It’s alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.

1. Is it possible for an international student to have employment opportunities in the public service or civil service sector after graduating from university?

2. What are the best suited degrees for public administration or service here in Singapore? Law(although I might not make the cut for it since I am not that academically gifted)? Political Sciences? Or others?

nooooblet,hhoiqu,A response to HSK,2020-06-29 07:07:54,singapore,378760,9,18,"[https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-clear-mandate-very-important-to-tackle-challenges-ahead-says-heng-swee](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-clear-mandate-very-important-to-tackle-challenges-ahead-says-heng-swee)

TLDR: Political fear mongering is a tool used to garner votes. Perhaps not beneath candidates running for parliament in Singapore. 

Our future PM has stated that a clear mandate is required, he has also stated that anything other than PAP is risky.

I would like to remind everyone that the government of the day is formed by a simple majority. And with approximately 63 seats that government will have free reign over our country.

Looking at the opposition, note comments by WP (above article) and PSP ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/progress-singapore-party-member-draws-ire-with-remarks-on-proposed-opposition-alliance](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/progress-singapore-party-member-draws-ire-with-remarks-on-proposed-opposition-alliance) ). The opposition clearly does not have faith in their own peers to win against the PAP. What are the chances that oppositions aside from PSP and WP might win a single seat?

In any case, let's evaluate the potential contests that the PAP faces - outside of WP and PSP.

[https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-with-new-leaders-and-new-parties-a-much-changed-opposition-gets-ready-for](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-with-new-leaders-and-new-parties-a-much-changed-opposition-gets-ready-for)

We start with our honorable SPP, thank you Mr Chiam for your years of service and dedication.  What is the SPP without CST, the party has been in a downward spiral since he took a step back. A party run on a person's legacy is nothing but an empty shell.

Our resident siao lang keng (this is not a term given by me), SDP, has always put forth people with very strong credentials but they still face a huge stigma because of reasons. Regardless, at the end of the day the majority of voters vote on emotion rather than rationality. With approximately 11 seats up for grabs, let's give CSJ 3 for the lulz, after all we should be looking at the worst case scenario for HSK right?

Next up! we have the NSP. This party likes to talk about jokes, unfortunately they are the funniest of the bunch! In 2011, it was called the nicole seah party, after a candidate! How low must you go before you completely lose your party's identity? With every face of the 2015 NSP joining a new party for 2020, what is the NSP? It is nothing but a brand new party with brand new faces. Cross fingers, in the best case opposition scenario NSP doesn't go bankrupt.

PPP, who gives up before the fight begins? Declaring its your last election before nomination day and complaining about how tough it is on your family - I feel for you. Really I get it. The people probably get it too.... I applaud you for putting nation before self but when you can't even support your family, please call it quits.

DPP, I guess I spoke too soon, the DPP pulled out before anyone even asked if they were contesting.

RP, the leader of RP is serving his SHN now, his campaigning is probably going to be highly ineffective from that position.

Did I forget to mention the SDA? An alliance meant to bring together groups of opposition parties - a bold idea by our dear CST. However, since leadership has changed hands, it is but a shell. In any case, the SDA will be contesting in ppp grc. with two-thirds of PAP's teo's standing in ppp grc, I doubt they stand a chance.

PV, I don't know much about lim tean, what I know about him is he enjoys pointing fingers at the government with little concrete solutions. For a tiny party to declare a shadow minister kind of signals they are slightly unhinged.

Red dot ?? The first time I heard of these people was last night, they are contesting in Jurong GRC. I think this signals outright that they are off the rails. DO you know who runs in Jurong? Can anyone tell me ????

&#x200B;

YES, the prime minister we WANT and NEED but do not DESERVE!!!!

Apparently we aren't ready for an Indian PM (shame on Singapore )

BUT WAIT, I have only mentioned 11 parties.... oh right... one party DISSOLVED!

With a total of 21 seats being contested by WP, giving TCB west coast grc and throwing in 3 SMCs for SDP (because why not) . PAP will return with a minimum of 64 seats! A beautiful 2/3's majority to pass any bill that the next government may desire.

In fact, if koh poh koon decides to abandon YCK to create a 4 way fight in punggol west, leaving YCK seat empty, The PAP will still be returned with a 2/3's majority! I highly suggest he does so, the urge to serve punggol must have been burning inside of him.",0.61,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hhoiqu/a_response_to_hsk/,"['> Political fear mongering is a tool used to garner votes.

They are also rational people, they know their odds of winning is against them. Yet they still do what they do, so we, the voters have a choice. You say what choice do we have if the opposition candidates are not up to par. But you do. If you think PAP is doing a great job, vote for them. If you think they are not or could do better, vote for the other candidate to show your unhappiness. At least you get to vote. If they have a walkover, they can say the people is in agreement with us and they have the mandate to do whatever they like.

quietobserver1,fegxeg,Opinion: We should de-stigmatize wearing masks,2020-03-07 01:33:46,singapore,378760,22,0,"In my opinion, we've gone overboard with the messaging about not using masks if you are not sick, to the extent that people worry that they will be looked at negatively if they wear one, unless they look obviously sick (in which case it's another kind of negative look because yeah what's a sick person doing walking around)

In this situation where it seems even people with very mild symptoms can cause a new cluster, we need to ensure that anybody who suspects they might be sick won't feel bad wearing a mask. So instead of looking at people wearing masks with accusing looks and calling them ""kiasi"" or irresponsible, we should instead be saying ""thanks for considering the health of those around you"". Because they might be sick and you just can't see it yet.

Of course the question is where are those masks going to come from? Well, the four masks per family were a month ago, so even if people are responsibly wearing them, you can expect many families will have used theirs up by now. I hope the government has planned ahead and has a solution so people don't have to say ""My symptoms are mild, I'd better save the masks for if I'm really sick""",0.42,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fegxeg/opinion_we_should_destigmatize_wearing_masks/,"['What stigma is there?

A problem is that sick people may not look sick, but that's a different matter altogether.\n\nFrom the start, it was correct that sick people should wear masks and healthy people not, so that these sick people could be able to get their hands on them. Unfortunately with the virus here to stay, and masks wasted unnecessarily -- noting that it is mathematically unrealistic to have enough for everyone over a prolonged period, we are starting to see sick people without masks (refer to recent anecdotes of sneezing/coughing openly in trains in daily threads) which is a very bad scenario as global infections start to skyrocket and spread over here.\n\nI think the govt planned ahead in the right manner by minimizing infections through rigorous contact tracing and being transparent about our current situation to build trust. Imo, trying to get more masks is not the right solution due to limited stocks, ever-increasing global demand, and that China (that manufacture the most) is also the most badly affected. Not that most people use masks correctly anyway and so is best reserved to medical pros who can use them best."", 'What kind of crap are you spouting?

There are still people who continue to wear masks today. The issue is contingent on the fact that people treat masks like some sort of godlike impenetrable Great Wall which it clearly isn't.

If someone in the family catches a flu or cold, chances are high that the other family members will catch it too. This means that a single bout of cold or flu can easily wipe out the family's four masks since that trip to the GP will use up a few masks.\n\n>Of course the question is where are those masks going to come from?\n\nIf the mask is for protecting others from you, then a cloth mask, an anti-allergy mask or even a summer scarf covering your face can help since they can catch the respiratory droplets.\n\nIf desperate, you can also reuse the surgical mask after sterilizing it with heat (e.g. steam iron) or a UV light pen."", ""If mask wearers are not gonna practice proper hygiene before and while wearing masks then I will continue to call them kiasi and/or irresponsible.

Japan and South Korea have long done it before we do and people here in SG have started wearing it in view of the current situation.\n\nThe alternative reason that the narrative of  ""only wear a mask if you\'re sick"" is so that the mask goes to the users who thoroughly deserve it - those working in the frontlines of the virus, those who are sick and those with pre-existing medical conditions who need the mask to protect their immunity systems. It\'s better to give the resources who are involved in the fight than ourselves so that we can rid of this virus faster.\n\nHealthy people should at least observe personal hygiene. The only concern is that those who are truly sick may not be wearing them (due to scarcity or \'kiasi\'-ism), or those who display/feel that they have symptoms may insist on not going to the doctor. That is the concern we should be afraid of, not the one on public perception of wearing a mask.  \n\n\nGlobally, we\'re probably facing a shortage of masks in the world, so again, it\'s best to give the resources to those who are directly involved in the eradication of the virus, so that life can return to normal.', 'Where did the stigmatise for wearing mask when you are sick crap come from.

You put newer masks into the stockpile and release the older ones into the market. Surgical masks expire after 3 years.

bloopwhatisthis,izk64b,[Rant] What's next after ITE/Poly/Uni?,2020-09-25 22:14:15,SGExams,77673,0,18,"I've noticed many posts here wondering what their next steps should be after graduation be it ITE/Poly/Uni.

This is my take on things but I am very much limited on my knowledge on what is out there so anyone who has additional advices and resources please feel free to chime in!!

Gone are the days where the paths one could take after graduation is to either work or study.

Here are some of the resources that I've found to be really helpful:

[SkillsFuture](https://www.skillsfuture.sg) \- I ***HIGHLY RECOMMEND*** all recent or soon to be graduates to check it out if you've never. There are a lot of additional support being rendered especially in light of COVID. There's many schemes available in case the traditional work or study route does not suit you.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) \- Building up your LinkedIn network can open new opportunities for you professionally. Take some time out to build up your presence on it and you will be surprised what it can do for you!

[WSG SG](https://www.ssg-wsg.gov.sg/individuals.html) \- Related to skillsfuture

***Your school's education and career guidance*** \- This is another area that many tend to overlook till it's too late. Your school would probably have invested a lot in having career coaches, counsellors as well as industry mentors as part of the support infrastructure available to students as well as alumni. Talk to them and make full leverage of their industry experience and insights to make the a decision that best suits you. I used to have a stigma thinking that talking to counsellors or coaches means that I'm struggling but having been to several myself over the course of my studies, I can safely say that their advice has been invaluable for me in terms of (but not limited to) CVs, Interviews, Interest in certain industries, Aptitude, Career Paths & progression.

Last of all, believe me when I tell you, it's not the end if you are not able achieve what you have set out to achieve!

Whatever you are doing now, remember that success comes in many forms so don't get stressed out just because you are taking a path less  traditional/common to many of your peers!

All the best!!!",0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/izk64b/rant_whats_next_after_itepolyuni/,[]
PsychoMan53,hgq0jb,Private diploma vs regular diploma,2020-06-27 16:41:37,askSingapore,44638,2,1,"Hi, I'm currently serving my second year of national service and am ORDing in April next year. Currently I have a spot reserved in temasek for that same year however, recently a close friend that's serving with me brought to my attention the potential choice of going private. 

After considering and researching the time and money taken to go private as compared to taking the govt schooling route. I was optimistic about giving this a chance. Having discussed this with my family this weekend they gave me a separate opinion, that regular poly diplomas are more credible as compared to a private on (I'm aiming for PSB) and that it would be more beneficial for me to take that in exchange for the 3 years it'll take to get it.

To anyone who has went through either of these paths, how was it and in hindsight, which would be best. Thanks any answers!",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/hgq0jb/private_diploma_vs_regular_diploma/,"['I’m a poly grad, currently doing Uni and from what I hear from my friends/colleagues in my temp jobs the consensus is that private diplomas/degrees aren’t as prestigious as local ones. Mainly bc the barrier to entry is lower which carries the mindset that “rejects” go there. And if you want to go into industries who have big companies like banking and all, most of the time HR will filter those who come from local unis/diplomas over private ones. Although it private degrees/diplomas take a shorter time to complete but you might have a harder time securing a job due to this bias that some HRs will have. I’ve also heard of pay discrepancies between local n private certs. Ofc this isn’t applicable to every company/industry, if you take a lot of internships and have a good portfolio in whatever you want to do. I’m sure there are many success stories of those who went the private route too but imo, since you can take the local route just do so', 'Hello! I have intentions to start a private diploma before gg up to a degree too!! ( I also have a local diploma bc I was 17 and didn’t know what to do w my life 🤡🤡)\n\nDEGREE WISE\nIt’s true that there is some stigma between private and public degrees and diploma. From what I have asked around, many MNCs don’t rlly care bout the degree. Once u start the job, how u go up the ranks  is essentially the same level as others from local. (Aka EQ is impt) but I haven’t worked so I’m not as sure. \n\nLocal companies r more familiar with local u and alongside w the stigma it may be slightly tougher to apply for a job+ lower pay. However once u have a job it doesn’t matter since more will be from experience. It would be good if u can even form meaningful friends and connections from your degree etc \n \nDIPLOMA WISE\nFrom a local reg diploma, it is easier to get into private degrees (as u can skip a year with a certain gpa) if it’s related. Diploma wise it is also more stable as most local u do not recognize private diploma if you’re looking for that stability. Local u also stigmatize against some private diplomas I feel.  But imo a private diploma gives you time of doing what you want outside of school. \n\nUltimately it goes down to what you’re actually studying. If you’re doing STEM all of this will be relevant but if you’re gg into arts a good portfolio is enuf to go anywhere.  \n\nBut but this is all hearsay so please do your own research! Ask ppl who studied at mdis etc.']"
throwawayed79,figbmn,[JC] I'm left out in my class. Should I change classes?,2020-03-14 18:26:23,SGExams,77673,32,25,"yo!

I'm a new j1 student and I can't really relate to the classmates in my class ( have history with one of them) and most of the cliques are either exclusive(from same old schools) or super high and popular. (and everyone is in a clique so I can't start one)

I really feel left out by the cliques in my class even when I try to join in and I feel I'll do better somewhere else. I thought I had made friends but some of my friends ditched me for eg during recess before I finish eating or during lesson times to seat with other people despite the sitting plan. I've went for numerous class outings but it has not seemed to help much. I feel sad when I go to school or when I have to spend time with my class.

I'm thinking of changing classes, but I'm not sure about the social implications of doing so. I think that it will be better, but I can't say for sure. Just wanna hear good and bad experiences of changing classes before I make my choice.

&#x200B;

Can I also hear if there is a lot of stigma in changing classes/is there a very high chance of being ostracised in my new class because I'm a transfer kid?

thanks y'alls! :)",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/figbmn/jc_im_left_out_in_my_class_should_i_change_classes/,"['Personal experience here...\n\nSo in j1 I also felt very out of touch with my class. I felt that many of them had alr formed cliques and left me out, like forming WhatsApp chat groups and organising gatherings without including me. Of course, I felt very lonely. At the same time, I also felt kind of betrayed since I did make the effort to attend the first few class gatherings but maybe I just wasn’t as interesting? Or I couldn’t be engaging enough since I was a pretty bad introvert.\nHowever, I also knew that changing class would not be a viable option since I may have to change subject combi and going into a new environment may make the situation even worse. Hence, running away from the current situation isn’t rly a valid option.\n\nFast forward 2 years, I managed to find my place in the class and have a few good friends when I graduated.\n\nSo, these are the few things that made things better:\n\n1) Remain open and try to engage them\n\nYes, it can be mentally tiring knowing that your efforts are not really paying off which honestly makes you feel like giving up. However, just know that as long as you maintain a positive attitude and remain open, you will eventually meet the right friends who will click with you. Some ways you can remain open can be lending a helping hand when they need help. For example, when they need help for tutorials or just sending them daily reminders on important things. Know that there are certain things about yourself that makes you likeable as a friend and a person even though not everyone will appreciate it. For a starter, just try talking to a few people you feel comfortable around and make a few friends first\n\n2) Develop friendships elsewhere\n\nAlthough friendships made through class will always be the closest, you can also try to make friends through CCAs, etc\n\n3) You could be just overthinking\nIn my case, I always thought that my class didn’t welcome me at the start and I always felt like an outlier in class. However, you don’t really know if that’s the case since you don’t really talk to them and maybe things aren’t that bad? So, it all boils down to maintaining a positive attitude and not being overly self conscious.\n\n\nTo wrap up, to be honest, jc goes by very fast and before you know it, you will be swarmed by academic  and CCAs commitments. Fitting in will take time especially if you are an introvert but just be yourself and be open! I’m sure you will be able to find a few people that you can proudly call them as your friends.\n\nEveryone goes through the phase of finding their place in a new environment although some take a longer time so don’t worry too much!', ""There's a chance something similar will happen in future.

About half a term has passed so changing subject combi may mean that you have ALOT of catchup to do. Whether that is worth it or not is up to you to decide\n\n2. Like others mentioned, there is a still a chance that they same thing may happen in your new class, even more so since they’ve had some extra time together by now. Like someone else mentioned, are you gonna quit your job because you don’t click with your colleagues?\n\nI know it’s tough to go through school feeling so lonely. I was in your shoes not too long ago. Let me assure you that it is completely possible to do fine in PW even though you aren’t friends with your group mates. As long as you guys can work professionally together, the A is still very much within reach. Beyond that, it is very possible to survive school alone. Yes it sucks, yes it doesn’t feel good, but it is possible to survive.

So I’m wondering is there any Singaporean here who is a student or alumni of Kaplan, especially those from the University of Murdoch doing business/marketing degree? If so, can I ask how is/was studying in Kaplan like, in terms of the quality of lecturers and learning.

I also would like to ask the alumni on whether it was difficult finding a job or having a career progression in Singapore with a private degree.

In no way am I trying to put down anyone but I’m trying to put things the way I see it.\n\nI can’t comment on quality of lecturers in Kaplan but here are my thoughts on career prospects and career progression.\n\n1. Career Prospects\n\nI don’t think you’d find it hard or impossible to find a job, in fact in all likelihood you’d probably find a job 3-6 months after graduation. Check out this [ST article ](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/better-job-outlook-for-private-school-grads-but-pay-unchanged-survey) published last Apr and the latest [GES (graduate employment survey) ](https://www.skillsfuture.sg/NewsAndUpdates/DetailPage/14df6883-4542-462d-ba88-ac7b24c26c0d) for more info on employment outcomes for private uni students. \n\nI think the main issue is rather on the sort of expectations you have when it comes to your first job. What kind of pay are you expecting? What kind of job scope are you thinking about? If you have high expectations like a high paying job that is cushy, then your prospects are pretty bad. Temper your expectations based on the job market and your qualifications. \n\nPriv uni students on average earn less than local uni students, so if the average pay for a Local student is 3-4K don’t expect 5k or sth. I was talking to this girl entering PSB biomedical who expected to earn 5k after graduation, local uni grads of the same field don’t even earn that much! And they spent 4 years mugging for their degree, why would a private uni degree that is a single year long earn more? Imagine approaching a potential employer and asking for that amount, you’d be off the list instantly. \n\n2. Career progression\n\nI don’t think you’ll be hampered at all in the private sector. Civil service on the other hand seems to disadvantage private uni students, so do take that into account. \n\nProgression after your first job doesn’t depend on your degree, it depends on you. What experience you can garner and what you expose yourself to matters a thousand times more than what degree you earned in the first place. \n\nOverall, private uni students may have a disadvantaged starting pay and job, but after that (barring civil service) progression is totally up to you.', '[deleted]', ""Hi there!

Would like to get some opinion/clarification after I had a talk with a friend since I’m a female and not too familiar with how NS works. From what I’ve heard from a friend, if you’re diagnosed with mental illness you would be immediately placed in PES E and that got me thinking about the whole stigma/stereotype that society have on someone with a mental illness. So,

Question 1: Is it true that you’ll be placed in PES E & do they have any check up before seeing if you’re to be assigned to the various PES? 

Question 2: Does that mean that there is no chance for  a person to serve frontline even if they are able to keep themselves in check?

caasi_las,gbb1d2,Help with mental health,2020-05-01 11:53:04,askSingapore,44638,9,16,"Hey folks, a little background before we start. I am 23 years old probably having my quarter life crisis. Here are a couple of things I would like to cover: 
1. Being alone 
2. Studies (loss of motivation/drive)
3. Advice

Currently still in school but due to this pandemic, online classes played no part in making my situation better. Although being an introvert all my life, I’ve never had problems making friends. However the problem lies with keeping friends. I feel at most times, they’ll just get bored of me or have better friends to talk to/hang out, leaving me to be alone. Overtime I’ve accustomed to this treatment, forcing myself to think that it’s just part and parcel of life or adulthood. People come and go and if they really want to stay they will make an effort to stay.

Next is my studies. Throughout my life I’ve achieved what many would say is great academic excellence but it all meant nothing to me. I did it just to impress my friends and families. For them to notice or be proud. To be proud to have a son/friend like me. I never did what I did for my own pleasure. However once I got into uni, my mentality just changed. I didn’t see a need for whatever I was studying (or rather I felt whatever I was studying was irrelevant for my major). Getting a degree, I feel, is just a test of your adaptability and perseverance. So naturally with this kind of mentality and lack of drive, I fell behind. Little by little I felt myself in a pit for which I could not get out from. 

I’ve actually been feeling this way of why bother, I just wanna end everything/I’m better off dead/I’m worthless anyway kind of mentality but I’ve always put it aside as I thought it’s just a bad day, not a bad life right? Plus in this Asian culture, many would think mental illness not as serious as physical illness. There has been such a huge stigma on people who seek help. Also as a male, it would imply that I am weak. But the truth is that I am weak, I’ve been weak for so long till I need help. I’ve always thought it’s just today that I’m feeling this way, I’ll get better when I wake, but I low key don’t want to wake up. And when I do, the dread of getting out of bed is immense. I’m always afraid of the black mark it will leave on my record for the future if I apply for a job. My future employers would definitely question my capabilities if they see this on my record (if I actually have depression). 

I know that when I’m outside of my head, when I’m a friend, or a son, I feel fine. But once it’s at the end of the day when I’m alone inside my own head, I’m just a mess. It’s a bad pLace which I can’t be inside by myself. Especially during this period when you don’t have much to do, it’s always the end of the day for which I’m not actively getting out of myself. And I can tell you 80% of my problems are self inflicted. Basically me overthinking all my problems. 

For those who know others that are going through something similar or are just like me please, I need your advice. Do I see a therapist, and if so could I get the details? Also, if I were to see a therapist I wouldn’t want my parents to know, so I would have to get out of the house with an excuse...thank you for your time. Cheers and stay safe.",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/gbb1d2/help_with_mental_health/,"['Hey there! First and foremost, I\'m sorry you\'re feeling this way, and I understand it\'s hard, especially in times of isolation like this. \n\nAs someone with a diploma in counselling and a degree in psychology, I do know a thing or two when I say that you\'re displaying very strong signs of depression. \n\nI know in our Asian culture mental health isn\'t discussed about as openly as in other parts of the world, and coupled with your being a guy it is easily dismissed as you simply being ""weak"". Heck when I told my parents I wanted to do psychology, they looked at me like I was the crazy one. \n\nBut here\'s the thing, if you\'re not feeling right in the head, nothing you do will be right. The more you try, the more you\'ll feel like an imposter just riding the day to day life. \n\nSome of the advices here are helpful, but I would suggest getting professional help as soon as you can. Why? Because you\'ve already shown ideation of suicide. Sorry to say, but that ish needs to be dealt with swiftly. Your head is not a safe space right now, you don\'t need to be alone in your thoughts. In fact, that\'s one of the last things you should do. \n\nYou need a professional to help guide you for a while, to equip you with the tools to be able to eventually cope with it yourself. \n\nHit me up if that was helpful and you\'d like to dig more into my brain I guess? :)', 'Being alone is not necessarily a bad thing. One of the challenges we commonly face is that we let our self worth be determined by others. We always look into external validation to feel that we have a place in this world. \n\nBefore you see a therapist, spend some time alone thinking about what kind of person you want to grow into and work towards that. Once your find your purpose internally, things will start to change. Negativity is contagious and nobody wants to stick around with negative people. Be the person you want to be with, and naturally you’ll find friends that will stat with you.\n\nHaving friends is not a goal to aim for, but a result of you being the best version of yourself even with flaws (nobody is perfect).\n\nAs for studies, you’re right to say that it’s a test of perseverance. Not everyone is lucky enough for find their calling early in life. I too studied a subject that I felt wasn’t right for me (I graduated and changed careers gradually but I’m where I am now thanks to a good GPA from that degree).\n\nA degree course is only short term. It’s difficult, it may be boring, but think of it as a challenge to overcome in order to move on. Prove to yourself that you can be good at everything you do!', ""For starters you can make an appointment with a polyclinic that offers psychological treatment/consultation services and see how they can help you. After this CB period at least.\n\nAs for an excuse to your parents, maybe you could start working out or something at home now? And like after CB ends you can claim to be going out to exercise when you're going to seek help? Just a thought.\n\nI know you've probably heard this plenty before, but it can get better. The fact that you're looking to get help now shows that you want to and hence can get better with the right help and time. Stay strong brother, another day you spend struggling in the rain, is another you have the chance to see the sun once again. As long as you don't give up, you can keep trying to make yourself better."", 'Hi there! \n\nFirst of all, you are taking a very big step to sort of ‘ask’ for help. That is very brave of you. \n\nI’m sorry that life haven’t been fantastic. With the CB measures, it is definitely taking a toll on almost everyone’s health (mentally/physically/emotionally etc). Most people have the need to socialise, be it going for a meal, hiking etc, anywhere but home 24/7 because it can get quite stuffy in the mind. So I can safely say that I understand your situation. \n\nAs for the friends part, honestly it is by luck about how people treat friendship. Circumstances right now reveal how people show their concern towards others. Some people may be low maintenance, while others go the extra mile to show their love and care. So, my question to you is, what are you expecting out of your friendships? Do you want them to check up on you? But of course, we cannot force people to become a certain way because the person would be seen as doing what you deem fit (aka insincere actions) and you might start to doubt their intentions. Why is friendship by luck? Because we are not able to control the environment we are in, except to hope for the best and prepare for the worst. So, i hope you can see that you are putting effort in your friendship and others may not be reciprocating it in the way you wanted. What you can do is, maybe highlight to them casually. “Hey, are you free for an hour? Maybe we can HouseParty and play games.” If you have made multiple attempts, and they do not seem to reciprocate, you can safely draw the conclusions. But that doesn’t mean you stop living because of people who are not worth your time. You live for yourself. You live for the things you have yet to accomplish. You live for the tomorrows you are gonna catch. Your favourite cereal, chicken rice, tehpeng, waffles. (Sorry I love food, can’t think of a better example). \n\nBeing alone is not a scary thing. Being alone with negative thoughts is. There are many many many benefits to being alone most of the time, one of which is having a clearer idea of who you are, what you want. This makes you a person knowing your goal. Which is great because I haven’t found my goal yet. HAHA. \n\nStudying in uni was probably the worst schooling period for me. I felt like death, only doing it because I want a cert. I was lucky to have friends for me to lean on most of the time. But I was able to overcome the distaste for studying by reminding myself that if I don’t do this (and drop out), I might regret it. “Tough times don’t last, tough people do”. My method of coping is unhealthy, because I cry a lot, always feeling sorry for myself etc. Every fail grade I got makes me hate myself more, like why did I become stupider etc. But, this is the last time I’m studying, why give up now, I told myself. \n\nI am kind of having my quarter life crisis too, except I need to find a job soon as I’m graduating. My friends are getting offers while I only get interviews. A few weeks ago, I start to feel that I was in a dark place, waking up feeling like a failure. I can only vent my frustration but it seems like an overflowing sea of unhappiness. I couldn’t stop feeling pity for myself. Talked to strangers, talked to friends, talked to family, but still I’m suffering. Then slowly, I start to see that I am feeling sorry for myself. Every time I put myself down, I keep feeling sorry for myself. And I no longer want to feel this way. So whenever I get this negative thought, I plaster over with “im not gonna feel sorry for myself” and move on to other things in life (such as exercising, watching an unhealthy amount of drama/shows/youtube, eating). \n\nIf you want to chat, you can drop my inbox a message. \n\nStay strong even when you feel like crying, because one day you will see that you are better than this (right now) and because of how you hold out, you were able to achieve what you have at that point in life.', 'Try this: https://www.betterhelp.com/', 'Your post really resonated with how I used to feel a year ago. Firstly, I just want to let you know that you are not alone in feeling this way, and that even though it feels like you will be stuck in this deep hole forever, it is not true! Seeing that you are looking for a way out of this and seeking some advice, I know you can find your way out of this and emerge a stronger person. \n\nI believe so because last year, due to stress from school or more likely the dread of having to face my future (getting into uni, getting through uni, getting a job), I began to see no point in whatever my duties were in life at that point (focusing on studies). Nothing interested me and everything just felt like obligations that I had zero interest or emotional investment in. So I just felt like life was so pointless, at that time. I would finish my studies, get decent scores, go to a boring uni, get a boring degree, live a boring life. This statement might sound perfectly okay to others, even desirable to some, but to me, who just a few months before this period of my life used to look forward so much to what the future had in store for me, it felt like my life had ended. Perhaps that was possible because I was immature or naive, but I truly used to believed that my life was exciting and filled with endless possibilities. \n\nLooking back, I now know what caused my drastic change in my outlook on life. It will sound cringey, but that very thing is having a dream. Your dream might sound very far away, unrealistic even, from your current position in life. But that is the very nature of a dream. It might be crazy, but it is an important source of hope, that keeps you looking forward, and gets you through the tough times. The seemingly endless, exhausting routine of school I had to go through really wore me out. And when I found out about the realities of pursuing my dreams and going to a dream university, that with my family situation it would not be easy, I decided to give up on my dreams so as not to burden my parents. So I shared with my parents that it\'s okay if I didn\'t go to that overseas university to study that expensive course, I am okay with studying the cheapest course at a local uni.\n\nBut the very night I went to bed after I told my parents that, I felt as if all the light in my world had shut off. Suddenly my heart felt so heavy, and I felt a sadness I never felt before. Each consequent day became longer and harder to get through. At first, in the day I was fine, if I was with my friends and not thinking much. But once night came, it always brought the same mental struggles. This sadness and dread for my new ""boring"" future. I would cry myself to sleep every night. Over time, even in the day I could no longer be positive. If my friends were joking or having a good time, my heart couldn\'t follow. Like I forgot how it felt to truly be happy and excited for life. I cannot explain how confused I felt too at that time, because I really used to be someone who could not understand how anyone could have depression. I became disappointed in myself, for becoming that person, for becoming so weak. Now even crying could not help me sleep. My sadness would keep me up at night and I would lie in my bed wishing so desperately to go to sleep and never wake up. I became even more withdrawn, that even being around my close friends gave me anxiety. But I never shared about this with anyone, so I think you are really brave to be reaching out like this...\n\nI somehow dragged myself to finish the school year and sit for the exams, but I was still so tired of life that I decided to take a gap year. I was not interested in more school. But just for my parents\' peace of mind, I finally decided to apply for the same course at a local uni as my close friend. I had no interest or even knowledge about that course.. Then with that momentum, at the very last minute decided to try for the heck of it for a course at an overseas uni I could actually envision myself enjoying. There was less than 2 hours to the deadline so I really was not expecting much, because as I said before, I told myself I had given up on my dreams.\n\nThe night I got the acceptance letter at the local uni, I got hit by that all too familiar wave of sadness. It felt like a confirmation that my life really is over. I would really be living that stable, but ""boring"" future that I dread so much. I really saw no point in living. The week that followed was a huge struggle. I realised how much I did not want to be going there, but I also thought that I really did not have a choice anymore, because how would my parents react if I ungratefully rejected that uni? I cried so much every night and day. \n\nThen all of a sudden, so unexpectedly, I received an offer from the overseas uni, with a full scholarship even. It was so shocking for me because while I was wading in all my sadness, this did not even seem like an option to me. In one moment all of that deep deep sadness and dread I had been drowning in was swept away. I was literally moved to tears. I couldn\'t, and still can\'t, believe that I can follow my dreams again. That the universe had allowed me to do so. This feeling is so powerful. To have hope again in your heart, and to find joy in life, is to be working towards your dream. Even though my dream still feels far away, I am so grateful to even be on the path towards it, to be able to take the first step towards it.\n\nSo to sum this long long post up, I\'m just saying that having a dream helped me emerge from that period of darkness. I don\'t want to force this on you, but I believe that God has the best plan for each one of us, whether we realise it or not. So if you have no idea what dream you have, you might try praying about it, and perhaps you might feel Him drop a dream in your heart! I will be praying for you too, all the best!', 'Self realization & then seeking improvement for yourself is a big step. The mentioned self inflicted thoughts should be the first to go.

i was hoping any senior could help me out by maybe sharing their experience during os and which course of study they chose and whether or not they enjoy or have any regrets about it? anything would be helpful rly, but some of my main enquiries:

1) is choice of school rly that important? (for poly, eg tp - design, sp - engineering etc)
2) are design courses rly as tedious as everyone says?
3) did u do better than u expected for os and got into a course u desired?
4) do you have any regrets joining your current course?
5) how is MI like? do people look down on MI kids as compared to other jc kids?
6) did you choose a school by its location or for its course itself? (in the case where different schools offer similar courses)

cosmicjae,dn8ru2,[O Levels] Some advice to those who might need them!,2019-10-26 11:57:22,SGExams,77673,26,172,"Hello! (this is my first time posting something here so it’s gonna be messy but here goes nothing) 

I’m a private candidate for O’ levels this year. The first time I sat for O’s was in 2016, 3 years ago. I still remember very clearly what I went through but I wish I can forget it all. It was the worst period of my life, and I truly felt like I’ve had hit rock bottom. Every time I completed a paper, I would never fail to cry on the bus ride home. 

In my school, the stigma of ITE being ‘It’s the end’ was still very strong. I’m not sure about now though but back then, my teachers would really make it seem as if going into ITE means you’ve failed in life. So I studied hard and aimed for poly! But at one point, everything went downhill. I guess the pressure got into me and I was really stressed out. Unfortunately, my coping mechanism for an overwhelming amount of stress is to shut myself out of the problem and the world. And that was what I did, I stopped going to school, I stopped studying and I eventually stopped “living”. 

It was so suffocating, I couldn’t do it anymore. I suddenly couldn’t do what I have been doing for the past 10 years, which was studying. It was as if I broke. I became very depressed and was filled with anxiety every single day. Eventually, I couldn’t run away from it and had to face it alone. For the whole entire time I sat for those papers, I couldn’t breathe. I hated going to school and seeing my friends work so hard and knew what they were doing. While I was only there to get it over and done with. In the end, we got back our results, the only subjects I passed were my languages. The place I worked so hard not to go into, ended up being the only one that accepted me. 

However, my life got so much better from there. I gained so many new experiences, picked up so many new skills and of course met some of my now very close friends! I even finally figured out what I want to do in the future. And that is what I’m doing now. After I graduated, I decided to retake my O’s so that I can study in the course that I want. This time, I’m coping with it so much better. I’m still nervous of course, and scared. But after knowing that even if this doesn’t go the way I want, it’s not the end of the world. As long as I do my best and believe in myself, then it will turn out great. It sounds cliche but that has helped me a lot. 

If you’re still reading this, thank you HAHA. It’s rather long and has a lot of TMI so I don’t expect a lot of you to read this. But all I want to say is that, to all the other O levels students, I really hope you don’t let this destroy you. It is going to be difficult, it is going to be stressful and overwhelming, but as long as you do your best and KNOW that you’ve done your best, that’s enough. You’ve done great. Good job! Breathe, this exam is not the only important thing in life. There are so many other things in store for you in the future no matter where you go, so live your life and never let this bring you down. You will get there! (I wished someone had told me this 3 years ago. I found this out later and through the hard way but you shouldn’t have to) I hope this will help someone reading this feel better. I really do. If my past is very similar to your present now, it will get better, trust me!

I cant help but think why not when some people genuinely need that help to get by.\n\n- Not more than 50 students are allowed to graduate with a Masters in Clinical Psychology because thats what the govt expects the job market for psychologists to be like: low, because there is no demand for mental health workers? But thats not true because from experience I've seen counsellors overwhelmed by clients, and pushing themselves to see more just to get a bit of that NCSS funding to keep their centre running.\n- In NIE, Masters in Counselling is one of the non-subsidized courses too, probably for the same reasons.\n- Mental health services are hardly subsidized, and difficult to access.

But this is more of societal mentality than a systemic problem, and is prevalent in Asian countries where mental problems tend to equal shame for the family. This may not be outwardly displayed but within family units there can be fair amount of blame and guilt-tripping going on towards members with psychological ailments. This most definitely affects the overall attitudes of the greater society too.\n\nPersonally, I just wish treatment for mental health conditions would be covered by insurance so treatment wouldn’t have to be so expensive. If you can afford it it’s fine, but if you can’t, you’re pretty much stuck with generic drugs from the 80s and rather basic talk therapy which may not be enough. Things have improved a bit from a decade ago though, so there’s that. \n\nI can’t comment on the more serious mental health issues which require long term institutionalisation though, but if I could hazard a guess I would bet it would be expensive to get good quality care since insurance doesn’t cover it.', 'There’s this social stigma about mental health. For the elderly, if they know you have mental issues, most of them would be saying that “ this generation is too soft/ i have gone through it with no issues but why you got this problem?” The older generation seemed to compare the current generation to them. However, they need to know that time have changed. For example, in the past, there are lesser cases of cyberbullying and online bullying due to lack of technology. In this generation, almost everyone owned a smart phone which can excess all social media platforms. This exposes them to online bullies. Some people are also bullied sexually online. \n\nI strongly believe that mental health is not truly cared enough in Singapore, but, it has growing attention. Those who have mental issues can reach out to counsellors online or offline. That is if they throw and remove the belief that “mental health issues is just a phase”.', 'There’s a lot of conspiracy theories and speculation floating around. Speaking as someone in the field, the actual explanation is due to a crisis within the field that started way back in 2015, known as the Replication Crisis.\n\nIt is an ongoing methodological crisis in which many scientific studies are difficult or impossible to replicate or reproduce. This is important for social sciences because a theory is only a theory when it can be generalized across the population. Unfortunately, we discovered that many psychologists were very sloppy and unprofessional in their research, frequently doing things like p-hacking and sampling their undergrad population.\n\nAs the crisis spread, psychology in particular only had 36% of its studies replicate successfully. This essentially means that all of its practitioners (i.e. therapists, clinical psychologists, etc) have been using techniques that had almost no grounding in science.\n\nIn Singapore, this problem is vastly compounded by the fact that many religious schools have counselling diplomas or degrees that allow and encourage their graduates to work in clinical practice. It is a known problem that vulnerable patients become preyed on for conversion.\n\nAll of the issues above make it exceptionally hard for the government to tackle, and they rather not open up the vulnerable to clinical practice. Hence, the focus for people to call the hotline or use web chats.', ""Yeah that's quite true but for me, it depends who you ask as mental health is more relevant to the youths of Singapore. \n\nDo people prefer opening up either online or face to face"", 'I agree. I\'m pretty sure I have some light form of depression, but I don\'t want to get it checked out because I don\'t want it to affect my job search in the event I try to apply for another job.\n\nEspecially so since a lot of the companies here are run by old-fashioned old folks who see people with mental illnesses as ""weak-minded"".', 'People feel that emotional health is not as important but it is ... there are many youths out there that need counselling services and  they may be prone to risky behaviours like crime and addiction . People always downplay it because they are uninformed of the negative consequences of not having such services. Mental health patients also need to have services because it affects the quality of their life such as  work and school performance.Bad emotional health will not allow one to function daily easily . Mental health patients are also prone to risky behaviours. Yet , people are fighting for services like Mcdonalds & bubble tea to be essential 🤦\u200d♀️🤦\u200d♀️ \n\nPeople dont experience physical abuse , bullying or emotional issues . They dont understand mental health. I see some online users thinking that mental health problems are not a big issue.']"
monpotage,i4l7kc,[NAFA] Need help in essays/reports/presentations? I’m here to help!,2020-08-06 12:35:04,SGExams,77673,0,17,"To the current NAFA Arts Management (AM) students, hello! I’ve recently graduated from NAFA AM and am studying in a local uni. I’ve obtained several scholarships and top scorer awards during my course of study and I never had anything worse than a B on my transcript. My final cGPA is >3.6. 

I’m using this platform to help the current students out as I understand how strict the lecturers can be in terms of research content and language. I understand how difficult it is especially when classes are shifted online and there is a much lower chance of lecturers digressing from the lecture notes and giving out industrial tips or other facts about the module which they normally do during physical classes.

However, please do not abuse this as I do not wish to waste my time on students who just want free essay feedback as I’ve seen many students submitting their assignments a day before the deadline just because they were busy hanging out with one another at Jalani. 

I’m not sure if this is entirely allowed by both this subreddit and the school but my main intention is to really help and guide current students through, as I believe everyone has the capability and opportunity to strive and break out of the ‘nafa-students-paying-for-the-cert’ stigma. It’s sad to see some of my former classmates having less drive towards their last semester just because they feel that their cert mean nothing to employers/local unis.


Tldr: I’m offering free consultation (as some lecturers do not offer direct consultation because it will be counted as double-marking) for all AM modules! Hit me up in DMs and I’ll help you out as much as I can! 

And should you have any other questions regarding the course as a whole, I can help out as well :)",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i4l7kc/nafa_need_help_in_essaysreportspresentations_im/,[]

Chapter 3: Movement of Substances


Diffusion - Diffusion is the net movement of particles from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration down a concentration gradient. It is a type of passive transport that does not require energy.


Osmosis - Osmosis is the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential down a water potential gradient via a partially permeable membrane. It is a type of passive transport that does not require energy.


Active Transport - Active transport is the net movement of particles from a region of lower concentration to a region of higher concentration against the concentration gradient, it is a type of transport that requires energy from aerobic respiration.



Chapter 4: Nutrients


Nutrients - Nutrients are chemical substances in food that provide energy and materials needed by the body


Condensation reaction - A condensation reaction is a chemical reaction where two simple molecules are joined together to form a larger molecule with the removal of one water molecule.


Hydrolysis - Hydrolysis is the reaction in which a molecule of water is required to break up a complex molecule into simple molecules



Chapter 5: Enzymes


Enzymes - Enzymes are proteins that function as biological catalysts. They speed up chemical reactions and remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.


*Denaturation - Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat of chemicals such as acids and alkalis.

(Not sure if tested)



Chapter 6: Nutrition in Humans


Nutrition - Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain food and energy for growth, repair and maintenance of the body.


Peristalsis - Peristalsis is the rhythmic wavelike muscular contractions in the walls of the alimentary canal where the longitudinal and circular muscles work antagonistically to move food along.


*Deamination - Deamination is the process by which amino groups are removed from amino acids and converted to urea.


Digestion - Digestion is the process of breaking down large complex insoluble food molecules into smaller simpler soluble molecules. Digestion involves the physical breakdown of food substances which mechanically breaks down food into smaller pieces to increase the surface area to volume ratio for digestive enzymes to work on. Digestion is also a chemical process involving breaking of bonds with the aid of enzymes.


Absorption - Absorption is the process whereby digested food molecules are taken into the blood capillaries for glucose and amino acids and the lacteal capillaries for fats. This takes place in the villi in the small intestine. The digested food molecules move into the villi in the small intestine by diffusion and active transport.


Assimilation - Assimilation is the distribution and use of products of digestion as as energy source and conversion into other nutrients needed for growth and repair of body parts



Chapter 7: Nutrition in Plants


Photosynthesis - Photosynthesis is the process whereby light energy is absorbed by chlorophyll and converted into chemical energy. Chemical energy is used to synthesise carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide. Oxygen is released in the process.



Chapter 8: Transport in Humans


Phagocytosis - Phagocytosis is the process of engulfing or ingesting foreign particles, such as bacteria, by phagocytes. The bacteria are ingested and digested in the phagocyte.



Chapter 9: Transport in Plants


Translocation - Translocation is the transport of manufactured food substances in the form of sucrose and amino acids, from the leaves to all parts of the plant, bidirectionally through the phloem tissue in plants.


Transpiration - Transpiration is the loss of water vapour from the aerial parts of the plant especially through the stomata of the leaves.



Chapter 10: Respiration in Humans


Aerobic Respiration - Aerobic respiration is the breakdown of food substances in the presence of oxygen with the release of a large amount of energy. Carbon dioxide and water are released as waste products.


Anaerobic Respiration - Anaerobic respiration is the breakdown of food substances in the absence of oxygen. Anaerobic respiration releases less energy than aerobic respiration.


Gas Exchange - Gas exchange is the exchange of gases between an organism and the environment. 



Chapter 11: Excretion in Humans


Excretion - Excretion is the process by which metabolic waste products and toxic substances are removed from the body of an organism. These metabolic waste products can be harmful or toxic if they accumulate in the body.


Osmoregulation - Osmoregulation is the control of water and solute concentration levels in the blood to maintain a constant water potential in the body.



Chapter 12: Homeostasis


Homeostasis - Homeostasis is the maintenance of a constant internal environment.



Chapter 13: The Nervous System


Reflex action - A reflex action is an immediate response to a specific stimulus without conscious control.


Reflex Arc - A reflex arc is the shortest pathway by which a nerve impulse travels from the receptor to the effector in a reflex action.


Synapse - A junction between two neurones that allows nerve impulses to be transmitted from the axon of one neurone to the dendrite of the other neurone via the release of neurotransmitter molecules.


Chapter 14: The Human Eye


Focusing - Focusing or accommodation is the adjustment of the lens of the eye so that clear images of objects at different distances are formed on the retina



Chapter 15: Hormones


Hormone - A hormone is a chemical substance produced in minute amounts by an endocrine gland. It is transported in the bloodstream to one or more target organs where it exerts its effect. After hormones have performed their function, they are eventually destroyed by the liver.



Chapter 16: Cell Division


Growth - Growth is a permanent increase in size of an organism.


Mitosis - Mitosis is a form of nuclear division that produces daughter nuclei containing the same number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus. The daughter nuclei are genetically identical to the parent nucleus.


Meiosis - Meiosis is a form of nuclear division whereby the daughter nuclei contains half the number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus.


Haploid - A haploid cell contains one set of chromosomes or half the number of chromosomes of  a normal body cell.


Diploid - A diploid cell contains 2 sets of chromosomes or the full number of chromosomes found in normal body cells.



Chapter 17: Reproduction in Plants


Asexual Reproduction - Asexual reproduction is the process resulting in the production a genetically identical offspring from one parent, without the fusion of gametes.


Sexual Reproduction - Sexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of gametes to form a zygote. It produces genetically dissimilar offspring.


Pollination - Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the sigma


Self-pollination - Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or of a different flower on the same plant.


Cross-pollination - Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from one plant to the stigma of a flower of another plant of the same species.



Chapter 18: Reproduction in Humans


Puberty - Puberty is the stage of human growth and development in which a person becomes physically mature.


Chapter 19: Heredity


Allele - Alleles are different forms of the same gene.


Genotype - The genotype is the genetic makeup of an organism.


Phenotype - The phenotype is the observed trait of an organism determined by the genotype.

Ecological community - An ecological community is made up when different populations of plants and animals live together and interact with the same environment.


Producer - A producer is an autotrophic organism that can make good by photosynthesis as they contain chlorophyll which absorbs and converts light energy to chemical energy in the form of glucose.


Consumer - A consumer is an organism that is unable to make their own food and thus obtain energy and nutrients by feeding on other organisms.


Decomposer - A decomposer is an organism that breaks down the dead bodies of organisms, faeces, and excretory products, by feeding on decaying organic matter. Their activities return nutrients to the environment.


Food chain - A series of organisms through which energy is transferred in the form of food.



Chapter 22: Our Impact on the Environment


Deforestation - Deforestation refers to the clearing of forests to meet increasing demands for land and materials such as wood. With modern technology, forests are being cleared out at a much faster rate than they are replaced.

Hi! I’m a Y3 NAFA (Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts) student studying a diploma in design (landscape and architecture). Currently doing FYP during holidays ;). I’ve not seen much info here bout NAFA aft lurking here for quiteee some time so I shall be the first to spill the beans. I’m also here for people who are looking for more options but are afraid of being a student in NAFA or for those looking for backup sch. Feel free to ask any questions bout sch life, curriculum, opportunities, 'stigma around art sch' etc. It’s a private art sch still unknown to the world but hey! ppl wants to know what’s up so here I am

[Here’s my previous general comment on my sch experience and bout Fine Arts Diploma](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ed54x5/n_levels_nafa/fbgdsp2/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Lil backstory: I love art, wanted to be an artist since young. At Sec 2 I decided that I want to be an architect. Never did EAE (I don’t regret it tho), got crappy O levels results and it sent me flying to NAFA (was alr planned as 2nd option) because I didn’t want to do a poly course I didn’t like. Met and talked to a lot of awesome ppl and more than I expected (I got out of my introvert hole). Got bursary annually, attained a scholarship in Y2, experienced the No. 1 art sch in China for 3 weeks, still trying to survive the crazy/hectic environment and graduating next year May

[NAFA WEBSITE](https://www.nafa.edu.sg)

[ADMISSION INFO](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/admissions/admission-information)

(NFP admission is over) Admission is ongoing for N levels result holders ONLY for NAFA Foundation Programme (NFP), similar to PFP. NFP has limited 50 slots and the test difficulty will be different from general admissions. General admission (diploma and degree) begins in Jan 2020. For the general admission, there’s online application available if you don’t want to take the admission test. Entry is pretty easy for general admission where a drawing of a pencil can get you in and I’m not kidding so I have no comment about how high are the chances of getting in

[DIPLOMA INFO](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/courses/diploma)

I can't answer much for theatre, dance, music and Arts management (comment bout AM is down below) because their campus is across the street lmao. But I've mingled with them and I know they're friendly outgoing ppl!
Word of caution: the design diplomas with 2 words ('something' and 'something') mainly focuses on the first word you read. Many ppl thought my course has architecture and fell for the trap

[DEGREE INFO](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/courses/degree)

NAFA offers a 1-year top up degrees for each department (which is pretty darn fast to get). It’s affiliated so no worries for existing students. People from external polys can get accepted considered that you have a related diploma, passable GPA from poly and a nice portfolio. Some companies acknowledge it if they see it works out.

[PART TIME COURSES](https://www.nafa.edu.sg/courses/part-time)

NAFA has part time courses (not official diploma)
For those who like art/design stuff to be an asset of your skills, this is for you

—————————————————————————

[OPEN HOUSE INFO]

(Open house is over) Do drop by the open house on the 17-18 of Jan (application fee is WAIVED non-NFP only) and the 2020 grad show exhibition which happens later in the beginning of June! It's free and everyone's welcome to see the wide range of works the NAFA students put out

Another one on the list of stuff I don’t have knowledge on 😑\n\nI’d say NAFA is all bout doing stuff in an artistic perspective and more towards the practical side of work compared to polys. Main reason ppl join is to pursue their artistic passion or if they can’t go into the actual course they like elsewhere. A benefit I would say is that there’s less competition compared to poly despite the pressure from work. Since there’s less Singaporeans in the sch unlike poly, not many ppl here like to engage in a challenge of beating high scores. See, if you work hard and showcase your talent, you can stand out and be at the top of the class (possible without near perfect GPA but As 80% of the time). Another benefit for all the courses at NAFA compared to polys is that we actually get insiders (sometimes ‘quite’ famous ppl) in the industry to work with the sch. The sch actually prepares you for work aft grad including a free ton of career talks, workshops with the pros (not sure whether polys does the same). As an arts sch, the industrial network here is excellent for anything arts related E.g for arts management internship has been conducted at Esplanade, the DECK a gallery near the sch, National Gallery etc. NAFA’s art management is more for solely specialising on the art side. If you find that you want ‘broad’ (I say broad as NP is not an arts sch) arts management with the business side, you’ll have to head to NP\n\nBonus: you can get a 1-year degree from arts management at NAFA (even after NP arts business management you can join) and I think it’s pretty nifty for expanding your experience even to overseas Uni', 'I’m no D&M student so take my advice with a grain of salt. NAFA actually has a 1-year degree top up course for Design and Media but I’m not sure if it’s close to what you want. Might have to ask the D&M Lecturers in charge of the degree course. Have you looked into 3Dsense and Digipen from SIT? 3Dsense is an independent school on its own, there’s a range of courses and it’s 1 year for the diploma not degree but the sch is quite pro while SIT is a local public uni so 3 years for the degree. Laselle offers a 3 year degree in animation art. I somehow would not suggest getting the 1-year top up degree from NAFA or basically any degree from a private art sch as it is not recognised by 90% of the companies here. You should ask which degree is more relevant when you undergo your internship if you’re mainly looking for a job as an illustrator/animator. Take the most recognised path. Even if you want to become a graphic/illustration based teacher, it takes years of experience and skills to build a portfolio for teaching and besides, the schs that you’ll probably be teaching are all listed here (unless of course you want to teach outside). I can’t choose for you so find out what’s best yourself and ask around', 'To enter the 1 year degree, a requirement is to have a related diploma so if you took interior design at Laselle you can take the degree in spatial design, fashion design then fashion degree at NAFA etc. Even diplomas from other polys is allowed as long as related.\n\nYou should’ve registered during open house because application fees will always be waived during that time. Getting in by test is pretty easy as the admission test won’t be hard even people who can’t draw can make it in. Like I said all over this subreddit: majority of NAFA students are graduates from ITE or international students, O level cert is a small number so obvious lack of competition. I wouldn’t worry about failing to get in if you meet the admission criteria. I applied for NAFA specifically due to the fact that I only want to be in that ONE course. I don’t the have fear of losing my spot anyways since I submitted via portfolio which is more work to show compared to doing admission test. It’s all up to you', 'ah my bad, thanks for that link and your really detailed ans!!\n\nabout that top up degree: it says that it is validated by the uni of essex. does this mean it is easier to gain admission into graduate study courses in the uni of essex?', 'I’m not sure bout the easier admission or doing graduate studies from the Uni of Essex haha you’ll have to ask bout that at the open hse. You’ll go on an overseas exchange to specifically that Uni. I do know someone that just grad with the 1-year degree but is planning on looking for masters elsewhere after working in Sg first so I’d think it’s somewhat possible', 'will do, thanks!']"

[**ALL ABOUT NUS NURSING VERSION 2.0**](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f8pvec/uni_all_about_nus_nursing_20/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x)

&#x200B;

Hello! I’m a current NUS Nursing student, and will be happy to answer any questions. This post is for those thinking about NUS Nursing but have some doubts regarding Nursing in general!

I can understand how daunting it can be - especially since you’re signing up for a specialized course / professional degree where you know exactly that you’ll be one thing at the end - a nurse.

Edit: Join the discord chat for applicants - if you wanna ask me or your fellow applicants some qns - [https://discord.gg/Wvq9aPV](https://discord.gg/Wvq9aPV)

Please correct me if I’m wrong for any of my statements :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*PAY (poly vs degree)**

Yes, the main differences would be the pay, how fast you get promoted, and the jobscopes. For the pay, the difference will be around 800-1000$ monthly if im not wrong, depending on the hospital. You will come out as staff nurse I with degree, and staff nurse II with diploma (I is higher than II). I is only one position away from senior staff nurse (so promotion is faster, pay goes up faster etc). For pay, degree holders earn about $3,500 a month, which is the same as Pharmacy degree holders. From government employment data from last yr, Life Science degrees/Arts degree holders earn only about 3100-3300$ a month in average.

\&#x200B;

**\*\*JOBSCOPE:**

As for jobscope, the diploma holders, ITE cert holders, and foreign nurses will be under your leadership. You will be the senior in the ward. For jobscope of SN I and SN II, i believe it lies in how many patients you take care of and how many people are under you, plus some admin things to do. SNII has more responsibilities but in general, your jobscopes are more similar vs the ite holders and foreign nurses.

\&#x200B;

**\*\*DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?**

I love the qn about the stigma hehe. Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers will NOT be done by staff nurses - it will be done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses, those from ITE / foreign nurses (tho there are some nurses from overseas who get promoted to SNs eventually!).

Staff nurses’ jobs are as follows:

1. dispense medications. You will be the last check bw the dr’s orders and the pt. Some drs may order the wrong dose or wrong meds due to fatigue - the onus is on you to check whether the drug is appropriate for the patient (some drugs for heart failure cannot be used for diabetic pts etc).
2. You are IC of assessment of patient - skin integrity, making sure that the patient is well during the hospital stay in general. We spend the most time with patients - hence, we are the perfect people to see any subtle changes in their conditions. All these subtle changes, if needed, should be immediately escalated to the doctor for further treatment.
3. Patient and family education - we spend the most time with patients. Doctors are only there for about 5min a day, hence any qns will be directed at you. Eg: nurse! Why does my father have an IV drip??? - have to explain that it’s because he needs to be hydrated etc as he cannot take anything by mouth before surgery etc.

Edit: perhaps I was not so clear / oversimplified the part about SNs not doing “dirty jobs” - you are absolutely right that they check skin integrity etc during diaper changes! When I went for my community hospital placement, the SNs were called by the juniors (ENs/nursing aides) when they change the diapers and notice any erythema etc. If short-staffed, SNs may help, but the juniors mostly do those jobs! If they do it, it will be with a purpose - eg if skin is broken and more care needs to be taken / need to change sacral dressing etc. I did not see any SN get assigned (or just do) those duties without special reasons such as understaffing, or skin integrity assessment. I do see the juniors who do those always call the SNs if they notice anything wrong with the skin! In a way, they are getting empowered in that way too! :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*WHAT HAPPENS AFTER NURSING DEGREE?**

Furthermore, there are 3 different tracks that nurses can pursue after a basic bachelor’s degree. After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take a master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. They are: management, clinical and education tracks.

Management - in charge of the ward, the staff, troubleshooting patient staff probs, patient patient probs, staff staff probs etc, admin stuff.

Clinical - called Advanced Practice Nurses, they will be like “mini doctors”. If you don’t know, some clinica in the polyclinics are PURELY run by nurses alone - they can manage diseases like diabetes, hypertension etc and prescribe meds without doctors. The only thig they cannot do will be surgery.

Education - come back to the nursing polys/nus to teach.

Occasionally, some people do 2 of the 3 + research, this is called dual appointments :)

So please, let your parents know that degree nursing is really not about washing butts anymore! :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*ADMISSIONS:**

IGP can be found on the NUS website. I heard that your cohort did well this year, so it may increase, tho it has been consistent the past few years. If your rp is much higher (tho we dont know the cut-off), you don’t have to go through interviews (perhaps 80++++). There are people who get in with much lower rp than the IGP, please put Nursing as 1st choice if you are worried you can’t get shortlisted for interviews!

\&#x200B;

**\*\*INTERVIEW TIPS:**

This can be used for any interview/personal statement.

Motivation: why nursing? Why healthcare?

Exploration: what have you done to cultivate this passion? Hospital attachments? Job shadowings? Talking to nurses? What did you learn?

Suitability: from your exploration, do you think that you, as a person, with your character and attitude, are fit to be a nurse? How so?

Also one qn they may ask: where do you see yourself 10 years from now? You then flex your knowledge of the 3 nursing tracks above and where you intend to go to :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*CURRICULUM**

Omg funfunfun. We have fake FULL wards in school where we learn all the nursing skills, practice on mannequins who breathe and have pulses etc. We also have standardized patients who are trained actors for us to practice our communication skills.

Lectures and tutorials. Some lectures are video lectures. Watch at home at 2x the speed!!

School is only 3 MAX 4 days a week, only 2-4hrs of lessons each day. Plenty of time to work or have CCAs or blahblah! :)

Edit: The kind of bio that we learn is different from H2 Bio. H2 Bio deals with the very minute things like oxidative phosphorylation and ETC and Krebs cycle and all its small molecules. However, we deal with humans here. Human anatomy and physiology, the human body and how it dysfunctions. The anatomy and physiology mods are pretty similar to secondary school bio - you learn about the heart and how the blood flows in general, as well as how it dysfunctions. However, we don’t delve too deep into the molecules at all - that’s for the medical students to do. Yes, there will be a LOT of medical terms, and you have to be ready for that if you join nursing or any healthcare-related field, honestly. It’s hard at first, but once you get the hang of it, it will come naturally :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*HELP! I DONT HAVE BIO BACKGROUND!**

That’s alright! I have friends who haven’t done bio since sec 1/2, and friends from poly who did intl business/engineering.

Just like learning a new language, the bio content in nursing is like that. Once you learn the alphabets, the phonetics, you can start stringing words together. Nursing doesn’t delve into the very minute things like molecules and stuff, so no worries 😉

\&#x200B;

**\*\*CLINICAL PLACEMENTS**

Do note that NUS Nursing students (and all other nursing students in the country) are very special. For every university holiday, half of it will be spent in the wards (eg if 3 months break, 1.5 months in the wards) ☺️ but you will be paid!!

\&#x200B;

**Edit: \*\*HELP! I'M SCARED OF BLOOD/NEEDLES/GORE!**

Someone asked me this - and this is my honest take.

During nursing school: We have cadaveric sessions - this means that you get to see real, preserved human bodies and you are required to touch and observe them, texture and all, during those anatomy sessions. They don’t look like normal fresh organs anymore - you can search some “science cadavers” to see how they look like! As for blood, generally you have to be alright with the sight of it as your first lab session will already have a finger-prick glucose test that you do on your friend (and vice versa). During clinicals, you will be exposed to wounds that may be huge and bleeding, etc, so you have to be okay with it. I do have some friends who enter nursing and medicine who are afraid of blood and needles and things like that - you can get used to it, through repeated exposure.

As a real nurse: You have to be alright with these sights as there of course may be some instances where the patient vomits blood/starts bleeding from somewhere and you have to manage the patient. If you are unlucky and get posted to the operating theatre as an OT nurse, then you will be assisting doctors in surgeries where you WILL see these. I suggest you try to watch some youtube videos to see if you can take it. Do know that you can get used to it!! Bottomline is, you can’t be afraid of your job.

\&#x200B;

**\*\*SCHOLARSHIPS**

Some scholarships for nursing students! By year 4, 80% of the whole cohort will be under scholarship.

**1. MOHH Scholarship**

* pays for tuition fees, hostel fees, book and computer allowance
* gives you $1,100 a month (i think iz 1,100)
* PROS: money money money
* CONS: you can only put preference for a healthcare cluster, you cannot choose which hospital you wanna work at. Also, harder to get.

**2. Hospital Sponsorships**

* gives you $1,000 a month
* PRO: you can choose your hospital. Eg some of my classmates wanna work as a paeds nurse next time, so they take sponsorship from KK hospital! Also, super easy to get. They give freely one.
* CONS: does not pay for anything else

You don’t need to decide whether you wanna take a scholarship now. Many people go for clinicals for some hospitals for 1/2yrs to see which hospital they wanna get sponsored by.

\&#x200B;

**\*\*MEDICINE VS NURSING????**

Know that: doctors cure, nurses care. So everything we learn is geared towards our roles. While doctors learn much, much more in-depth stuff to pinpoint what is the dysfunction in the body exactly, nurses learn just enough so that we are able to catch any potential mistakes. For example, sometimes medications are mistakenly ordered when patients have drug allergies, or when patients have other conditions that are contraindicated for that drug. Nurses play a big role in knowing the general science so as to prevent such fatal mistakes. Short answer: Medicine delves deep, deep, and wide, while nurses generally just learn the basics!

Also, when a patient walks in with a limp, a doctor will zoom straight into the condition. Eg: what meds can I give or surgery can I do to cure this patient? If the same patient walks into the room, nurses will look a the patient and family. Eg: He is limping, how will I help him up the bed? How will this affect his job? His family? Does he have children?

\&#x200B;

**Edit: \*\*OVERSEAS NURSING VS SG NURSING**

I think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, are trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a freshgrad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.

There’s also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I’m not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fastfood meal in the US can easily cost $15 :<

I think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes, you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues.

Bottomline is, it’s up to you, and what is the most important for you :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*WHY NOT NURSING??**

This is not a why NOT nursing, but someone asked me if there’s anything that made me wanna turn away from Nursing. My answer was I haven’t been to hospitals long enough for that, but from my convos with many nurses in the wards, it’s mostly this.

1. You will inevitably get attached to some, especially if you work as a community hosp nurse where pts there stay for 3 mths or more, as compared to acute hospitals where they stay for only 3-4 days. So you have to be prepared for deaths because everybody dies eventually. While doing that, try not to get too desensitized too to the point that you lose your humanity. However, it is a privilege to be there with people in their last breaths.
2. Sick people are angry people, their relatives are angry too. Be mentally prepared to be scolded and criticized (but SG law protects healthcare workers from physical and verbal abuse). But still. However, the satisfaction is worth it when they show gratitude after recovery :)

\&#x200B;

**\*\*HOW TO DEAL WITH DEATHS AS A NURSE**

I haven’t personally experienced it as a nurse as I haven’t been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals :)

1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.
2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it’s a death after all, I know that she’s in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.
3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it’s your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It’s alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.

Whew! Hope I answered all qns. Feel free to comment if you wanna know anything else :) Nursing is not just a dumping ground for students who messed up A Levels :)

Also, the **NUS Nursing Instagram page** covered the lives of some of my nursing schoolmates the past week!! Check it out! It’s a really nice read to know the ins and outs of NUS Nursing 🌚 [https://www.instagram.com/nus\_nursing/](https://www.instagram.com/nus_nursing/)

Edit 1: SNs having to do junior work sometimes too @ “DO WE JUST WASH BUTTS?”

Edit 2: Included discord chat link, curriculum updated on bio content, added a new FAQ - what if im scared of blood?

Usually the roles in the ward and cubicles are divided into in charge/ junior roles. The in charge will always be an SN or above, however junior roles can be either ENs or SNs, so there is no running away from it. Usually, SNs are also involved in diaper round changes as they have the responsibility to check the sacral and perineal skin conditions for patient on diapers.

After all, OP wrote this as a student. I\'m a senior staff nurse who graduated from NUS, been working on an inpatient ward in a restructured hospital for several years now (I\'m Singaporean, if it matters). So here\'s the real deal in the actual working world.\n\nIn case anyone is actually depending on this for insights, here\'s what I see that is incongruent with reality. Won\'t be commenting much on school because it\'s been some time since I graduated.\n\nFirst time commenting, so please forgive me if my formatting\'s messed up.\n\n(1)\nPay doesn\'t necessarily go up faster. Promotion isn\'t necessarily faster. Sure, you skip the first step from SN II to SN I, but if any newly hired SN II performs decently this should only take 1 year. Pay increments and promotions still depend on your performance. Of course, unless you work somewhere rumoured to promote based on the number of years worked, then it might not be the case.\n\n\n\n(2a)\n> As for jobscope, the diploma holders, ITE cert holders, and foreign nurses will be under your leadership. You will be the senior in the ward. For jobscope of SN I and SN II, i believe it lies in how many patients you take care of and how many people are under you, plus some admin things to do. SNII has more responsibilities but in general, your jobscopes are more similar vs the ite holders and foreign nurses.\n\nSN I and SN II are *nowhere* near *""the senior in the ward""*. You don\'t have people working ""under you"", unless you\'re a manager. You work *with* diploma holders. The diploma holders and foreign nurses will all be *your seniors* when you join them. There are even foreign nurses in management! And in clinician and educator roles! It\'s terribly myopic to think that people of lesser educational qualifications or people from other countries should be under you! A mere fresh grad! Everyone works together for the patient, be it for comfort or recovery. SN II and SN I have to do the exact same things (again I must emphasise, **there is no one working ""under you""**)! You don\'t really have a say in your patient load (number of patients you care for), but in case you haven\'t realised, SNs are bargaining to take fewer patients, not more. Once you\'ve got your SN work down pat and get promoted to SSN II, that\'s when you\'re definitely expected to hold responsibilities other than just patient care itself. Disclaimer: Many experienced SN Is also perform SSN responsibilities, possibly due to lack of staff or delayed promotion due to whatever reason.\n\n\n\n(2b)\n> Okay anyway, the seemingly “dirty” jobs like cleaning butts and bathing patients and changing diapers will NOT be done by staff nurses - it will be done by nursing aides/nursing assistants/enrolled nurses, those from ITE / foreign nurses (tho there are some nurses from overseas who get promoted to SNs eventually!).\n\nContrary to OP\'s opinion, nurses (local/foreign, EN, SN, SSN, Assistant Nurse Clinicians, even sisters who are more hands-on) do wash butts. And I actually take pride in washing butts because it\'s an important job. Not only when we\'re short staffed or only when the patient has a wound. I do it every! Day! These hygiene activities are a key part of patient care and I\'m not gonna leave it all to the ENs. At the end of the day, I\'m the one responsible for the patient\'s skin condition, and I\'ll wash butts as many times as it takes to keep my patients clean and comfortable, and their skin healthy. Also, there are foreign nurses (most with a minimum number of years of experience) who come in as SN IIs, or whatever position commensurates with their experience. They don\'t all come here to be nursing aides/health care assistants/ENs.\n\n\n\n(2c)\n\nThere are many ENs (both foreign and local) who upgrade to SNs. In fact, the public healthcare system in general is trying to move away from having ENs and gearing towards the SNs providing holistic care. That is, the SN does *everything* for (hopefully) fewer patients, including vital signs, nutrition (feeding), mobility, personal hygiene (a.k.a. cleaning butts, bathing patients, changing diapers). Everything.\n\n\n\n(2d) \n\nI think OP may simply be highly misunderstood about the EN situation. Perhaps she didn\'t mean to, but (despite her disclaimer that SNs and ENs have different responsibilities) I feel that her words carry an undertone that ENs are a lesser class than SNs, e.g. that ENs are ""getting empowered"" when they call the SNs when they notice something wrong.\n\n> I do see the juniors who do those always call the SNs if they notice anything wrong with the skin! In a way, they are getting empowered in that way too! :)\n\nHow is calling the SN in such a situation ""getting empowered""? They\'re empowered when they are able to perform interventions to improve skin integrity or prevent further skin breakdown, not by simply calling for the SN. Interventions such as washing butts properly, promptly changing diapers whenever possible, using appropriate wound/skin care products correctly, and repositioning the patient every 2 hours. It\'s not the EN\'s responsibility to know the patient\'s skin condition, it\'s the SN\'s. And the SN isn\'t gonna know jack shit about her patients if the EN is the one doing all the ""dirty"" work. Basically, think of it as this. You have to be able to do the EN\'s job well, before your SN job. How can you guide the ENs if you can\'t even do their job well? (To be fair, OP mentioned the SN-EN-dirty-jobs observations were in the community hospital, so OP is most likely still very early on in the programme.)\n\n\n\n(3)\n\n**What happens after nursing degree**\n\nOP casually states\n\n> After working for about maybe 1-3 years, you can take a master’s degree then pursue one of the 3 tracks. \n\nTaking a Master\'s degree is not something casually done. It\'s also not a requisite for pursuing any of the tracks mentioned (unless one wants to be an APN specifically, then yes the Master of Nursing is required).\n\nClinical track: Advanced Practice Nurse (APN) isn\'t the only role in the clinical track. APNs hold a Master\'s degree and have to pass a nationwide licensure exam. The ""collaborative prescribing"" that APNs can do still has to be signed off by a doctor as far as I know (the legislation for this is still changing). You can be a specialty nurse (e.g. wound care nurse, diabetes care nurse, asthma nurse, amongst many! Many! Others!) or a ward-based Nurse Clinician -- without a Master\'s degree.\n\n\n\n(4)\n\n**How to deal with death as a nurse**\n\nEven today when I face a patient death, I remember what I learned in my very first student posting. Do your best to make your patients comfortable and pain-free before they die. Treat the bodies with dignity and respect in the last office. Comfort the living. Grieving with the deceased relatives is kind of unconventional, you gotta figure it out yourself if you\'re suitable for it or if it\'s acceptable in your environment.\n\n\n\n\nThat\'s all I have for now in response to the post. \nPlease DM me if you wish to know more about Singapore nursing in the real world!

I do know that after working for a few months, you can request to be rotated to other departments - again depends on staffing :) (tip: be nice to your superiors and HR)', 'Hello! You’re welcome! I have heard of people transferring in, but it’s from other NUS courses. I do believe there should be some from other unis as well though! They base it more on your A Level grades more than uni grades i believe, because NUS (not sure if NTU too) has the first year grade free thingy (S/U option - you can search about it) which inflates Year 1 GPAs. If your A Level grades are safe, you should stand a chance, given that you write a good reason why you want the transfer. Although I gotta say that I’m not sure if they will hold your previous rejection against you - I do hope not! Hope to see you in school, all the best! :)\n\nEdit: if you do get an interview/get a slot, do break the stereotypes that your parents have! :)', 'Hello! Thank you for this! :) yep, perhaps I was not so clear / oversimplified the part about SNs not doing “dirty jobs” - you are absolutely right that they check skin integrity etc during diaper changes! When I went for my community hospital placement, the SNs were called by the juniors (ENs/nursing aides) when they change the diapers and notice any erythema etc. If short-staffed, SNs may help, but the juniors mostly do those jobs! If they do it, it will be with a purpose - eg if skin is broken and more care needs to be taken / need to change sacral dressing etc. I did not see any SN get assigned (or just do) those duties without special reasons such as understaffing, or skin integrity assessment. I do see the juniors who do those always call the SNs if they notice anything wrong with the skin! In a way, they are getting empowered in that way too! :)\n\nAgreed @ 2nd para! For those considering nursing: as a fresh grad, you are not and cannot go train to be in any “specialty” yet - you have to go for adv dip or masters like what @wonderingnature said.\n\nThank you for the clarifications! 🥰\n\nEdit: oh ya for clarification on the issue: the SNs dont usually do “dirty jobs” not because they are superior or whatever, but because the roles are just different for the different types of nurses :)', 'May I know why KKH? If you\'re interested in becoming a cardiac nurse, you should consider the National Heart Centre (NHC). To apply for their sponsorship/scholarship, you can check the respective organisational websites. You can search ""national heart centre sponsorship""', 'Hello! You are welcome! :) happy to know you are joining the field! agree with @wonderingnature, you can go straight to the organizations’ websites and email them directly! Note that what you are intending to take is a sponsorship and not scholarship! :) also, though you can work at a cardio ward as a fresh graduate, specializing in nursing comes in under the clinical track - where you can start to become like a mini doc and offer some form of differential diagnosis/run your own clinics/prescribe basic meds. That’s after a master’s degree!! But if you meant that you j wanna work in the cardio dept - then of course there’s that chance as a fresh poly/uni grad! :) for surgical nurse, i believe that you may need a few years of experience before they let you become an OT nurse - if that’s what you mean. Though you can be a nurse at a med/surg ward - where patients are lining up for surgery! Hope this helps!', ""Heya! Hope you enjoy yourself in Nursing at NP, graduated from there a few years ago. It's gonna be a blast over there!"", 'Hello! Sorry, I am not sure of their cut-off point :( However, if you scored 85+++ with good portfolio, I believe they will consider you! Otherwise, you can wait till year 1/2 in uni and have a super high GPA to apply again. For this year, won’t hurt to try! 🤗', 'You’re welcome! Yes, will be considered as long as you have 2H2 passes in any of those subjs. As long as you meet the cut-off point, you will be shortlisted for interview! :)', ""It is alright to have emotions, we're bound to feel attached to patients when caring for them. So when dealing with death, especially those new in nursing, give yourself some time to express your emotions. Talk to your colleagues and ward managers, they might suggest counselling if you're too affected by it. However, it becomes unprofessional if our emotions are imposing on other patients or their relatives. So it is alright to have emotions but not at the expense of other patients.\n\nAs stated above, based on your results alone, you might not have a good chance, but your portfolio might help you in this. There's no harm in trying. However, if you get rejected, don't feel discouraged, there are opportunities when you've started school, such as MOHH mid-term scholarship and other organisational sponsorships."", 'I haven’t personally experienced it as I haven’t been in the wards long enough. However, I will answer based on my personal experience when my grandma passed away, as well as my conversations with other nurses/healthcare professionals :)\n\n1. Give yourself time to grieve. We are all humans, with real emotions and feelings. While many many years of being in healthcare may get you used to people dying / being struck with fatal illnesses everyday, someday, you may still encounter a patient whom you may get too attached to and the unthinkable happens. Please, take the time to grieve and reflect. Talk to people who understand.\n\n2. See the bigger picture. I once performed CPR on an elderly lady (not in the hospital - at her house), and she passed on a few days later in the hospital. Though it may seem tragic, since it’s a death after all, I know that she’s in a better place now. She does not have to suffer the complexities of her diseases + any broken ribs due to the CPR, if ever.\n\n3. Remember not to be too hard on yourself. Sometimes you may feel that it’s your fault, for not checking on the patient enough, for missing out the signs. It’s alright. Everybody makes mistakes and we all learn from them.\n\n—\n\nAs for the MOHH scholarship, I’m afraid that 75rp may be a little bit of a stretch, no matter how good your portfolio is. From personal experience, they call people up based on rp first and not really portfolio. You can hold first and apply if you get amazing GPA in year 1/2, or consider the sponsorships. Though, there is no harm trying. Personally, I think it may be too far of a stretch.\n\nHope this helps!', 'Hello! I’m not very comfortable revealing my identity yet haha. I created a discord chat, which I will also include in my original post for people to join. Do you mind asking your friends to join this discord chat instead? A bit mafan to download another app, but I prefer this 😅 thanks! https://discord.gg/Wvq9aPV', 'Hello! You are welcome! I’m so glad that this helped you ☺️ Please do share with your friends if ever!', 'Hello! Thanks for the qn :)\n\nI think different countries and THEN different schools have different niche areas that they focus on. For example, we import a lot of nurses from other Asian countries - firstly because they are extremely good with their skills even though the labour cost is relatively cheaper as compared to poly/nus/sit nursing graduates from Singapore. The Singapore nursing schools - ie poly/SIT and especially NUS Nursing, is trying to produce nursing leaders of the future in Singapore. Hence, on top of hands-on skills, the focus will be on cultivating that ability to lead the healthcare team that they are part of - cuz indeed, as a freshgrad, you are already in the same position as foreign nurses who may have years and years of experiences more than you.\n\nThere’s also a flip side of the coin. In other parts of the world, that is. Nursing in the US, UK, Australia, from what I heard, have much more autonomy than nurses here in Singapore - they are generally able to do more. If I’m not wrong, they are called Nurse Practitioners there, similar to our Advanced Practice Nurses in Singapore - with much more autonomy in prescribing meds/doing procedures etc (you can search all about it). Generally, their pay is higher also - but that may be due to the fact that the standard of living is much higher there as well - a fastfood meal in the US can easily cost $15 :<\n\nI think one thing you should ask yourself is, do you want to serve your home country? If yes,  you have to settle for the pay here. On tope of that, how do you want to serve your country? An overseas nursing degree, like any overseas course, will offer you insights that you can hopefully translate back to the clinical setting here in Singapore. However, getting a local degree will ensure that you are the most up to date when it comes to the Singapore healthcare system and its current issues. \n\nBottomline is, it’s up to you, and what is the most important for you :)\n\nHope that helps!', 'Hi there! I\'d be happy to answer your questions.\n\n1) Yes we do clean the deceased. In a more formal term, the procedure is called last office. When a patient dies, the patient will then be identified if it is a coroner\'s or non-coroner\'s case. For non-coroner\'s cases, the deceased will be cleaned, any IV plugs removed, to make it as dignified as it can be as the deceased will then be ""released"" to the relatives. For coroner\'s case on the other hand, it may vary but more than likely the present state will be preserved for coroner\'s examinations.\n\n2) Generally, in the day to day work, doctors will not be the one appraising your care standards and skills competencies. This will fall under the purview of the nursing education/clinical/management. Nurse educators will ensure that you have sufficient training and performed adequately in your core competencies to be a safe practitioner, while nurse clinicians usually ensures that these standards are maintained in the area of practice and nurse managers are generally in charge of the overall staffing and or appraisals. Though management role can and is also usually performed by the nurse clinicians as well.\n\n3) Interactions and the quality of interactions is highly dependant on the ward culture and the area of practice. In a fast pace or more general wards like Ortho, or medical wards, you\'ll always see new faces as it is where new doctors usually practice (HOs). Because of these fast rotation, interactions are always brief and professional. However for more specialised area of practice like critical care, rehab, geron, you\'ll get to see more familiar faces and interactions although professional can be more relaxed. From my observations as well, those senior doctors,tend to have low perception of the professional status of nursing, however, this view as changing as the society begins to understand the role and the importance of nurses in the healthcare organisation. And this can be seen in younger doctors. However, this is painted in broad strokes. There are nice senior doctors and nasty younger ones.', 'Hello! Yep, nursing and pharm are curved. No idea why, since the nature is the same (I assume you saw the post on NUSWhispers about this bellcurve thing?).\n\nAnswer is: depending on the module, most if not all students pass. Most students pass - the faculty of course try their best to pass everyone cuz if you fail a mod, you have to wait 1 full year to retake. For some mods such as pathophysiology and pharmacology where content is generally a bit more challenging, a very very veryyyy small percentage may need to retake the module (can count in 1 or 2 hands) - but that’s not a problem cuz the teachers really provide all the help they can :)\n\nAs for number of As etc, no one knows the answer except the teachers! They have some automatic algorithm to calculate how many As etc they give, similar to what they do for all other courses in NUS.\n\nExam formats are all MCQ/diagram labelling/true or false qns for content-based mods. This is really helpful cuz we don’t have to memorize chunks of texts then vomit out like sec/jc bio.\n\nHope that helps :)', 'Hey, thank you so so much. I really appreciate this, and this is why I do what I do :) I’m so glad that you found peace in choosing Nursing - I assure you you won’t regret it!

I really appreciate your very detailed comment, I’ve added a link to this particular comment in the original post (see Edit 4). Thanks so much! Just a few things:\n\n1. Appreciate you giving the realities of Nursing and correcting my limited experiences! I wrote this after only going to a few hospitals for a maximum of 2 weeks which certainly influenced my views.\n\n2. After a 6 weeks attachment in med/surg wards and a different hospital, I do 100% agree with everything you said - especially washing butts. Perhaps I was misunderstood though - I didn’t mean to say that SNs won’t ever have to and don’t ever wash butts - I just meant that it’s primarily the juniors’ job for that day (now the junior may or may not be an EN). And yes, checking the whole perineal, perianal, sacral skin etc and calling the SNs is a common practice which I failed to highlight in the post. It is extremely important and juniors are crucial in preventing pressure ulcers by alerting SNs in order to execute preventive measures. For all it’s worth, I did not in any way mean to say that ENs are lesser. I am an extremely strong advocate that all healthcare professionals are equal - we all just have different roles to play in the dynamic healthcare team. I’ve seen ENs and EVEN STUDENTS who alert the SNs in charge and prevented something catastrophic from happening - in no way did I mean that ENs are lesser at all. So if my words suggested otherwise, am truly sorry!\n\n3. Regarding the working “under you” thing - I think you may have misunderstood me (and it’s because my choice of words - sorry!). From my experiences, there is always an SN in charge, and a junior (may it be EN or another SN) in one cubicle or two, who is supposed to report anything to the SN in charge. Similar to how nurses report abnormalities and follow doctors’ orders, that’s what I meant with regards to SN/EN relationship. As a nurse, I also wouldn’t want to be described as someone “under the doctor” - so perhaps that’s where the misunderstanding lies. So in fact, what I truly meant is “ENs who work WITH the SNs and report any abnormalities etc to them”. Sorry for that!\n\nAs with the rest, thank you for your insights, especially career progression! I merely shared what was shared by other nurses to me, I really have no personal experience in most areas as a student (especially career progression). So thank you for that! I really appreciate it :)', ""Sorry to bother you, I have a question.\n1)What's the difference between NUS and SIT NURSING? \n2)Are nurses in NUS more better than SIT?\n3)Do you have friends from Poly that enter NUS nursing?\n4)Which is better?

I’m sorry I’m not that sure other than the fact that the SIT one is affiliated with Glasgow Uni if I’m not wrong? But when we work in hospitals, we all come out as SN Is! :) \n\n2. I believe that the teaching methods may be different - NUS Nursing emphasizes a LOT on being the nursing leaders of tomorrow. Doesn’t mean that SIT Nursing students won’t be though! Generally, of course, people know NUS Nursing more so they may have that stereotype - I am not sure how we are perceived in hospitals. But tbh, as long as you do your best, you will shine no matter where you are from :) note: pay MAY be different also but im sorry i dont really have much data on this :(\n\n3. Yes! When Poly Nursing students go into NUS Nursing, they go straight into Year 2 and skip Year 1! I do have friends who are from other poly courses like business and engineering - they are doing well now too :) (they of course start from year 1)\n\n4. This is entirely up to you. PAY - I’ve heard from HEARSAY that monthly pay for private is a bit higher, but bonuses for public is much higher especially when gvt announces some good bonus for public servants. JOB - of course, in private hospitals, people are generally more demanding since they pay much more. They expect service to be tiptop, and hence the stress is on you, the nurse. Like hotel sia. As for public, generally, patients are nicer. But some move over to private cuz they feel like they can help more since patients there are dying because they are really dying - not because they dont have money for surgery or medicine etc like in public hospitals. Note: this is the extreme viewpoints, not my own viewpoints.\n\n5. Keep in mind that they are angry cuz they are sick, not because they hate you. If you dont take personal offense at whatever they say, then it wont affect you that much. If it does though, seek refuge from your friends in the field - because all of us are going through the same things :) also - always, always be kind. You don’t have to like a patient, and the patient doesn’t have to like you. You just need to be his nurse, and be kind.\n\nHope that helps!', ""Hi there, I'm from SIT nursing, I can address some of your questions:\n1) Main difference is that NUS nursing degree is a pre-registration programme, while SIT's nursing degree is a post-registration programme; SIT only admits NYP/ NP nursing graduates who are already registered nurses.\n\n2) They are both the same and are demanding equal pay based on recent GES.\n\n3) Yes.\n\n4) Generally it is better for new nurses to begin their practice in government hospitals as they will be exposed to more cases.\n\n5) Listen to their grievances and explain why it has to be a certain way, try to accommodate to them if possible.

My question is why does the Nursing degree in SIT took 2 years when NUS took only a year for Poly nursing students? Are the modules there different? ', 'alright, hehe thank u!! ', ""The main difference is how the programme is structured. As NUS nursing programme is designed as a pre-reg programme, they will have to teach fundamental nursing skills. And this goes all the way to year 3 where it will culminate in the transition to practice (TTP) module - a 12 weeks placement similar to PRCP. \n\nHowever, SIT's programme is designed from ground up as a post-reg programme, therefore, skills learnt during polytechnic will not be repeated. And students do not have to go through PRCP/TTP again. Placements in SIT are more to apply theories into practice, such as teaching and learning theories, the use of lean thinking and value stream mapping to identify problems and propose changes and to perform a detailed health assessment and history taking of the patients, like what junior doctors do.\n\nBecause the skills lessons are omitted, it allows the students to complete the program within 18 months with honours.\n\nIf you have any questions regarding SIT's nursing programme, you can PM me. 😊"", 'Thank you! 🙏🏻☺️']"

The JC2s are too busy to stigmatise you."", ""Used to be J2 here and I had 5 J3s in my class. I feel that you wouldn't really be stigmatised but in terms of admin there might be some issues (or always for my class/school as the auntie never prints for the J3s likely as they have the old class list). And since my class had like 5 plus 2 or 3 people who repeated J1 so us J2s would call that group J3s but we wouldn't call you individually like that so that is not something to be worried about.\n\nHowever, your school might be different so maybe the J3s in each class are like 1 or 2 so I cannot say for sure about being stigmatised for your class.\n\nMaking friends is something I can't really say something positive about because the guys that are J3 stuck together in our class so they have friends from the start and the only girl kind of sticks to herself? I did talk to her and ask her about academics but I wouldn't really say that I'm a friend to her. If there are groups where they invite you and ask you about stuff then I would say join them if you don't want to be alone but again, might be different in your case.\n\nAnd I would highly recommend J2s to interact more with J3s, in events like sports day(?, whatever they call it in your school) as it really brings you closer. My school had that and coincidentally, I was in the group with the J3 guys and my other friend was absent so it was me and like 8 guys but we had fun and there were inside jokes and stuff. Amongst the people in my class, I guess I was one of the few J2s that were close with them (and also since I was reps for 2 subjects which meant I would need to talk to them about notes and stuff which played a part).\n\nHopefully you don't feel as anxious now if you have read this and remember that you can also ask your friends that were with you.

Ignore those fools and remember, your main goal is to achieve better results for A levels, not be affected by these small matters. Just be friendly and nice to your classmates. Treat it like Orientation all over again, except most of them know each other.\n\nThe first thing you should do when you resume schooling is to seek help from your prev tutors.

beaniebois1997,aivw79,Project on menstruation.,2019-01-23 12:28:17,singapore,378762,109,69,"Hello, I am a student doing a project on menstruation in Singapore. I've tried googling about the menstruation taboos in Singapore but can't really find any on the articles. Do you think menstruation is considered a taboo or a social stigma in Singapore?  I've encountered some myself like women and girls would be sometimes embarrassed to purchase or bring around sanitary pads in Singapore and the older generation saying things like we are unclean, etc.

&#x200B;

Would appreciate any comments coming in, any redditors would like to share their stories or comment on their views about girls having menstruation in Singapore.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Sorry, this is the only thread i can find help on my project and there are only some topics to choose from so i had to go on with this. Thanks a lot once again!

edited: omg I didn’t expect this post to have so many replies but I would like to thank everyone for the comments! ",0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/aivw79/project_on_menstruation/,"[""20 y/o female here, i have a few thoughts regarding this topic.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nAt this age, I am very open on the topic of menstruation and don't feel the need to be discreet about it. not that I'll go around telling everyone when I'm on my period, but if I am and there is a need for me to inform my friends, lecturers or co workers, I don't feel any guilt or shame in that - regardless of whether the person I am informing is male or female. in sec school, I used to feel shy about having to inform my teachers if I was on my period and unable to participate in certain activities, especially if the teacher was male. I also used to feel embarrassed when it came to borrowing pads from my friends if I needed one. But as I grew older and learnt more about my body and menstruation (I was also diagnosed with endometriosis which pushed me to do a lot of research in this area), I came to understand that menstruation is a very natural process that ladies go through, and there is nothing 'dirty' or shameful about it. regular menstruation is actually a sign that our bodies are healthy and fertile, which is something we should be proud of.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think a lot of the stigma surrounding menstruation comes from the belief that menstrual blood is 'dirty' (it's just old bodily waste that your body is getting rid of, same as feces and piss, so it's really not a big deal) or due to the fact that a lot of young girls were just taught to be discreet about it and didn't bother to question why exactly.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nin terms of menstrual sanitary products (i.e pads, tampons, cups), I don't feel ashamed to be seen with any of these products in public. I'm taking the steps to be sanitary and clean about a very natural monthly occurrence that I have no control over, what's so shameful about that? it's like shaming someone for buying toilet paper lol. like I mentioned above, I think this shame that a lot of girls feel when being spotted in public with sanitary products comes from 1. the way they were brought up and 2. how other people were brought up to view menstruation and sanitary products as 'gross'.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI think that although majority of people have this belief that menstruation is taboo, more and more people are becoming aware of the fact that menstruation is normal and not that big of a deal. Personally, amongst my friends, we have no problems talking about our periods and caring for one another when necessary (i.e providing one another with pads/tampons, getting one another a warm drink, etc). Even with my male friends, they have no issue with asking me if I'm on my period and will look out for me when we go out for drinks by restricting my alcohol intake (I handle alcohol fine on a normal basis, just not on my period, something to do with alcohol being an anticoagulant). However, as with most things, this may vary for everyone depending on your group of friends and the people you're surrounded by.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nsince some other comments here have mentioned tampons and menstrual cups, I have a couple things to say regarding those too. it is a MYTH that if you use a tampon or any other invasive sanitary product (i.e cups), you will break your hymen/lose your virginity. yes, technically, you could break your hymen by inserting a tampon/cup, but hymens can be broken from bad falls, bicycle riding and a TON of other non sexual, daily activities. many people's hymen also tend to thin over time and will just tear on their own. in terms of losing your virginity -- if you haven't had sex yet, then you're still a virgin. regardless of what you insert into your vagina. also, virginity itself is a man made concept that imo people put more importance on than they should, but that's a topic for another time haha. for menstrual cups, no, they aren't 'dirty' because 1. it's your own body and blood and 2. there are safe and effective ways of cleaning menstrual cups after each use. so why the fuss? plus they help save a TON of money and they're good for the environment too. I'm personally planning on buying my first menstrual cup after I get my next pay.\n\n&#x200B;\n\noverall my pov is that yes, there is a stigma surrounding menstruation in sg. as someone who is not ashamed of such matters and does not take the measures to be *super* discreet about my periods (I don't run around flaunting my sanitary products and announcing to everyone that I'm menstruating, but if we're at a café and I need to change my pad, I don't see the need to bring my *entire* bag to the toilet that's just around the corner, just bring the damn pad lol), I have gotten comments along the lines of 'you shouldn't carry *things* like that around so openly', or people have reacted very awkwardly upon finding out that I am on my period (e.g when I inform lecturers that I cant participate in certain water sports). people really need to be more open to learning about menstruation (and a whole list of other non-taboo topics that people are still apprehensive about) in order to get rid of unhealthy and unhelpful views regarding the matter."", 'One friend (28 years old) never used a tampon because she thought she would have to take it out to pee.\n\nWhat kind of shitty education system do we have that women think pee comes from the same place babies are made? Srs question.', ""Honestly, I think it differs from person to person and household to household. I've had friends who treat menstruation like a very secretive thing to be hidden, but being from a girls' school, I've also had the habit of just taking my pad and publicly waltzing to the toilet. I think a lot of the tentativeness of menstruation comes from guys actually--because they don't know what it's like.\n\nBut as for the older generation, I completely agree. My grandma frequently says its dirty blood. "", ""The only taboo is that you can't organise a waterpark outing with more than a certain number of girls because they pretty much covered the entire month for their respective monthly-stuff..."", ""Well I think it's not talked about as openly as it should be, perhaps an 'asian' kinda customary that all things involving your most private parts should be talked about only in private places. When I was in school (primary and secondary), I've never received any form of education or talk from both school and family about how to deal with my period, what is it in the first place, why am I bleeding, how to wear a pad or tampon etc. Not sure if times have changed now and they have more classes on sex education, but I was given the impression that it's an embarrassing thing to talk about and we just gotta figure it out on our own.  \n\nOn a side note that is not all too related, let's talk menstrual cups. It's a lot cheaper (can cost you 2-4x lesser than tampons or pads depending on your flow), and results in a lot less trash (you change them every 12hours, buy a new one every 6years). Wanna eliminate straws to save the environment? Think about how much less trash we create if menstrual cups are encouraged. The sanitary bin is almost always full in public restrooms. But I've never seen it being promoted in any manner. Food for thought"", ""Growing up, I often heard adults giving period nicknames like 'da yi ma' or 'that thing come already', often times whispering about 'it' in the presence of a male. I thought it was odd, seeing that it's simply part and parcel of a natural, healthy female.\n\nAnyway, the girls I grew up with, followed their mothers and the behaviours passed on. They are still whispering and giving it nicknames, akin to the name of Lord Voldermort. It's pretty much a learnt behaviour and I do wish people would stop this pointless behaviour."", 'Yes it’s considered taboo to the older generation. Some examples:\n\n1. I’m perfectly fine leaving my boxes of unopened pads on display in my room because easy access when I need to take one lol, but my mum always asks me to hide them in less discernible places because my boyfriend sometimes comes over and she’s afraid he will see them. I’m like... what’s the issue here?! He knows I menstruate, he knows I need pads etcetc plus boxed up pads aren’t even disgusting lol. She would probably die if she knew I regularly change my pads in front of him when we travel together and share a bathroom 🤷🏻\u200d♀️\n\n2. She told me I can’t wash my underwear with his clothes when we do laundry together (I was on exchange and he visited me often). My bf says his mum mentioned the same thing, saying girls underwear is “tainted” coz we go through periods, and it’s considered bad luck for the man if he has his clothes washed with our stuff? ', 'A lot of people think that tampons are taboo for unmarried (or virginal?) females.', ""I'm male but based on my experience with v close girl friend...\n\n\\- tampons are seen as taboo, likely since people think that inserting a tampon is akin to penetration. My friend had never used a tampon in her life until she was 27(ish). \n\n\\- Menstrual cups are even worse. People see them as dirty and unhygienic, and so just basically never use them at all. I have no idea why this is the case since... it's like your own blood. Plus moon cups save so much money AND the environment. "", ""I feel like in Singapore, private/sexual matters that occur naturally such as menstruation are not being taught properly or re-inforced in the right way. Well, my mom definitely didn't tell me much about menstruation when I was a kid so I was kinda left to my own devices about getting the right info. I guess it's just an Asian cultural thing where women were taught in the past to hush hush about menstruation. A huge example about taboo/superstition about menstruation that my mom told me was if a girl is on her period, she cannot touch the plant *ang huay*, or else the plant will die. It sounded so ridiculous to me! Also, I think the way that teachers taught sex-ed and sexual health in primary & secondary school is insufficient. I wasn't taught anything about PMS and the many symptoms that plague women before/on their periods, what happens if my period didn't arrive (which could be due to stress, etc.). I found out all about it through googling my problems or just reading up about it on Google. Going a lil off-topic here, but even topics such as masturbation are not explored in school for girls. For example, the sex-ed talk when I was in primary/secondary school told the guys that it's normal to masturbate but the girls weren't told anything. There's this gap that needs to be filled.\n\nEssentially, there should not be a feeling of shame if someone is on their period. I really want to instill this in my kids in future. Open communication, being knowledgeable and not ignorant about such biologically natural occurrences is so important."", 'Am a 23 years old male, so you have something to ballpark with and this is speaking from my personal experience. \n\nGrowing up, I never viewed menstruation as a taboo thing. Friends of my age, I believe viewed it the same way. It\'s more of a chore that girls have to deal with and most guys didn\'t really care about it anyway. When a female friend who is more outspoken mentions that she\'s on her period/needs settle her business, or that due to her incoming menstruation, she wouldn\'t be able to participate in certain water activities etc, our reactions would be the typical ""huh, alright that\'s unfortunate. let\'s delay the outing then.""\n\nI personally always offered to get pads/tampons for my close female friends as well as my own gf whenever it comes, and whatever that was necessary to assist them through the monthly chore to make it easier for them. \n\nHowever, it is still a very personal thing for the girls themselves, so they will keep it hush hush whenever it arrives, but if it were found out, it\'s just like an ""oh, explains your angst for these few days"" joke for the guys, and that\'s it. Taboo is basically non existent when it comes to this tbh. I can\'t speak for the older generation however.

hattifnattener,fjco25,[Uni] SMU incoming exchange student. What support facilities are available to those who have a learning disability?,2020-03-16 09:30:26,SGExams,77673,2,37,"Hi! 

Short intro. I am a business administration student from the Netherlands, considering going to SMU for my exchange semester. I have severe ADHD and no experience with how Singapore treats learning disabilities so please forgive my ignorance. 

In the Netherlands I am accustomed to extra exam time (automatically registered) and facilities I have to request for every exam (for example, the opportunity to have my exam in a less crowded room, ability to bring and use a special timer (that shows colour instead of numbers) into the exam) and so on. Teachers are usually forthcoming when I ask for suggestions of extra material such as videos, interactive platforms etc, nobody ever questions the fact that I may need more support. So it is an important consideration for me. 

The questions are as follows: 

* Is ADHD considered a learning disability in Singapore?
* Is support available at the SMU for this? If yes, how easy/difficult it is to get it recognized by the university? What facilities are available generally and for exams?
* From a social standpoint, is there a lot of social stigma/prejudice associated with ADHD/learning disabilities?   
(I am generally very open about the condition, but I do not want to be a constantly questioned over it or gossiped about).

And, more general, but still relevant:

* How are courses usually assessed? Is it more cramming and regurgitating memorized information at an exam or more critical thinking oriented?   
(With this I'm essentially wanting to know whether creativity and thinking out of the box is valued or looked down upon).

I am very much looking forward to going to Singapore, so I'd like to make sure there are no negative surprises that will ruin my stay there.

Thanks a lot in advance!

burntchicken-nuggets,eooznk,[O-LEVELS] Should I apply for DAE?,2020-01-15 02:14:46,SGExams,77673,12,6,"Hi! I took my O levels in 2018 and did horribly and retook my O Levels in 2019 as a private candidate (Comb Humans, EMath) but still did not get a good enough score to be eligible for Poly. My L1R4 is 28, and many of the people I’ve talked to told me to register for JAE to ITE (which I did) and then apply for DAE in hopes for an interview. 

I’ve heard of cases of people getting higher than 26+ but still managed to get in Poly through DAE. 

I am planning to apply for DAE to RP during the second phase, 26 Feb (I’m not sure about the other Polys) and I was just curious, to people who’ve successfully (or not) applied for DAE how was it? And do I have hope? 

If I do, how must my portfolio look like? Do I just compile all my drawings into one sketchbook?(I am trying to apply to Media Production & Design, Art Management) 

I have heard of the bad stigma around ITE and to be honest I think if I stayed in my lane and studied, it would be okay but to those who are in ITE or have graduated ITE, how is/was it? Would I, as an awkward dumbass die? (Okay I’m joking, maybe) And how is the Higher Nitec Early Childhood course like? 

I’m so sorry for the excessive questions, as much as I try to rationalise my thoughts, knowing that I did my best, despite the scores and there is nothing I can do now, I still can’t help but to feel panicky. 

And to those people who’ve just recently took their O Level results and are happy with the scores, good job! You deserve it after all the hard work! But to those who haven’t gotten the scores they wanted (despite the hard work you’ve put in) it’s okay, cry or do anything to relive yourself of the pain because you deserve the right to do so  but just know that it is not the end of the world. I know I am in no position to advice anybody but I’ve been through the disappointment twice and all I’ve learnt is that there is always another path, it might be longer and not conventional but it’s still something.

Now, I'm almost done with my second year in Higher NITEC, just hoping to do well for my final term such that my final net GPA is above the minimum requirement to secure my EAE offer.\n\nTo be honest, I don't think there's a need to worry about the stigmatisation here, so long as you are working in a group of like-minded individuals hoping to graduate smoothly, you're safe. There's actually a series on CNA that talks about individual students' lives in ITE, you are more than welcome to binge-watch it if you want, it isn't a one-to-one comparison to what I've experienced, but there were certain parts where I can relate to it.

If we do mess up, we would have to either, reapply as a private candidate, retake sec 4/5 (which would be mentally and emotionally draining as you would feel discouraged from witnessing the people around you advance to the next level without you. And you’d have to go through that long-winded process for a whole year again.) or just applying to any course available which you might not be passionate in. And from there it’s a domino effect. \n\nI’m not sure about JCs, but all hope’s not lost as for Polys they do help students get in a course based on their interests and well, portfolio. But realistically speaking, it’s a game of chance because we don’t know if we would even get shortlisted for an interview, and even if you do get one you’d have to hope there’s still space for the specific course you want.

It’s better to take the chance, knowing you didn’t get in than not knowing and beating yourself up for it.) \n\nAh, but that’s just my opinion, I’m sorry to put that all on you, I’m usually not this much of a downer.

When I provide them any information, will they disclose this and will there be consequences? For example, if I say I was abused as a child (not true, just an example), will they launch an investigation or something?

Holo-Best-Waifu,enlghl,[O-Levels] I have steeled myself pt. 2,2020-01-12 17:20:17,SGExams,77673,0,20,"Welp guys I'm back and after seeing some of the replys from my previous post I've decided to do another motivational? Speech, but this time the problem seems to be people not knowing which route to take after their results so I'll try to address that.

Ok, I'm a o levels students like you guys so take my advice with a grain of salt as all of this info came from my cousins who all took the main 4 routes namely: poly, JC, ITE and retain. I have quite an extended family so all of this data came from all of my 14 cousins who graduated 1-5 years ago so results may vary.

[**POLY**]

I personally am EAEing into Biologics and process technology in NYP so I personally hope I can get into poly.

Based on the account from 7 of my cousins who chose this route it's one of the best choices they've ever made, they made a lot of good friends, learnt a lot of new things and most importantly they don't really feel that stressed as compared to my other cousins of took the JC route.

They say poly is generally for people who want to experience more hands on stuff and how their future working condition are going to be like so it's pretty fun but the most important thing is that for group projects you must put in your 100%, don't skip out on projects cause your project mates will literally crucify you by complaining to the prof and spread to other people about how lazy you are until no one really wants to work with you, and another thing is you must be thick skin when it comes to project work, your GPA is on the line, if your project mates don't contribute just keep complaining to the prof, so his lazyness only backfires on him and not the group.

[**JC**]

Personally I think there are two types of people who choose this route, either they are like super smart, or just plain retarded. Like who wants to start school early by 2 months and cram so many things within a short span of 2 years, like come on.

Either way back on topic, 3 of my cousins choose this route and the consensus is the same, they are dead inside. They told me how mentally tiring it is and if you are not naturally gifted is quite common to fails your A level, even my tuition teacher said that failing As is not a big deal as 60% of JC student would experience it. So technically speaking if you are smart, you only need to tank for 2 years and of not well eventually you'll pass.

Either way they all said that they kinda regretted it and the only thing they felt that is good from choosing JC is that it's a direct route to University.

[**ITE**]

With so many posts where people keep saying how they're going to go ITE it feels like ITE is the worst place an o level students can go to, maybe because of the social stigma it poses or maybe it's because it takes up too many years of your time but either way there's no going back now

Ok, I have 3 cousins who choose this route but only one gave a short reply and the other two never even read my msg even though it's been a week, so info is quite hazy on this one.

So basically to quote what my cousin said ""Ai ya, ITE basically like poly with a lot of YP only, just avoid them and go about normally can already""
So you've heard it folks that's all the info I have so... hope it helps?

[**RETAIN**]

So now to the most dreaded route of all. I only have one cousin who retained, when I msged him he asked me to fuck off so... Yea but I can give some info based on my accounts and conversations with my seniors who retained, hope it helps.

So retaining is basically just going through sec 4 again or going to 5n, so not that much difference, well the only thing I see my seniors did when they retain is that they study more, which is good but that's about it, until Mon I can't really say if their newfound motivation for studying got pay off or not so I'll keep you guys updated on pt.3 if I'm in the mood to make it on Mon lel. But that's about it.

So guys I hope this helps some of you out, as I said before, although these info are based on real people's account, take it with a grain of salt. Good luck on Monday guys, if I make a pt. 3 I'll share my results too.",0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/enlghl/olevels_i_have_steeled_myself_pt_2/,[]
Nicholas_Wee,clk70p,Why i want to try out multiple jobs after o levels + advice needed,2019-08-03 23:47:59,singapore,378762,23,1,"Im now in sec 4 and I've always wanted to try out different jobs just to see how working life is like. Although this may seem weird, i want to try working in as many different jobs as possible so i can get a better feel of how work can be like. 

##My main motivations:

1) Well cash for buying a laptop and for finally being able to buy christmas presents for my parents with money i made myself 
Best if the jobs are at least $10/h but I'd prob only do this after i feel i have accomplished (2) but if i can do it on the way it'll be best :)

2) Work experience (honeslty more important than then (1)). I have always wondered about the hardships of working in generally considered"" lowly"" jobs like working in Mac d as well as retail and customer service. Many people (esp many asian parents) joke about people working these jobs as ""dumb"" or ""not having proper education"" so i want to see for myself what such people can be like. I want to be able to understand in order to emphatize and appreciate what these people do in their jobs that no one thinks much about or appreciates. I have always felt that the importance and the people working in such jobs to have been undermined and misunderstood by most of society so i feel it is important that i have firsthand experience so i am informed and ready to dispel any misconceptions or negative stigmas on such jobs in the future if need be. Therefore it is important that the jobs i do allow me to work in various fields so that i can maximise my exposure and enlightenment of the real world

As far as my motivations go i havent done much research (my l1r5 is the only thing i should be thinking about now) on how to actually apply for the jobs im interested in or if they require me to stay for more than a few days or more than a week which may decrease my ability to maximise my time  after o levels so would

#Jobs I've considered: (would be great if yall can share your experiences with some companies i can work in so maybe i can consider them since i have no idea where to apply even)
- FnB (Macs, subway, KFC, Stuffd,Bubble tea shops or the likes)
- Retail (Uniqlo? Levis? I have no idea please recommend me)
- Customer service and any jobs that i can learn how much shit customer service takes from people
- Backend jobs that no one knows exist 
- office job maybe?
- Jobs that i can learn skills from whether be it soft or hard skills
-Finally- A well paid job that i can do after all of the above is done so i can work towards the laptop i need for JC

In a nutshell, i need a mix of good pay and a meaningful experience working in everyday jobs

I know what im doing is really weird and no one really wants to do the same as me especially after o levels but i do feel its a once in a lifetime experience that could make my post o level time actually meaningful and also make me money rather than only gaming the whole day at home. Would be great if someone could give me some advice and point me in the right direction so i know where to start looking for jobs and can start right after o levels :))

Edit: Not sure why my comments are geting downvoted but im here to learn and i understand my reasons for taking up the jobs can be seen as self-serving but i do feel it is something i should do to expose myself.

Not many young people are you like nowadays, most would prefer to spend the 2 months of holidays hanging out with friends or playing games at home. It\'s heartening to know that you are interested in seeing society outside of school, and taking the first steps towards ownership of your own finances.\n\nHaving said that, I would like to remind you that it\'s not easy to work multiple jobs during this short period. Companies hire for a minimum of 1 to 2 months, and some may not even entertain you if they find out you\'ll be starting JC in Feb. I would think that you will most likely work a maximum of 1 to 2 jobs before you start JC. Personally, in between my O levels and start of JC in Feb (many years ago lol) I did 3 jobs, gift wrapping at Robinsons which I believe was $7/h, assistant at the local school bookshop which I believe was about $6/h, and later moving on to a shop assistant at Giant for $6/h as well. I suggest you ask around everywhere you walk into, that was how I got these jobs. I literally just asked the shop assistants and they directed me to their manager.\n\nI managed to save up quite a bit, and managed to pay for my own laptop and phone when I went to JC. However like you said, the biggest lesson I learnt was how society really works, that was when I realised the meanest teachers at school were nothing compared to some customers outside. It really taught me that life wasnt going to be smooth sailing and to fight for what I want. I also met some kind souls and experienced uncles and aunties who gave me a lot of good advice. \n\nKeep in mind that it\'s gonna be super tiring as you definitely wont be used to it. I was actually glad to start school in Feb unlike most of my friends when the hols ended. But it was a huge sense of accomplishment knowing that I experienced something that most others didnt, and I still consider it my ""first step"" to being an adult.

There were also people there who came from agencies, and they were paid a dollar less per hour than direct part-timers. For me, I was a direct part-timer as I had some connections (i.e knew someone who knew someone).\n\nLike someone already mentioned, we also had to book a slot to work 2 weeks in advance, before the roster duty is printed out 1 day later. There were 2 shifts (morning/night) which started at 7AM/6PM. One thing I liked about it is that you could choose to end your shift anytime you want (so long as you don\'t end your shift too early. i.e to say don\'t start at 7am and end at 10am). If you booked from 7am - 2pm, but needed to go at 1pm due to last minute emergencies, most of the time the on-duty manager would just let us go.\n\nManagement side, more than half the staff were just utter trash. Back then, I didn\'t know that it would be that bad. The way they treated other staff (especially senior to junior), really depended on their mood for the day. If they were in a bad mood, they would come in and berate everyone for the smallest of things (i.e why are you putting trays on the table when keeping the plates and utensils for turnover). If they were in a good mood, they would come in and greet you when they see you and be very warm. As a part-timer, the best thing to do is just suck it up. At first, I just brushed it off as AMDK superior trying to be an ass towards the ""low-level"" staff, until I saw one of the directors talked in a pretty condescending way to the Junior Executive Chef. However, this got so bad that even some of the full-time staff there begin to lodge complaints against these superiors. When I left (because school was starting), all but one of the \'trash staff\' were transferred/fired within 3 months.\n\nTraining-wise, there probably wasn\'t much to do. On my first day, a friend of mine was thrown the task of telling me what to do and how to do it, and there wasn\'t much stuff they would/could teach you. You had to pretty much figure out stuff as time goes by.\n\nIn terms of operations, the amount of food waste I see daily was shocking. In the morning, there\'s a buffet everyday for the guests that have stayed overnight. Usually, by 10.30am, any uneaten food is just thrown away in order to prepare for lunch turnover. Yea, sure, it might be standard practice for FnB buffet outlets, but it was quite an eye-opening sight I saw for the first time.\n\nThe only thing I ever learnt from there, was probably improving my ability to smoke my way through. Always find something to do, or look like you are doing something, even though you might not be, so they have lesser chance of finding shit with you/dragging you over to some ridiculous shit. I once spent an hour and a half chilling and cleaning banquet plates, because there wasn\'t anything to do out front.\n\nNote that what I have written is my OWN personal experience, others may have a different story to tell when it comes to working at places like Ritz-Carlton, Fullerton, etc.\n\nEDIT: phrasing', 'np\n\nany questions can pm me', ""Thanks for sharing! :)) May i know how long you had to stay with them?

2. Those with mental illnesses, what are 3 things you wish society would understand about you?

3. What is it like to have an episode? e.g. if you have depression, what is it like during a depressive episode? How do you feel, what are the thoughts going through your head, how do you deal with it personally etc.

As I have access arrangements, there would be an asterisk reflected on each of my subjects in my official A level certificate. 

Just wondering if this is true or not, that having access arrangements would affect my future job employment, and also as I plan to enroll in a rather competitive course in university (law), would this affect my chances of getting selected? And if I decide to apply for scholarships, would this again affect my chances? Thanks!

Edit: SEAB granted me AA for O levels as such my school told me that they probably would do the same for A Levels.

This is actually a question I also had when I first got to J1 and I know it's a really tough one to make but I have zero regrets deciding to take the extra time. Okay so I was diagnosed with ADD (inattentive) and have actually been on meds for it for a while now and it got to the point where I realised that even with the meds I struggled to finish my papers. Not that I didn't know how to do them I just could never finish them on time. So of course I did pretty badly for MYEs. I'm not gonna like and say that after I took the extra time my grades jumped or what but that's mainly because I was lazy as hell and never really bothered to study until prelims. \n\nAnyway I digress. So I ended up doing well for As and my prelims which gave me a lot of options. As one guy already said, on my report card there's a plus sign next to every subject which indicates I had extra time. Now despite having it for both prelims and As, after my As I was asked to apply for early admissions to NUS, NTU, and SMU. NUS and NTU didn't get back to me but SMU offered me a place in their Business school through their discovery day. I was pretty shook because I was also under the impression they wouldn't wanna get back to me cause of the extra time and since for smu also wrote my personal essay about ADD. Anyway fast forward to after results were released. I haven't had to reapply to any schools cause they have my early admissions and they get my results directly from MOE. \n\nI think I can safely say taking extra time has in no way impaired my chances of getting a scholarship because within days of getting my results NTU offered me an interview for a scholarship which I got and have already accepted and SMU has also offered me a double degree programme and a scholarship interview. Only thing is NUS still hasn't gotten back to me about anything other than the fact they're pending my scholarship applications. I didn't apply for any government scholarships or even external ones because I really didn't like the idea of the bonds that came with it so I'm not too sure if it'll affect your chances there though. \n\nI think that most importantly you've got to ask yourself if you think that the extra time would help you. At the end of the days I genuinely believe they care more about the raw grades than anything else. It's better to get all As with extra time than to get straight Bs without it. I know it's a little scary to take the AA and I know that there's the whole stigma about it especially in Singapore and the only real advice I can give here is to ignore what other people say. Some of us just need this and that doesn't make us any less of a student or less worthy of a scholarship position because the AA isn't an advantage it's a leveler to make sure we've got a fighting chance. Of course it will be weird to not take your exams with the rest of your class but you'll get used to it. I know a couple people who could have applied but chose not to and in the end their results suffered. So despite not having AA their chances of getting a scholarship are much lower. You gotta play to your strengths. \n\nTl;Dr\nFrom my personal experience it does not affect anything as long as you can still make the grades. So if you're sure you can't get a perfect score without the AA then definitely take it"", ""Hi! Not sure about AA affecting scholarships - you should be fine! As for work, from what I heard (I might be wrong), as long as you're not in the public sector you're good!"", 'As a person with mental health issues, I can safely say from my personal experience on the job employment part, it will.

They said oh and we will contact you if you\'re hired. This world sadly stigmatises those with mental health issues.

It is indeed a leveller (the extra 25% time) to help you ensure you won't be disadvantaged in A levels compared to other candidates.However, the 'plus' sign annotation is quite obvious. For pictures of the certificates, you can PM me. \nI took my A levels under AA with the knowledge that this will affect my future job employment.I REALLY NEEDED the extra time as all my exams were basically essays (was from Arts stream)  and I had sweaty palms also caused by anxiety and also panic attacks so I can literally fail all the subjects.I also could not do maths (even at the H1 level)  because maths trigger my anxiety so badly that I can literally not do more than half the paper and instead panic and cry throughout the exam.

I'm using my other account so people who know me won't know it's me. I feel like a no one. i have no one to rant to so I'm ranting here. I have friends and all but no close friends. And all of my friends think I'm a happy and carefree person, they don't know im a emotional, anxious and easily depressed person. I always hid behind this happy, friendly, carefree facade with everyone. In sec 3 things were going bad and I had suicidal thoughts. I self harmed and I tried to commit suicide with a knive and I was holding it but I couldn't do it. I'm scared that if people see the real me they will leave me. I'm just really broken inside. I have been bullied/outcasted in kindergarten and primary school. In secondary school I started putting up this facade, I was still a loner sometimes and still had drama with classmates which I couldn't avoid. Because of all these I have incredibly low self-esteem. Fast forward to now, I'm in an new class where I don't know anyone. I see people in my class talking and hanging out and I feel lonely. I just wanna disappear. I feel very useless, worthless and inferior to everyone tbh I believe if I disappear no one would really care except for my parents. Everyday I go to school and come back feeling like shit. I feel like no one likes me and everyone thinks I'm pathetic and a disappointment. And academics makes things worse because I'm stressed about studying now too. I'm not coping well with studies. I'm not Singaporean and my parents chose to come here for my education and I feel v guilty that I'm doing rlly shitty for studies. I don't know what to do anymore. I self harmed last week again. I'm trying to stop I know this isn't a solution. But my brain keeps thinking about all these things. I keep thinking I want to disappear but not die. I wish I would go into some sort of accident and fall in coma or something. I just want to rest for the time being. I have thoughts of purposely falling down and hitting my head on the floor so that I get injuries in my head and I become unconscious. I just want to escape reality for awhile. Things were fine and I was doing really well a d great before school started. Now school has started and I have become a mess again. I have been thinking whether or not I should visit my school counselor but I'm also anxious about that with so many thoughts. Anyways thanks for reading my rant I know it's pretty long and all and it might seem stupid and dramatic and I suck at explaining it and also wanted to keep it short so yeah.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/n4nxbm/rantself_harm_and_suicidal_thoughts/,"['You should book an appointment with your school counsellor.', 'hey, ik things are tough right now but eventually it will all be over, it’s only the third week of school and ik how school may be like gg through the depths of hell for you now, but ngl, in future there will be projects that require you to work with your classmates so maybe you can start off from there, tbh for me having friends is great, but sometimes being alone is amazing too. Don’t stress yourself too much, take a deep breath and start afresh, leave your bad memories of kindergarten and pri school behind. It’s a new chapter of your life, try to negotiate a convo with the classmates near you. Start off by asking qns, like when u need certain help in class, for eg. “Hey sorry but do you know how to do this?”, so and so. Take it slow, you’re growing out of your own comfort zone and need to be social with everyone around you in poly in order to survive this chapter of your life. I’m not a very sociable person either, but when it requires me to be social, I hv no choice but to talk. I may not know exactly how you’re feeling now but i do know that things will get better as long as you try your best. Not all friends may be nice, some may be snakes, some may be kind to you with a motive and there will be others who would really want to be friends with you.

However, it’s perfectly alright to give yourself ***encouragement*** from time to time. Looking on the bright side may help too when not used excessively.\n\nMaybe you would like to write down all your ***strengths*** that you may want to focus on and ***weaknesses*** to take note so that you would understand how you cope and react to each of this attributes. I would also highly recommend “**Psych2Go**” videos on YouTube if you prefer something to watch and it wouldn’t take a lot of time as most of the videos are below 10 minutes and they offer quick and concise pointers on the various topics searched on such as “10 signs of social anxiety”.

Wouldn’t be surprised if people don’t remember me ever being there. \n\nI really urge you to speak to a counsellor in school — they should have one in every polytechnic (whichever one you’re from). There’s absolutely no shame in doing this and to be honest, it happens very often. It wasn’t until I’d left school that I realised how a handful of friends (not from my course, just from extra-curricular activities) had been seeing the school counsellor and even deferred their studies due to mental health. You really don’t have to feel this way. It’s painful to see someone else going through the things that I did, so I really want to remind you that you’re not alone and that there’s help. Sometimes help involves taking a break from school and focusing on your mental health, something I never did until I completely ruined myself (so don’t be like me hahaha). \n\nDrop me a message if you want to chat, or just need someone that can relate and validate everything you’re feeling, from the self-harm (been there) to the holding-a-knife suicide attempt (been there too lmao), to wanting to disappear (still there hahaha). And if you need some encouragement and help (tbh even physically being there to coax you into the counsellor’s office hahah) in getting the help that you deserve, because you really do deserve it. Also just wanted to remind you that you’re not being dramatic. You’re just a person in a lot of pain, and if pain isn’t meant to be heard, then what is, right? \n\nSending you all of the positive vibes that depressed old me can send you today hahaha.

I found them helpful and they are very validating. Also you can apply for a Community Health Assessment Team (CHAT) referral. U can apply for a mental health assessment. Its confidential and doesn't need parental consent. I also have suicidal thoughts which started in Sec 4 for me.

BlueHeronKnight,my38ct,"Looking for mental health support in Singapore (depression, self-harm)",2021-04-25 15:28:08,singapore,378762,17,25,"Hello, I'm writing this on behalf of a friend (33F, expat) who is currently going through rough times in her life and would certainly benefit from counsel from professionals.

In short, she has been having difficulties in her very demanding work, personal/romantic life and she lives alone, rarely leaving the house and meeting with other people. Her family and long-time friends are all abroad and she has struggled to find friends here, if not for a few people and mostly colleagues.

The fact that she needs help is not simply an hypothesis of mine. Lately, every time we meet she ends up opening up with me and letting out her *true* thoughts, fears and sadness. She says that she has trouble being honest with other people and often also herself, meaning that she puts on a mask so that nobody can see what she's really going through. Only with me she says that she can really be herself and she lets out all that she's keeping inside.

Yesterday she told me that more and more she's been having *dark* thoughts: *self-harm, suicide*. She says it would make everything easier to just not feel anything. She told me that this is not the first time in her life that she has been having these thoughts.

She has been seeing a therapist on and off the last year, but she's been delaying setting up a new session with this person (for months now). The main issue being that this is a person in her same work/social circle and she doesn't feel comfortable with sharing more. At the same time, she has been using this as an excuse to not find help elsewhere.

We agreed that I would help her find support from some other institution, so here I am.

This morning I called the Institute for Mental Health and they gave me some general advice. Of course they cannot do anything until she sets up an appointment. However the IMH is very far from her house (Jurong area) and I feel she might use this as another excuse not to go.

Does anybody have experience with this situation? Who should I refer to? Especially, west/central area.

Thank you.

To summarise for easier reading, basically end 2019 i was in a very dark period, which led to regular self harming.

I’ve never actually been to a psychologist/psychiatrist/doctor/whatever, but i’m seriously considering it because i don’t want to go down that dark rabbit hole again. So, i wanna ask just in case, IF i do start self harming again, whether regularly (daily) or not regularly (once a week?), is it safe to let the doctor know or will I be thrown into IMH immediately?

They\'re called followers. She makes a career out of this. \n\n> During her disappearance, she lost many followers - not that she minds.\n\nThe fact that she has to say she doesn\'t mind almost seems defensive but I chalk it up to possibly a bad summary of the interview. The interviewer asks about her friendships as an influencer and she gives some trite answer about how social media ""friends"" are not really friends, then talks about losing ""friends"" in that context except now relabelled ""followers"" by the interviewer. \n\nThe article could have easily omitted that part but I guess the interviewer didn\'t have much material to work with. It would have been more interesting to ask about how her sources of revenue were affected and her strategy to regain followers (if any). \n\nOther than being a rich guy\'s daughter, I presume ST deemed her worthy of interviewing because she\'s an influencer and not talking about the main parts of her career (other than than the last three lines) seems like a missed opportunity.', ""I'd be sad too, if I named my son Kyden.

If you run in her social circles or people who are linked to them you'd know the way she's being painted here is nothing but a facade. "", '# She may be home-grown billionaire Peter Lim\'s daughter, but Kim Lim says she has had to work for what she wants\n\nIn public, Kim Lim is always sparkling and stylish, with a cluster of Cartier Love and Juste un Clou bracelets on her arm.\n\nAsked if they have a special meaning, she says with a smile: ""I usually go out without much jewellery, I just like to stack different bracelets.""\n\nBut beyond being accessories, the bracelets are also a cover.\n\nWhen she removes them, her wrist is encircled with scars. They are old wounds, each scar a record of her little-known past.\n\nAt the lowest point of her life, she says she tried to do ""stupid things"", without elaborating further.\n\nIt is a past she rarely talks about. She says she decided to open up because many young girls these days battle depression and she hopes they will not take the same self-destructive path.\n\nLim is 27 and the daughter of Singaporean business magnate Peter Lim. One of Singapore\'s most successful stockbrokers, he switched to being a full-time investor in 1996. In the 2018 Forbes list of Singapore\'s richest people, he ranked 12th with a net worth of $2.4 billion. His companies and commercial interests include Thomson Medical Group, Valencia CF, footballer Cristiano Ronaldo\'s portrait rights and Hotel Football, which is next door to Manchester United\'s Old Trafford football stadium.\n\nWhen she was four years old, her parents parted ways. It was one of the longest divorce cases in Singapore, lasting more than seven years.\n\nRecalling that time, Kim Lim\'s eyes well up with tears. She says: ""That\'s the darkest period of my life. I remember when I was in primary school, my brother and I would shuttle between our parents every two to three days.""\n\nAfter primary school, her parents sent her to boarding school in England to make her more independent. She spent four years at Queenswood School. She returned at age 16 and attended Anglo Chinese School (Independent), Hwa Chong International School and the Singapore Institute of Management.\n\nMany would think that as a rich man\'s daughter, she is able to have everything her heart desires and enjoy a life without worries. But Lim disagrees.\n\nShe says: ""I\'ve never felt I was different from other children. My father is very strict with me. We live a simple life, such as going to the hawker centre to eat his favourite mee siam. As a kid, I didn\'t have many luxuries. He always told me that whatever I want, I have to get it myself.""\n\nThis is advice that she has taken to heart, at least in her love life. When it comes to love, she believes in destiny, love at first sight and being a go-getter.\n\nLim laughs like a little girl as she says: ""I met my husband in a temple in Thailand, I guess that\'s destiny."" The devout Buddhist regularly visits Thai temples and believes in fate.\n\n""I was drawn to his tall frame and his \'bad boy\' vibe. I later found out he was my assistant\'s friend. We dated for half a year and, in a flash, we had registered our marriage.""\n\nContinuing with a laugh, she adds: ""Our personalities are completely different. He\'s very low-key. He\'s older than me by one year, but is completely uninterested in social media. Before we met, he didn\'t even have an Instagram account. He set one up later just so he could follow me on social media.\n\n""When it comes to how we deal with things, I\'m more impulsive, he\'s more calm and rational. Maybe it\'s because we\'re different that we\'re attracted to each other. I feel grounded when I\'m with him.""\n\nThis is the first time she has shared her love story with the media.\n\nIn 2016, she was rumoured to be dating Macau casino tycoon Stanley Ho\'s son Mario Ho. Both shared photos of themselves exchanging rings and kissing in Paris on their social media accounts. It was widely reported by the press.\n\nAsked about it now, she says: ""We were together for half a year. But because we lived in different cities, it was hard to maintain a long-distance relationship. Over time, we drifted apart.""\n\nThere were also rumours of a romantic relationship with K-pop boyband BigBang\'s Seungri.\n\nShe dismisses it with a laugh: ""We\'ve always been good friends.""\n\nInterestingly, while her romances were widely talked about, few knew about her marriage registration. The ceremony was very simple, with only family members by her side.\n\nShe says: ""Once you\'ve found the right person, why wait?""\n\nAs for the wedding ceremony, she says it keeps getting delayed. It was planned for March 23 last year and invitations had been sent out, but midway, she got pregnant.\n\nAfter her delivery, she planned to hold a ""wedding of the century"" at the end of 2018, but that got derailed again as she ""had not attained her ideal figure"".\n\nLim is the spokesman for Cambridge Therapeutics slimming salon and apparently goes there for at least three sessions a week to achieve her ""ideal wedding figure"".\n\nNow that she has a son, Kyden, her life has undergone a 180-degree change.\n\nPreviously, she would pack her bags and jet off wherever she fancied. Now, she puts him first before her trips. On this 10-day-plus Europe trip, she would often FaceTime the one-year-old to see what he was up to on the other side of the world.\n\nLim also invited us to her father\'s holiday home in Manchester, letting us spend 48 hours with her there.\n\nHer football-loving father\'s holiday home is on the sixth floor of Hotel Football. Manchester United is one of his favourite teams and he often visits Manchester to watch games and has his own private room at Old Trafford.\n\nA few years ago, he and football players Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs invested in the hotel, which was officially opened in 2015. On the sixth floor, there is a row of rooms without numbers that is Peter Lim\'s private suite - and also home to Kim Lim and her younger brother in Manchester. He chose to have his suite on the sixth rather than top floor because the windows look out directly to the Manchester United logo, a dream view for a super football fan.\n\nThe suite has an open kitchen, living room and bedroom, with floor-to-ceiling views of the neighbouring stadium. On the top floor of the hotel is an indoor football field with a 360-degree view of Manchester.\n\nAfter becoming a mother, Kim Lim says she has started doing charity work for kids.\n\nRecently, she took more than 100 underprivileged children to The Great Moscow Circus, hoping to bring more smiles into their lives. She also went to Mongolia before the arrival of winter to deliver gers (Mongolian yurts) to homeless children there, hoping to provide some shelter from the cold.\n\nShe says: ""With a mother-in-law, father, husband and son who love me, everything is perfect. I don\'t really need anything else.""', 'Disgusting.', 'WTF? so rich already got so many problems.  what a load of BS', 'We should become robin hood and rob their wealth while giving it to the less fortunate\n\nViva la Communism!', 'Who is she??', 'I am depressed too, hope I can have a big company to inherit when I am 30.', 'Why is this even being published in St and not the usual tabloids?

My parents are divorced too but unlike her I can't drown my tears in money /sarcasm"", '## SHE HAS 238,000 FOLLOWERS, BUT NOT MORE THAN FIVE TRUE FRIENDS\n\nAs we travelled to different European cities for the photoshoot with Kim Lim, she took on the role of a big sister, always giving suggestions of the best places to eat.\n\nThis is why, when we were in London, we ended up in the city\'s hottest restaurant, Novikov, as well as her family\'s favourite, Orient London. And in Manchester, she made reservations at Menagerie, a restaurant popular with the city\'s footballers, well before our plane touched down.\n\nLim says her father is the one who taught her to be hospitable and gracious. ""As a child, whenever I went out with my dad and his friends, I would see that he treats them with so much sincere hospitality. I think sharing things that I like with my friends is so much more fun than enjoying these things on my own.""\n\nOf course, she is aware that there are those who befriend her only for networking purposes or even to take advantage of her.\n\nBut she says: ""If I am being taken advantage of, to a certain extent, I really do not mind."" She insists there is no need to be calculative over many little things in life.\n\nOnce, when she found out that a trusted friend had been stealing money from her wallet, she stopped hanging out with the friend and never asked about the money. She saw it as having paid ""school fees"" to learn the truth about a person.\n\nLim is an influencer with 238,000 followers on Instagram, so I ask her if she has that many friends in real life.\n\nShe says with a laugh that the case is entirely opposite. There are not more than five friends whom she can really talk to or who will help her in an emergency.\n\nShe adds: ""You have a lot of fake \'friends\' on social media. They will like your photos or sometimes leave comments, but as soon as a prettier or fresher face appears, they will have an immediate change of heart and move the focus onto someone else. This is reality.""\n\nWhile she was pregnant, she disappeared for nearly nine months on social media. She says: ""Pregnancy is a very private matter - I wanted to share this experience only with my family and my husband and not let people on social media comment about it.""\n\nDuring her disappearance, she lost many followers - not that she minds. All she wanted to do at the time was take care of her baby and enjoy the pregnancy process with her husband.\n\nLim also sets boundaries for herself. She never posts photos of her home or her kid\'s face. She explains: ""That is for safety concerns.""\n\nReportedly, in the 2014 case where the elderly mother of Sheng Siong supermarket boss Lim Hock Chee was kidnapped, the defendant revealed that his first choice had been Lim and her younger brother. This is why when it comes to sharing details of her life, she has always chosen to be more conservative.\n\nUp till now, she has never shared photos of her one-year-old son Kyden\'s face on social media. Even when she held the 99-day celebration for her son at Ritz Carlton, she made a note on the invitation card for guests to refrain from sharing photos of him on social media.\n\nShe says: ""I don\'t want him to be moulded into an influencer baby when he is still so young, it would be too unfair to him. If he wishes to be an influencer when he grows up, then I will encourage him, because that would be his own decision.""\n\nMany fashion, beauty and jewellery brands promote their products through her social media platforms, although she insists on working only with brands she likes.\n\nShe also hopes to use her social media influence for good and encourage more young people to lend a helping hand to the elderly, children and stray cats and dogs.\n\nSince most of her income comes from being an influencer, I ask if she is worried about the day when social media is no longer trendy and what her plans would be if the influencer business is over.\n\nIt turns out that she has seen this coming for a long time.\n\nShe says: ""I have given myself a deadline - I will quit this industry after I\'m 30, so I can focus on working with my brother to help our father manage his businesses. After all, that is more practical. So during this time, I will work hard to fight for my own career and hopefully make a name for myself.""', 'Some random woman with a rich & influential dad ', ""Because she's rich."", 'Because quality journalism /s', 'Maybe it\'s part of the ""above and beyond"" that her dad does for her?

wahsedap,nylalf,[Rant] My girlfriend left me before my NS Enlistment,2021-06-13 09:03:44,SGExams,77673,108,429,"TL;DR My girlfriend left me 3 weeks before I enlist and now I don't really know how to cope, especially with Uni appeal stress

&#x200B;

I've been a lurker on Reddit and only recently found this subreddit due to Uni application Results, this is my first post so I apologize if I make any errors with the formatting/procedure/grammar

I recently graduated from Poly and am currently waiting to enlist (2nd July)

Growing up I've always struggled with anxiety and the inability to cope when I don't perform academically, which resulted in a history of self-harm. For me, a minor setback can ruin my whole day (like forgetting to bring my wallet to school) my motivation for each day is pretty much a silk thread ready to break under the slightest of tensions.

I managed to get through my final 2 years of Poly with the help of my supportive girlfriend, am just a year older so she's still in her final year of poly, the fact that she is the top of her course really inspired me to do better and reach my fullest potential.

Lately, Uni admission results and awaiting the appeal results, have taken a massive toll on my mental health. This caused me to devote my time towards checking the Uni portals for any changes/constantly refreshing this subreddit and my email. But with the support of my family and girlfriend, I was able to stay focused on exercising and preparing myself for the Commando training I will soon undergo.

I felt ready to face NS, knowing that Id be able to get through this season with my girlfriend, I even felt ready for an unsuccessful uni appeal result, because truly the people around me matter more.

I was clean from self-harming for almost 3 years now. Then my girlfriend broke up with me yesterday, for the reason that she wants to focus on her studies. Making me feel that she only loved me when it was convenient

I know for a fact that if I self-harm now, my time in NS would be greatly affected, but without it, I honestly don't know how I'm going to cope

I have a really supportive family, and we spent yesterday hugging and crying together after I told them, but now I feel bad for sharing my burden with them and causing them stress too.

I really would appreciate any advice on how to cope :)

Edit: Thank you so much to everyone, honestly didn't expect the amount of encouragement you guys gave me, am really thankful for this  **😭**

Edit2: I've decided to seek professional help from a counsellor and I once again thank everyone for being understanding!!",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nylalf/rant_my_girlfriend_left_me_before_my_ns_enlistment/,"['I see you have been relying on your gf and family for pretty much the entire time.

However I just wanna bring up to you that it is okay to seek professional help in NS.\n\nIf you\'re really unable to cope mentally in NS, bring it up to your commanders (sect com, PS, PC etc) and explain to them your predicament. Your PC especially should ""interview"" you personally upon enlistment to check in on you, you can always bring it up to them and they are supposed to treat it professionally. Just give them a heads up so they can better support you. You may also want to see the MO and get referred to get some help be it via counselling or seeing a psychiatrist. It may be a hard sell given the stigma that mental health issues are often used to ""chao keng"". You may think it\'s not needed or brush it off but it\'s really just to protect yourself. Also, always remember in NS you are still human and have basic rights. BMT is a time where commanders always try to intimidate fresh recruits.

Or a distraction required to not think of a gf. This is an awesome chance to make friends for life. To get fit. To pursue any interest you might have, i.e. A new skill or a new language. Whatever. It gives you the chance to have clarity as well.\n\n4) the camaraderie in army will help u get past this. There will be brothers in similar situations. It beats dealing with this alone.\n\nYou are upset and hurting. But you wull get over it easier than u imagine."", ""OP, I know you are feeling sad from this break up. Although you may hear this often, but try view it in another perspective. It's better that she ended it now than later when you are in NS. I had seen a couple of my BMT section mates where their gfs broke up with them while they are in BMT. One of them got so sad that he cried while he was sleeping late night (not sure if my section mates heard him sobbing but i did). \n\nFor uni admission, if you didnt get in this year, there is always next year. I didnt get accepted in my 1st try after my poly but I got accepted the following year while I was in NS. \n\nAlso, if you feel that you need help in terms of your mental health, please do reach out for help even if you have to downpes if your case is quite severe. It may do you good in the long run. Nothing is more important than your well being especially mental health."", 'Dear OP, it sounds like you tend to be codependent in relationships (friends, family and love). I am not sure if you are aware of the concept, but if not, do look up codependency and look out for the signs + how to be less dependent. It will help you out in the long run:)', 'My advice is to focus on self-improvement instead. If she did this to you, she’s definitely not the one. \n\nYou wouldn’t want a wife who divorces you whenever she needs to focus on her career now, would you?\n\nLike the other guy said, turn your anger into motivation and focus on becoming the best version of yourself. Work out, read more self development books and learn new skills (coding, music instruments, investing/trading etc.) You could even buy the notes for the modules you’ll take in uni off carousell and prepare in advance or revise your A-level materials if you feel like you’ll have to retake A’s. \n\nAnother thing I would mention is that you don’t have to choose just one of the things mentioned above. You could develop those skills in parallel or do more than one of those things at once. Things will get better, I promise.', ""NGL, the Commando journey is alot easier w a gf from what I've seen.

And know one thing, once you've hit rock bottom, its really an eye opener for yourself.

Read a handful of the comments and I think alot of them are very harsh and unempathetic. Although it is worth it to take time and read constructive criticism, I think this is a very important juncture to realise that ultimately what others say shouldn't always be taken to heart, or be used to decide who you are as a person and what you should do.\n\nMany of the comments are talking about being independent emotionally, and as much as I agree with that, I think that they aren't really being very helpful by telling you what you should be like. Rather than becoming independent, I would encourage taking smaller steps towards becoming able to internalise and evaluate the emotions and thoughts inside. I think it will help to invest some time in something that you like to do, or something that can be a healthy coping method! I read that you can't help but check up on uni applications due to anxiety, which honestly I actually feel so much (that was me two years ago). I think that redirecting your energy and thoughts to something else would really make that much better! It could be picking up a new instrument, a new form or art etc! Personally I like journalling and calligraphy :).\n\nSpeaking of journalling, some people find this helpful in terms of organising their thoughts and feelings. It also helps with sorting out plans you have for yourself! One of the things on your mind is applications - logically, you and I both know that there is nothing much you can do about it anymore. Of course, it may not feel like it and that's alright! What you can do to make a difference to the outcome though, is to be ready for whatever it is at the end of this application cycle. You can start exploring options you have that you can make right now, or after the results happen. Other than going to university, what else can you do? Are there other institutions that you could apply to? When do they accept applications? Are they also a pathway to what you would like to do in the future? If you were to apply for universities again in the next year, how can you make your application even better than what you have currently? Rather than stopping at an event itself, allow yourself to think about the possibilities beyond it! You can also try to ask yourself related questions to the setbacks you experience.\n\nI know that a sudden change in life as we know it is difficult, but it can be helpful to think that there are no accidents in life (if you get the reference :p). Sooner or later, we must come to terms with it and life goes on! Everything is an experience that can be a lesson learnt for us. I can tell you about a situation I got into yesterday that kinda destroyed my day. What happened is one of the members in my team that is in charge of our marketing came up with a horrendous row of posts on our instagram that looked like 5 mins was spent on it. I asked her if it could be revised, as per her initial plans she told us which looked infinitely better. She told us she was tired, and I offered to cover her for these posts. Mind you, marketing is not related at all to my role and there is nothing in it for me if I help her. I complete everything, finalise a colour palette and arrange transitions, sizing and content and I had the posts ready to go. At the end of the day she basically scraps what I did and came up with another post that looked maybe like it had 10 mins effort put into it. My entire day's worth of effort is gone just like that. On top of that, I did not get a single word of apology and the thanks was not sincere at all, because she was so busy trying to explain why she is right, that she didn't know I did ABC, etc. Because of that, I cried for the entire night. After that I realised that actually since I had a side business that I was running on my own, I could use what I made and elements of my design in advertising my stuff. I spent the whole night thinking about what I could do with my business and honestly maybe this is a bad experience, but can be useful none the less!\n\nSorry for the loooong comment haha. I wanna end off with wishing you the best of luck on your journey, and congratulating you for being brave enough to take the first step towards professional help!

chemisdie,n9q5rw,[Rant] can’t do this anymore,2021-05-11 13:59:28,SGExams,77673,44,280,"tw: suicidal thoughts, self harm
(using a throwaway acc bc my friends know about my main one)

I am in school right now, and I wish more than anything else to be home, to be in my bed, away from everyone and everything.

I was getting better. I’ve been getting better. So when and how did I end up like this? I’m so unimaginably tired. Like, my head is literally in constant pain and I can feel the fatigue weighing me down. 

For context, ever since I started JC last year, I’ve been struggling. I went from being a great student in secondary school to failing everything. In summary, I hit rock bottom last year- my depression and anxiety got so bad that my parents (despite me trying to hide it) realised how not okay I was and sent me to a doctor for treatment.

I advanced to J2, and slowly got better. My grades were improving, and for my recent tests, I passed Math and got a B for bio. Did okay for the other subjects too. (BCMe) 

However, about 3 weeks ago, I started to feel like I was burning out. I’ve been studying much more than I used to, so I expected that, and therefore I decided to take a short break. But right then I got into a huge fight with my best friend in school because she found out about my self harm habits during the holidays last year when I was still struggling (she saw the scars and i usually wear a jacket and i didnt that day). She was angry that I didn’t ask for help, and she told me that she couldn’t be friends with someone who didn’t want to help herself. So she ignored me in school for a while, and that exhausted me a lot because I’m an introvert so I don’t have many friends other than her to hang out with. (shes the only one i’m close to in our friend group) After a couple of days we talked it out and things were fine, but then more things started happening- another girl in my friend group started to break down in school non-stop, then our whole group got into a conflict, then my sister had to be admitted into the hospital, then I started fighting with my parents again...

Today I came to school and another friend of mine got pissed off at me because I was supposed to go eat lunch with her but I totally forgot because I’ve been so out of it lately, and I can’t make it because of another school commitment.

So now I’m in the toilet trying to not cry while I type this stupid rant.

There’s only so much I can take, I just feel so overwhelmed, and the past few weeks I’ve been feeling like I’m back at square one. They’ve been foggy and tainted with suicidal thoughts and just constant anxiety. I have no energy to study, no will to do anything. All my friends are leaving me. I’m a burden to my family. Nothing good ever happens in my life because I don’t deserve it. Last weekend I found the suicide note I wrote last year and had this thought that even though it felt like things were getting better, nothing has changed, and nothing will.

I haven’t been to therapy in a while because my parents had a falling out with the clinic. Of course they did. (they had some complaints idk tho didnt really talk about it to me and never asked me if i wanted to go to another clinic so) So I havent had professional help for months now. But i’m so close to breaking, I can feel it and i’m scared. 

Is it possible for me to see a doctor at a polyclinic for mental health issues? Without my parents knowing? They are under the impression that I’m okay now and it’s not worth the fight and emotional struggle to explain to them what’s going on. 

Thanks for reading this rant.


[edit: i’m in shock right now at how much support ive been getting, i’ve read every response and every DM (and tried replying to all of them), and i feel so much better now to know how many people are rooting for me, and how many are willing to help. i’m in tears, which feels strangely carthatic in the best way possible because i havent cried in ages as i’ve been too tired to emote. thank you everyone for understanding me, and for being so supportive. i’ll be getting help soon, and i’ll do my best to push on. it’s the least i can do after all of your kind words. thank you so much. i typed this rant to vent, but in return i received consolation, care and love. thank you.]",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/n9q5rw/rant_cant_do_this_anymore/,"['Hi OP, if you are contemplating suicide, please seek help.\r  \n\r  \nEmergency Helplines (all 24h)\r  \n\r  \nNational Care Helpline: 1800 202 6868\r  \n\r  \nSamaritans of Singapore\r  \nHotline: 1800 221 4444\r  \nWebsite/Care Text service: https://www.sos.org.sg/\r  \n\r  \nInstitute of Mental Health\r  \nHelpline: 6389 2222\r  \nWebsite: http://www.imh.com.sg/contact-us/\r  \n\r  \nCounselling /Mental Health Assessments (non-emergency):\r  \n\r  \nSingapore Association of Mental Health\r  \nHelpline: 1800 283 7019\r  \nWebsite: https://www.samhealth.org.sg/\r  \n\r  \nCare Corner Counselling Centre:\r  \nHotline: 1800-3535-800 (Mon-Sun, 10am-10pm)\r  \nWebsite http://www.carecorner.org.sg/cccc.html\r  \n\r  \nCHAT (youth aged 16 to 30) :\r  \nWebsite: https://www.chat.mentalhealth.sg/\r  \n\r  \nSingapore Association for Mental Health (SAMH)\r  \nHotline: 1800 283 7019\r  \nWebsite: https://www.samhealth.org.sg/\r  \n\r  \nA more comprehensive list of helplines/organisations can be found at: https://thetapestryproject.sg/get-help-resources/helplines-support-services-in-singapore/\r  \n\r  \nStay safe everyone and please take care', 'Your friends are too young to handle depression issues appropriately, don’t take it on yourself for that.', 'The doctors at polyclinic are able to give you a referral to a therapist at a later date, so to answer your question, yes, it is possible!\n\nBut depending on the severity of your condition, if let\'s say you\'re clearly suicidal and they notice it, your parents might be called up to be informed so there\'s a slight chance that they might end up finding out.\n\nI sincerely hope you feel better soon and I\'m glad you\'re taking measures and steps to try and help yourself, even just by making this Reddit post. \n\nIf I may add on, I personally think it\'s odd that your friend is mad at you and said that ""she can\'t be friends with you"" when she found out about your self-harm habits, that\'s not the first natural or instinctive reaction that a friend should have when they find out about their friend being depressed and having self-harming habits.', 'Hello friend,\n\nI really, really wish I could tell you that simply dying, really doesn’t help at all.

You\'re really strong for fighting on, for fighting through all that youve gone through in life. And its okay to fall sometimes, its okay to have downfalls that are a little longer than usual but what matters is that you rest, give yourself a break, and stand up and keep going again. Its really really tiring, and you may feel like dying because youre so tired of life, but are you tired of life as a whole, or tired of not being able to see a way out of the darkness? Please dont give up, because you getting better in that period of time shows that it is possible to get better. Its also completely normal to get better, and then get worse again. It may seem like a never-ending cycle of depression and self-harm and life throwing rocks at you day after day, but those times when you got even slightlyy better, when your mental health improbed even if just by a bit, keep on fighting for those better days to come!! Also, I completely understand how bad it must have hurt when your best friend ignored you because you didn\'t seek help, I think your best friend was honestly not being very understanding. Personally when I told my best friend about my inner demons and things that were making me upset, she ignored me too because i seemed like i was ""too scared to stand up for myself"", which i kinda was, because of past experiences. Idk, you may feel really worthless like how I did when your best friend ignored you, but I assure you, you are NOT worthless. These people, they may not know how to be empathetic and understanding to you because they didnt go through what you went through, and her ignoring you during that time does not make you worthless.

Firstly,I am in s4 and Im already doing rlly bad for all my subj.So I actually wanted to put all my focus into my o levels and not be involved in any drama.BUT there’s this annoying mosquito who suddenly started calling me names and even physically attacking me as in shoving me.(shoving really hard btw).So I did not even do anything to that mosquito but he started calling me insulting names and even cursing at me infront of my face.your might think it is normal but it have affected my mental health and I also started self harming to numb my mental pain.There was once,that bitch strangled me just because I wanted to stand up for myself and guess what?I cried in school for the first time((:Since then,his clique kept bullying me and I really can’t take it anymore...Just a few months ago I almost jumped off my building cause of the incessant bullying.Not only that,my parents also recently found out about me self harming and they cried so badly.This made me feel that there is no more escape as I do not want to hurt my parents by commiting suicide.I tried to talk to my Teachers about it but they seem to forget about it after one session of htht with them.The only way for me to survive is by ruining my bullies lives just like how they ruined mine.Give me some tips on how to ruin their lives.I want to go back to my old life the boy who is genuinely happy and not the person who have to put on a facade to show people that I am happy but inde me is just shattered pieces .",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nprn6v/ranthow_to_ruin_my_bullies_lives/,"['hey... i know ur having a rly hard tome now and my heart goes out to you. though i cant help you much, what i want you go know is that the best revenge is to do well, rise up and do better than them. this may sound far fetched, but i really want you to try to do this. if you need any help for os, im here to help. i jus graduated sec sch and will help you in any way i can. please stay strong and may things get better for you soon. also, i think its rly good your filial and think for ur parents. that is a sign of maturity. please carry this strength with you. i also want to remind you that revenge in a physical way  doesnt make you any better too, so how about doing something that benefits you plus smack their ego too, shiw them ur better than what they see.', 'Post it on tiktok with the sch uni but blur the faces', 'The hard truth about life is justice is not always prevalent. Life is unfair. People like bullies tend to possess strong characteristics for success and popularity. The childhood fantasy of everything sorting out by themselves won’t always happen. I’m not an advocate for violence, in fact I think it’s one of the worse choices. But bullies don’t speak civilised languages; the only way is to either earn their respect or make them fear you. \n\nYou have to fight back. You have to make sure they leave you alone. Hell, you’ll probably be beaten up the moment you returned punches. The ugly truth is you’ll probably be suspended and your bullies wouldn’t. But you have to make it so that bullying you becomes a chore than entertainment. \n\nI’m sorry this happened to you.

prettyatoms,nx8ok1,[rant] am i just introverted or what idk what’s going on,2021-06-11 13:54:12,SGExams,77673,5,14,"tw: self harm??

idk where i want this post to go but idk whether i should be seeking help or anything and if you have any advice for me, feel free! 

so this started somewhere around last year with feelings of inadequacy and a lot of other emotions i cannot put into words but i just feel like i’m never good enough and i’m aware that many other students experience this as well. i think i let my feelings of inadequacy take over me and my actions in both academic life and cca. no matter how good my results are i just feel inadequate no matter what position i get in cca i feel like i’m not good enough for that role and i end up lacking. i’ve now stepped down from my cca and i feel like i didn’t do enough with the big role i was given and yeah. SYF was also this year and i guess i just felt very stressed out by it and ended up resorting to self harm as a coping mechanism. i feel like i wasn’t good enough for my role and others thought so as well. and then my term 1 results were also not ideal and i let that affect my emotions a lot and even though i say i’m over it but i’m not??? 

now SYF is over and my results have improved tremendously and i just feel numb and emotionless. i still have self harm thoughts and i should add that my school teachers found out about my sh and i never wanted them to find out but when one of them did i really thought i had someone to talk to and seek help from but she said she would “follow up” then never did. i was tossed between 2 different teachers and both of them acted like nothing happened after that? idk it kinda invalidated my feelings and made me a feel like a burden at the same time?? in between lessons i would just get the urge to go somewhere else and harm myself and then go back to class like nothing happened 

i just feel quite restless and i have also talked less in school and i don’t enjoy social interaction that much anymore. whenever people text me now i just feel restless like i don’t want to talk even though they’re my friends and i have this habit of ghosting people and i know that it’s not a good thing and i shouldn’t do it but idk what to do??

not everything is explained here and maybe it’s quite vague but if u have been through something like this or can offer advice, please do",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nx8ok1/rant_am_i_just_introverted_or_what_idk_whats/,"['do you have any close friends or someone you can trust and open up to? i feel that that’s really important. also, with regards to your teachers, perhaps they are just “following up” bcos it’s their job and i’m sure you can tell if their insincere which is disappointing so i’d suggest speaking to other teachers you might be close with or your school’s counsellor. i’ve had a very close friend of mine who went through something similar to you, it helped him when he opened up to us and went for regular counselling sessions. counselling may seem like a place where only ‘troubled’ students went, but i wish to remove this stigma as i feel that it can really help you, at least it worked for me friends and i. \n\nfrom what i read i personally think you’re rather overwhelmed at this time, perhaps it would be good to take a break (whether it’s alone or with close friends) from work and school.', 'OP, you sound like you have [imposter syndrome](https://www.verywellmind.com/imposter-syndrome-and-social-anxiety-disorder-4156469).', 'I hv no advice to give regarding this but maybe you should write out the full words of ""tw: sh"".

Meowdyn,n3vmev,[Rant][JC]Should I actually see the school counselor?,2021-05-03 21:09:48,SGExams,77673,12,60,"TW:Potential depression, mentions of self harm(not really tbh)/suicidal thoughts,panic attack,childhood trauma,mild swearing

Sorry yea this gonna be a bit hard to piece together cause all my thoughts are a mess but I really need advice on this.Im also not diagnosed so I can't specifically say I am depressed or having panic attacks but it's the closest I can describe it.Sorry again.

Since JC started,so much has happened,not even sure how my CT(basically a form teacher) linked my ""lack of interest"" into involving the year head and vice principal trying to ""stop me from committing suicide"" or some shit like that.Im tired of constantly trying to prove to them that I won't try anything but they keep assuming I will.Currently I have to see the assistant year head every Friday to show that I'm still alive and not self-harming(I don't self harm).I can't let my abusive parents know about any of this either cause they are one of the problems that made me like this.

So yea recently what happened(like last Monday) is the assistant year head asking me to meet her somewhere else instead of the concourse but instead it kind of fucked me up.Locking me inside a room,trying to force me to sign this agreement stating not to self harm but I have to see the counselor.Not sure why,but seeing the counselor requires parental consent,which isn't something I want, obviously.Despite my repeated attempts to tell her I won't sign it because of that specific part(where parental consent is needed),she insisted that I was ""threatening"" her for making it sound as if ""if you make me sign this agreement I'll kill myself""(that's what she assumed and said that I actually said that,mild gaslighting tbh) but basically yea I couldn't take it anymore and had a panic attack so she gave up and let me leave.In the end I basically rejected signing the agreement so she thinks I still self harm.(I still don't)

Anyways yea last Friday I still met her cause I didn't want any trouble and she tried to push her agreement for me to sign but at that point I just told her to drop it and she eventually did but still encouraged me to see the school counselor.According to her I could see them at least once without parental consent but I'm not sure if I should take her offer cause of how she hurt me emotionally and I don't know whether to trust her.

(I should put this in another rant but like eh simplified)Ngl I'm getting burnt out because every break I have is wasted seeing either the year head,assistant year head to prove I'm not dead or subject tutors for consultation(I'm meeting more others than just my current subject tutors because I need that help) and all my homework is overdue at this point and I don't understand anything already except that I have to stop anyone from contacting my parents.

I can't get diagnosed because getting a diagnosis requires parents/turning 19 and being a minor I don't want to take that risk.Teachers don't know about my family situation either.I don't have friends to talk to in school.

I don't want y'all to chide me that it's cause I act depressed that's why they notice or give me reasons why they would think I would kill myself.(Ive already heard that from my classmates so many times)
I don't need solutions on how to tell her to stop talking to me because I wouldn't apply them anyways when I'm scared and I'll just make everything worse.
I just want to know should I take her advice and see the counselor once? I'm scared of parents knowing or even leaving a permanent record,but I know I really need the help.

I'll answer whatever questions you have because I can't cover everything here tbh.Just don't be hurtful please,I'm reaching my limit.

Side note uh:anyone from JPJC?idk I need ur insight better cause what dafuq is wrong with the teachers here

Edit:My life has fucked up.Year head called my parents to ask them to sign the parental consent form to send me for counseling(which they obviously would disagree).My parents want to talk to me when I get back,I am going to die when I get back fuck.Im having a literal panic attack I hate this it's supposed to be SYF today and I'm just here dying inside

angrychestnuts,mebofu,[Rant] No Friends in JC,2021-03-27 19:06:19,SGExams,77673,40,150,"TW: suicide, self-harm

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA i just wanna end it all :"")

Hey folks almost 17F here, didn't do too well for o levels after I tried to kms last year ahahaha but I ended up doing slightly better than prelims and went into a mid tier JC? (I think Im not sure)

I used to be pretty extroverted in sec school I think, since all my friends were in my class I could vibe pretty well with everyone. But my sec school was a pretty close knited girls school and most of my classmates were with me since primary school. My best friend went to the same JC as me but she ended up in science stream while I went to arts. We still go to school in the morning together though and shes a huge emotional support in my life and I love her more than anything.

Ive always struggled with various suicidal thoughts and ??depression?? (Dont wanna self diagnose) since like 12. But after I went to JC its gotten worse. I have virtually no close friends. Seriously, I barely have friends. For the first month of JC I basically ate alone and just called my long distance boyfriend during breaks. I have bad anxiety when talking to new people without anyone familiar with me, and when some of my classmates suddenly asked to sit with me I literally just froze like 👁👄👁

I kinda managed to get into a group of like 5-6ish people that I think are my friends? But like I dont really know any of them that well, heck I dont think I even know their full names :)

Ive had a few breakdowns throughout JC1 this year and 😫 literally no one gave a fuck :"") it was really humbling when I was hugging my knees crying in PE because my dad yelled at me for feeling sick and wanting to not do PE for that day and a few of my classmates stared at me, made eye contact, and went back to talking with each other. I left early after class and then everyone, including my friend group, stayed back and took group photos with each other. Not a single person who saw asked me if I was doing alright or how I was, nor did they message me. I know they saw me crying because they literally stared at me while I was hyperventilating on the bleachers.

Another time, a lot more recent, I felt incredibly suicidal and my desire to kill myself just maxed out and I started having a mini stress attack in class. My two friends sit next to me and they were focusing on class while I self harmed very lightly with limited options to use. During break, I hugged my closest friend tightly and told the kids in my friend group thanks for being my friend. They did seem rather worried but as I ran off without a word, they all just kind of left to go eat and have fun as per usual. I went to buy a pair of scissors and yknow, the rest can be inferred.

I found my sec school best friend in the hallway, I just lept onto her and hugged her and starting sobbing. I feel so lonely in class all the time I dont understand how I can be such a failure of a human being to not even make 1 friend whod care about me enough to ask me if I was okay after i cry infront of them after like 2 months with this class.

I just wish someone cared about me there. When I returned to class an hour late, no one asked where I was, in fact I dont even think they noticed I wasnt there. Even if I died in that one hour I was gone, they wouldnt even care that theyd never see me again. I know its my fault for not reaching out and getting to know people, but I am legitimately trying my best in my own way and I just dont know how to keep on going.

I just want friends. Everyone told me how JC friends are like your lifelong friends but I cant even make a single friend, let alone lifelong ones. I really think that theres something wrong with me, if I cant make any friends that really care at all. I dont get it, I can make them laugh and I can hang out with them, but why dont they care enough to check up on me?

It really feels like everyone would be fine with or without me. Often I feel like Id be better off dead, that I should have succeeded in dying last year. Talking with my family is terrible too, everything I say is intrepreted as disrespect or me being a horrible child.

It really just feels like Im living for no reason, going to school every day to see the same group of people that wouldnt even bat an eye at the news of my death. I really wish that at least 1 person could have just smiled at me reassuringly when I was crying. No matter what happens and how hard I try, I just cant make friends in this class, in this school.

I have severe anxiety and depression since I was young and I also didn’t have much support from friends throughout the years. I wasn’t v close to my family either so I understand the pain you are feeling. \n\nWhat I can advise to you rn might be counterintuitive to you right now, but it’s gotta be accepting of the situation you’re in. Yep, you have to accept that you might not have friends in JC, accept that you will be in this situation for a while, accept that things might not go the way you want and accept that things might take a long time to get better. After accepting only do you get better and start to take some kind of actions to address your issue.\n\nI’m not gonna tell you to “love yourself” or say everything is gonna get better because it doesnt rlly help most of the time if you’re convinced that your life is shitty. I understand things are really difficult for you and from my experience, acceptance is the true and only way to get better in the first place.\n\nIf things are really hard, share with your friend about the issue, I’m sure they are able and willing to understand the situation. As for your family, try to share with your closest member if possible. If the people in JC aren’t able to provide the kind of support you need, you can jus send me a pm here and I will do my best to give you the support you need :)', 'Hi, i\'m so sorry you\'re feeling this way, but i just wanna say that its super brave of you to share your thoughts in this platform :) i\'d say that this means you don\'t want to end it all, you just want to end your suffering. \n\nPlease please do not equate your worth to your ability to make friends, i\'m sure it feels sucky to not receive the care that you are looking for from the people around you. If it is of any help, after reading this post i do care about you. But not only me, your best friend must care about you as well. If you dont tell her how you\'re feeling she\'s never gonna know, so please do her and yourself a favour by reaching out and telling her about how you\'re feeling. \n\nI really do hope i can give you a big hug, if your harmful thoughts dont get any better please seek professional help. I can link you up with some of the resources i have, i hope you\'ll feel better soon, nobody deserves to feel this way :"") My dms are open if you need to talk more dont worry!', '> Everyone told me how JC friends are like your lifelong friends\n\nDont think thats really true.

Its really awesome that you got your best friend in the same school and you travel together. Not everyone is luck enough to have that. Heck I didnt even know a single person whos in the JC or going to the same JC as me! Really keep her close because I personally think that secondary school friends really have a way better chance at becoming lifelong friends and since you are already really close to her its really good!\n\n>Ive had a few breakdowns throughout JC1 this year and 😫 literally no one gave a fuck :"")\n\nIts ok, this might sound a bit sad but like from what I know, not a lot of students in Singapore are like open and willing to help people they dont really know. Plus, u are not the only one having breakdowns in JC1 lol. If u visit this subreddit enough you will see a lot of other J1s just like you and personally Im no exception. JC life is really hell and I have no one to rant to because nobody Im close to is even in my school. In fact, most of them end up in my dream school which Im unable to enter. For now, just focus on getting through your JC life and hold your seccondary school friends close.\n\nJC life is painful and all but always remember that time is on your side. Every minute of pain u feel in JC is one less minute in your whole JC life.

Even though many of my ex school mates went to the same school, some r in the same class as me, I caught myself becoming more and more introverted.\n\nExtroverts like us feel drained when we dont have social interactions. Especially if you have depression and you\'re used to breaking down in an inclusive Secondary girls school. What I\'ve been trying to do is find my source energy through my CCAs and my parents. After all, jc is 2 years of your life it\'s kinda hard to forge life long bonds during that short period of time. \n\nThis may sound backwards but the end goal of JC is to do well in A levels. Focussing on school work and working towards that goal really helped me to be more confident in being alone, since I can say ""I\'m going to mug"". And nobody can judge you for wanting to score straight As instead of hanging out. Plus you have loyal and lifelong friends already. Keeping in touch with them will really help to get rid the feeling of emptiness and loneliness. \n\nI hope I\'ve been able to help you. Just know, you\'re not alone.

It might not be true that they don't care about you.\n\nLet me ask you a few questions, and think about them:\n\nWhat is it about friendships which is so essential? Why are you so depressed without friends?\n\nIt is definitely possible to survive with just a few friends, or even alone. If you feel lonely, just occupy yourself with something you enjoy, or maybe studying a particular subject that you really like."", ""You are worth it, even if your new classmates don't seem to care for whatever reasons, it isnt true that you don't matter. Its probably a bit ironic that it's coming from me, but don't tie your self worth to your ability to fit in and how others perceive you, because those two things can change from day to day, and are very subjective to who you are with, so they are very elusive goals to chase after\n\nI know all this is much easier said than done though haha, and Im not in the same position as you to be able to say that I understand your pain. Plus your family members also sound pretty terrible, and I'm sorry that that's what you had to grow up with.\n\nIn a nutshell, we want to support you, and truly wish the best for you. The pain you feel is awful and you shouldn't have to be put through that. With that said, this pain doesn't have to last forever, and I hope things get better for you :)\n\n\nEdit:\nAnd try to keep even closer contact to your Secondary school friends, it sounds like you are wayyyyyy more comfortable with them around, so call them, meet up with them, anything that yall can do with each other\n\nI also apologise in advance if any part of my comment is insensitive in some shape or form, if it is you can tell me and I'll correct it"", 'Honestly, I have no advice for your current situation. Personally I am more of a introverted type of person and I am also not a JC student ( starting poly this year ) so I can’t empathise with your situation . However, I had been my been through my own set of hard times and I want u to understand that  u only get one chance at life  ( as far as we can observe, idk if ur religious but I still stand by my point ). Don’t let how others treat u or how others think of u , make u lose your one chance at life , your life is worth more than that .                                                                 \nUr current classmates may not care about u , and sometimes life be like that , some people just don’t get along for example personally i fine extrovert people ‘harder’ to  interact with .Interacting with people tire me out in general so classmates or friends who are extroverted sometimes make me feel exhausted , but I don’t think bad of them by any means they just drain my energy away so it hard for me to become close with them (not saying it is impossible am always open to changing).Or some of them may be just bad people .  However u still have plenty of chances to meet people after JC , when u attend Uni  or when u enter the workforce , ur life have just started , u have so much time left on this horrible but simultaneously beautiful world , it won’t be alway smooth sailing but hey we should enjoy feeling anything when we can cause who knows if we will ever get to feel anything again when we have to go to sleep for a eternity.

As someone else mentioned in their reply, please do not equate your ability to make friends with your self worth. I had a lonely JC life and some of my classmates did not like me for some reason or other (i.e. I’d find out that the whole class was invited to a party except for a handful of people and I am always in the handful). Focusing on a goal which was to do well for the A levels helped immensely. I focused on studying hard and eventually topped my class. Over 15 years later, looking back, the 2 years passed really fast and my lifelong friends currently are mainly from Uni. Hugs and I hope that things will be better for you. Study hard!', 'Tw: suicide, self-harm\n\nHi OP, I read through your whole post and your experience was kinda similar to mine. I graduated from sec sch with pretty good results but I decided to go to a school where I knew NONE of my sec school friends would go to and regretted it dearly. I was from a girls school all my life and hence I was VERY VERY loud and clueless about everything. Coupled with being an international student, just about everyone hated me because they thought I was weird or thought I was faking my accent, to the point I was bullied for it. And everyone was extremely toxic and it was quite frankly the worst experience of my life. I felt so alone even with the few friends I had because I didn\'t feel like I could talk to anyone about it. My best friend from sec sch unfortunately committed suicide while I was in JC too and I because of the toxic environment, I was fearful of talking about it to my friends. My home life was not any better, with said guardians and housemates telling me to ""kill myself if I had the guts to""\n\nI attempted suicide a lot of times (13 times to be exact) throughout my JC life too. And almost everyday I would self-harm (something that I had been doing since I was 13) which also meant bad grades and low attendance because I was either warded into IMH or having appointments or just had such a bad breakdown i couldn\'t bring myself to go to school. Even in school I would disappear during classes because of anxiety attacks and would constantly cry to my teacher every day because i felt so alone. \n\nBut looking back now, I eventually found a group of friends who\'ve stuck by me. It was only in my last year of JC that I became good friends with them, previously I had a good friend who constantly said I was faking my mental illness for attention and laughing at me whenever I felt an anxiety attack coming on. So OP, it takes time. It really does. It\'s only your 2nd month of JC, so cut yourself some slack. \n\nIt sounds like you\'re really really struggling so I suggest you seek help too! Halfway through jc I realized I really needed help and just walked into a random doctor\'s office to tell her I need help. It was the hardest thing I\'ve ever done in my life frankly, but I dont regret it. I\'m currently on various medications and I\'m going for regular therapy sessions, and I really do see an improvement in my condition. I\'m now 4 months clean from self-harm, when it used to be a daily thing not too long ago.\n\nI\'m so glad you\'re talking about it on reddit and you probably have lots of comments and DMs to read. But my DMs are ALWAYS open! If you need someone to rant to, you can come to me. If you\'d like, I can even give you my telegram so that you can call me when you feel like things are too much, I\'ll try to answer as much as I can. Please know you are not alone, and as cliche, things will get better. It might not feel this way, and even i felt that way just over 4 months ago but it will. Trust the process. \n\nSending you love and hugs 🐻 Feel free to hmu any time alright?', ' Fuck it. Talk to me', 'Ayo don’t try and Kill yourself no more\nSo many stuff to do in life don’t trip over the little stuff aite just cry it off and live do it for yourself cuh who knows you’ll make so many friends in the future', ""Tons o awesome folks dispensed their good advices and opinions.   \nI won't add more  other than you have me prayers and spiritual jia-yo aite!

3 years ago today, I stepped into my JC to receive my A-Level results - avoiding my teachers’ gazes as I knew how much of a disappointment I’d be.

It’s a cliché fall from grace story.

I was fortunate to enter the Integrated Programme at a “top JC” after PSLE. Without O-Levels, we spent the first 4 years doing things out of the usual curriculum, all while maintaining my (almost) straight As. Life was good! I loved going to school, and most importantly, I developed a calling in sec 4: Medicine.

Then JC came.

For whatever reason, something changed. I was always sad, staring into space, slept a lot. As a nursing student, I recognize now that I was in full-blown depression - self-harming, suicidal, and honestly just done. The school toilets became my safe space to breathe (hyperventilate!) and cry in. I didn’t seek help, refusing to believe it was serious, didn’t wanna burden my parents.

My grades dipped to Es, Ss and Us in JC1. Still, I threw myself into things I loved - science research, and my CCA: astronomy 🔭 

Long story short: I didn’t have the time nor the mental capacity to pull up my grades. I flunked the A-Levels. People talked. “How can someone who went to ISEF score so badly” 🤮🤮🤮 

I was so ashamed, I apologized to my teachers profusely for my grades. The amalgamation of mine, others’, and society’s expectations weighed heavily on me. It was so toxic. And devastatingly, I couldn’t apply for Medicine.

But!!!

Fast forward 3 years later, here I am: in a field, course, and profession that I’m absolutely head over heels about 🥺😩♥️

And sis am I thriving. I’m a consistent Dean’s Lister (top 5% of my cohort), I use my knowledge and skills to take care of my parents, I started a healthcare education page (@nursesays), and I ENJOY every moment of it ✨

‼️ YOUR GRADES DO NOT DEFINE YOU. YOU DO. ‼️

Honestly, this time of your life will be so, so confusing. Depending on your grades, you may not know what to do. Maybe you scored well. Too well. Or you scored too badly. You don’t even know if you can enter any uni. But it gets better, as long as you take steps forward, trust me.

Not everyone is cut out to score in H2 Math (I certainly wasn’t), but I found my place. Do what you have to do in order to do that. If you already know what you want to do, and you can’t see yourself anywhere else, GO FOR IT. Even if you have to retake A Levels, or go to a private uni, or take a gap year, or whatever.

For those who scored super well and are thinking of doing a “more prestigious” course like Med/Law, when another “more mediocre” course is really in your heart, think again. Because it’ll be hard to turn back if regret sets in.

Please, find your place, go into something you love, and you’ll find a way to excel in it and be joyful while doing it. Don’t let the toxicity of society’s expectations snuff out your light💡

damstereiw1,mghz49,I think my friend is being abused by her Foster parents - is there a way to make a report?,2021-03-30 23:01:04,singapore,378762,8,45,"TW self harm, abuse

Hi, I have a sec 4 friend that is in a Foster family.

She has a history of self-harm/PTSD trauma and frequently gets flashbacks and has a habit of cutting herself whenever she faces stress.

However her parents seem to be worsening her problems by doing many questionable things like 
- hitting her
- refusing to let her have a voice and shutting her out when she tries to communicate her distress
- blaming her for just about everything
- keeping her to strict bedtimes and curfews and cutting off her free time, but then blaming her when she finds herself with no time to get things done

And as a result my friend has been self harming even more and suggesting suicide recently

Essentially, I feel extremely worried and helpless because from my perspective all I can do is watch as my friend dies.

Her therapists, according to her, are not really in a position go convince her parents to be more forgiving, and getting medicine will not happen so soon. However, my friend's situation is urgent.

So I'm thinking of gathering evidence to make a report.

I have some questions: does this qualify as child abuse? What kind of evidence do I need and who do I report it to?

Thanks.

EDIT: it doesn't seem easy to gather evidence because 1. Her phones audio recording is broken and 2. Her parents refuses to let her get a new phone/fix her current phone.

Recently started self harm with an sog to help myself cope as well as having suicidal thoughts so my parents brought me to a polyclinic to seek help for me during first bookout

Polyclinic doctor said that they dont treat saf personnel but also found history of depression in my medical records wrote mo a memo recommending an instant ooc and referral to imh

Mo excused me from firearms live firing grenade explosives and sharp objects so i got my sog confiscated

However i am still forced to continue with training and it is really stressing me out. I went to the orientation officer in the meantime as i thought that he could give me tips on how to cope but all he keeps reiterating are the three A’s

I recently started hearing voices in my head encouraging me to commit suicide but i just shut it out and continue on with training

Its been about 3 days of intense pt and force prep and tekan sessions and i think im on my last straw already and might snap anytime

owlcovesg,j59xj4,[Rant] Adam Khoo and his courses.,2020-10-05 08:37:51,SGExams,77673,104,848,"*TW: Suicide, mental illness, ASD references.*

A few years ago, I went for an Adam Khoo motivational course. The experience was exhilarating, and I found myself at the end of it all inspired to turn over a new leaf and to do extremely well; but as time went on I began to realise how *unhelpful* the lessons were. Not only were the lessons unhelpful, but they were also *damaging* to one's motivation and mental health.

The trainers, having no experience in psychology, didn't know anything about mental health. Yet, they spoke with confidence on how to deal with mental illnesses. Khoo himself has pseudoscientific and naive views of mental illness, claiming that ""if you believe that you are clinical (sic) depressed, that mere thought will stimulate chemicals in your brain that will continue to make you feel depressed."" (1) His brand of coaching relies on a pseudoscience called neuro-linguistic programming, (2) a psychotherapeutic methodology that has little evidence to support it. (3)

At the course, my first experience with people with mental illnesses came when I met an old classmate who had Autism. (a) Vaguely, I recall that the one of the student-trainers remarked that there was 'at least one every year.' My second experience came during a group-sharing session, where we had to share with our cohorts our personal issues in a sort of group-therapy. A girl (b) decided to share, and she talked about how she had self-harmed on some occasions. At one point, she was about to attempt suicide before a friend talked her out of it. (c)

Then, the trainer replied. First, he talked about suicide, calling it a 'stupid' and 'selfish' act. He talked about how she had family that loved her and how killing herself would hurt her family deeply. Second, he talked about self-harm. He shared about his experience with a student who regularly self-harmed, who often 'pretended' to hide their scars, who was obviously 'attention-seeking'. His advice on self-harm was to slice chicken instead of flesh. 

She laughed at the quips and the anecdotes. We all did. Looking back, however, the jokes didn't help her get over her suicidal ideation, and the anecdote on attention-seeking was dismissive and insulting. More importantly, she didn't *learn anything*, not a new technique to cope with their problems nor a reason to stop self-harming. Neither was she referred to other resources to help her with her problems. In the end, it all came down to a *joke*. (d)

\~

So far, I've only talked about Khoo's (and his trainers') approach towards mental health. To reiterate, Khoo and his trainers do not have any proper training in psychology but in a pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP). To give you a sense of what NLP is, practitioners believe that they can tell if people are lying just by looking at their eyes. (They can't.) (4) This willingness to believe in pseudoscience transfers directly over to Khoo's teaching methodology. His advice on studying and motivation is either platitudinous or faulty.

For the most part, the advice is platitudinous. Even Dr Barbara Oakley, a professor in education, asks Khoo to ""go beyond platitudes and just go straight to what goes on in real everyday life"" in an interview. (5) If you want to know what a lesson by Khoo is like, a video on YouTube entitled 'Adam Khoo - How to Condense Information - learn how to read fast and effectively' is a good example. In thirteen minutes, Khoo ironically states what could be said in two-or-three minutes: longform text is not very good for revision as it contains a lot of descriptive language; making summary notes with diagrams is better. 

Some advice stands on shaky ground. Khoo believes in speed-reading, which has little empirical evidence to support its purported benefits. (7) He also promotes the idea of learning types (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile learners), which is again pseudoscientific and which has been criticised by Dr Oakley. (8) (9) .

Every piece of advice he gives, however dubious, is in his *I Am Gifted* book too, so there really is no need to spend thousands of dollars on the course.

**TLDR: Don't go for Adam Khoo courses. They aren't helpful; they are bad.** If you want study tips, Drs Barbara Oakley and Terence Sejnowski have two online courses on them: [Learning How to Learn](https://www.coursera.org/learn/learning-how-to-learn) and [Mindshift](https://www.coursera.org/learn/mindshift). If you want help with motivation or mood, Dr David Burns has a book on cognitive behavioural therapy, [Feeling Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feeling_Good:_The_New_Mood_Therapy). And, if you want help with mental illness, you might want to consider psychiatry and/or psychotherapy.

(a) I had known the classmate since primary school, and it was known that he had Autism at the time. Back then, the term Autism Spectrum Disorder was not in use, and I believe that Autism would have been the official diagnosis. I also note that some consider Autism to be a neurodevelopment disorder rather than a mental illness.

(b) I portrayed the actual person as a girl so I could refer to them with a feminine pronoun and to the trainer with a masculine pronoun. The gender used is not indicative of identity.

(c) Although I only met two people who had so-called mental illnesses or mental disorders, I suspect that many more students are sent to such courses. I realise now that some parents sent their children to Adam Khoo because they are afraid of acknowledging that their children might need help. That's why we have 'enrichment' centres—your child is being *enriche*d instead of being *helped*.

And in the anti-psychiatric society we live in, parents would rather spend thousands of dollars on pseudoscience than let their children seek psychiatry or psychotherapy. They're scared of thinking that there might be something wrong with them or their child. Khoo would never *label* your child with a mental illness. In his eyes, we are *gifted*, after all.

(d) Tony Robbins, incidentally, has a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k_YqsqJBUfw) where he 'saves' a suicidal man. Robbins doesn't actually save the man, nor does he help him in any real, tangible way. All he did was tell a joke and make a the man smile. Some may be inclined to believe that making a suicidal person smile, 'breaking their depressed state' can help them out of suicide, but it really doesn't. It doesn't teach them how to better cope with their problems in living, nor does it address their mental health, nor does it address any potentially organic causes of such a mood. Robbins is, incidentally, an NLP practitioner.

**Addendum: Adam Khoo and Health**

I've talked a lot about Khoo's pseudoscientific beliefs in mental health, which leads me to question his beliefs in other aspects of health. For instance, he believes that [cancer can be cured through ""the power of the mind.""](https://www.adam-khoo.com/91/congratulations-to-my-mum-for-getting-her-book-published/) Why then, was Khoo a [director of the Health Promotion Board from 2009-2011](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamkhoo/)? And why did the Ministry of Education grant a [tender on sexual health education to his company in 2015 and 2017](https://opengovsg.com/corporate/200721495D)? One can only hope Khoo and his company are more scientific when it comes to other aspects of health.

During P6, I remember the instructor shouting at us as he was unhappy with something. That gave me a bad impression and I was very bored with mindmap and stuff. The mindmap worked for some time but alas, it didn't work after a while.\n\nIn Secondary 4 and 5, Adam Khoo once again came for the motivation workshop. All I can say is that I did not learn anything useful.\n\nI learnt way more things for motivation through TEDTalks. Some of them are really inspirational.\n\nMOE's tender is indeed questionable."", 'i’ve never attended adam khoo’s courses but i really appreciate this well thought out and cohesive rant, supported by ample evidence. it’s a very satisfying read and substantiates your points well. thank u OP :)', ""This seems worrying.

Should ~~report~~ forward this to MOE_"", ""I absolutely agree with this post and it's contents. As a person who has been coerced to attend one of Adam Khoo's courses due to poor performance in school, I can testify to the accuracy of this statement. I was a mere 12 years old when I attended this programme, and reluctantly went for it as my parents believed it would benefit a childish adolescent who was scoring badly in school. Indeed, the course relied on various motivational speeches to excite the youths around me, and included cliche activities such as the ability to cross a suspended wooden plank whilst blindfolded because you 'believed in yourself'. \n\nAdam Khoo himself appeared once and gave an hour-long speech about how he once struggled in studies but rakes in millions today. After the talk, he never appeared during the remaining entirety of the programme except for the graduation, and this speaks volumes about how dedicated he is to the running of these lucrative programmes. Costing thousands of dollars just to sign a child up, the man himself only appeared once throughout the whole three-day programme. Doesn't this seem fishy? The rest of the instructors weren't particularly sincere or effective either.\n\nAdditionally, I was disgusted at certain activities and speeches during the event. One of the instructors hurled vulgarities during his speech/scolding in a half-hearted attempt to motivate a seminar room of 13-16 year olds, and forced us to hold a mirror in front of us while shouting at us to force us to literally reflect upon ourselves. I vividly remember the instructor shouting angrily at us to 'wake up' and to 'stop disappointing everyone around you'. I believe the scolding can be done at home, what was the point of this at all?\n\nI believe the programme was ineffective and an absolute waste of thousands of dollars. So this should serve as a precautionary message to any parents out there who may be thinking of enrolling their children into one of Adam Khoo's motivational courses in a bid to improve their studies. Just don't. Save the money for tuition instead, I believe it's definitely more effective. After all the onus is up to the child on whether or not he/she wants to study, if the child doesn't understand the importance of grades then why would a three-day camp miraculously inculcate such values in him/her? Please rethink your choices before foolishly throwing thousands away to support the notoriously-wealthy Adam Khoo."", ""This just reminds me of some classes that I took at Mindchamps, which spent many hours communicating what could've been condensed into a few minutes (learn visually... with mindmaps!). \n\nI'll never forget how the big motivational exercise when you finish Mindchamps is supposed to involve miraculously breaking a sheet of wood (in a sort of mind over matter way). But on the day this was supposed to happen, one of the instructors accidentally snapped a whole STACK of that wood in half with barely any strength. We all laughed, especially when they spent the next half hour hyping us up to breaking that supposedly hard wood.\n\nGod, the study / tuition industry here is such a scam when it comes to these get smart quick techniques."", 'Saw a reddit comment where the user shared his story during his time with Adam Khoo trainers where they came to his sch and had those workshops.\n\n\nSo his trainer tried to push the class harder to do for the PSLE by making them imagine where both the students parents are dying and the child have to study hard for their PSLE just for them', 'Lmao I went for this math Olympiad Adam khoo workshop and the chers were so unmotivated.

That student failed tho"", 'i actually went for his $1000 course last year and tbh it had no long-lasting effects but i never told my parents this bc i dont want them to feel like they wasted their $. his courses are a failed attempt at being fun and captivating, and he emphasises SO MUCH on the mindmap concept (personally i learn better from textbks or notes) that it just undermines the other learning techniques (aka normal classrm method) and for those who cant draw mindmaps or cant learn with mindmaps, its extremely boring. his speed reading technique as mentioned by OP is pretty useless bc i read to understand not read to memorise words im gonna forget in 5mins. the course also required us to set goals and work towards them by walking on a suspended log that the trainers would kick (the kicking was representative of the challenges we face) and basically we had to walk across the log to reach our ""goal"". the whole activity is tasteless and did nothing to motivate me, not to add that one guy from my group fell and bled. he was crying alot and was visibly shaken, i felt rlly bad for him bc the trainers clearly pushed him TOO FAR with little concern for his wellbeing. i really regret wasting my parents $ going for the course, only thing i did there was make friends\n\nworst thing was, the whole 4 days of the course, adamn khoo didnt show up. not once. total waste of money bc they get all these ppl apparently coached by the Adam khoo himself to teach u but he isnt even there LOL.', 'amazing post; a lot of these so called ""learning courses"",  ""quick memory"" are mostly just pseudoscience without much evidence. im not well read enough to provide enough sources for credible details or these so called ""gurus"", but I\'d advise anyone interested in these courses to research well and read deeply into the program, before getting sucked into the program. :)', 'What disgusts me even more is that I’m seeing Adam Khoo advertisements popping up on YouTube regarding some investment/trading courses he’s offering.

That’s when I knew “Mr Leeroy Jenkins” and the whole Adam Khoo posse were lying the whole time...', ""Let's be real about Adam Khoo's instructors.\n\nThey were recruited in Secondary School, they undergo a training program to be facilitators and they just need an additional step (getting approved by MOE) to begin 'teaching' or facilitating. I have a lot of friends who are in this program, who knows nothing about psychology and only goes for the events for the reimbursements or for the hype to know more people... \n\nI totally agree with you that Adam Khoo's trainers are very inexperienced especially in the field of Mental Illnesses and they might not be as empathetic as you would expect them to be. However, let's not forget that they are people too, and they were never taught how to handle such issues in public. (Can you imagine someone talking about being suicidal in front of the whole class but you have to quickly change the topic but not ignore the person? It's not something easy to do!) \n\nI'm in no way supporting what the instructors did to your ex-classmate. But we should understand why the instructors are acting in certain ways ( they are also teenagers who aren't fully matured yet ). \n\nNonetheless, i totally agree with you regarding how Adam Khoo should re-look its process of hiring trainers/facilitators or look into having more training on the dos and don'ts especially with regards to sensitive issues, not limited to mental health. Other issues such sexism, racism should also be taken seriously by Adam Khoo!"", 'I remember going for an Adam Khoo workshop. Literally just that we were playing scissors paper stone with rubber band as bets.', ""Back in secondary school, I was sent to one of these workshops (with my parents' and teachers' adamancy). Really, really hated it. Most distinct memory from that workshop was them asking us to close our eyes and imagining our parents on their deathbeds."", 'dragging adam khoo course  \n\n\nI love it.

No\n\nalso i just realised that some subreddits have understanding dudes, so I might as well get this out of my system. im takin o levels too xd\n\nBack when my classmates and I were sec 2, the would-be CCA leaders were sent to a \'leadership camp\', just to mentally prepare us to take over leadership roles (fuck you, whoever printed the form and didn\'t put the option to opt out).\n\nFirst day, trainers were already giving us an earful for having five different standards of \'neat\' because people from the same classes (5 classes, 2 express and 3 NA) sorted out the bags as a class. Looked well organised, but nope. Kena fucking tekan by the trainers. The head trainer was especially guai lan. Loudmouthed piece of shit. End of the day, \'lesson learned\'. Sort bags together as one group.\n\nSecond day, more or less the same. Third day, we were given a task of working together. Doesn\'t matter how long it took. If we finish it, we can go hone straight away.\n\nWe were split into three categories. Gladiators (doing tons of exercises for like, five to six hours straight? The only break given to them were the lunch break at 12 o\'clock), scholars (basically finding information within a stack of newspapers. For every answer we get correct, the gladiators run to where they think the puzzle pieces were. Find as many as they can within a set amout of time before we get to set them free again with a correct answer. I was in this group and the trainers there were guilt-tripping us because we were the reason those \'gladiators\' were still running around finding puzzle pieces.) and the debators (argue, argue and argue. after argue then they have to talk to the worst group member that was apparently giving the most negative vibes. Somehow I ended up being that asshat dragging everyone\'s mood down, so they gave me \'tips on how to be a better person\')\n\nAfter about five hours of solving 5 questions and being labelled with ignominy, I nearly lost my shit and told my teammates, of course within earshot of the head trainer, to ignore the trainers, as they weren\'t helping at all. First time in my secondary school years, I acted out a bit. good boy since primary 5. Head instructor came over. Lo and behold, scolding lor. Pulled the ""you not interested, get out lah"" card. Obviously sec 2 me was mortified, because I felt like I lost face in front of my group mates. Went to the toilet with my phone (no phones were allowed. They didn\'t know I had one with me because I didn\'t keep mine in my bag like everyone did. Idiots never did some sort of inventory check) and researched the last 5 answers to carry the group.\n\nEveryone went home happy, or so they thought xd. Half of us, who weren\'t looking for excuses to get out of the house, left feeling displeased. Obviously I was one of them. The only takeaway was that Adam Khoo programmes don\'t really help. I listened to what they had to offer, since we weren\'t gonna get out of the place for from 0730 to 1730, three days straight. Style of leadership I used as a CCA chairman worked better than what they tried to teach us.\n\nI kinda felt down because my precious time was wasted. Could\'ve studied for sec 3, ya know. Had another bullshit course at sec 4 on how to study, obviously paitao\'d it. Had enough of those stupid mindmaps and speed reading. Memorising isn\'t understanding. These certificates only prove to be useful in the Early Admission Exercise, where you show the interviewers how much you went through to get to the course.\n\n\nLooking back, as ironic as it may sound, it\'s one of the memorable moments in secondary school cuz we all hated the trainers. This school is probably one of the shittiest ones but I wanna leave it on a positive note. I\'m still not going back for teachers\' day though. I still hate secondary school.\n\nalso, i think i sound like a brat, but im grateful for being accepted into the education system of singapore. im a foreigner, so uh yeah. i get the \'if you dont like it here, go tf home\' message a lot if i complain even for a bit. i pay to study, not for a study trial that ill just abandon if im not satisfied with it.\n\nop, thanks for bringing this up.', 'I am still traumatised by that course back in school.', 'honestly the only memorable thing i remembered from his workshops was the mass gathering one where they said some emo stuff and told us to “imagine death” or something and made almost everyone cry - then the instructors were extremely pleased that we cried HAHHAHAA', 'Don’t know why Adam Khoo is so popular, have never enjoyed a single course from his company', 'Vaguely recall being made (along with my fellow P5 or P6 classmates) to imagine our parents dead...\n\nApparently that was supposed to help inspire us for the PSLE', 'You guys can check out James Jani\'s documentary called: ""The Toxic World of Self Help"". It\'s v good and detailed. Youtube btw', 'heard (gossip don pofma me) sch principals get a nice thank u envelope.when they hire him', 'Went through a workshop by him in P6, totally useless', 'Had also attended a similar workshop during the O level year I was fortunate to have not experience the ""crying session"". I wasn\'t particularly interested in his training as i felt that it was mainly just a waste of time however I was being ""caught"" by the trainer for not being interested and he gave me an earful. He said that he is the captain of a boat that brings people to happiness not all can take the boat like you. Seriously this is so cult like ....', 'He lives off making people cry and making us feel guilty and shit lol', 'I\'ve got a few things to say.\n1.""The trainers, having no experience in psychology, didn\'t know anything about \nmental health. Yet, they spoke with confidence on how to deal with mental illnesses."" \n\nI mean, they aren\'t psychologists. I\'m sure the confidence came from the trainer personally, thinking that because he is older and NOT depressed, he knew better.\nMany people do it like that, it\'s how different people try to help others. It seems like the trainer has taken a more\n""aggressive"" approach in helping. I am diagnosed with depression,have self-harmed before, suicidal thoughts yada yada. And so in my desperate times of need, I confided in various people. \nDifferent people have responded differently. Their responses are either aggressive or passive, for the lack of better word(s). (Or neutral, meaning they don\'t care lol)\nPassive meaning ""Oh, why do you feel this way? Oh no I\'m so sorry for you. It\'s not your fault, things will get better!""\nAnd aggressive meaning ""Suicide is stupid. There are people who LOVE you. Think about that dude!"" I had always\nconfided in people who helped me ""passively"", somehow they made me feel ""comfortable"" being depressed. And so, I didn\'t\nreally improve all that much. But when I opened up to this friend,she shocked me with blunt tough words, \nbut I know she meant well. She told me things like ""Well if nobody\'s gonna love you you gotta love yourself"" or ""In this world\nthere isn\'t always going to be someone willing to help you all the time"" Yes, the words made me uncomfortable. But\nit shook me, it changed me. It made me think in a different way, and quite frankly those words were what kickstarted my recovery from depression.\n In my opinion, it\'s really personal. What works for someone may not work for someone else. I\'ve been to so many theraphy sessions and I came out the same. But that girl changed me with a few sentences.\nHowever, most people with depression are indeed in a very vulnerable state, so the most professional way to respond is passively, with care, like therapists/counsellors do. I am definitely not supporting you/people to \nhelp people with depression ""aggressively"" (unless you TRULY know how their personality, how they\'ll take it etc.)  \nI 100% agree that it was actually very unprofessional of him to respond in the way that he did. But I won\'t say that it is definitely damaging, as to be honest, it really depends on the individual.\n Although I am definitely not going to ignore the idea that he had actually hurt her more than he helped her. \n\n2. ""She laughed at the quips and the anecdotes. We all did. Looking back, however, the jokes didn\'t help her get \nover her suicidal ideation, and the anecdote on attention-seeking was dismissive and insulting. More importantly, \nshe didn\'t learn anything, not a new technique to cope with their problems nor a reason to stop self-harming.""\n \nI don\'t think he was supposed to/in the position to help her overcome her suicidal thoughts. The best any untrained (in pscyhology) person can do\nis provide you with personal advice,stories, and encourage you to seek professional help.\nI can kind of understand him making jokes, he\'s probably trying to lighten the situation. But he should have ended \nwith a conclusion that would actually \nhave helped her, such as encouraging her to speak with trusted adults or seek professional help.\n\n3. ""So far, I\'ve only talked about Khoo\'s (and his trainers\') approach towards mental health. To reiterate, Khoo\n and his trainers do not have any proper training in\n psychology but in a pseudoscience known as neuro-linguistic programming (NLP)""\n \nI\'ve only ever attended one (1) adam khoo course thing, so I don\'t really know much about that. Correct me\nif I\'m wrong, but I don\'t think Khoo advertises his course as a psychology/counselling course or anything? It\'s a \nmotivational course. Please enlighten me on this one.\n\n4. ""(7) He also promotes the idea of learning types (e.g. visual, auditory, tactile learners), ""\n\nI don\'t know about you, but I DEFINITELY learn better with visuals, and I\'m sure many others do. I have\nADHD, so it\'s kinda hard for me to pay attention to things that are uninteresting, even if I wanted to. I have tore my hair out over trying to memorise basic stuff. \nNotes can be boring. Right? It\'s all just words. But pictures? Pictures ""stimulate"" \nme in a way, allowing me to focus better. I don\'t know about the science of it all and such, but I study way, way,\nbetter with pictures/depictions/visuals. I draw on my notes to help me study better sometimes. (not doodle, like draw a concept out)\n  It may just be a personal thing though.My friend who has aspergers studies better with tactile stimuli. I\'m sure it\nprobably doesn\'t only apply to neurodivergent people .\n\n5. ""TLDR: Don\'t go for Adam Khoo courses. They aren\'t helpful; they are bad.""\n\nI honestly believe that you should have included a ""IMO"" because the Adam khoo course actually DID help me and my friends who went. \nI saw many of them come out of the course more confident then they have been when they went in. Evidently, there are also people who did not benefit from his courses. \nIf there are more people that have not benefited than those that have, then I think a better word would be that the course is ""ineffective"" but not entirely unhelpful, or bad. \n\nI MUST STATE I perhaps got lucky, because my trainers were actually very nice. I even opened up to one of the trainers, telling him about my situation and my condition. He gave me kind words, giving some actually respectful advice, like\n""everyday, write down 1 thing that you are grateful for, in a book"". He then left off telling me that he believed in me. \n\nI may have made a few mistakes in my essay above as I\'m notoriously known for being careles amoungst my peers. Please tell me if any of my words seemed wrong, or if it looked like I was trying to defend the instructor/condemn depression etc.\n\nReply below if you wanna rebuttal any of my points of something. I\'m open to discussion/debates!\n\nComments:\nJust wanna say that I\'m reading Adam Khoo\'s ""How To Overcome My Clinical Depression?"" \nFirst off I just wanna say that I don\'t even know if that title/heading is even grammatically correct.

I bet anyone who is reading this blog feels depressed at times too. If you do, pls leave a comment and prove me right.""\n\nFeeling depressed and having depression is different...In his first paragraph he has already displayed his lack of understanding of Depression. Not even gonna mention the fact that this very statement is very dismissive as well. \nI\'m just gonna leave it at that, and say that the whole article presents a very old-fashioned/traditional idea of depression lol. That depression isn\'t a real disorder , and that\n "" Depression is a state that you CAN change IMMEDIATELY the moment you CHOOSE to MAKE IT A MUST."". But there are some truths in the article, such as ""If you are not happy with who you are today, then a billion dollars and a million fans will NOT make you happy.""\nI\'m going off tangent. Hope what I typed above wasn\'t too messy and thanks for reading!', ""Man, I've attended a couple of his courses before.\n\nFirst time was kinda okay, I learned a bit.\n\nSecond time on, it was completely and utterly useless.\n\nThankfully though, my school offers leadership training programs and camps for its student leaders.

But the worse was when we had to write down our goals on a piece of paper and hold it up and stare at it for 10 mins. Siao ah. For the next few days, I tried using the methods taught to me. After that, give up liao. I went back to my old studying methods and I could absorb info better. And guess what? When I went into Sec 1, the same thing happened again. Ah shit, here we go again.

I appreciate your providing a counter-argument towards my post, but I still disagree with the practices employed at the course.\n\nTo elaborate on my experiences: the trainer at the time had explicitly encouraged us to share openly about our struggles, and that he would give his advice on how to overcome them. I have no doubt that students in similar situations have shared such experiences before, and yet the trainers still continue with such a practice. If the trainers knew that they were unqualified, and that suicidal people would share their experiences, they would have stopped such a 'group-therapy'. But they felt, even after years of similar experiences, that the sharing session *was* something helpful. Bear in mind that neuro-linguistic programmers believe in an alternative, harmful view of human behaviour, and that may lead to their false confidence in dealing with other people's problems.\n\nAnd on your point on Khoo's course not being marketed as a 'mental health' course, see my footnote on 'enrichment' courses. 'Mental health' and 'stress-reduction' courses are not as appealing as 'motivational' courses that reinforce a belief that 'I am gifted' (the actual name of the course). The fact of the matter is that many, many people with mental illnesses and/or neurodevelopmental disorders are sent to these camps but are treated with pseudoscientific and ineffective methods. Sure, some people may benefit from the methods use—Khoo himself obviously believes very strongly in NLP—but the empirical data has shown time again that they do more harm than good."", 'cgs?', ""Did those people use the unorthodox techniques against your class to make you guilty of yourself or ask you imagine your parents' death and stuff?"", ""> The post-secondary school “trainers” lack sufficient life experience to take care of real shit.

The techniques he used may be scientific but there are cons with it.\n\n1. Guilt and Shame ^([1], [2])\n2. Fearmongering^([3]) or Anticipated Guilt^([4], [5])\n3. Sensitization^([6]) to (academic) failures^([7])\n\n###Some anecdotes about Adam Khoo's lessons\n\n> Then the trainer replied. First, he talked about suicide, calling it a 'stupid' and 'selfish' act…… Looking back, however, the jokes didn't help her get over her suicide ideation,……\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/\n\n> - Actual 'sob-session' involves the instructor narrating a story where a person (us) is a slob who takes everything for granted, but realises his parents are dying and he have done nothing with his life.\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0x28ib\n\n> Additionally, I was digested at certain activities and speeches during the event. One of the instructors hurled vulgarities during his speech/scolding in a half-hearted attempt to motivate a seminar of 13-16 year olds, and forced us to hold a mirror in front of us while scolding at us to force us to literally reflect upon ourselves. I vividly remember the instructor shouting angrily at us to 'wake up' and to 'stop disappointing everyone around you'. I believe the scolding can be done at home, what was the point of this at all?\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7r7dhe\n\n> being told that they should aim for JC or get a lower salary.\n\n**Source:** https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rgvu1/\n\nTechnically, the techniques can be wildly effective if it works for the student,^([8]) but if it doesn't work, it can inflict a lot of psychological harm to the student. Even if it works, in the long-term, this isn't good for mental health as well.^([9]) Unless the facilitator knows the audience very well, using these techniques on unsuspecting participants is crazy.\n\nFirst, one of his techniques may include arousing guilt and feeling ashamed of your not-so-wonderful performance by scolding some of you with vulgarities with the aid of props like mirrors so you can look into the mirror and reflect upon yourself,^([10]) or he has a sobbing session so that you will be ashamed of your incompetence at the expense of your parents' hardwork.^([11])\n\nSecond, he always practices fearmongering or anticipated guilt^([11], [12], [13], [14], [15]) and one example is telling you things like aim for JC instead of Polytechnic because you are more successful if you go JC.^([11], [16])\n\nThese 2 practices result in sensitization towards failure. I'm not sure whether it is part of his bigger strategy or unintended consequence, but it is what it is.\n\n###The problems with these techniques\n\n**1) Ignores the contributing/other factors to the problem**\n\nLet's take suicide as an example. **You will never see a medical expert describing suicide as the following:** ^([17])\n\n- selfish\n- stupid\n- cowardly or weak\n- a choice\n- a sin\n\nThe reason is that most of the time, suicide is actually not a decision nor someone's free will. It is not a choice if you do not have an ability to make a rational decision due to intense emotional pain, hopelessness and a narrowed, negative view of the future interferes with balanced decision-making. They usually only can think of better choices when the crisis is resolved.^([18])\n\nWhen he makes such remarks, he is affirming to the suicidal person that indeed no one really cares about him/her^([19]) and the purpose of him/her existence is to please others. Even though he did talk about how it would impact the person's family, but the effectiveness is diluted by his insensitivity.\n\nFor academic performance, while the primary factor is typically up to the individual's mindset, there may also be other factors that results in the student not doing well academically. He got it right with suggesting a learning technique, the mind map,^([8], [20]) but learning is not all about mind map.^([11], [21], [22], [23])\n\nMaybe because pace of learning? The type of teacher? (Like too fierce so no one dare to ask too much?) The efficacy of the teaching? The helpfulness of the resources (like notes)? The student is not yet to mastered a particular topic results in he/she having difficulty understanding a higher level of the topic?\n\n**2) It is very destructive and/or traumatizing to the student if he/she fails to achieve the goal**\n\nAfter spending so much time fearmongering and creating anticipated guilt towards non-performing, the students will be shattered once he/she falls into the description he contrives. Idk, low salary? Shameful?\n\nIt will make the student feel like a degenerate, and depends on how immersed he/she is in his course, worst case scenario could consider suicidal.\n\n**3) Even if it works, it is very unhealthy mentally** ^([24], [25])\n\nAssuming that the student has good performance, motivation driven by fears will make the students lose touch with humanity to be over-focused on performance. Overzealousness is never good.\n\nStudying by itself is already stressful. Still have to be stressed over minimum expectations? That is double whammy.\n\nExcessive stress will give you another set of problems.\n\n**TL;DR:** These techniques may be very effective if it works, but whether it works or not, it is very harmful. It's very unpopular technique and you rarely see a professional use it this much. If they ever use, it's carefully planned and/or consensual usually on a case-by-case basis.\n\n---\n\nMotivational speakers should always be positive^([26], [27], [28]). That is the best they can do, unfortunately. However, they cannot be too fake and use too much exaggerations or too unrealistic scenarios/examples/expectations lest it's toxic positivity.^([29]) They have to be realistic. The goal of them is to motivate you.\n\nI hope motivational speakers can invest time to incorporate the talk with stress management since nowadays students are quite stressed. If you are mentally good, then you could perform better.\n\n[1]: https://www.psychologytoday.com/sg/blog/creative-synthesis/201501/shame-and-motivation-change\n[2]: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/268449831_Shame_and_motivation_to_change_the_self\n[3]: https://www.healthwriterhub.com/fear-mongering-in-the-media/\n[4]: https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1468-2958.2005.tb00879.x\n[5]: https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0188781\n[6]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitization\n[7]: https://intuitivehaven.com/what-failures-taught-this-highly-sensitive-person-about-life/\n[8]: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0x1m4c/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[9]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rk7hq/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[10]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7r7dhe/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[11]: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0x28ib/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3\n[12]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7r4ksa/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[13]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7s0cy3/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[14]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rq566/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[15]: https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/4a36xi/what_was_your_adam_khoo_workshop_experience/d0xag0w/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[16]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rgvu1/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[17]: https://www.healthline.com/health/mental-health/how-to-talk-about-suicide#Not-every-word-can-be-taken-back-easily-or-in-time-\n[18]: https://www.nationwidechildrens.org/family-resources-education/700childrens/2019/11/suicide-is-not-a-choice\n[19]: https://www.elitefts.com/education/training/bodybuilding/its-time-to-stop-calling-suicide-selfish/\n[20]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7qrame/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[21]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7rnsza/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[22]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7sgo5v/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[23]: https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j59xj4/rant_adam_khoo_and_his_courses/g7tndry/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3\n[24]: https://www.innerbonding.com/show-article/1364/healthy-guilt-unhealthy-guilt.html\n[25]: https://www.nicabm.com/guilt-vs-shame/\n[26]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15250815/\n[27]: https://www.bestow.com/blog/toxic-positivity/https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005796715300814\n[28]: https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/releases/bul-1316803.pdf\n[29]: https://www.bestow.com/blog/toxic-positivity/"", 'Hahaha, credits to OP (u/owlcovesg), he is the hardworking one to have researched it and linked a post with your comment.', 'To prove mind over matter or something, it is meant to be motivational after all.

iambicpentameter2,k1sr7r,[rant] what to do now,2020-11-27 10:38:32,SGExams,77673,27,235,"idk how reddit rly works IDK IF I ADDED THE CORRECT FLAIR OR NOT UMM !!!! i know this is reALLY RANDOM but As ended for me on monday (helm) and im already hating being at home :(

for context this year has been a rather weird and generally unhappy year because of covid, which led me to losing like 2-3 weeks of school before prelims when my fam got dengue and everyone had to sort of take turns getting covid swabbed (a few times for my sister) but besides that my relationship with my mom has gotten super super strained

it started with this incident with my laptop which i put on a chair and then my sister didnt know that my laptop was in the bag on the chair so she sort of threw it down and it cracked so i couldn't use the touchscreen anymore. Take this with the fact that this was leading up to prelims too and i was super stressed with all the work I had to catch up on abd that incident just made me break down [ for more context: that was the first laptop i owned to myself and was given to me for free by a bunch of really sweet people during covid so idk it made it even sadder ig]. SO anyways i broke down and started crying rly hard and my mom who saw the whole exchange btwn me and my sister was like "" Why are you crying?"" and i told her and she said i should jave taken care of it better but the thing is that I did i put in its bag but my sister (whos like 12) absentmindedly just threw it down when i was on my room so technically its really just an accident bah but it doesnt mean i cant be upset about it right? like the crack was pretty obvious also. then she basically told me that ""since it's nobodys fault, you dont need to cry. why are you crying? just take it as a lesson"" and i tried explaining to her that IM UPSET (she kept gg back and forth that i dont have a reason to cry) before i just point blank told her "" if you dont understand, then its okay,"" then i went into my room like i really was trying to JUST CRY and i shes asking me so many questions like what lesson do i TAKE FROM THIS + she didng even try to CONSOLE ME then might as well dont right 

anyways, from the next day she started ignoring me. like no cap just straight up ignored me and i didn't think it was anything wrong because i honestly didn't think that anything i wouldve said wouldve hurt her feelings or wtv... like cmon i didnt even say anything about her and i didn't think it was a big deal. + i was also more concerned about traumatising my younger sister when she thought she screwed up my lappy so i didn't talk about it at all afterwards. like even my dad didnt know what the sudden hostility was like until i prodded him to ask her and he said its because of the incident

i lowkey was furious because its so freaking petty and I felt like i didnt say anything wrong AND it was prelims szn so in my mind i was like lol sure she can ignore me imma just focus on studying so when she wouldnt talk to me id just pretend i didn't notice and did my work/ stay in school longer etc but it rly affected me for sure like all the changes i had to make to feel unaffected rly stands until today --> cant stand being in the same room at all because it makes me super super super uncomfy + my rship w my grandma also sort of deteriorated because of it

ANYWAYS, the Alevels period and school rly helped me to take my mind off of my mom and the horrible rship that we have. i dont think we ever had a great rship to begin with ever since she mocked me for self harm in sec school but i think most ppl in my fam would agree that ive tried rly hard over the years to make the rship work for the rest of my fam but she rly undid it by choosing to ignore me for months now and i dont rly feel like trying anymore? i think even the rest of my fam has accepted that its a lil irreconcilable since my mom is so unbending and imo petty af but since As ended its been rly bad cos ive been cooped up at home and trying not to breal down because of her and its so weird to just wait for her to go into her room to do my chores. i even found a 10 hr job to start THIS Saturday which i lowket regret since i wont have much time to meet up w ppl who end papers later but i really cant stand it 

does anyone have any advice as to how i should deal w this situation,,,, imma be honest at first i tried to be normal and talk but she rly ignored me WHEN i was talking to her,,,, bUT ANYWAYS idk what i can do because like even if i didnt get a job id need to get money to do pretty much anything. it's just so weird im like living in constant anxiety or smtg

whatistruelove24,hxdusg,Cityrevival.sg's rhetoric made me consider suicide,2020-07-25 09:03:59,singapore,378762,192,2343,"TW: Suicide, homophobia

Dear cityrevival.sg,

People like you have made me want to kill myself.

In your latest video, which you have removed, your members Joanna Theng and Jaime Wong called gay pride a Satanic event aimed at displeasing God:

>*“Have you even wondered why the gay pride uses a six-colour rainbow flag as a symbol for love? Satan knows that God is love. The biblical rainbow has seven colours and seven is a number symbolic for perfection in the Bible… On the contrary, the mark of the beast is the number 666. Is it a coincidence that the gay pride celebrates taking pride in distorting the true symbol of the love and peace of God with the six-colour rainbow flag? We believe this movement is one of the ways that Satan, the spiritual force, has influenced the physical realm to manifest in ways that insult and show contempt for God.”Transcription source:* [*AsiaOne*](https://www.asiaone.com/singapore/lgbt-pride-flag-influenced-satan-artiste-joanna-theng-receives-backlash-statements-social)

This is not new to me. Your latest video is just one of many demeaning episodes that I have endured. In the many years that I spent in church, I have been called sick, animal, sinful, demon-possessed, hellbound, destroyer of families and nations.

I’ve had friends shout in my face about how they’d love to electrocute me, ask me if I enjoy sex with animals, and tell me that homosexuality is an exceptional sin that they must stamp out from the media lest more children turn out like me.

I spent close to a decade on my knees praying for God to turn me straight.

At the time, the other option — which I’d lived out for as long as I was in church — was emotional amputation. Most conversion therapists nowadays admit that sexuality cannot be changed, and that queer people should settle for being celibate. What a life that is; to fear ever being loved because to accept someone into your heart is to damn yourself to hell.

The structure behind the logic I was taught was clear: gay people are simply less human. Our suffering is less valid, our feelings less real, our lives less valuable. To earn dignity, we must rise to the level of straightness. But, since that is impossible, we settle for a life less colourful. Queer love is not true love because queer people are less human.

None of my friends from church could understand me when I told them that being gay isn’t a “lifestyle choice”. And now, after watching your video and hearing your accusations of devil worship, I know why. It’s easy to hate someone when you’re trained to think of them as less human. Call me “satan spawn” and a “dirty sinner” enough, and soon you learn to see me not as a *him* but an *it*.

Caught between an unanswered prayer and a life extinguished before it’s even lived, I sometimes wondered if I would be better off dead. In my mind’s eye, I look off the parapet towards the pavement. Fading into nothingness was an attractive idea. I wanted to be free from my friends’ faces twisted with holy pity, free from being told I’m evil simply because I want to be myself, free from the pressures of living in a country that pretends I don’t exist.

But I want to tell everyone not to worry for me, because I don’t consider myself at risk of self-harm at all. Even though it’s been a challenge, I have learnt to love myself, accept love from others, untangle myself from the psychological self-mutilation I have been trained to do, and carve out a comfortable space for myself in this inhospitable world. I have friends who genuinely care for me. I even have Christian friends, properly queer-affirming Christian friends, who are strong in their faith and rightfully angry about the way their religion has been sullied by people bent on discord.

I choose to live because I won’t give you the satisfaction of knowing you’ve robbed me of my dignity. More importantly, I choose to live because the strongest resistance I can wage against a system insistent on my extermination is a life fully and joyfully lived.

I hope you can face yourself in the mirror knowing that your insistence on this prejudiced interpretation of text is driving people away from you.

Your video is one of many that will keep coming. I have learnt by now that to be queer is to live amidst unsolicited trouble. I cannot choose to exempt myself from people like you, but I can choose to journey towards happiness.

**EDIT FOR CLARITY:** Hi everyone, thank you for all the concern I have received! I would like to clarify that I am NOT SUICIDAL. I am sorry for alarming everyone. What I am trying to draw attention to is the fact that I was ONCE suicidal because of Cityrevival-ish hate speech tactics, and am raising awareness of how hate speech can have regrettable consequences. I regret that I cannot change my post title, but have amended my Medium title to something clearer - ""People like Cityrevival.sg once made me consider suicide"". Thanks again!

**(EDIT 2) QUEER-FRIENDLY COUNSELLING:** If you are or know of a queer person struggling with similar issues, you can direct them to queer-affirming counsellors!

Thanks!",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hxdusg/cityrevivalsgs_rhetoric_made_me_consider_suicide/,"['Tbh when I see these posts made by christians I just get really furious. One reason being that I’ve always believed in Christ, just that I don’t believe that rejecting homosexuality is what those people call the TRUTH at all. \n\nThe other that completely infuriates me is about my gay brother. As we are brought up in a christian family, he tried his best to be heterosexual for 6 years. Dated many girls, repressed all his feelings for the men he met and guess what, I nearly lost a brother as he became very depressed and suicidal. My acceptance of him being gay was definitely NOT ENOUGH to REVERSE that DAMAGE that had taken a toll on his well-being for many years. In the past, I heard some sounds coming from his room, thinking that he was simply exercising. Later on, only after 6 damned years did I realise that over the past 6 years he was hitting, slapping and cutting different parts of his body whenever he thought of the men he liked. He did EVERY SINGLE thing he could to make his “gay” go away - even attended online conversion therapy meetings. I just felt really terrible not knowing that he went through all of that alone until we nearly lost him in the hospital. Fortunately, his life was saved and now he’s happier and much more carefree. I can only say that it took a lot of therapy over the past few years just to get him back on his feet, just to accept himself, to love himself and to even think that others will love him for being himself. This is also why I’m so against christians who force that “truth” on others.', 'As someone who used to be staunchly Christian and anti-lgbtq, I would just like to apologise for all the hate that you have received. I lost faith precisely because I could not deal with the hypocrisy that is Christianity when it comes to LGBT. \n\nWe claim to be the religion of love when all we can do is spew hate towards people who don\'t share the same faith. Jesus condemned divorce more than LGBT but you don\'t hear a peep from Christian activists calling them Satan\'s plan. You don\'t see Christian activists loudly going unto Geylang and condemning the rampant adultery there. We claim to spread the ""truth"" but we\'re just exercising our moral high horse, no different than the pharisees that Jesus condemned and those who crucified Him.\n\nLove thy neighbour, let those who have not sinned cast the first stone and do unto others what you want others to do unto you. These were three advices that once defined my faith and still continue to guide me, and probably the most important ones I think from Jesus, but it\'s sad to see not many believers actually pay heed to these, but are more concerned about bullying minorities.\n\nAgain, I\'m sorry for the way we\'ve treated everyone who is different. I really hope Christianity could take one long hard look at itself one day and ask what it actually stands for.', 'This is incredibly crazy because this is not a one off experience. I’ve heard from people online and in real life that they go through similar turmoil, both physically, mentally and religiously.\n\n\nSingapore has formed such a bubble that I think it is very hard for people of the LGBTQ+ community to be genuinely happy staying here. The worse part is that it is not something being rectified at the moment, in fact, it is one of the most major items that’s being looked past by our government.\n\n\nStay strong OP.

A black man who persuaded many white supremacist to give up their bigotry. And in he explains that \'hate stems from fear. From fear of the unknown\'.\n\nNext time they spew their homophobic vitriol, know that they do so out of ignorance. Out of self-inflicted fear. And because their words are ignorance and fear, they cannot touch you. \'How can you hate me, when you don\'t even know me?\'.\n\nFor every one of such homophobe there are many more people who love and accept you for who you are.

conflictedcause,lodcpu,[RANT] Conflicted on which University degree to apply for.,2021-02-21 02:31:00,SGExams,77673,6,7,"tw suicide selfharm depression

Literally the title. I don't know who else to ask honestly.

I graduated from Singapore Poly last year in 2020, with a horrible GPA of exactly 3.0. That's in my opinion of course, because all my life was just dedicated to entering a Local U. At 3.0, I know my Uni options for full-time are extremely limited, especially for the course I took- Accountancy.

My O's wasn't too bad, was brainwashed by my mother into Accountancy but in year 1 sem 1 but I immediately realised I didn't enjoy doing Accounting. Unfortunately, I enjoyed doing a field that's requires Accounting because of my internship with an Auditing firm... Which brings me this dilemma if I should continue opting for Accountancy for my future degree (in private unis of course).

Every inch of me did not enjoy learning/doing Accounting and I am someone whose effort doesn't seem to pay off regardless of how well I do during my classes. My brain simply goes blank during exams which results in a C+ for almost all the Accounting modules I took, and hence the GPA. 

Accounting took a toll on me physically and mentally, self-harm, suicidal thoughts, depression, all that you can name it. I honestly have no idea what to do now. What even are my options if I choose a different path from Accounting??",0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lodcpu/rant_conflicted_on_which_university_degree_to/,"['there are many other courses from SIM you can consider. some of my friends were previously from engineering in poly but studied courses that are not related to their diploma in SIM.', ""You enjoyed Auditing but dislike accounting? \n\nAuditing is a branch of accounting and requires strong accounting knowledge.

If you actually work in Auditing and rise up the ranks, it's not going to be so easy.\n\nYou might want to rethink your strengths, rediscover your interest and look at which modules you did well in, then make a decision. \n\nAlso, never adhere to what others want for your future, including your parents, you can take them just as an advice.

Cheer up and atb.', ""I know its weird and I have no idea why either, which is why I'm so conflicted... I have no issues relating accounting concepts to audit and my audit workscope for intern did involve doing the full audit for several FS components which I also liked oddly. My audit related modules (including internship and final year project) were either distinctions or A-s but it was only to an extend where those grades helped in my GPA. (And devastating that the internship of 22 credits didn't count in my GPA because of the school) Its just the accounting exams that brings down most of my grades for the module as it has the highest weightage and credits and I was so stressed out by that that my brain started disliking accounting in general. \n\nI was 16 when I listened to my mother, had no idea what I wanted then so I just followed, but yeah, lesson learnt.\n\nI am considering some Math/Econs courses I like but even so, the odds of the Universities accepting me into the course is quite low to none... Is there anything I can do to increase my chances of making it to an interview even?"", ""Honestly, I don't really know, nobody knows. But imo 3.0 probably can't get you into the big 3. But, never try never know. Put in as much CCA as possible to increase your chances. \nYou should look into SIT/SUSS/SIM. \n\nMath, are you sure you really like it? 3 years without touching math and now you're competing with A Level/IB/Engineering students who did intensive math for the past 2-3 years.

You can take Uni Prep lessons etc. But are you that dedicated? Or is it because you just wanted to do something else? If it is, think twice. You'll likely end up in a similar situation. \n\nReally go deep and think why you did not do well in accounting, do you fundamentally dislike it or is it other reasons? If you did well for audit and internship, and can relate accounting to audit, you have grasped the concepts. I don't think you're that bad at accounting. \n\nAnyways there's alot of accounting module, Tax, Financial Accounting, Management Accounting, Cost Accounting. Do you dislike/did badly for all?

Also took a bridging Math module (B+) in Poly Year 2 that was supposed to help with Uni Year 1 math at least.. The least I know was that I looked forward to attending the night Math class twice a week but still, then was then. Same thing for Econs, I liked it, but I don't know if I have the courage to fully pursue it as a degree because it'll be a huge wager.\n\nHonestly the reason why I was convinced into taking accountancy because my mother told me Math and Accounting are the same haha, definitely not the same for me. \n\nThing is, I don't know what went wrong for me regarding Accounting modules. Grasping the concept (in theory) is one thing, using the concept accurately (in practice) during exams is another thing. I did my lectures and tutorials all on time, even the practice papers were alright because my numbers matched to the answer key. And because of that, I thought I was starting to like that particular Accounting module too (including Taxation), but my result slips tell me otherwise, and then I get deflated again. Its a tiring cycle that I'd hate to have it continue to Uni... which is why I thought maybe I should choose another route instead...\n\nIT was never in my consideration because I assumed most to be related to coding, which is something I didn't enjoy in sec school when my CCA introduced that in as part of the CCA. Don't think it will interest me but wouldn't mind researching about it for the time being.""]"
NotFromYouTube,jyymio,[O levels] My weird O level motivation,2020-11-23 00:40:00,SGExams,77673,23,187,"I know O levels are over but I thought this may still be relevant.

Many students are often motivated by a prize from their parents for good results, happiness, the 2 month holiday and a good post secondary education. For me however, I am motivated or otherwise FUELED by REDEMPTION, FRUSTRATION AND ANGER.

 I had a bad PSLE score. I thought I was going to Express but ended up in Normal Academic. I usually always compared myself to the bottom thinking to myself “Hey at least I am not last"" to be optimistic or something. But after I entered secondary school, I always compared myself to the top. If I am the top in class I would work to be top in the nearby classes. If I am the top in the nearby classes I would work to be the top in level. This helped me transfer from normal academic to express.

After I went to Secondary 3(Pure double Science), I started failing my subjects again. I was at a very bad point in my life, self harm and basically feeling very miserable. I studied my worries away until I got the hang of one subject, then 2 , then 4 and until I could pass every subject. Then I aimed to go pass 60%, then 70% and aimed to receive a 9 for L1R5(After CCA points) and a 7 for L1R4(After CCA points).

Then the dreaded O level came. My PTSD of my horrible PSLE score came up when the secondary 4 students were watching the previous batch receiving their results. We had to leave before they collected their results, we were only there to see the cohort performance and the top 10 students. My brain immediately fired up and I wanted to study everyday until I die for some reason.

During O levels I was studying 6+ hours a day and only stopping to take a piss, take a shit or eat and shower. I had never felt this motivated before and I was not happy at all. I was feeling like shit and constantly had a headache. But I never actually burned out and kept going.

Let me tell you how different it feels when you are motivated by redemption where the redemption is getting a good result after the previous shit one. You wake up and you immediately feel like you were wasting time and just remember all the crying after the PSLE results were released and also remember the hell you went through in secondary 2 and 3 to get here. You would study and feel the knowledge going in and you try to focus and put your brain to 200%.

Now I am having my holidays but the motivation is still there. I want to study for no fucking reason and I somehow lost interest in gaming. I now wake up everyday and watch youtube and go back to sleep. I feel like shit and feel like I should be doing something. I feel absolutely miserable and tired. Can any seniors tell me what to do?

jiaaaminn,jkrrd8,[o level] encouragement!!,2020-10-30 14:33:22,SGExams,77673,35,242,"(okay I get that my title is lame :<)

hello everyone! this is my first time posting and im kinda scared LOL anyways there’s something ive been wanting to address so bear w me and try giving this a read hahaha ~

Over the past two weeks, I have spent many hours on reddit reading responses towards examinations as well as how people are feeling. Most of the responses are negative and self doubting. Many have taken upon themselves to check their answers (same) and I've seen the toll of its impact on some of you. I have friends crying upon checking of answers and I also have friends boasting about how well they did. 

Regardless, I feel like no matter how badly or how well you did, you should always take it with a neutral and calm heart. Giving yourself false hope is pointless. Demoralising yourself is pointless. The exam has been done, what else can you do about it? Steal the papers? HA funny. There is simply nothing you can do but move forward. Maybe you really did so badly there is no hope for you. So???? What's the worst that could happen? ITE isn't so bad. Retaking isn't so bad. As long as you have the strength to continue, YOU WON THE BATTLE.

to those out there suffering. those considering self harm as a way to destress, why are you casting your mental health aside? you feel isolated? worthless? talk to someone. talk to your parents, talk to your friends, talk to strangers (be cautious) , anything is better than hurting yourself. better days are looking upon you and trust me, this isn't worth it. This. Isn't. Worth. It.

Yes, results are so detrimental to our society and I hate it too. But why are you devaluating your self worth based on numbers and words displayed on a piece of paper? RESULTS DO NOT DEFINE YOU. your results do not stop you from achieving your dreams. Your results either speeds up or slows down the journey. This is YOUR life, people can say what they want but this is your life. You call the shots and you experience these moments on another personal level. What your family say, your (toxic) friends say, does not matter. Everything is going to be okay. In case no one has told you, everything will be okay. The worst that could ever happen is you giving up. You can give up on toxic friendships, you can give up on impressing society, you can give up on diets. But, as long as you DON'T LOSE HEART, and don't give up on yourself, everything will be just right. :)

Pick yourself up. Start again. 
If you fail? 
Pick yourself up. Start again.

Your life is the constant variable, please stop letting your mental health deteriorate to the point of no return. You are so so so valued, it may not seem so right now but the sun will shine upon you again and everything WILL BE OKAY. 

I understand your panic, your worry but really, there is nothing you can do right now except to move forward. Accept what has been done and move on. Maybe you'll cry over it, throw a tantrum, eat a few pints of icecream, whatever. do whatever you need to make you happy. Life is way too short to just waste it on things you can't change. To those who have done well over the past few weeks , congratulations. Don't forget to thank the people around you who have helped you since the start, be it directly or indirectly. To those who haven't, itsokay, start again. I feel you. But really, as long as we don't give up on ourselves, the future is so bright and we will get there.

There are days whereby I feel like hurting myself due to the amount of pressure being put on me. I couldn't sleep most of the nights because I am constantly thinking about results day next year. I have 1 more paper left, which is sci mcq, but I dont feel like doing the paper anymore. My life sucks and I really hate it. I wish I was smart because if I was, then I won't be in this fking situation. My life will continue to be like this until results day because only then will the real situation reveal.

kwpstudies,jxmgus,in severe need for help,2020-11-20 18:05:28,singapore,378762,78,259,"update: talked to my mom, but not much difference. initially dad had signs of violence, but was controlled by mom. currently receiving death threats from anonymous ppl here.

hii, i know this may not be the best platform, but i dont know how to move on from here anymore.

as my depression has been consistently worsening, my parents have since been forcing me to religious rituals and abide to their religious practices. according to them, they think i have been possessed by bad spirits from my soft toys and also from my workplace. so they took me thru an exorcism process, during which i said i felt extremely uncomfortable as i started to have multiple panic attacks. but my parents forced me to bear it in, and the process took about 1.5 hours. subsequently, they threw all my soft toys away, quit my job without my consent. i argued with them and asked them why they'd force me through this. and they said they dont see any help in me going for therapy, so they rather use their own religious method, asking me to believe in them that this is the only way to cure my depression and anxiety - which obvly isnt true. basically they think that im possessed w spirits and dat is why im suffering from mdd and anxiety disorder. 

right now i am in severe danger as i feel so controlled by my parents to the point they are contacting every person in my contact list (which idk how they accessed to it), and also they still want me to abide to the religious practices (eg returning back b4 5pm otherwise i will get possessed by spirits, having a noise-free env). as a result, i have been self-harming myself every night.

my psychologist and psychiatrist recommended my parents to go for family counselling, but they refused. they feel that nth is wrong with their mindset. its just me who has a problem.

perhaps my parents have good intentions, but their way of helping me jus started out horribly. right now i feel so broken. it doesnt feel like a family, constantly tearing apart. every time im at home, i just harm myself. i have no suicidal intent, but rather i cut to relieve the emotional pain.

i went to fsc this morning, and they said they cant help me unless my parents are keen to join the counselling session. but again, the more controlling they get.

i dont know what to do anymore. neither do i want to go to IMH. i dont know whether a CPO is necessary, but its so extreme to the point all im being put through is religious stuff which i really feel uncomfortable about.

please, help me. ik im still under the charge of my parents, but idw to put myself through even more pain and trauma. idk what i shd do.

at the time of writing, i feel hopelessness and pain in life.

KnightlyVulture,l8sppg,Domestic violence situation,2021-01-31 02:55:47,singapore,378762,10,85,"I have no where else to go to, im hoping i could get some advice here.

So my mother is currently going through a divorce with my step dad and its been back and forth arguments every other day over the last 2 months. To keep it short, my step dad had cheated on my mum and earlier tonight at around 12.30AM he threatened to hit my mum, which caused a huge ruckus that resulted in me and my sister coming out to the living room. He left the house after that, and fearing for our safety we called the police. To keep it as short as possible, the police did nothing about it and merely told us to apply for PPO(Personal Protection Order) and go for family counselling. 

First of all, the protection order still allows him to be under the same roof as us. The police said they cant do anything right now because he hasnt done anything violent yet, but to call them immediately if something were to happen. What am i to do? Wait until somebody gets hurt at home or worse?

He had brandished a knife in front of us before threatening to commit suicide 4 years ago, which forced me to call the police in which he was locked up a day for. And two weeks ago, during one of their fights when my mum left the house, he took my 5 year old little brother out of the house where i had to chase after him down to the parking lot, where he locked me out of the car with my brother inside with him, under the guise of ‘only bringing my brother along to look for my mother’. He only relented when i threatened to call the cops if he doesnt unlock the doors. He has displayed signs of self harming, like hitting the wall with his fist during fights with my mother and has even hit himself before. 

I have decided to go down to the police station first thing tommorrow and make an actual report detailing everything that leads me to believe he is capable of extreme violence. He is showing signs of desperation and depression as he doesnt want to go through the divorce willingly. I am hoping that the people down at the station would be more patient and understanding than the first responders that showed up tonight, but i also fear that i’d receive the same response. If tommorrow doesnt go well, i’m at a complete loss here.

Is there anything i could do? Can we not get a restraining order against him? It seems like police are not taking this case of potential domestic violence seriously. I would really appreciate some advice here, i do not want to stand idly by and watch my family become a statistic of domestic violence or murder.

Our laws are .... uncharacteristically restrained when it comes to domestic violence. Don't expect police to march down to the house to arrest him after your report, unless he is at that moment, being a danger to self or others. Saying this to set expectations that don't expect immediate enforcement action, because police's hands are tied due to overarching legislature. This also meant a lot of work and onus are placed upon the victims. \n\n2. Why other users are recommending PPO is that PPO makes any acts forbidden in the order (e.g. acts of violence, verbal abuse etc) an arrestable offence i.e. police can handcuff him and bring him away on the spot if he breaches the order (instead of giving warning and leave). \n\n3. Both DEO and PPO are decided by the Family Court judge. Upon application, your stepfather will be given an Expedited Order, like a temporary cease and desist. Both parties will still need to go through the Court hearings for the judge to decide if PPO or even DEO (sidetrack: DEO are less likely to be granted than PPO, and even then it may be limited e.g. can still stay in house but cannot enter master bedroom) will be granted. This mean however, your stepfather will be given a chance to to contest and even file a counter-charge against you. \n\n4. Relating to point 3, as others suggested, to strengthen your claims start logging evidence e.g. threatening text messages. Start taking note on events like if weapons are used, frequency of violence, duration of violence, last incidents etc.  I would imagine he won't take being served notice too kindly. PPO, end of the day, is a legal notice and a deterrence rather than a magic talisman that will stop your stepfather instantly if he decides to be violent and consequences be damned. (The saving grace is that he cannot apply to remove PPO unilaterally. The judge will decide on that)\n\n5. This meant that you and your loved ones need to learn to protect yourself and seek alternative solutions. As others have suggested, please do seek out your nearest Family Service Centres (find yours here: https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/familyservice/default.aspx ) or Violence Specialist Centres. The social workers/counsellors there can come up with safety plans and alternative solutions (e.g. referral to crisis shelters, exploring staying at relative houses etc) while providing emotional support across this onerous journey. **Again, the nature of our laws dealing with this is that the victims need to be the one pulling the trigger and enduring most of the work.** The professionals there will also explore long term solutions, e.g. divorce and housing etc, and work with you through the process. It will be helpful to discuss with your mom how ready is she to explore all these solutions. (We have seen plenty of cases where victims are emotionally unprepared to go through divorce or even take up PPO against the perp out of love for them.) \n\n6. Side note: you are not responsible for how your stepfather deals with his anger. It is his choice to self-harm (considering there are plenty of other methods e.g. walk away, bitch to friends etc).\n\nAll the best, and take care."", 'Just tell her divorce him and be with the new chick.

I took my O’s last year and damn it was def one of the most stressful times in my life. Heres my experience with it. When I first started sec 4 the stress was alr there with my chers and parents constantly telling me to study, tuition classes back to back, remiedial lessons etc. Idw to go into details lah but I had a really hard time coping with completing homework while studying at the same time and my results were also well not the best. I rmbr I failed subjects during school exams like CT and Prelims it really got the best of me and dragged me all the way down, everyday just felt horrible, i was tired, my mom nagging at me to study, crying while doing tys LOL and I genuinely felt like I hit rock bottom. To the point that I wanted to just give up. But I didnt. 
-
The reason why I didnt decide to give up was because I realised smthin. That even if you fail ( touchwood ) time still continues. When I realised that I decided that yknow what, Im gonna focus on trying my best instead of focusing on only the grade. Worst come to worst just retake next year. So thats exactly what I did i stopped worrying about getting good grades and I just tried my best to study as much as I can before Os.
-
In the end, I actually surprisingly did better than expected! My L1R4 was 9 and I got into the poly and course that I wanted to go to!! It was overwhelming to see that my efforts rlly did pay off. 
-
Thats my own experience with O’s. Somthing I wish my parents and teachers did was at least praise me for my effort I think most of the time they only look at your grade and start going on about “ oh you dont work hard enough” or like “ your never going to amount to anything in life with this kind of grade” and its rlly dejecting to hear those kinds of things esp when your in the most mentally vulnerable state of your youths having the pressure of all that is really suffocating and depressing. 
-
Some of them dont exactly know how hard we work because they never really witness the endless days and nights we stay up to study and when results dont show they just immediately assume we didnt try. Its crushing and painful to constantly be put down even when u alr tried hard which consequently lead to us as students just wanting to not study because we alr know either way you study or not the results still the same and thats why you want to just give up. 
-
So im here to say KEEP UP THE GOOD EFFORT! I know its been a long a tough road but if you really got put in effort to try even if your grades is still :// IM PROUD OF YOU!!!!!!! To those who are struggling to keep going JIAYOUZ please dont give up yet its just a few more months push through it!! Then you can rest easy. And to those who didnt try well idk how to help you lah but you still got some time might as well give it your best shot?? 
-
Another thing is that school results and o level results are vv different. School results are solely based off how correct they mark you. O level results is determined by the bell curve so lets say its a difficult paper, dont be scared because if its difficult for you others will also find it difficult which will bring the bell curve down on a whole too!

Some studying tips: 
If your studying and you rlly cannot alr just walk smwhere drink some water breathe and rest for a bit before continuing it helps clears the brain! 
-
I know its dark and depressing for some of yall. For me I also been there I actually also self-harm and regretted it.. if your going through smthin it really is better to tell someone about it. Dont bottle it up it really only makes it worst. If you dont have anyone you can trust feel free to ramble or rant to me 🥺 I cant provide 100% advice but having smone there is a comfort of its own and having a listening ear at least lifts the burden up a little! 
-
So yee :D idk if anything I said will help motivate anyone or smthin but I just wanted to share and maybe help a few of yall out there cuz I know it isnt easy 😔👊 some days are really that bad that I actually just cry myself to sleep like the wuss I am. 🤙🏻but Im glad I still persisted and made it through. Really RLLY IF YOU GOT PUT IN EFFORT IT WILL SHOW !!!!!

All the best for your papers guys!! JIAYOUZ YOU GOT THIS BRED!!! few more months then yall are home free!!

Experts told The Straits Times they are not too surprised by the figures given their work experience - and believe more should be done to eradicate the stigma against mental health issues in the Republic.\n\nResilienz clinic senior clinical psychologist Jeanie Chu and the principal psychologist and director of The Therapy Room, Ms Geraldine Tan, both said the statistics reflect what they see in their centres.\n\nNovena Medical Centre consultant psychiatrist Munidasa Winslow said the proportion of people harbouring suicidal thoughts was ""a little alarming"". He also said that the self-harming rate of young adults, whom the survey defined as 18-to 24-year-olds, reveals that people are not used to talking about or dealing with emotional issues.\n\nSamaritans of Singapore (SOS) senior assistant director Wong Lai Chun said that when young people have not yet developed adequate positive coping mechanisms and lack awareness of the resources available to help them, self-harm may become a possible outlet.\n\nMs Chu said there are typically three reasons why young people self-harm - academic and relationship stress and hormonal changes, which can affect emotions. They may also self-harm because they hear that their friends have tried it.\n\n""Cutting oneself produces physical pain, which they believe they can deal with, and that distracts them from the emotional pain,"" she said. ""You\'re just creating something secondary to distract yourself - the problem will still come back.""\n\nAll four experts said communication is important in helping a loved one who engages in self-harm.\n\nDr Winslow said they should be able to talk without judgment or ridicule. Ms Chu agreed: ""People sometimes avoid talking about it because they feel it\'s a taboo subject, but you want to communicate so you can find out what\'s really going on. Talking helps them to verbalise feelings and open up a conversation that can get them to seek help.""\n\nMs Tan added that if individuals are unable to talk about their feelings, they should be encouraged to visit a psychologist who can assist them in processing their feelings, and also assess if they need medical assistance or are at risk of suicide.\n\nAccording to the survey of 1,095 Singaporeans, young adults were also three times more likely than those aged 55 and above to state they had a mental health issue.\n\nMs Tan said it shows the younger generation is better educated about mental health disorders. Ms Wong added that this may be partly due to the example set by celebrities, who share their personal experiences with mental health issues. She said that SOS and its partners in the mental health sector have also been educating and creating awareness about mental health issues, including the importance of emotional well-being. However, the stigma still exists in society.\n\nThe survey found almost 64 per cent of Singaporeans would be embarrassed to admit having mental health issues, and only 58 per cent of those with such issues would seek professional help. It also found women were more likely to seek help for their issues than men.\n\nHELPLINES\n\n\xa0• Samaritans of Singapore: 1800-221-4444\n\n\xa0• Singapore Association for Mental Health: 1800-283-7019\n\n\xa0• Institute of Mental Health\'s Mental Health Helpline: 6389-2222\n\n\xa0• Silver Ribbon: 6386-1928\n\n\xa0• Tinkle Friend: 1800-274-4788\n\n\xa0• Care Corner Counselling Centre (Mandarin): 1800-353-5800\n\nMs Wong said that while women tend to communicate with family and friends when in distress, men adopt a ""standard"" masculine role which emphasises greater levels of strength, tolerance, independence and risk-taking behaviour. She said: ""Men seem to have internalised the belief that they cannot and must not talk about issues that affect them negatively or emotionally.""\n\nDr Winslow felt this stereotype is prevalent in Asia where, he said, ""society has problems allowing macho males to express weakness"".

kwpstudies,k2s2sw,Need urgent opinion on hospitalisation for worsening MDD and anxiety,2020-11-29 01:49:53,singapore,378762,7,16,"hii, need urgent advice on what i should do, bc i just feel very conflicted and lost now.  


Just a few hours ago, I had collapsed in a public place due to huge agitation from family issues. Coupled with other interpersonal issues, my body could not take it. This seems to be the case every time I get greatly impacted by things. I was looking very pale, and I felt extremely drained to the point it felt like I was about to go. Took Xanax but at the time of writing, I still feel as if my body got ""sucked up"".  


In addition, I could not control myself to self-harm since yesterday night. Strong suicidal thoughts, but no active plan to end things. More of feeling extremely depressed and in distress for the past 2 weeks.  


Kindly provide any advice or suggestion for me if I should seek hospitalisation. My parents felt that I can pull it through over time, but my psychiatrist on the other hand is suggesting hospitalisation asap. I know I should heed my psychiatrist's advice, but at the same time I also have to get approval from my parents in order to be admitted.  


Was also wondering if anyone who works at SKGH (Sengkang General Hospital) knows if there are still available beds in the psychiatric ward + whether there will be a psychiatry doctor stationed there 24/7. How long will I usually have to stay for admission as well? Went across all the other government hospitals (except IMH) but their psychiatric wards are full. Not keen on treatment at IMH as it has proven to have further reinforced my suicidal thoughts and worsened my depression + anxiety even further.

However, character is the reason that will allow you to mingle with the opportunities (people) in the house. The (people) in the house does not care whether you got a 6 pointer, 260 T score for psle or 90rp. Because they already knew that you have the potential and permission to enter the house. Even if you are not able to get into the 'house', there are always other 'houses' , if that particular house is something you really want to do, there are other ways to enter, either through for eg getting a scholarship, going overseas, or just retaking the exams. So do not be devastated or demoralised because in life sometimes we have to take a different road or a detour to reach our destination.

2) Do not self harm. Thinking you are not enough for whoever or whatever, thinking that no one loves you, no one cares about you should not lead to self harm. Negative thoughts should not be even cultivated. It is by no means easy to become happy or deemed normal either by others or by yourself.

Meeboi009,jyb8mt,SOS! Am I depressed? Or crazy?,2020-11-21 22:03:46,nus,21220,12,58,"Hii guys, this is a desperate call for help. My finals starts next week, I'm about 60% there... Thats not the main problem. The bigger problem I'm facing is whenever I'm stressed, i just procrastinate and push everything away. I'm not always like this tho, when the sem started up till week 10/11 I've been very on and passionate about the stuff I'm learning. Then as the exams creep near, i get stressed and start ""self-harming"" by procrastinating. I think im doing this cos if I were to score badly, i have a reason that I procrastinated and not because I'm dumb. But everytime my grades come back, they are not that bad either, definitely not the best, slightly worse than my friends who mugged alot. Then I comfort myself by saying, wow u didn't mug that much and yet still get grades close to ur friends who mugged...

Am I crazy? Or am I depressed or sth? Anybody facing similar issue? Pls advice 🥺🙏. 

Also, another thing is, I've pushed away too many people especially guys in particular who showed interest in me and were showing concern when I'm stressed... Is this because I'm afraid to show my ""weaker side"" to them? I don't like to share my worries with my parents toooo. But yet I feel so helpless:((((

purrrish,jrdlkf,How do I know if I am blacklisted from entering SG after this incident? Tourist here.,2020-11-10 11:45:43,askSingapore,44638,16,0,"So long story short, my ex is Singaporean. And I'm Indonesian. He dumped me over text and I flew to Singapore last year days after it happened for closure. I went from Friday - Sunday. 

Friday, I met him and I got my closure. I was fucked up and all. That night after, I went to Marquee to have some drinks with my friends who live in Singapore (I didn't stay with them, I had my own airbnb). Then the next thing I remember I was in an ambulance, laying and restrained. I remember crying about my ex- boyfriend tho. (I was drunk) and the next memory of mine is when I'm in Singapore General Hospital. I don't remember much, only crying in the hospital because I was mad and emotional, why would they need to bring me. I don't remember the exact causes why. Then they gave me back my bag and passport, I then took a cab back to my airbnb. Went out the Saturday night with my friends, and Sunday got back to Indonesia. 
Nothing happened, I think I was there for a few hours. They didn't charge me also.

Question Is, I'm concerned if I'm banned from Singapore for future travel because of that incident. I'm guessing why they took me in an ambulance and restrained was because I had cutting scars on my wrist (which was still very visible and it was still fresh cut, and I couldn't cover it with makeup because it sting.) and I didn't self harm in SG. The scars are from days ago when I'm still back in Indonesia. My Singaporean friends told me, if they didn't detain me in the police station then it should be fine. Since on Saturday till Sunday I was still ""free"" in Singapore. 
Or because I got too drunk and emotional? And maybe they thought I am a drug user from the cut? Cause I heard heroin addicts cut themselves. 
I was alone when I got into an ambulance and the hospital, it all happened to fast, my friends didn't know.


Will I get banned for future travel for that ""trouble?""
I need to confirm what my friends say is true or not.

An_educated_fool,hiuehy,"[Rant] We, as human beings, are incredibly overworked from school-induced pressure",2020-07-01 03:32:10,SGExams,77673,36,77,"Not trying to farm karma or sit on the moral high horse, but just wanted to express a sentiment that is deeply rooted in my beliefs after slaving through it for about \~12 years. 

I come from a *relatively* casual family who happens to be in the high socio-economic standing. My parents allowed me to pursue whatever major I want as long as I work hard for it and that it can provide a stable living. 

They aren't super particular about the quality of my grades (GPA above 3 is tolerated, as long as I can enter a uni course after, which is around 3.3X for NTU philosophy ) 

But even then, I still feel the incredible pressure from doing my absolute best in my schoolwork. I feel cornered into a situation where I take what it takes to get my best GPA. 

Sometimes, I feel like I'm learning not because I want to learn, but because I can highlight the relevant information for the upcoming test/ assignments. 

Thankfully, I'm a humanities student who loves what almost whatever he's studying. But imagine about the large proportion of young children coerced into taking subjects or courses by their parents, even though they strongly dislike it or inept at it. 

How many of those RI, Hwa Chong, Anglo-Chinese students are happy? How many of them actually enjoy studying what they study? How many of these poor souls are gaining true life experience or exploring themselves to mature as individuals? How many of them look to death to escape their torment?

Our academic culture isn't like Japan where we attend school for the sake of it and just pass it. Many students in our education system are made to study over-complex subjects under the burden of reaching an expectation of academic excellence (80+/100) due to pressure from parents and school? 

I've seen it and experience it firsthand what is it like to slave under these horrendous conditions. O levels were my absolute breaking point. I went through so many mental breakdowns just so I can cram the information into my head and regurgitate the swallowed info into the exam paper. 

I've seen too many people going bonkers from the academic stress exerted on them, with some even looking to self-harm as an unhealthy output to release their stress. It's simply inhumane. Period.

Parents, the main culprit, fail to spare a single thought for the emotional state for their suffering child, send their children through excessive tuition and supplementary lessons on top of nearly impossible standards set for them. All these children will understand in their life is stress, overwork and misery.

What I abhor most are answering techniques and the approach mainstream schoolteachers adopt during lessons. They are there not to cultivate a love for learning or make the subject fascinating for students to learn and grow as people. They are only there to teach you the *correct* manner to answer. 

What happened to learning because the subject was interesting and insightful? What happened to true learning? 

As a future social entrepreneur and secular humanist, I dream of a future when we can reform our education system that implements an effective curriculum that enables students to study in safe and nurturing environments without overexerting them. An academic culture that fosters intrapersonal exploration and true learning that shapes our youths positively. 

This is probably poorly worded but feel free to message me, I'd love to talk more about this topic that I'm quite passionate about.",0.78,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hiuehy/rant_we_as_human_beings_are_incredibly_overworked/,"["">slave under these horrendous conditions.\n\n>I've seen too many people going bonkers from the academic stress exerted on them, with some even looking to self-harm as an unhealthy output to release their stress.

Having gone through the system themselves, many do acknowledge the struggles of schooling, and are generally more understanding and are more willing to hear their children out. For many (myself included), it is actually the kids that ask for the tuition to help boost their grades, not the parents who force it upon them. And even if they do, they only do so because they want the best for your future.\n\nOverall, we’re living in a resource-scarce country like Singapore where human capital is vital to the future of its economy. Our education system, although not without its flaws, has served us well, and I guess the stress and competition, be it from parents, oneself or the system itself is just part and parcel of life here. There is much to be improved, and I believe that in time to come change will follow.

Yes, it is competitive and yes it is stressful but these are not inherently negative things. It is very subject to individual character and experience. I come from one of the above schools and the teachers pushed us hard, we competed against each other but ultimately most of us didn’t come out emotionally stunted. We are empathetic, compassionate people who now know how to handle pressure. I do not believe that ensuring students’ emotional development is within the scope of the school. That is the parents job and if they cannot do their job of giving their child a safe environment to grow; then reducing academic pressure doesn’t do anything. \n\nMy school experience was exceedingly positive. The faculty was constantly supportive and understanding. Sure, learning things that are complex is tough but I genuinely loved what I studied. I was from the science stream and of course my teachers mainly focused on teaching us how to answer the questions. I don’t see why inculcating the love for learning or a love for the subject has to fall on the teachers. If you put in the effort, you grow to love whatever you’re studying. Competition only heightened that for me, it pushed me to do better, work harder and be the best version of myself. It was stressful and at times overwhelming but I credit having undergone the pressure for changing my perspectives on work and life.

Typical Japanese parents only care about their children\'s entry exams\' performances, since the general school of thought is that once you\'ve gotten a position in a certain school, you\'re already set for life regardless on how well you perform in it. So grades among undergrads and high schoolers tend to be mediocre but incredibly high for their entrance exams. \n\nIn Japan, the prestige of the uni is enough to set you for life and your major and GPA is largely irrelevant when applying for jobs since \'black companies\' will usually give the same set of instructions you all entrees simultaneously how to perform in the company. \n\nThat\'s why you have Japanese computer engineers doing PR work and programmers doing business admin work. \n\n>Why are you quoting RJC, HCJC and ACJC/SI? \n\nMy reason for quoting this example was not to pin the blame of these institutions but rather to characterise how students from academically elite schools tend to be subjected to relatively more stress from the rigours of school compared to neighbourhood schools. \n\nI myself was struggling to keep up with HC and AC standard papers while sitting for O levels due to the stark contrast in academic difficulties between our two schools.

Typical Japanese parents only care about their children\'s entry exams\' performances, since the general school of thought is that once you\'ve gotten a position in a certain school, you\'re already set for life regardless on how well you perform in it. So grades among undergrads and high schoolers tend to be mediocre but incredibly high for their entrance exams.  \n>  \n>In Japan, the prestige of the uni is enough to set you for life and your major and GPA is largely irrelevant when applying for jobs since \'black companies\' will usually give the same set of instructions you all entrees simultaneously how to perform in the company.\n\nThat makes 0 sense. Most parents know that academic excellence do not come suddenly, but consistently or gradually. One quote by Aristotle is that \'excellence is a habit not an act\'. Don\'t tell me that Japanese adults are stupid and do not understand this. Also what gives you this impression towards the Japanese? From watching anime? After reading this post, my friends who watches anime asked if you watched too much anime, because this is purely sterotyping. I am not going to comment on the universities because I thought we were talking about pre-U education. Why are you stating ""black companies""? It\'s literally an exploitative sweatshop-type employment system. If you would want to compare, GPA also don\'t matter if Singaporeans apply to such companies lol.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>My reason for quoting this example was not to pin the blame of these institutions but rather to characterise how students from academically elite schools tend to be subjected to relatively more stress from the rigours of school compared to neighbourhood schools.  \n>  \n>I myself was struggling to keep up with HC and AC standard papers while sitting for O levels due to the stark contrast in academic difficulties between our two schools. I wanted to express how being in an elite institution while not being academically gifted like the rest can lead to a disproportionate amount of time being spent on schoolwork, which has the *potential* to be detrimental to their social, mental and emotional well being.\n\nIt is wrong to assume that harder papers means that it leads to more stress. Papers are set based on the students, they believe that we are capable to solve ""harder"" questions and we learn better from harder questions. Note that school exam papers are meant for us to learn from mistakes, so that we can do our best by the time its O levels. Schoolwork is supposed to give us pressure, and when we get used to it, we wouldn\'t breakdown as easily because of the pressure we had in school. However, I believe that the school would not give too much pressure, because they know that it will do more harm than good. That\'s why we start off with tutorials, then harder questions (supplementary questions for my school, which is based on past years Block Test/ Prelims/ Promos), then tests (which is about the same difficulty as supplementary questions. What I would say is that JC is not meant for everyone, if one is more suited to Poly\'s curriculum, then go poly. Most people should know that JC is not easy, and we need to complete about 2 times of O levels content in 2 years, thus there is no easy way out. If one chose JC, then face it, because the decision was made.\n\n \n\n>What I do have a problem with is kids being pressured to do their absolute best without considering their emotional health.  \n>  \n>What parents and teachers should do is *encourage* them in a *positive* manner to do their best as humanely possible for their assignments and tests rather than place strict criteria that have consequences attached to failure to achieve that benchmark.\n\nDo your school not have counsellors?

Don\'t assume that they take care of 0% of their mental health, even if there is, that will be a very small minority (it\'s unnatural for someone to only study without doing anything else).

Not cold hard facts, but interesting stories like how retarded Hitler was when he went south instead of going to Moscow --> one of the reason why he lost WW2 (I did ended up scoring quite well so it worked for me). It\'s really the approach to learning, if one learns by hardcore memorising, then that\'s their way, and I can\'t help them. Another example would be GP, and there is no cold hard facts for this subject (unless one decides to hardcore memorise). You can read everyday news for P1, AQ ect.

This is actually a really common phenomenon known as self-handicapping. It’s basically when you don’t try so that you can prevent harm to your self-esteem; when you think you’re gonna flunk so you give yourself a reason for flunking, “just in case”. If you think about it, the reason why you’re doing all this procrastinating etc. is so that your self-esteem doesn’t get hurt. If you’re interested in trying to stop self-handicapping, one way to do so is to reframe failure/not doing well. You’re basically creating a reason to excuse your (potential) bad grades. But what if said grades did not need an excuse? Why is a bad grade such a bad thing, and can you look at it differently? Maybe right now you feel as though your grades define your self-worth—can you change that? Maybe you could be worth something whether or not you do well on a test. \n\nImo I think the issue with guys might be related? I’m not sure but maybe it’s due to your self-esteem/self-worth being tied to your ability to maintain a front (I don’t know, maybe the impression that you’re a chill and relaxed person)?', 'dont self harm plsssss you can do it babe', ""This is eerily similar to what I've been doing lately,\n\n it's like the weeks leading up to the exam period, im like super motivated, study everyday for 6+ hours, do papers and all.

This really sucks because like I do know content and I did study, but like I 'give up' last minute because I'm scared~ and I end up getting like super average grades which really sucks because ppl expect me to do well (from being consistent before)\n\nI don't have any advice but this post made me not feel alone :)\n\nSo thank u :)"", 'Three things:  \n1) Whatever grade you get at the end of sem is no definitive, its not like A\'s where its just one big examination and the future is set in stone.\n\n2) Because of the liberty given by (1), your expectations largely drives your motivation to study or on the flipside procrastination too.

It's not the event which I'm sad about but the events triggers my memory to make me relive the traumatic moment (death of someone) and it also reminds me of all my failures in life. Sounds overly dramatic but I really have no idea how to describe it, sorry. 

I had an episode yesterday where I started crying on the train and even in macdonalds when I went to get lunch. Good thing I had a cap and mask so nobody could see a random kid crying in macdonalds lol

Before ytd's episode, I had another one about 2 months back. The funny thing is that the event which triggered my episode was me being scolded by my supervisor. Id consider that my worst episode because at one point I was crying so hard that I could barely catch my breath. Something like hyperventilating really bad. I even started to scratch and pinch myself unknowingly. This got me thinking If I would proceed to self harm in the future. I don't want to harm myself but sometimes things are very hard to control when you're in the middle of an episode. 

I've also had suicidal thoughts. No actions to suicide though. It's more of a ""I just wanna disappear right here, right now"". 

The thing is, I don't know if I should get help. I don't know if my episodes are frequent and serious enough to be ""help worthy"". It happens about once every 2 weeks to once a month. Normally I'd just pop a sleeping aid pill and try to sleep the sadness off. On days where I don't have my episode, I'm just a normal guy. A little introverted but likes to joke around with friends kind of guy. And also, maybe I'm good at hiding but none of my friends know that I'd rather die than live.

Medically transitioning has been good for me,but when your own parents give you snide remarks like 'you'll never be a real man' and 'no girl is gonna want to date you because you are still a woman' all you feel is empty and pain.

Treatment here is too expensive and I have no idea where I can get 15K to even do a SRS surgery  just to get my gender marker on my NRIC changed and that alone is already such a pain since I do have goals in life and I'm both a part-timer and a full time student and right now that's a really big amount of money.

My CA is also really transphobic and tells me that 'you're only trans because you're not a real Catholic'

The only people who respect me and treat me like a human are a handful of friends and the hospital staff but that's their job.
Since I just turned legal it's real hard to not relapse back into self harm and/or drug use.
I haven't met any other trans-men and would like to,but I'm just such a mess 

I want to have a wife and adopt kids in the future but my life right now is too much for me to even handle and I struggle to think that I'll have a life where I'll ever be happy.

Parents: If your kids are Transgender,don't deny us treatment or ridicule us for something that we can't control,unless you want them to wake up everyday wanting to kill themselves. Treat them with love and care and tell them it's okay,because that's all I want from mine.

PM_Me_Your_F00t,dv831j,Dad have a 10k+ debt that he incurred but is in my name,2019-11-12 18:15:48,singapore,378762,75,99,"We are a low income family with as of current, my 70 plus years old father working as an odd job worker and my sister presumably not earning more than 3k each month. I'm an adult but I plan to return to education next year, I'm saving up and using my own money for my own education, bills and expenses. I had a fallout with my father earlier on with a minor issue that he is constantly inconveniencing me with, the issue is causing me to have nose discomfort which he instead, turned to be angry at me and asked me to do something about it instead of him changing. I already have a strained and estranged relationship with him, where I do not talk more than 10 times to him in a year. And it is the same with my sister. I have a mother who is illiterate and does not understand how society norms work and I do not get financial support, emotional support from her as well. Following the anger of my father, I questioned him about the 10k debt that he incurred but is in my name, he revealed that he does not have the means to even pay a bit back monthly (which I asked him to, as it shows that he still have some responsibility in him). He flared up a lot of times during the quarrel and even threw things. I tried to calm down as well and asked him nicely and asked if he could talk to my sister and have it debted under her name instead as she is the one earning the most for now. Instead, he said that she doesn't have the money and I asked why should it be under my name then and he concluded that he will sell the house.

My father and I had a talk with one of the HDB advisor a few months back and selling the house back to HDB would mean a fixed sum sold back to us and we could only rent the current house for a few more years and then we will need to find our own places. Which of course, is a risky solution. My father kept insisting that he can sell the house and we will still have the house to live which confuses me, because this wasn't what the advisor has mentioned and he refused to explain further and simply dismissed me. I tried to call Income (the company that we are in debt to) but I broke down during the call and when a staff came on, I wasn't in a state to question why was the 10k+ debt simply credited to me just because my dad had bought an insurance policy for me years ago when I was smaller without my consent and why isn't the debt credited to my elder sister instead when she is the eldest.

I'm in midst of a national exams and it had already been a stressful period, managing my studying, finances, health and depression. Earlier on this year, I had severe negative and suicidal thoughts which I managed to get out of after breaking off a toxic relationship. My self-harm relapsed again after a 10-year period during the relationship too. I've been struggling with other issues too but I keep trying to feel better and I did but negative thoughts seeps back constantly and new issues keeps popping up. I have little to no means of relief. Today I just found out that the dad I tried to think good of, cared for despite his negligence in bringing me up is a selfish, bad tempered, unreasonable, biased, irresponsible father.

I'm sorry if this is long.  


Update: I've went to consult an income advisor and it's like what some of the comments have said. I'm able to clear off the loan with the cash value of the policy and so it's solved now. In fact, I will ending up with more money.

Dad has God complex and whenever we ask him to eat healthy or stop drinking, he intentionally does the opposite more as he thinks people are trying to ""challenge"" him. 

I'm so sick of constantly asking him to take care of his health... To make matters worse his mother is giving him all sorts of unhealthy fried stuff.. I don't know man. He currently does not have any serious health problems but is overweight and pre-diabetic and I know its only a matter of time before shit happens and we won't be able to afford the bills. 

It's really unfair if children are required to be responsible for this kind of selfish self harm attitude. I'm struggling with life myself already and won't be able to look after a man child like that 😭 

His stubbornness is next level and it's not like I can get him to see a counsellor or smth like that because he has God complex and won't listen to anybody... He won't even exercise when I ask him to go with me cos he's always 'tired'.. Then opens a beer. Wtf.

Hello everyone, I have seen a couple of posts here and in the sg reddit on where to/how to seek help.   

I would recommend going to a polyclinic for a consultation to get a referral. (This is what I did)

For the first visit, just get a GP consultation. You should tell the GP about your issues and request for a referral to see a psychologist. 

The appointment date will depend on the severity of your case. For me, I only waited for 1 week to see the doctor and psychologist at the polyclinic's health&mind clinic.

During your first visit, your psychologist will get to know you and understand your issues to come up with an appropriate treatment plan. So don't worry, he/she is there to help you. If you feel uncomfortable at anytime during the session, do voice out. You can even request for another psychologist.

As for the consultation with your doctor, they will determine your severity and if theres a need for medication. 

The follow up session should be a week or two after your first session.

The cost of each consultation will vary, as it depends on short/long consultation and types of medication.
For me, it costs about $60 (including govt subsidises) for both my psychologist long session, doctor's consultation and medication.

A little background of myself:
I had been diagnosed with Depression, Social Anxiety and Panic disorder by my psychologist at polyclinic and psychiatrist at IMH.
I have been on prozac since Sep/Nov 2019 and still going for my psychotherapy sessions at my polyclinic.

I may have missed out some stuff, but feel free to ask me via private message or here.

I'm in PES B1 according to the checkup I did last year (though I do have thalassemia minor as a blood disorder which I've declared, as well as a foot arch problem that they do not know of), and my enlistment date for the Tekong military camp is on this Wednesday, 12 August. I've been fretting over it ever since I got my enlistment letter just 3 weeks ago, especially after reading all the horror stories of overly strict and unfair commanders, nightmarish platoon mates and the whole range of high-key activities that I eventually have to do..

Personally, I suffer from depression and suicidal thoughts as well, but my cowardice has prevented me from acting on them. I haven't told MINDEF or any counselors or therapists in fear that such a condition marked on my name would close up all chances of a career path from me. I'm also aware of the stigmitisation that most people in Singapore have against people with mental illnesses such as this, that scares me...making this post scares me, I haven't been here long enough to know whether you guys are just like them..

I've been trying to open my mind up to NS, which has helped to a certain extent, but these worries still cloud over me. Will NS finally set me off, causing me to have mental breakdowns like some or even worse, acting on my self-harming urges? If I speak out, will my superiors come after and start giving me hell? Will they think I'm faking it even though it's genuine? What if I don't click well with my mates, will they bully for fun just like in high school? I honestly don't know..it just seems everyone's experience is too unique from one another to understand how it would actually go.

All along I knew something was up with me but all thru primary to uni, my counsellors never once suggested I go for a psychiatric assessment. I decided to take matters into my own hands and went to a polyclinic months ago for an IMH referral to see if I hav ADHD because of my poor work performance. Turns out I have PDD (persistent depressive disorder), and was finally diagnosed after struggling with my low mood, regular crying, anxiety and self-harm for the past 12 years (am 24).

I was prescribed Sertraline. I've been taking it for 2 days now. I'm feeling more anxious and the chest tightness (do other fellow depressive mood disorder sufferers feel this too?) and anxiety happens over a longer period than it usually does. Even as I type I'm feeling it.

Not sure if it's the meds, but I'm sure that the diagnosis has added on to my stress. I don't know what to think about this diagnosis. Nothing's changed really, I've just gotten a label to my behaviour. As of now I don't see the diagnosis as an answer. I don't know even know if I can trust that good things will come from this diagnosis. I also don't have anyone to speak to except my SO because I don't know how this will affect my relationships with my family and friends. I don't want them to think I'm using it as an excuse for my poor ability to keep up conversations. 

Please advise on how to cope with this new diagnosis.

I’m a secondary four student sitting for O’s I’ve recently spiralled into a mental health decline. I’ve been having suicidal thoughts since secondary two and since then on it has gotten worse. secondary three i reached out for help but i guess they never really took me seriously. now i’m secondary four and it seems to get worse and worse and i’m really exhausted. 

i have daily mental breakdowns, in school and at home. sometimes i have panic attacks that come out of nowhere. usually i would just go to the toilet to try and calm myself down but it takes more than a period so i go back to class in case i get suspected for truancy. in class, i never seem to be fully focused. thoughts of suicide always seem to be there and sometimes they’re really loud? i don’t know how to describe it, but sometimes it’s all i can think about. it’s like my mind is this whole jumbled mess of negative thoughts all the time, but on sine days some of the thoughts are louder than the others. sometimes, the idea of self-harm also lingers. i used to cut myself in secondary two, but i stopped. now the thoughts are coming back and it scares me. even simple things such a as red ink scribbled onto paper to cancel out words sort of puts me on edge. 

i feel really hopeless and unmotivated, yet i’m really worried about my o levels. it feels like there’s nothing i can do, ive tried so much things to help myself feel better but nothing seems to work/stick. i’ve been stuck in this slump since may around there. at first i thought it was just circuit breaker getting to me, but now that school has reopened it doesn’t seem to be the case. 

i don’t know what to do, at this rate i’m going to fail o’s. i’m really scared to reach out because the last time i did my father got mad at me. i’ve tried talking to my friends about it but it doesn’t seem to help either. and i keep hearing how therapy is useless, how expensive it is and redundant it is. so i don’t know, what if it doesn’t work for me and i’m stuck feeling like this forever?

it’s physically taken a toll on me as well. now i’ve started eating really little and no matter how much i sleep i feel like i’ve not slept at all. i cant even revise my subjects anymore. 

i don’t see the point in anything anymore. i’m really exhausted, i just want to be free. i’m really tired of feeling this way. i’m tired of everything. i’m so lost, i don’t know what to do and i’m tired of holding on. everything just feels so fucking pointless, i feel like no matter what i do i’ll bound to fail, so why even try?

i don’t know... a small part of me wants to get better, to seek help. but i’m such a fucking coward, i don’t dare to talk about how i feel because usually i get brushed off or people seem to think that i’m just being your typical teenager/i’m just being a whiny bitch. 

but then another part of me thinks that there’s no point, why should i get help? we’re all going to die anyways. some sooner than others, some planned or unplanned. 

i feel like i’m constantly at war with myself and somehow i seem to be losing. what should i do now?",0.67,https://www.reddit.com/r/MentalHealthSG/comments/h0zxf4/i_dont_know_what_to_do_and_i_may_need_help/,"['Hey, u/idkimanon \n\nI’m sorry you’re going through a tough time.

xentricescp,g632hj,I need help on my mental health.,2020-04-22 23:23:03,singapore,378762,19,50,"Hi everyone, I’m filing a PPO againts my father and I need it to be good enough for the court to take me seriously.

I need your honest opinion on will I be wasting my time or do you think I have a fair chance to win my case. I would ask the opinion of friends/family but I do not want a potentially biased view.

This is my story:


When I was younger, my father would constantly punish me by beating me up, slapping me or throw things near me. One of the items he used to throw away was my bicycle and my goods in front of my doorstep. The physical abuse stopped as I outgrew him physically, when i get bigger (around the age of 14) 
, but the mental torment still continues.

My father begins to purposely do things that irritates and causes me mental discomfort whenever things do not go his way. He will make irrational accusations towards me and when I tried to defend my rights rationally, he begins to call me slurs constantly and starts to imply demeaning words that made me questioned my worth. 

90% of the arguments boils down to him having an irrational or having bad thoughts about me regardless what I do or him communicating his terms poorly. These ill thoughts about me are usually based on his own assumptions without investigating the matter at hand. He will give an instruction/rule “A” today and I will comply but as weeks or month pasts, I will get scolded for doing as per instruction/rule “A” as he changed the instructions/rule to “B” without communicating his thoughts clearly. This often leaves me in a confused state and kills my self-confidence and self-worth. He will constantly bring up matters that happened years ago as a leverage to his arguments but when the same is being done towards, he will refuse to listen or accept it. This puts myself on edge not knowing if my actions (regardless how positive) will result in consequences or not. When his miscommunication is being pointed out, he will refuse to admit his wrong.

Over 10++ years, all these experiences have made me feel traumatised by loud noises and I feel afraid every time he is around. When confronted, he will ""apologies"" sarcastically and continue his negative behaviour without comprehending the matter in hand. When the topic of Divorce (for my mother) or applying for PPO he will make desperate promises and begin to hit his head on the wall or other unorthodox methods that will strike fear in me and my mom. We always give in and give him ample chances however; the situation will never get better. It will feel like a time bomb before he starts to provoke and use demeaning words again.

My father does not respect my personal boundaries often, provoking me mentally when I have my anxiety breakdowns. For example, he continues making loud noises (like throwing plates and cups when doing the dishes or slamming household items). 

He will begin to use Religion views or threaten to sabotage something that is important to me (example, he pulled similar ""trick"" on the morning of my engagement which causes my fiancee's family to question his behaviour which embarrassed me and could jeopardise my happiness. This is done purposefully in order to get me to comply) for his benefit and striking fear in me in order to remain in control or in power. When I try to talk things out rationally he will refuse to listen and when things get bad, he will begin to start self harming in order for us to comply to his terms.
As of right now, I am not able to live in the same roof as him. Every single noise makes my body twitch and my face pale. I will begin to shiver and have anxiety attack. I do not feel safe around him fearing he will try to purposefully provoke my mental state. He will always use the term ""I didint beat you up so why are you afraid"" as a justification of his actions.

You would also prove to the court that prolonged exposure to these abuse from your dad has resulted in ‘personal injury, physical pain or injury to physical or mental health’. As evidenced from your personal account, it is clear that he has caused severe trauma to your mental health and injured your relationships with your fiancée and her family. Your father seemed to also be capable of manipulating you and your mother, such as self-harming, in order to exert dominance over you. \n\nDisclaimer: I am not legally trained. But as an outsider, I believe that you have a case there. The application for PPO is available online or via agencies listed in the link down below. \n\nI am assuming that you are still going to be living with your father under one roof even after the PPO, if so I am afraid that it may not be helpful given your serious trauma with his very presence. The process of PPO is likely to take Long as well. If you have the resources,  consider exploring the Expedited Order (EO) which would last for 28days if you need the Order urgently (to protect you and your mother before the hearing). \n\nAlternatively, you may also consider Domestic Exclusion Order (DEO), which would bar your father from living in your house or parts of your house.\n\nI believe that it is best for your mental health if you are planning to move out as the PPO proceedings are ongoing. But I digress.\n\n<About PPO>\n\nIirc, PPO has to be served on your father. In some cases, he may need to appear in court if he chooses to accept/ contest the PPO. \n\nFrom my limited knowledge, if you want to make for a strong case, you must submit evidence of abuse as clearly seen from your post. As you may not recall exactly when various episodes/incidents of abuse have occured, it is still vital for you to document these episodes as much as your memory retains. As one fellow redditor has suggested, you may wish to seek a mental health professional to assist you in recalling and documenting what you have been through. I am sorry that you have to go through the unfortunate events yet another time. I believe a written document (such as your post) would come in very handy when you are making a case. \n\nTake care.\n\nConsider to look for professional legal services, or pro bono ones, if you require professional assistance during hearing:\n\n(Bottom half of the page: Resources...>Agencies)\n\nhttps://libguides.nus.edu.sg/Probono/Fam violence', 'OP, I relate to this so much.

I would recommend to go through family counselling and/or therapy to help all of you root out the trauma you and your mother are experiencing and the emotional blackmail that you are father is exhibiting.\n\nYou and your family needs to go through the process of acceptance and healing, otherwise, this scenario might manifest in your own family if and when you decide to get marry and have children of your own.

Get in touch with NCSS or IMH, they may be of help.  \n\nBut if your father would not budge and help in the process, then you take that PPO option yet you and your mom should still go through the process of healing which means accepting that it is what it is and that you are forgiving your father for doing those nasty things to you and your mom.  You also learn to forgive yourself in the process.\n\nAll the best.', 'The only right advice.

xangelicaxx,dry37f,[O Levels] Papers and depression?,2019-11-05 19:51:35,SGExams,77673,23,70,"Hey everyone, 

Sorry to have to express myself like this but writing actually helps me think and clear my head... :(

Today, I did my lit paper and I guess you can say it was the straw that broke the camels back. Literature was my last hope for my O levels because I really wanted to score well. Not only did I give bad answers, I didn’t finish my paper as well. At this point, all seems pretty hopeless and I’m just pretending I’m okay because I have no one to turn to. Smiling through the pain as though it doesn’t bother me...

One good thing about reddit is that it is pretty much anonymous so I guess I can really share how I feel. Most of my friends think I’m ‘smart’/‘hardworking’ because I score better than them by a couple of marks and it’s really suffocating when I say that I feel so scared about my results and that I’m about to have a break down. I just wanted some comfort or encouragement but it is just met with things like “Man it’s over, don’t care abt it anymore” or “Yeah it’s fine, you will still get your A1”. It is as though I have this pressure to do well or people will say stuff behind my back. I died a little inside when people said that the lit paper was easy...I feel so worthless.

I have aspirations to go to a specific top tier JC but no one but my family knows because I am ashamed to say that because I know that people will say that I’m not worthy. So I just lie and say I have no idea where I want to go after sec school.

I might be struggling with depression or anxiety but I’m not sure. No one really knows about this, not even my parents. I used to self-harm but haven’t done it in 8 months. It’s a step forward. Sometimes I don’t feel like I have genuine friends to confide in. I let people confide in me instead.  And yes, I’m the one that respond with encouragement to threads about depression and sadness because I don’t want them to feel alone...

No one will ever expect me to be “depressed” because I’m that clownish friend of yours from school...the one that is crazy and hyper energetic and is just talkative. I think that I’m genuinely happy sometimes but whenever I’m home alone, I just wanna cry so badly but I stop myself. Yes, I have been bullied before and most people assume I’m okay because I fake my happiness when I’m literally crumbling. I’m breaking down as I write this, its been awhile since I cried like this but I guess it helps me feel better...

If you have read so far, thank you for taking time to be part of my life spiritually, I guess. Do take time to care for your perpetually happy friends too, sometimes it’s not all that it seems on the surface. Remember bullying hurts too, just because we wear the same uniform doesn’t mean we have the same experience

It’s time for me to assume the role of the crazy friend again and be the source of joy to everyone...I hope you are happy with whoever you are. If I can’t, I hope someone else can :)

Personally, in my opinion, those who are seen as above average usually get those remarks from peers saying ""you will still get that A1"" even if they honestly found the paper genuinely hard and realistically have fears of doing badly. Being seen as smart shouldn\'t mean much as i feel it is superficial and it really has some negative connotations like others assuming you cannot relate to their struggles at all and that everything will be effortless. Smiling is personally how i choose to hide my emotions too and i am also usually energetic with people i know but honestly, i dont really care or feel much for most of them.

kay000000,e4q8uz,Need advice on Depression,2019-12-02 07:58:29,singapore,378762,31,62,"tl;dr brother (16) needs a new therapist. Where do I find a good and hopefully cheaper one?

My little brother (16) has been dealing with depression for about a year now. He's been getting better, but I think things have been going a little downwards lately, especially since my parents have been pushing him to get out of the house more and find a job.

He does have medication that he takes occasionally and used to go for more therapy sessions. But he stopped during O level period and hasn't gone recently. His therapist, in my opinion, isn't exactly the best. Before O levels, they had marked him a success case since he apparently stopped self harming which is great but somehow I dont think my brother agrees with that sentiment and it's kinda made him more conscious of his issues like imposter syndrome. They also tell my parents about things my brother shares during sessions which I feel is highly irresponsible. 

I'm looking for a new therapist who is preferably less expensive and focuses on kids around my brothers age as I'll be trying to finance him without my parents knowing as they're a big factor in how my brother feels about therapy and I don't have a full time job. Of course, cost isnt that big a deal. I'll sell my soul if it can get him some help... and I wont be keeping this from my parents forever but for now I'd like him to get his safe space back. 

Any advice is greatly appreciated.",0.87,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/e4q8uz/need_advice_on_depression/,"['Hey there! \n\nI’m currently going for therapy (counseling) at [Family Services Center](https://www.msf.gov.sg/policies/Strong-and-Stable-Families/Supporting-Families/Pages/Family-Service-Centres.aspx).

Sometimes the shoulder to cry on can get tired, and it’s always a good talking session anyway. Prevention is better than cure.', 'hello! some private clinics (at least those i’ve been to) are willing to charge a lower rate on a case-by-case basis, so it may be worthwhile checking. psychologists and therapists at imh are great but the time in between sessions made me go private. i’ve heard good reviews on clarity and their rates are reasonable. ultimately it’s really different for each patient. some may find one therapist’s methods useful whilst another may absolutely hate them. it took me a couple tries to find my current therapist and i’ve been seeing her since 2017. she even changed practice and i just followed her there. all the best to you and your brother. you really sound like a great older sibling :-)\n\nedit: also regarding doctor-patient confidentiality, there are cases where they can/have to break confidentiality. especially if the patient is a danger/threat to themself/others. however suicidal thoughts do not mean they will immediately inform their parents etc. but if they express an intent to act on those thoughts and have a plan to take their life therapists will intervene (suggesting hospitalisation etc.)', 'You can try CHAT, they can help evaluate the situation and recommend a specialist with subsidised cost.', '[deleted]', '[removed]', 'Have you tried the therapists at IMH?

For medications, I can only recommend public routes such as IMH. Going private is very expensive.\n\nAs for therapy: there are private practice therapists who offer discounts on a case-by-case basis. A quick Google search informs me that before such discounted rates, therapy can easily be at least $80/hr. If that is not viable, counselling at Family Service Centres is an option. They charge nominal fees based on circumstances (and in some cases, nothing at all). Other organisations such as REACH Youth / REACH Counselling may also be of help to you.\n\nYou can also approach CHAT to find out more about seeking help for your brother. They may be able to refer you to other subsidized routes that are not as well-known but just as effective.\n\nAs a last ditch effort: NTU and a few other universities (NUS and JCU, if I'm not wrong) offer counselling services to the public at affordable fees.

Have a quiet word to your parents and ask them if your brother had a debilitating physical injury would they still be prompting him to find work.  The stress of interviews and pressure to perform in a work environment is the last thing he needs especially when doing O-Levels.  I liken it to being harangued into running with a broken leg.  Changing therapists isn't going to help if his family support network is undermining any progress.\n\n> They also tell my parents about things my brother shares during sessions which I feel is highly irresponsible.\n\nI don't know the law in Singapore but as your brother is still a minor the therapist may be legally bound to tell the parents.  If not then it risks undermining any relationship between your brother and the therapist.  He won't want to share things he doesn't want his parents to know.  But essentially it still comes down to how your parents are using that knowledge.  They're the adults.  They're the ones that can most sabotage his rehabilitation by using it poorly."", ""Seconding this. I just started going to my neighbourhood FSC and really feel that they've created quite a lovely safe space for people.\n\nIf your brother still needs medication, I would encourage going to an FSC to continue counselling and talk therapy, but also go to a polyclinic to get a referral for a psychiatrist at a government hospital. It is a lot cheaper than going private and he can pay using medisave. The downside is that the waiting time for the first appointment can be very long, and even when you have an appointment you probably still have to wait quite a long time to see the doctor.

Edit:My family has been supportive of me and they love me a lot and I always try to not think of suicide because if I really do suicide, they will be devastated and I am an only child so I wonder who would take care of my parents if I really attempted and died successfully? 

I have sought professional help since 2014. Am also seeing the school counsellors apart form the psychologist and psychiatrist. My Uni has been giving a lot of support to me in different forms... 

Okay confiding here isn't the best idea ever...
But yeah I have a history of several mental illnesses including anxiety, depression and panic disorder. And even though I searched through reddit SGExams, there are only several people struggling with both anxiety and depression and to such an extent. I feel like I'm doing very badly and quite alone in this and would like to reach out to more people going through all this. :(

I am a year 1 student trying my best to succeed academically in university. I am still in my first semester and just finished week 11. If you guys read through this and think you might know who is it in real life that posted this, please do not say it out. You can PM me but please respect my privacy. This is all very personal stuff and I'm only asking for tips to survive Uni bcos I really don't want to get to the point of attempting suicide... 

Feeling so tired and drained out and yet I don't want my peers who see me around Uni to know I am actually struggling a lot and have thoughts of suicide so I try to look normal and as happy as I can as I want to spread only positivity and not negativity. Furthermore, many of my friends are stressed as Finals are coming up soon in a month's time so I don't want to confide in most of them and I know things have been quite hard for them to manage as well. 

I have been receiving a lot of help in Uni but it makes me feel like I am a very needy student that can't be independent and strong enough to cope with Uni life and I hate myself for that. I wish I didn't need to live anymore...

My history of depression and anxiety came from my personality as I am naturally anxious and get easily upset. I am very sensitive too.

But it was worsened due to bullying in primary school and academic stress as well as in secondary school. My ex classmates would avoid me, laugh and mock me and even my suicide attempt in primary school and made something called a ""virus"" where people don't want to be in contact with me.

Secondary school was even worse and I had been told to commit suicide, cut myself and even got physically hurt by a guy who threw a chair and it hit my left arm. Psychologically, it brought on a lot of trauma and stress and I developed PTSD from it that until now I have recurrent nightmares and flashbacks relating to school. 

JC was better in the sense it was just rumour spreading and unwarranted hate but the students in my jc didn't dare to do much.

All along, i have been struggling with the support of school, family and mental health professionals. 
I am also taking medications to cope with the mental illnesses that never seem to go away. 

The anxiety I face in Uni continues and gets worse as Uni module contents are very heavy and the workload is a lot, more so than JC. I am just lucky that I am taking a course and modules that I like and am passionate about or it might have been far more difficult for me... I feel suicidal out of the blue and the sudden anxiety and panic attacks come, apart from the constant anxiety, apprehension, fear, uneasiness and stress and its affecting my sleep. I sleep very late at night as the insomnia is damn bad and I wake up exhausted too. Sometimes I feel sad even when I feel happy a minute ago and when things are going well, I feel sad for no reason and ready to die. 

Has anyone felt this way? I hope that I'm not the only person struggling now...

snowpyne,bkvcgq,Musings of an LGBT individual,2019-05-05 16:08:19,singapore,378762,77,268,"I decided to write this post after there was a resurgence of the LGBT topics here in the sub. I’ve been reading them frequently and am honestly amazed at the knowledge people have. I’ll admit that I’m not really familiar with most of the technical and logical theories that people have brought up.

&#x200B;

This led me to question the best way to reach out and appeal to the anti-LGBT groups: by logical arguments and technical knowledge or by appealing to emotions? I don’t have the answer but I figured sharing one's experience as an LGBT individual could help people to understand better what individuals in our community go through. Of course, this is not necessarily applicable to every LGBT individual as everyone comes from different socioeconomic backgrounds. This is my own experience and perceptions.

&#x200B;

The one thing that I wish people understood is how our sexuality is involved and brought into question into almost every aspect of our lives. And this begins the moment we start discovering ourselves.

&#x200B;

During school

>Why am I different from the other boys in school?  
Is there something wrong with me?  
How come the religion that I was brought up with says that I’m a bad person? I haven’t done anything evil or malicious towards anyone?  
How will my parents react? Will they be angry or disappointed? I will never be the son that they wanted and I won’t be able to have a family. Should I tell them? What if they pass away before knowing the real me? Will other people, such as my friends, treat me differently if they knew about it?

Couple this with the usual teenage angst, body and self-esteem issues, and it’s the perfect recipe for mental health issues. I started self-harming.

&#x200B;

National Service

>Should I declare?  
What if I don’t and I get bullied by the other guys?

In the end, I did not declare. But figured I should just share with the MO what I was experiencing: that I liked guys more than girls. I was still figuring myself out. But the MO dictated that I should come down for another visit with my parents. I couldn’t leave them in the dark so I had to come out to them even though I wasn’t ready. They dismissed it as a phase. I was assigned to PES C. Initially I thought it was because of my asthma, but apparently it was because the MO deemed me effeminate. It was then that I realized that people like me will never be accepted in these spheres, where they still see LGBT issues as a medical condition. I wasn’t even granted security clearance.

&#x200B;

University

It was here where I finally embraced my identity. The things I learnt made me realize that there was nothing wrong with me. That the world is never black and white and that individuals experience life differently. Even things like religion, where everyone has different interpretations and that there’s no one person who can dictate that their interpretation is the right one. Of course, I understand that some may argue that this is self-serving, that I was justifying myself. But still, I finally felt that life was coming together for me, and that there’s a future. I also finally sought treatment for my mental health, where I was diagnosed with dysthymia.

&#x200B;

But then, issues started to arise again. I had to think about what exactly is my future.

>I am not able to buy a house until I am 35  
If I want to start a family, it won’t be possible here. Same-sex marriage is not recognised. Having children through adoption/surrogacy is difficult. In the event that one of us is suffering from health issues, we cannot make decisions on behalf of each other.  
This means that I would have to move. This could be a stressful process, both emotionally and financially.  
But then my family and friends are also here. Why am I being forced to choose between them and my own life?  
Will my sexuality be an issue when I apply for jobs, especially for government ones? I recently applied for a job and got into the selection rounds. But when they asked about my PES status, I decided to be truthful. I was eventually unsuccessful in going to the next round. I will never know if it was my lack of ability or due to my sexuality.

&#x200B;

It almost seems like normal, heterosexual people have a general outline and framework that they can work with to guide their lives. Graduate, find a job, get married and have kids. But for LGBT individuals, every decision and milestone of our lives has to be carefully considered about how it will affect the future that we want.

LGBT individuals also have dreams and aspirations. We don’t want special privileges or rights. All we want are inclusive policies and rights so that we can actually lead our lives normally, just like other people.

I apologise if some aspects of this are incoherent or debatable. Please correct me if I’m wrong. I just wanted to get this off my chest.",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/bkvcgq/musings_of_an_lgbt_individual/,"['This post was timely considering how one of my gay friends was telling me earlier today about having to choose between his homophobic family and living his own life as who he truly is.

I think LGBT debates are often treated as just that, just debates, but for us it's just our own personal lives, and you did a great job in sharing that aspect of the discussion. Honestly, seeing these issues being discussed over and over can be exhausting, because sometimes you just get tired of your life being treated as a Topic of Debate. But it can also be very rewarding, because the more people speak up like you, the more people who aren't part of the community will understand us. While these discussions can show the nasty side of humanity, it's also encouraging to see just how many people are willing to treat us kindly and support us. \n\nSo thank you OP, and everyone who has been contributing to the recent discussions.

They keep their work and private lives separate, and they don\'t seem to be penalised for it. They work hard, and they get promoted.

In other private sectors, you hear the occasional ""my partner"" dropped into a discussion over their last holidays.  \n\nIdeally of course, we want everyone to have the same rights. You should be able to marry, adopt and everyone below 35 who can afford it should be able to own their house if they can. That\'s why the fight for LGBT rights is so important - it\'s about equality for all. But at the same time, your sexual orientation is just one aspect of you. Don\'t let it be the deciding factor in your career or as to whether you should apply for a job in XX sector. If you feel a work environment doesn\'t seem to fit you, move on.

Furthermore, I disagree that surrogacy should be loosened up for anybody, straight or otherwise. It is immensely tricky as an ethical and moral issue, and I see far too many LGBT individuals think that their entire basis of legitimacy in society is to break the final barrier of having biological kids for themselves the same as straight people do. That\'s not healthy, and that shouldn\'t be encouraged.

For the past few months, i have emotionally pain due to family problems, stress and depress. I'm not gonna say my story here cause it's long and my english is not good. It also didn't help that this family problems issue happened 2 weeks before i enlistment. I manage to control my emotion during BMT but ever since i step into new unit, it becomes worse.

Just to be clear, i am NOT thinking about suicide or self harm currently. Suicide is stupid and it will make things worse. However, my mental can be a problem and it can happen in the future (just hope not).

i'm a student, and i've been looking to seek professional help for a while now.

i've dealt with suicidal ideation, hopelessness, excessive and depressive rumination, self-harm and constant fatigue for the last, maybe, four to five years? the severity of these thoughts and behaviours really do fluctuate a lot from time to time, and my mental state is quite far from what i think was the worst it's been, but i know that where i am right now might not be particularly good either. 

i wish to understand why i feel what i feel. i'd like an objective, professional opinion - whether this ongoing issue of mine is truly due to, i don't know, a chemical deficiency or medical condition, and not from my overimagination or an overexaggeration of my emotions. and maybe, if what i feel is real, get better with their help.

i have two options right now - approach the school counsellor, or book an appointment with CHAT. i have issues with both options, though, due to privacy and other concerns. i am aware that my school counsellor is legally bound to inform my parents if i am a danger to myself (i am, but i'm dealing with it and i can't involve them - the consequences are more disastrous if they somehow get involved), and that (as i'm from a school in which gossip spreads like wildfire) teachers and classmates/schoolmates will know about me seeking help. in terms of CHAT, i hear their appointments are booked pretty far in advance. i don't think i will be able to commit to something so far away without my parents' initial notice - they make plans often which i can't get out of, and i have (to prepare for) upcoming major examinations. and i'm afraid that they will contact my parents if i disclose my suicidal/self-destructive tendencies. i also fear i'm taking away an opportunity some others need direly - if i've lived with this for so long, why should i need to get help? if i can already (kind of) deal with this, why take an unnecessary step forward? i don't need the help - i just want the help. and that makes me feel so, so guilty.

Simply put, i think i may have depression and anxiety but I have not been officially diagnosed, and don't know if I should see a doctor about it. I've been going through quite a bit, though I'm only 19, and I honestly thought about killing myself last night (definitely not the first time). This isn't something I can tell my parents as I know they wouldn't understand and they'd just feel hurt.

My main question is, what should I do? I'll be entering the army soon, and I'm quite certain I'd be sent to the counsellor due to my scars.

No depression or anxiety but you don\'t really feel happy or excited. Heart beat became extremely regular and calm. Weaning was no problem and I was doing regular  exercise so that helped.

Great_Environment381,nwiok2,"A letter to our beloved Singapore Chinese - with pain, tears, hope for love and solidarity",2021-06-10 16:38:38,singapore,378762,152,534,"(The below words are from Ms. Kokila Annamalai, a fellow Singaporean Tamil, about her thoughts on recent happenings, and a call out to our majority non-racist Singapore Chinese friends to stand up and be counted)


It's difficult to explain why amongst so many acts of racist aggression and staggering hostility that we have all borne witness to lately, this one made me come undone. Is it the desecration of the prayer bell, that is a sound of great comfort, peace and transcendence? Is it because this is the same bell that our friends rang with love at my wedding? Is it that our brother in the video continues his ritual seamlessly, so composed and self-possessed, refusing to recoil or shrink away from this shameful bullying? Is it because once again, this hostility was displayed by a neighbour, and I too have felt deeply unsettled in my own home because of neighbours' racist behaviours? Because so many of us work so hard to make our homes a sanctuary we can retreat to, away from an often alienating and harsh world, but are reminded that this, too, cannot be ours? Or is it because it comes on the back of so many other incidents that have made me and every other Indian person I know more nervous on public transport or walking down the street?

If I had to put my finger on one reason, though, I think it would be this - I can see her face in the video. I can see the unmasked hatred, the mocking expression, the contempt, the disgust, the spite, the vindictiveness. In her face, I see how she planned this, how all this anger has been festering in her, how she got her prop ready and took time out of her day to disrupt this family's sacred practice, and let them know just how much she detests them and their practices.

In her face, I see all the ""apuneneh""s and ""keling-kia""s that children screamed in our faces, all the impatient Chinese shop owners who ""tsk"" at us, who bark ""what you want?"" at us, I see every time my friends and I have been made to feel like pests, I see the woman who spat at me and my lover on a train, I see the source of the shame I know we have all felt about the intimate, beautiful things our families, cultures and lands have given us - our coconut oil, our pottu, our incense, our kuzhambus (or curries, to you), the way our tongues rolls, our dark skin, the dance numbers in our films, our deities, our bells. 

In her face, I see the root of why so many Tamil folks in Singapore distance themselves from anything that could attract taunting and derision from their Chinese peers, including each other. Because what won't we give, so that someone never looks at us that way? Too much. Enough to lead to an existential loneliness later in life, a yearning that cannot be fulfilled. 

Racial contempt taints everything. I know because I know that the sounds of gongs, cymbals and drums that accompany lion dance - sounds of familiarity I have always relished, even when they awaken me too early on a Sunday morning - will now always remind me of this woman, and her face full of hatred. 

What solidarity means, is for Chinese people - perhaps other neighbours, friends of Livanesh/his family, but best of all, friends/family of this woman - to reach out to Livanesh, ask him what he and his family need, and offer to speak to this woman and her family. To then support this woman in acknowledging the harm of her actions, and hold herself accountable to putting things right. To explore with her what factors in her environment allowed her to believe she could act in such a manner, and commit to transforming those conditions. 

Livanesh's family deserves to live and practice their faith in peace, and live as equals among their neighbours. They deserve to receive an unconditional apology and amends - whatever that looks like to them - for the disrespect and bullying they've been subject to. And Chinese people who consider themselves anti-racist - this is an invitation to step up and take responsibility for trying to make this happen.

We - especially Chinese people, but in fact all of us - might feel release in making this woman out to be a monster, setting ourselves apart from her. But the much more difficult, scary and transformative work, is in recognising her ordinariness. In recognising that these monstrosities lurk everywhere, within all of us to some extent, and we need each other to exorcise them.",0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nwiok2/a_letter_to_our_beloved_singapore_chinese_with/,"['OP has flaired the post with the ""Serious Discussion"" flair.

They do not purchase or wear traditional attire, they severely downplay knowledge or fluency in their 2nd language, they do not even acknowledge watching, listening to, or enjoying cultural movies and music. _(In essence, they become secretive about anything they appreciate, or enjoy, about the 'indian' portion of their Singaporean identity)._ To them, all of the above is, in public, both a weakness and an unravelling - both of which they can do without. \n\nWorse still, perhaps, is that many have mastered the art of self-deprecation in this regard.

It wasn\'t until I had some Indian friends that it woke me up to the extent of racial discrimination faced by SG minorities. It might not be the dangerous sort, but it is bad enough to hurt them emotionally and many do carry years of emotional baggage due to the episodes of discrimination. \n\nBefore any of us majority brush it off, ask yourself if you even have closer minority friends who are comfortable enough to share their personal experiences with you? Discrimination exist, it\'s you who are ignorant. You think  they dont know the slurs and jokes told behind their back and it doesn\'t hurt them?\n\nIt\'s time we dig this up, have conversations and face it head on.

Its difficult to admit that we have been silent partners to this crime that has been going on beneath the surface. We have been deaf and immune to what we have heard or seen right before our very eyes. To that, we plead guilty!\n\nThank you for opening our eyes. We must resolve to fight this vile strain with love and hope.', 'I\'ll pen my thoughts based on what I\'ve seen in this subreddit that I sincerely feel would help in discussing the topic at hand here.\n\nFor starters, I was very hesitant to even type this. However, I feel that this climate of fear would ultimately not help in the long run.\n\nWhat am I talking about when I say fear?\n\nFear that my questions asked in all sincerity would be mocked and invalidated.\n\nIn the context of the gong incident, There was a question about the viability of the religious ritual being practised indoors. Ironically, I found an answer on Facebook of all places. I don\'t think I\'ve seen an answer that was not confrontational or snide over here. I\'ll take a look at the thread again after this, and if I was wrong I\'d correct what I said. This was the answer I saw on Facebook: [https://i.imgur.com/IV5Sktd.png](https://i.imgur.com/IV5Sktd.png)\n\nWould it be helpful if there were no stupid questions? Can we, as a community, try to understand that no matter how dumb or insignificant a question may seem, it doesn\'t help the asker\'s confidence to be shot down just like this. Someone may really just want to know!\n\nNext would be the fear of expressing opposing or even slightly different viewpoints. In this case, there is a clear divide between people who think that the incident was racist, and those who do not. Those who did not think that it was racist were met with comments like ""eh fuck you lah can listen to minority voices more"" ""you from SAP school isit"" ""next time you burn joss papers I go kick you see how""\n\nI get that we will never understand how a minority would feel or perceive things. That\'s what we might be trying to do, to try empathise and understand the situation at hand. Rude comments, whether which side of things you are on, has the potential to alienate the other party further. Viewpoints can change, it may not be overnight, so give us a chance too.\n\nAnother point would be the audience. I will use the example of a post from yesterday about a SPH publication claiming that Critical Race Theory was one of the reasons that led to racial tensions. I\'ve seen some redditors try to explain it, but there are differing opinions on what it is. I\'ll say that I honestly don\'t know what it is.\n\nConsider a layman reading that post, will he or she research on what CRT was? If so, are the chances high that it might be comprehended wrongly? As it was a movement that started in the USA, would left/right wing media portray it differently? For any cause, you would want to win over as many people as possible. Maybe there are no simple terms that can describe such a complex issue, but I\'m not someone versed in all these, so if there are, using something simpler can help you reach more people.\n\nI get that it\'s the internet and you probably can\'t stop certain things from happening, but in the context of what OP has said, the above 3 points would be what I would start with in discussions that might be of a serious nature. To foster inclusivity, maybe we need inclusivity among ourselves to start with.\n\nEdit: Another point\n\n/u/gleophas talked about Hindu customs & rituals an hour ago, thank you!\n\n[https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nvzbl9/neighbour\\_clangs\\_gong\\_repeatedly\\_as\\_man\\_in\\_spore/h19r5dh/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nvzbl9/neighbour_clangs_gong_repeatedly_as_man_in_spore/h19r5dh/)', 'fellow chinese here, and i promise to speak out when i hear any racist remarks in real life', ""The reason for me to post this, is not to discuss about the video or the separate incidences that has happened to minorities lately, specifically. \n\nBut I do hope, we can share our thoughts and strategies on how we can stand up, speak out, and come together in solidarity. \n\nI think enough words have been raised for whether there is racism in Singapore, whether individual incidences are racist or not and how the minorities feel. \n\nLet's try to bring the conversation, to what can be done and should be done by the majority as an ally against discrimination, bigotry and ignorance against any minorities (not limited to racial or religious).\n\n**Important Note: I know ppl are trying hard to downvote this post.

sarahforest,o38ozw,I was racist. But I want to do better.,2021-06-19 13:04:08,singapore,378762,137,274,"**Disclaimer:** Just sharing some shower thoughts. If I am being insensitive or rude in any part of this post, please call me out in the comments. I want to learn, I want to do better. Also, I'm of the Chinese race if it matters.

**Ok so here goes:** Lately, there have been a few incidents that highlight the racism that exists in our society. I saw posts and videos of people of minority races responding to these incidents, and speaking up about the racism they have encountered in their lives. It broke my heart. I want to do better.

I want to do better, because racism (whether overt or casual) hurts people. It hurts the people the comments are directed at, and indirectly hurts the people in our society because it creates a culture that says that ""hey, racism is ok, bullying is ok"". When it is not.

What really stood out to me was this model/celebrity's(?) video calling us out on how we're pretending that racism is a recent phenomena. She explains that people of the minority races tend to have memories of racist encounters that go all the way back in their childhood. Man, how is this ok? How is it ok that we're so mean to kids, and teaching them from a young age that they're lesser than others? How is it ok that we're giving them trauma that they carry with them, and that they have to work extra hard to come to terms with and get rid of?

You know all the nasty comments that we make. Harmful comments like ""eh later APNN come and catch you"". We may think it's just a casual comment, but that's super hurtful. That's like people saying ""eh be careful ah, later a Chinese catch you and fk up your sense of self-worth with racism"". At least there is some truth in the second statement given our behavior recently caught on tape. So can we please stop doing this? Can we treat everyone with acceptance and respect?

We also have to stop tying wrongdoings to people's races. If someone is an a$$hole, then only HE/SHE is the a$$hole. Not his/her entire race. Because I don't see this happen with good things. So let's stop overgeneralizing just because it's convenient to do so. It is just not meaningful to make such conclusions about people based on their skin color.

Also, I used to be one of those people who didn't believe in Chinese privilege in Singapore. I thought, ""How can I be privileged? I still have a bunch of problems."" But I decided to educate myself on the subject and boy, did it open my eyes. For the people who still don't believe in Chinese privilege, I strongly recommend this article from Harvard Business School: [https://hbr.org/2018/09/use-your-everyday-privilege-to-help-others](https://hbr.org/2018/09/use-your-everyday-privilege-to-help-others)

Chinese privilege is a type of ordinary privilege. And we should use this to help and not hurt others. We can do better as a society. Personally, I want to do better. Who's with me? :)

Peace.

We all have freedoms and we have our priorities in life. If someone chooses to be focused on their vocation and have little interest in societal or political issues, why should they be blamed for causing unintentional hurt to others simply because they don't understand it well.\nThis is taking away your given right to freedom to pursue your own interests and serve the community by performing well in those areas.\n\n2. There is only hurt when you choose to feel that way. If someone came up to me and said oh you are an engineer... but I'm actually a research scientist, should I feel offended because they mislabelled me or have no concept of difference? No. It is the same thing with race or religion or any other matter. You can choose to be offended, or you can choose to laugh it off and brush it aside. if you want to, of course you can have a civil discussion to clear up the differences but that's simply a day to day interaction between individuals or small groups of people. It doesn't have to be a full blown issue. If you intentionally think that everyone who made an insensitive remark is out to get you and your race, then you have a major issue. \n\n3. Grow up and be tolerant and know that there's more to life than race. Just as we celebrate gender equality, we know that there's differences between genders. With race, we are all equal but we have our differences and we can celebrate that even though we do not fully comprehend it. Even within a race, there's so many differences and complexity in our way of life and opinions.

Especially in a society like Singapore where it prides itself for its fair system based on meritocracy. But meritocracy is blinded to differences in income level, disability, race. It assumes a level playing field that doesn't exist.\n\nIn putting yourself in another's shoes, it might be helpful to think how would one feel if another person/the society thought this about oneself.

The casual racism in Singapore is not as simple as that. As stated by the OP, it includes things like ""eh later APNN come and catch you"" being told to young children, giving them the impression that Indians are kidnappers that prey on careless children. Even jokes like “wah room too dark only can see your teeth” can be hurtful as it targets someone for something they are born as and cannot change. \n\nIt seems that like most others, you focus a lot more on the intent of the statement. However, the impact is equally, if not more, important. And the impact is usually only felt by the receiver.

Imagine if a group of people find the colour blue offensive instead, because the colour has a negative historical impact on them. The situation would be much different right?\n\nBy your explanation, it shows you have never been under the prolonged influence of racism and hurtful things being said to you from a very young age.

It means exactly that.\n\nFirst: race is an obsolete term used in 1930 - 1950 to categorise 4 major groups, and although many might thing ""Asian"" was considered a race, the correct group is ""Mongoloid"" and includes also Native Americans.   \n\n\nSecond: Chinese will never be a race and neither a subgroup, because the ethnic groups are actually too big and diverse (there are Mongoloid, Uygur, Han, Dai, and many many others) coming from different major groups.   \n\n\nYou can say that Chinese are a culture or a people, but even in that case the only thing in common will be the passport.', ""> If a group of people are hurt or angry at ALL Chinese people due to experiencing racism from SOME Chinese people, they are equally guilty of being racist isn't it?\n\nI think it’s more of a normal human defense mechanism, where if you’ve been repeatedly hurt by a group of people it would be natural to be angry at or wary of them, and I don’t think it’s right or helpful to ask them not to be.\n\nBut this also assumes that the hurt and anger is due to specific major racist incidents or attacks. If so, I agree it would be unfair to blame all Chinese people. But if that hurt and anger is instead due to an overall social atmosphere of being treated as different (maliciously or not), and a lifetime of teasing/insults/exclusion/discrimination because of their race, then I do think Chinese people as a whole are guilty. I know was guilty of contributing to that, even though it was out of ignorance because I was young and didn’t know better.

Or not. \n\nUp to you. You can most definitely continue being like you now, doing whatever you like without consideration of others, even if people are saying “hey you’re hurting me”.

teochewlang,nuz0sg,[Uni] An encouragement for all who got rejected from uni this year,2021-06-08 15:26:33,SGExams,77673,26,463,"TL;DR Graduated poly with GPA 2.4 in 2017, got offered a place in SIT in 2021 after walking through the narrow path no one wishes to take, but maybe you might.

I don't know who needs to hear this, but it's better you hear it from me today. If you have been rejected by university this year, I'm here to tell you I have been through that and you are not alone. Today, I managed to get in. Here's a little background of my admission results for 2021:

Status: Cleared both KIRA and F2F interview end-April, offered and accepted mid-May, deferred to 2022 (will share more below)

Poly GPA: 2.4 (yes you read that right, it's two point four)

Portfolio: Regular technician in SAF since 2017 and everything else that doesn't matter

Remarks:

Here's my story. I graduated from NP with a GPA of 2.4 in 2017 (regret squandering my life away by gaming). I was the last in my humble cohort of 47 people (2 classes only). 2nd last guy was my FYP partner who got GPA 2.8. The stark difference between his GPA and mine didn't deter me from trying to enrol into a local uni.

I applied for mechanical engineering in SIT in 2017 but got rejected without even an interview. I was so distraught that I decided to sign on in the SAF to prove that I'm still useful compared to all my peers in Poly. For reference, 98% of my poly course peers went university. I'm that 2%.

Signed on as a technician but didn't even bother trying to apply for university throughout the last 3 years. How could I ever enter local uni with a GPA so cui. This year, 2021, I decided to toss another coin into the fountain to see where it would land. And to my shock, it finally landed at the spot I wanted it to, after 4 long years of being in the SAF (could have ORDed twice).

Unfortunately, my contract only ends 2022 since I just got promoted. So I have to defer to AY2022/23. If you ask me if I ever regretted signing on, I'd say a firm no. I've learnt so much in these few years. I can safely tell you that more than half the university students entered a degree program without plans for what they wanna do in the future (I witnessed my peers suffer).

You won't truly know what you want if you don't know what you don't want.

I, (nric rank & name), don't want to be in the inefficient SAF for life. Still, my officers invited me to return as an officer in the future, but seriously, no thanks. HAHAHA. I've learnt so much by talking to so many different batches of NSFs. Where they are going in life, where they think they are going, and where they actually go.

A little bit of working experience definitely won't do much harm to you if you are rejected by university today. In fact, you will gain the much needed clarity and realise for yourself what you really want and don't want. For what's worth, your choice of degree might even change (as mine did) after exploring your options.

Of course, I do admit I initially signed on just to show others that I'm as capable. Granted, I have enough savings now to pay off my entire university fees and even self-sustain through the next 4 years. But to be fair, if I had gotten into uni back in 2017, I wouldn't be the man I am today.

Lastly, to all others who got rejected by the 3 big uni and still have a slot in SIT, consider yourself fortunate. SIT may be a last-resort choice to you guys, but SIT was my main source of motivation and drive for the last 4 years. It's a new and fresh chance given to me and you can bet I'm gonna give it my all this time.

Far-Explanation-3736,nu4xti,[Rant] Personal experience: What is PW like for an introvert?,2021-06-07 13:33:54,SGExams,77673,14,171,"Im a J1 this year and I am a huge introvert.

However, during pw discussions, I always tried to step out of my comfort zone to speak up and offer my ideas, as I felt the need to contribute in my pw group. Although I was normally quieter than other group mates during discussions, I managed to offer some quality ideas/thoughts relevant to the topic, and listened attentively throughout all the video calls which we have almost everyday...
It was really tiring and draining for my mental health but yes, I knew I had to try my best to speak up, living in this unfair society that favours extroverts.

In addition, before every meeting/discussion, I would do research or come up with prior ideas to prepare myself for the discussion. After discussion, I would sometimes even go beyond my assigned work to do extra work/research for the group. I attended every pw meeting and consultation, despite my huge workload as a J1 student

Because of my effort and diligence, I could sense that 3/4 of them were grateful towards me and appreciated my contributions as a group mate. Whenever I had something to say, they were usually willing to listen and give consideration my ideas.

Yet, there is this one group mate who seems to look down on me for my introversion. Yes, I did speak up to contribute ideas whenever we were discussing the topic. However, whenever my group trails off to talk about stuff away from pw (sch life, jokes, teasing one another), I often remain totally silent, not because I was unable to say anything, but purely because I didn't have the motivation to. I do not really like them as friends as I feel kinda awkward with them and Im happy with keeping the basic grp mate relationship with them. 

So, I would remain silent until they stop talking their ""nonsense"" and return back to the topic of discussion. Despite being left out of their friend convos, I was satisfied as I felt comfortable in our discussion convos.

Ok, so back to the group mate who looks down on me, let's call that person XXX. I could sense that XXX looked down on me from the start but I thought it didn't matter as long as I contribute well to the group. 

YET, XXX KEEPS ON PICKING ON ME FOR MY INTROVERSION. I do not want to go into the details in case anyone finds out my identity, but XXX often gives sarcastic remarks and mocks me for speaking lesser. I try not to seem hurt by XXX's remarks in front of the group, but I can't deny that I am. So now, in addition to contributing ideas to the topic, am I expected to join in their nonsense convo? Is this a requirement of a pw group mate? Bruhhhh

I get that as humans, we have social instincts and crave social interaction, so I don't blame the others for talking more to one another. I just hope that people like XXX would stop picking on me and making me uncomfortable for my introversion... Like, what can be so wrong with being quieter than others in the group??? I thought that as long as I contribute sufficiently to the group project, my group mates would not have any reason to pick on me.... 

This is not the first time such stuff has happened to me in life and I just want to vent my anger.... I was even bullied in the past due to my introverted nature despite doing no harm to others, that period of bullying really took a toll on my self esteem, and made me even quieter... I wanted to change into an extrovert thinking that I would be more favoured, but it is just so hard and tiring. Over the years, I learnt to accept and embrace my introversion better, but why it is that I still feel discriminated in this society?

I am not hating on extroverts as they have done nothing wrong, but some of them just don't seem to understand that there are introverts in the world who prefer quiet and alone time.... I dislike my pw group in the sense that they are all extroverted (at least more than me) and seem to view me like another species...(I would not delve into the details of the other members)

Yes, 3/4 of them do appreciate me as a group mate, but ALL of them do not like me in any other way. I feel so sad thinking that my life in the workplace could potentially be like this... I am responsible, hardworking and determined, but I am just not extroverted......",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nu4xti/rant_personal_experience_what_is_pw_like_for_an/,"['I feel your pain.', 'hey OP, i just wanted to say that it’s really great that you’ve been making an effort for PW, despite your introverted nature! you’re the kind of group member that i would’ve liked to have for my project ^ ^ ; \n\nit’s really unfair that XXX has been making fun of you for not participating in friendly conversation; personally, i’d be far more insulted if someone faked interest instead of politely minding their own business. at least your other 3 group mates appreciate you, and that’s three out of four already! XXX is clearly the outlier in this situation, so focus on the positive :) \n\nsince you aren’t interested in making friends, i’d advise you to just concentrate on the project. haters gonna hate :P consider it practice for the real world, where you’ll probably have to deal with less-than-savoury personalities while keeping your cool :’D if you want to resolve the situation, you could try asking your groupmates for support, or talking to XXX directly. i wouldn’t recommend going to the teacher unless you want to escalate the situation (and maybe burn some bridges 😅)\n\nthe working world isn’t as bad as school! adults *generally* have more professionalism and understand the concept of ‘working relationships’ better, so i found that working life was pretty chill, and i’m an introvert myself :) drama doesn’t really come up unless you actively participate in office politics, and if anyone had anything bad to say about my quiet nature, they kept it to themselves. \n\nit’s not as bleak as you make it out to be! you don’t need to be friends to work well with people, and most will appreciate your diligent nature and strong work ethic regardless of your personality :D jiayous for PW, and all the best!', 'Hello, it’s only one guy in your group so why bother ? Some people are sarcastic in nature also and I think it really helps if you can explain yourself. After all , you guys are going to be together until like October so there is no reason to tolerate until then especially if you are so uncomfortable about it.\n\nI wouldn’t say to forcefully change yourself but you see, you also don’t like something about your group mates so it’s natural that your group mate don’t like something about you too. Honestly, I think it’s pretty good that the guy even try to engage with you during their convos. I know a group in my class where they don’t even talk to their more introverted group mates and only talk when they really need to. I think there is a real difference between not wanting to talk because you are not comfortable to and not wanting to talk because you find the convo meaningless or irrelevant. It can really give off different vibes to your group mate which can affect their attitude towards you in general.\n\nOverall, I really think it depends on what you want your pw experience to be like. I mean it’s okay if you continue to keep quiet during their convo but you will have to except that they might not like you or whatever. Anyways, you just want that A for PW so as long as it doesn’t affect your work then sure. If not, just try to have fun ya ?

In work life, there may be people who don't like you, regardless of whatever you do but i just feel that it's alright as there is no way to get everyone to like us...\n\nDon't let them get to you and if you feel that the person is getting too out of hand with their actions, just say it out and let them know that they are hurting you!

The moment you do, they will know it, and they WILL make it worse for you since they think its for their enjoyment.\nPersonal experience in pw was, a 5 man team, 3 non existent people who bullied the fuck outta not just me, and some of the rest of the class (albeit not having malicious intentions, they just think its funny). Everyone got A cuz Oral presentation carried their asses so hard (they are really good at talking). It was effectively a 2 man team doing a 5 man work, with a blind as bat teacher who thinks its 4 people doing the work except for me (since i have bad grades, she thinks i dont put in effort, and yes that means she gave like 100% of my credit to the 3 slackers)\nDid i let it get to me, well yea, thats why i 100%, no, 200% lost motivation the moment it was revealed everyone got an A, like what the fuck, did i really just spent all my efforts of countless sleepless nights designing products rewriting reports sacrificing my grades just for people undeserving to get an A? Lost motivation for everything else right after, flunked, no, failed As as a result, and until now im still scared of even re trying A levels cuz of this prior experience. And if i think back, root cause, lies in me, cuz i let THAT incident get to me and fucked me mentally which escalated everything. Please, really, take my advice, just ignore the fella. Dont let him get to you. If you do, it might snowball out of hand and affect everything else. Sg has a lot of ass holes like the ones u and i both met and people i met in NS basically taught me to just deal with it since theres nth we can do about it. Just ignore him. Being an introvert is fine. As long as you do your job, no matter what lies he spreads, no matter how many people believe it, trust me, your other grpmates will see clear as day on whos ACTUALLY doing their shit and who isnt. Well on the off chance they become as blind as my teacher, you yourself will know how much you have contributed, and that will be enough. \nAlso heads up, if u get a B, dont let it get to you either, i have seen classmates also kinda give up after they got B and as a result they flunked As (like the 60-70+rp kind, cannot really go anywhere but still considered pass), some EVEN failed As like me (the 40+ rp gang, some even possibly 30+)\nJust\nLive with your head up high.\nIt will get better.

What they are doing is probably bullying no matter how you look at it. \n\nJust do what you can and contribute when you can. From my own experience back then, I led most of the meetings even though I was 'introverted'. Use your diligence to come up with a meeting agenda to help guide the meeting along and make sure people don't waste time/dilly dally. I'm sure you'll be able to learn how to step up when needed with time."", 'Hi OP, ignore XXX and scold him back for wasting time bc socialising wont help his grades!\n\n\nIn my PW group, girl A likes guy B, while guy C likes girl A, so both ABC will always be the majority bc A supports B and C will support A.

sjwsingapore,o3eezo,I was moral grandstanding. But I want to do better.,2021-06-19 19:58:20,SingaporeRaw,13747,18,10,"**Disclaimer:**   Just sharing some shower thoughts. If I am being insensitive or rude  in  any part of this post, please call me out in the comments. I want to  learn, I want to do better. Also, I'm of the enlightened ones if it  matters.

**Ok so here goes:**  
Lately,  there have been a few incidents that highlight the moral grandstanding  that exists  in our society. I saw posts and videos of people of  majority races responding to these incidents, and moral grandstanding  about the racism they have never encountered in their lives. It broke my  heart. I want to do better.

I   want to do better, because moral grandstanding (whether overt or casual)  hurts people. It hurts the people the comments are directed at, and  indirectly hurts the people in our society because it creates a culture  that says that ""hey, I am better than you. I am morally superior."" When  it is not.

What really stood out  to me was this model/celebrity's(?) video calling us out on how we're  pretending that moral grandstanding is a recent phenomena. She explains  that people of the all races tend to have memories of moral  grandstanding encounters that go all the way back in their childhood.  Man, how is this ok? How is it ok that we're so mean to kids, and  teaching them from a young age that they're lesser than others? How is  it ok that we're giving them trauma that they carry with them, and that  they have to work extra hard to come to terms with and get rid of?

You  know all the nasty comments that we make. Harmful comments like ""eh  later thought police come and catch you"". We may think it's just a  casual comment, but that's super hurtful. That's like people saying ""eh  be careful ah, later a SJW catch you and fk up your sense of self-worth  with moral grandstanding"". At least there is some truth in the second  statement given our behavior recently caught on tape. So can we please  stop doing this? Can we treat everyone with acceptance and respect?

We  also have to stop tying wrongdoings to people's races. If someone is an  a$$hole, then only HE/SHE is the a$$hole. Not his/her entire race.   Because I don't see this happen with good things. So let's stop   overgeneralizing just because it's convenient to do so. It is just not  meaningful to make such conclusions about people based on their skin  color.

Also, I used to be one of   those people who didn't believe in moral grandstanding in Singapore. I   thought, ""How can I be moral grandstanding? I still have a bunch of  problems.""  But I decided to educate myself on the subject and boy, did  it open my eyes. For the people who still don't believe in moral  grandstanding, I strongly recommend this podcast from Georgetown University: https://academicminute.org/2017/10/justin-tosi-georgetown-university-moral-grandstanding/

Moral  grandstanding is a type of ordinary privilege. And we should use this  to help and not hurt others. We can do better as a society. Personally, I  want to do better. Who's with me? :)

LesserMuffin,mpxxjr,[Rant] Living in a toxic environment,2021-04-13 16:15:34,SGExams,77673,11,69,"I'm not sure where to put this, I really want some advice and help some fellow peers. I don't want to expose myself so I won't go to much into detail.

I'm currently studying in poly, below 21 years of age. My early childhood was quite pleasant (from what I recall anyways), until mid to upper primary the quarrels between my parents got worse and they eventually stopped talking all together, sleeping sperately but not divorced. Due to this I would often be the middle.of their fights and they vent their anger out on me, through both verbals and physical abuse. I'm still abit scared to call it ""abuse"" as it isn't as bad as what I've seen on TV, but talking to friends who work in social welfare many of them said it would be considered child abuse legally. So I growing up in this unsupportive and toxic environment made me attempt suicide. Unfortunately I am still here and struggling in school. 

For my teenage life, I've had to support myself financially and was mainly independent other than seeking shelter at my house. I was almost severely underweight due to the lack of proper nutrition the house provided. We had a maid but she has some anger management issues so I wasn't treated well when she was mad. The food at my house was mainly carbs, but how can I complain? At least I'm not starving right? Ashamed as I am I have resorted to stealing as a means of feeding myself, I justified it since I wasn't stealing from small shops that it was fine. But now I feel regret for my actions. My school life wasn't good either, I was outcastes and ""bullied"" to a certain extent. I wasnt beaten up or anything but my belongings were often thrown away or stolen and my classmate would often kick or pull my hair. Name callings was something I had gotten used to but because of all these, adding on that my teachers despite knowing, chose to shrug it off as light teasing, led me to skip school often. I had lost faith in adults and struggled with self esteem and even depression. 

It was only recently that I had gotten diagnosed and it's taking a burden on my finances. I am tired. I just want to stop trying, an incident occurred recently that really escalated these feelings. Many of the things I have kept throughout the years was recently thrown out by my parents. I had spend alot of money on them but most of all the sentimental value was what really hit me. Precious memories with friends, money I had to painstaking saved through the years, just all gone because ""it was taking up space"" or ""I haven't used them in so long"". I've placed it in a container not larger than 30x30cms. How much space do they need..

I've just about had enough, I felt so frustrated to the point of harming my parents. I'm not sure what to do, suicide is always an option for me but I didn't want to hurt my friends. The only thing keeping me here is my relationship and another friend who's always been there with me. I don't have the guts to do it and so I'm just lying in bed wasting my life away. I don't feel like doing anything, I feel like a waste of space like what my parents always call me. Please can anyone tell me what I should be doing from here on?",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mpxxjr/rant_living_in_a_toxic_environment/,"['Contact MSF for help.\n\nThey should be able to guide you.', 'Hellos..

**Admission Questions:**

Do universities admit students based on RP or IGP?  What is the RP cut off for NUS Biz? Is an interviewed required even if your rank point meets the 10th percentile igp or like 2.5 points away ?

\- Rank Points! **Do not worry if you are the 10th percentile for your desired course.** You are likely to get into the course unless if the university cuts the volume of intake DRASTICALLY or if there is a DRASTIC number of people applying for your course this year. (which is unlikely) If you are on the borderline (meaning below 10th percentile by quite a bit), you might wish to apply for 'special consideration' or 'aptitude based admissions' (forgot what it was called) - you will be asked to write a personal statement which will be considered in the event you do not make the cut but is nearly there.

\- Interviews are only required if you do not meet the cutoff of that year (which changes depending on supply and demand) and you applied for the 'special consideration' or 'aptitude based admissions' thing I was talking about.

\- Check the cut off point here:  [https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp)](https://www.nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp))

&#x200B;

**Business School Questions:**

What made you choose NUS Business over NTU business and SMU Business? How often do you have presentations and projects? How competitive is it? Work week of a year 1?

\- Different schools have different cultures, offer different opportunities (programme wise - university wide), and career preparation courses, etc. I will be speaking more from the NUS front as I am not very aware of what the other universities offer.

\- I chose NUS because I wanted to stay hall and because I wanted to go NOC (NUS Overseas College - basically an overseas internship programme) If you are interested do find out more from the official NOC site. [https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/](https://enterprise.nus.edu.sg/education-programmes/nus-overseas-colleges/)

\- I also chose NUS because I wanted to stay in school longer. (NTU is a 3 years honours programme - heard from friends that their timetable in general is more pack because they are squeezing 4 years worth of content into 3)

\- All 3 schools are equally competitive. The stereotype of SMU being very competitive with their class participation may be true but it applies in NUS as well. If you are in Business school you wont be able to shy away from presentations, projects and class participation. It applies to most modules! (5 modules means 5 projects, 5 presentations lor) From what I see, business students are placed in an environment that we strive to find internships every semester and every break. (or at least the people around me)

\- You may ask got time to intern while studying meh? Haveee... If you take 5 modules a semester (recommended), your work week is around 2.5 days in year 1 if you plan properly. A part time internship will typically ask for a commitment of 3-3.5 days. The reason business school is so 'slack' is because you learn through experiences, be it, internships or ccas. These experiences will help to boost your portfolio and allow you to have the necessary skillsets and knowledge in your desired field in the future. The school gives you the time to explore many things outside of school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Double major in computing/business in uni, how demanding/competitive is it?

\- Business isnt the hiong one. Computing is very shag. All my computing friends are studying non stop and I guess business will be a good balance as biz modules will be 'slack'. It is all up to your ability to handle and juggle as well as your aptitude for both of these majors. If you have aptitude for computing, you will do well with hard work. But I know of people who struggled a lot in computing as well. No harm applying, can always drop the second major if you do not like it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Double Specialisation in Business School?

\- It opens more doors I guess. Personally I feel that it will be good to have as you can take specialisations that compliment each other. For example, Business Analytics and Marketing. You can do marketing, business analytics or marketing analytics in the future. Studying more means more knowledge. However, internship experiences are still the most important. When I go for interviews, employers dont ask about what you study. They ask what you have done in your CCA and previous working experience, as well as what you learnt from them. You only talk about what you study and your projects if you really have nothing in your portfolio. OR if you did a project that got some significant recognition or award.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What goes well with Business? Econs, accounting, computing or communications?

\- hmmm.. tbh depends on what you want to do leh. Like if you want to do more analytics computing would be more suitable. More finance will be accounting and econs. More marketing or media related will be communications

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m from poly, do poly students lose out academically compared to jc kids in uni in your opinion?

\- No omg, the poly friends I know are doing very well. In fact some of them are very driven and very successful. Never think this way. You guys are the top of the top to get into uni. Tbh we jc kids are scared of you guys leh.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How have classes been conducted with the recent pandemic?

\- Previously everything was online on zoom. Right now, they are adopting a hybrid kinda system. Some modules will be online, some modules will be held in school. Some modules are pre-recorded and will require you to OTOT go and watch. It all depends and can be checked before bidding for your modules. You can ask your friends or seniors who have taken the module as well to find out about the examinable components and specific class details, etc. Exams were done online last semester and monitored through proctoring. This semester all exams should be done in school.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Most difficult compulsory module (in your opinion)?

\- this is unanimously known by all NUS Biz students, it is the python 2K DAO module. BSP3701 is also very difficult (havent taken) and many students map it overseas on exchange because taking modules on exchange is pass/fail and will not be counted to your CAP.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is it ok if im unsure of what I want to do in the future so I go into biz?

\- If you are SURE OF NOT wanting to do anything technical or specialised like computing or psychology then sure. Biz you can do a lot of things, read through the different specialisations available before deciding. [http://www.nusbizadclub.com/academic-guide/](http://www.nusbizadclub.com/academic-guide/)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I heard that business degrees are useless? Your thoughts ?

\- HAHAHA yes I thought of this before. Cause.. I have not utilised a single thing I learnt in these 2 years in my internships LOL. Tbh I forget what I learn anyways. HOWEVER, I feel that it is not 'useless' because it is your gateway into whatever you want to do. For example you want to work in a bank. Take finance -> go for all the opportunities related to finance -> meet people passionate in the same field, make friends go for case competitions -> get opportunities and resources related to finance or banking.

\- If you had went to a more 'useful' degree likely you wont get those opportunities. Connections are key too! Only in business school you can build connections in certain fields and those connections can help you in the future.

\- one more thing, Biz school is 'slack' so means more time to explore opportunities to boost your portfolio and your career

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Where do most business people find their internships, how many internships do they typically take up and what type of companies do they eventually work at?

\- We either source ourselves online, on glints, on LinkedIn. Or we use our university career page. For NUS it is called Biz symplicity.

\- Hmmm depends on individual and how drive you are. Some people dont even have a single internship up to when they graduate -> internship is not a requirement in NUS biz. Some people pursue different internships during the semester and during summer and winter breaks as well.

\- Summer break is around 3 months so good time to get an internship. winter is only 1 month and most people will convert to a part time internship after that 1 month for the rest of the semester.

\- Company wise depends on what you want to go into and which industry. With a business degree you are free to apply to anything and everything within your scope. Just need to see the requirements and conditions in the job application, if it fulfills you can apply!

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is overseas travel compulsory?

\- Yes! It is a graduation requirement in NUS Biz (with or without honours). With covid however there might be exemptions. If you do not want to go on exchange (SEP) which is around 6 months, you can always go Winter school (around 3 weeks) or Summer school (around 6-8 weeks)

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Gender Ratio?

\- 6:4 F:M

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How are the profs?

\- I think they are quite ok. I dont really have much opinions on this. You can check with seniors about the different professors, how they grade, what they look out for, etc

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Why Business over Economics or Accounting?

\- haha personally because I am interested in neither of those. I didnt like H2 Econs as well. And H2 Econs came back to haunt me in one of the Business modules.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Will taking H2/1 Econs be beneficial for Business School?

\- Maybe for 1 or 2 core modules or if you intend on specialising in Business Economics in NUS Biz Sch. JC econs will lay the foundation BUT you will learn so much more beyond JC econs so... it helps a bit only lah

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Hall and CCAs Questions:**

Do different nus halls have their own exclusive ccas or are ccas open to all students?

\- Exclusive CCAs! If you are not in hall, join NUS wide CCAs

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is cca in university important?

\- Yes! CCAs are crucial for your application for your first few internships. CCAs give you the necessary platform to acquire experiences and skillsets. In the event you do not have any past work experience, employers will ask you about your CCA experience and your leadership experiences. They will want to know what you learnt, what skills you acquire, how will you translate those to your work.

\- Academic clubs help you to deepen your knowledge about certain topics which can be used to show employers your eagerness to learn

\- CCAs are a good platform to find like-minded individuals to connect with and they will be your support system in school and in your future career goals

\- Although I have already had a few internship experiences, I am still in 3 CCAs myself haha. Make sure you join something you like too

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**Social Life Questions:**

Is the stereotype that business students in uni are commonly 'snakes' and do you have to be a really social/outgoing person to make friends?  Is it difficult to make friends in universities if I don't stay in the hostels?

\- The 'snakes' thing, happens everywhere tbh. It is not a business thing. There are many nice people in business too. So far, I havent met a 'snake'

\- How universities work is you will bid for the modules you want to take. In year 1, you will be preallocated core modules. Because of this, unless if you are very lucky to get the same timeslots as your friends, expect to meet new people every semester. Even if you are in the same class, you may be in different project groupings. If you go in without friends, it will be up to you to make friends with the people you work mostly with -- your project groupmates. If you guys all click then congrats you have found a clique whom you can bid modules together with.

\- I personally feel it is difficult. Not sure if it is because I spend all my social energy in hall. But think about what I said above, you have to be lucky to find that group of people.

\- Thats why you should join Orientation programmes as those are social platforms. CCAs too. Most of my friends are from hall and CCA.. but dont worry too much

\- I feel the important thing is putting yourself out there, be friendly. No matter whether you are an introvert or extrovert, if you dont make the effort dont expect people to come to you. If it is difficult to make friends in class, join programmes or ccas. Sometimes the student clubs will host events such as (most recently) the Biz bff (whereby they pair people up in Business school) -> join those

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

**General Questions:**

Regrets and things you would’ve done differently

\- Dont have leh.. Advice tho, do your research! Plan ahead! Know what you want or agar agar also can. Know the requirements. Example if you going into computing know that internship is a requirement. In that case plan out when you want to fulfill the requirement. Dont wait until the last minute before you plan and realise you are out of time or unable to fulfill.

\- I knew coming into NUS biz, I wanted hall, NOC, I knew what I wanted to specialise in as well. Although all of them (aside from staying hall) changed, because of different perspectives and priorities, at least I am aware and have clear direction. I wont be caught unprepared or anything. Always do something with a plan and it is ok to change that plan along the way.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Is there anything completely unexpected that you encountered in uni business/non-business related that you can advise future uni students?

\- This is not unexpected but it is something that should be brought up I guess.. Uni is very self driven. No prof is going to ask you to study, find internship, go cca. You can pon cca, you can be irresponsible in your work, you can party all day whatever. People dont care what you do. But everything is on you. You take care of your own consequences.. you are responsible for yourself, your grades, your portfolio. There are many programmes, and events out there, to help you reach your goals. You have to find them yourself. Join the right group and cca, get intel etc. Ask your seniors for tips. No one is going to spoonfeed you or guide you.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

How stressful is life in university compared to JC?

\- depends on individual. If you pile yourself with a lot of commitments, well you be more stress than JC. If you just study, then if your course is light then it be more slack.

\- but exams comes every \~6 weeks during semester time. Sooo... its like A levels 4 times a year.

\- ps. commitments I mean, number of modules, internship, ccas, programmes, etc

\- you control how much stress you are giving yourself, join less things if you want a more 'slack' life, join more if you are more kiasu

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

What would you say is the toughest/difficult thing for a business student in uni?

\- This is a tough question. AHHHHH idk leh

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Do you prefer uni or jc/poly life? And why?

\- LOL JC def. I had ALOTTT of fun in JC, altho I was very stressed during A levels. But thinking back I cant remember most of the stressful parts. I think in university you see a lot of things lah, good and bad. and see a lot of types of people. It is def not as carefree as JC lor. There are a lot more things to worry about in general.

\- But come on lah, university means adult already hor. Its a part of growing up lor.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

We have a compulsory module called STR as well, it is a series of lessons that will teach you about LinkedIn, Personal Branding, How to prepare for interview etc. On our internship portal you can apply for case interview mock test (but its not applicable to my field so idk how useful it is). There are various opportunities to attend panel discussions and talks to better understand different career fields as well. (both planned by the school or by student clubs)\n\n2) hmm.. Its very competitive if you are looking at MNCs and large corporations. I will advice that for year 1s (if you are looking for an internship) start with a startup and gain experience first. Or just focus on your ccas. \n\nFor me I have multiple leadership positions but arent a study person LOL. I personally feel grades not thaaaat important. So I pile myself out with a lot of external stuff including internships and ccas. (idh bad grades but they arent great either)\n\n3. Tbh you dont have to know what you want to specialise in. Because it will change. When you come in in year 1, there are compulsory core modules which every biz student needs to take. Those modules are pre-allocated to you. The modules will expose you to all the specialisations. You only have to start thinking of your specialisation at the end of year 1 after you have exposure to everything. And even if you took a specialisation module and dont like it, you can still change your specialisation (so that module would be counted into your UE aka your extra modules thingy) or you can take it as a second specialisation. Not sure if my explanation is clear\n\n4. hmm this is hear say, as much as its competitive NUS claims that 95% (if I dont remember wrongly but its the high 90s) of graduates found a job within 6 months.

Only hall ccas give you the points that will contribute in helping you be able to stay the next yr. NUS ccas do not give you points', 'Hi! In biz you can go into almost every industry. Depending on which area you specialise in and which area you build your portfolio towards, it will shape your career direction.

In the event you choose HR, you can apply to any industry that requires HR (which is like every company lol)  It is really very broad because almost every company requires say a marketeer or a HR coordinator... \nRegarding the other specialisations, I am not very sure as well becus I am working towards being a marketeer, but rest assured that there are many opportunities! please go to the open houses to find out more!', 'Hi, it is possible!

(in places whereby the pay is lower, NUS will subsidise? not sure how it works tho)\n\n3. They are counted as CCAs and yes very selective.

QualitativeEconomy,kzrdw6,Criticism of data interpretation made in MSF's first local study on intergenerational effects of divorce on Children.,2021-01-18 17:29:07,singapore,378762,17,51,"I was watching the Parliament records wherein MOS Sun Xueling was going through the MSF's study on Intergenerational effects of divorce on Children. MP Carrie Tan brought up concerns regarding potential signaling effect the study would have in stigmatising divorced families, especially when combined with the lack of actionable insights the study actually provides. I.e, if the study produces nothing very useful (no insights on causation, which can be acted upon) why say something that may be misleading? Possibly making divorced parents which had to make a hard decision feel even worse about a choice they are often forced to make. 

I found MP Carrie Tan's comments quite interesting and decided to look further into the study itself. I think there is sufficient reason to render MP Tan's concerns valid, especially with regards to a lack of useful insight, but also on another point regarding the way MSF is using this study to justify certain policies.

If you wish to look at the study yourself the link is below, or you can Google MSF Divorce study

http://go.gov.sg/intergenstudydivorce

The facts from the statistics used by the study are that children of divorced families do perform lower on a number of metrics, not alot (<10%) but also not in significantly either (>2%). On the surface this does imply that divorce leads to negative outcomes, and hence the existence of a ""divorce penalty"" which the study repeatly deems to exist as a result of the evidence. Hence the study advocates for the policies regarding the prevention of divorce and/or the addressing of issues following divorce. 

However, MOS Sun clearly stated that the study was correlational rather than causational, and this was acknowledged in the study itself. This means that it is possible (and depending on further study, likely) that lower performance is due instead to a common confounder, such as a common factor that is simultaneously causing higher divorce rates as well as lower performance by children but with seperate causational chains. One such common factor might be emotionally abusive grandparents (on either side) or a gambling addiction by either parent.

To further elaborate, it may be the case that the common factor (let's use emotionally abusive GPs) leads to lower performance for the child through one path (destruction of Grandchildren's self esteem) and divorces via another path (abuse of spouse). In fact it may very well be in many cases that divorces increase because divorces are used by parents as a strategy to resolve such issues before they harm the children more!  (Many divorces happen because parents want to protect their children rather than because they don't care) 

In the lack of even any minimal attempt for a causational study (such as analysis of divorced family narratives and histories), it is thusly rather reckless for MSF to assume that there is indeed a ""divorce penalty"" and use it to back up a slew of marriage protection policies. For if it was a case of misdiagnosing the social issue, and divorce-avoidant policies cause greater harm on the relevant children (who may have otherwise been protected through the institution of divorce) then that would be plain bad. 

It is irresponsible to claim causation without proof. It is even worse to recognise that a study is correlational rather than causational... then interpret it for policy as if it was causational anyway! 

Because human beings always think in causational terms and there is a tendency to act on correlational data as if it was causational. In the lack of minimally sufficient causational insights, MSF should have not publicised the data in the form that it did (perhaps directly issuing it to public research institutes for follow up instead), or at least included much more significant interpretational warnings in the study itself (such as examples of possible confounders)  so that readers won't come to faulty conclusions. Most importantly, it should not be utilising this kind of study to justify its policies, for if the government wants to invoke the virtues of science in its management of its peoples' lives, it ought to be more rigorous science than this.",0.82,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/kzrdw6/criticism_of_data_interpretation_made_in_msfs/,"['First off, I disagree with your characterization of the effect size as being not that big. A difference of 9.2 percentage points translates to being 25 percent lower when the base is 37.8%. That is large, which is why it\'s important to differentiate between percent and percentage points. \n\nSecond, they actually did try a method for establishing a more causal connection, which is to match children of similar family backgrounds. The question then is whether the set of variables they match on is sufficient to eliminate the influence of confounders. \n\nThird, ~~I\'m surprised they didn\'t probe the causality of their results further.~~ (edit: they did but it\'s not in the linked paper. See my final paragraph.) A quick search of the literature tells me that timing of divorce matters, which is why some studies look at divorces that happen when one child is of adult age and another child is not. The idea is that adult age children are much less affected. Just how much is the so-called divorce penalty affected by the child\'s age at the time of the divorce? To the extent that the matching is done well, we should see the penalty disappear for children who are working adults at the time of the divorce.\n\nEdit: I looked up the parliamentary records and Sun Xueling said that ""[there] was no clear finding suggesting a relationship between the child’s age when the parents divorced and the child’s outcomes at age 35."" So it sounds like the matching wasn\'t good enough to give a causal interpretation to their results. Omitting those results from the paper seems to me like an sly move to make their findings sound more causal than it is.', 'Any social scientists on this sub can comment on the challenges of establishing causality for social determinants of health? In my mind it appears very difficult.', ""As you acknowledged in another comment, it's not like they are making up a bunch of draconian marriage protection policies. Stuff like counselling is different as it doesn't merely avoid or delay divorce, counselling actually aims to improve the quality of the relationship.\n\nThis study _does_ produce actionable insights, by the way. There is a second way to try to avoid the 'divorce penalty', as you seem to call it, which is to support those families and the children with additional resources. As a matter of fact, that's what is actually being done, once again as you acknowledge! Regardless of whether the penalty is because of divorce or some other confounding factor, it is still possible to use the study to determine how much of these 'additional resources' should be allocated to this cause, versus other types of social aid. Because the aid is purely in the form of resources to help the families in need, they should provide some benefit in a relatively agnostic fashion, though, sure, further study could help refine the specific intervention. Sure, perhaps divorce isn't what harms the kids; perhaps the issue is that divorce is a proxy for toxic relationships! Well, guess what, marriage counselling would likely help diffuse that too. \n\nI don't think the problem is that the government erred. This is but one study; it lays the groundwork for future more detailed studies. The fact that the effect size is broadly similar to what is observed internationally also allows one to cautiously (and with low certainty) imply that the causative mechanisms might be similar too\n\nIt's important to not make perfection the enemy of the good, and if you worked in research you'd understand this point very clearly. Even if the study isn't useful on its own, which is categorically not the case here, it can still be useful in laying groundwork for future studies. Instead of having one mega-study, it's better to just conduct more targeted studies and publish as soon as you have data. That helps dissemination of information, and also helps your research be more flexible as later studies' design would be informed by earlier studies.\n\nFinally, it's important to understand that social workers aren't stupid. They're usually very cognisant of the reality on the ground, and a study of effect size can likely help inform their more qualitative understanding of the situation."", ""Even if there is a confounder, divorce will still function as an indicator of that confounder's presence. The divorce penalty will still exist. MSF isn't claiming that there is causation anyway - policy is based around the fact that children who are divorced face a harder time and they're gonna need more support. In the link you provide, MSF says that this is evidence that helps inform policy on how to support these children, which is pretty important imo."", 'what are some examples of marriage protection policies?', 'Think you are overthinking this. \n\nIn the long run this means we should try to reduce divorce rates, and if divorces are to happen - the children need appropriate support to reduce the divorce penalty. \n\nThe one that is lacking is additional divorce support for the children', ""That is indeed quite wise: Do not let Perfection be the enemy of good.\n\nIn that aspect I do relent, most of the fault here wherever it is, lies with the study's writing and not with the government Ministry. In that we view the Ministry's function as primarily policy based (rather than research based) they have shown prudency in their policy design, implementing in force only policies that they are confident will have benefit even considering the flaws of the research, such as improvements of marriage conditons and direct help to divorcee children. It is the even temperedness that calls for respect and acknowledgement.\n\nBut we must then address the flaw of the study. My contention arises in the way the study jumps from results to conclusions (points 14-15 in the study). Usually social science studies, to the extent I am exposed to within my field, contain a discussion segment where the possible interpretations of the results are discussed, usually in conjunction with relevant theoretical literature or qualitative insights from accessory data. Such sections also usually call for additonal studies to confirm possible interpretations. Instead the study jumps straight into \n\npoint 14: These findings suggest that divorce may affect children negatively even into adulthood, in \r\neducation, finances and relationship outcomes.(which effectively implies a causal relation for all save the most detailed readings) \n\npoint 15:  In addition, upstream interventions to help couples build strong marriages are important. (note the possible misinterpretation of such a factual proposition) \n\nOnce again to the study's credit this time, both conclusion points are qualified with examples of policy actions which are rather restrained. It actually seems to be that there very well have been that a discussion on the results was conducted, used to be between those components as a qualifier, then edited out before final publication for some strange reason. For otherwise the jump from a strong conclusion to a moderated policy stance wouldn't make sense.\n\nHowever the point remains that the study lacks nuance, detail and self-criticism regarding possible causal relations because of the absence of such a segment. Such information would be material to the Parliament which it was presented. It would caution the bravado of certain MPs suggestions, such as MP Louis Ng's suggestion to make certain voluntary assistance programs compulsory. It might also invite more constructive suggestions from MPs familiar with the qualitative aspects of the issue, such as from MP Carrie Tan who is a leader of a relevant social service. Most importantly, it should contain within itself a self criticism and thusly a call to the same Ministry to necessitate those more detailed studies (which is key since the Ministry has the access to sources of qualitative data). The overall point being that these elements which are missing from the study are necessary for the discussion of possible refinements of policy, both where it ought to go further, where it out to show restraint, and where it ought to look differently, refinements often enough made through suggestions in Parliament to the Ministry. \n\nIn the absence of these elements being contained within the study itself, it is the onus of the critical outsider to raise them. Though admittably that is perhaps better done through journalism or academic response rather than on reddit. But I like reddit, it's has alot less red tape. \n\nI do not mean to say that the Ministry should do nothing in the absence of full data, it has done much good with what it can credibly ascertain, which is applaudable. Yet there is room to do better, to provide pathways towards even more effective policies, which may either be performed by more rigor by the study itself, Parliament's critic of it, or public debate such as this or from more institutional sources. And as someone to which this issue affects both myself and many of my friends/family, I reckon Singapore eventually deserves better.\n\nI admit in the moments of passion I had been too intense and reckless in my criticism, and I thank you for the strong counter arguments made in response that point out the critical flaws of that positon."", 'Yes.', 'SXL said to determine causality will need longitudinal studies and tbh it’s very expensive to run these kind of studies.', 'Im actually in the field and yes I agree full confidence in causality is difficult.\n\nWhich is why some degree of minimal evidence usually suffices, to the extent that no extremely salient counter evidence arises. \n\nThe function being that the quanti correlational data provides the ""proof"" and some on the ground qualitative reports (usually by a few of the subjects themselves) provides the ""reasonable hypothesis"". The combination of both provides a relatively safe measure of truth. The quanti ensures that the quali is not solely anecdotal, the quali ensures that the quanti not terribly misinterpreted. Hence while full confidence is not achieved, a signicant confidence can be. \n\nThe unfortunate thing is that this was not performed by the study, despite it being not that difficult to phone in a few divorcees or their now adult children, who would usually have grandmother stories to tell which can serve as a decent enough guide.', 'Usually social determinants of health do not prove causality. Because it’s incredibly difficult to do so. You can’t easily put people in RCT like medical sciences but have to observe people in natural settings. \nBut what we do is to prove high correlations, reverse causality doesn’t happen (aka dependent variable - low income doesn’t affect independent variable - divorce) and ruling out any other cofounding variables that OP already explained. \n\nAlso this study is more likely following population demographics methodology. -> closer to sociology/public health than psychology although i haven’t read the full paper.', 'Tbh to the Ministry\'s Credit their policies are well crafted considering the inadequacy of knowledge, but whether this is because of their natural conservatism or because of they are self aware of their studies pitfalls remains of question.\n\nMarriage protection policies include stuff like courses for marriage advise, provision of marriage counselling, intervention by ""first responder"" social workers.\n\nThese have been matched with Divorce support policies such as co-parenting schemes.\n\nThe only policy which may explicitly deter divorce (tho conditioned upon whether the marriage is deemed ""salvageable"") would be the compulsory (for Muslim couples) Marriage Counselling Programme for Divorcees run by the Syariah Court. \n\nThe cautionary way these policies are drawn up are... alright. My issue is that if these policies are backed up by this kind of poor study there may be, at best, a misallocation of resources as we fail to address the core issue and hence not perform the welfare functions the Ministry was tasked to perform and for which those resources were budgeted for. At worst, because of the ""soft"" nature of counselling, advice and social work, the operations may implicitly deter divorce when divorce is actually necessary. Parents trapped in terrible marriages that are bad for their children may also hesitate to divorce out of fear of subjecting their children to such a ""penalty"". This of course being the signalling effect that MP Carrie Tan was concerned about. \n\nLink for government source on policies \nhttps://www.msf.gov.sg/media-room/Pages/First%20Local%20Study%20On%20The%20Intergenerational%20Effects%20Of%20Divorce%20On%20Children.aspx', 'I agree in the long run we should reduce divorces.\n\nBut being a child of a divorcee myself, I attribute most set backs in my life not to the divorce itself but to my dad being financially reckless (a matter which would have caused greater set back if not for the divorce)\n\nIf the causal focus is on divorce rates alone, we risk reducing divorces but not treating the issue. Which has an annoying issue of making the vulnerable children ""invisible"". It\'s kinda like taking panadol for COVID-19. You address the symptoms and hide it, which makes it harder to treat the underlying disease.\n\nHowever I whorl heartily agree that additonal support for children you have mentioned are direct repairs, that rectify the damages already done. I don\'t think anyone should have anything against that, and regardless of where the debate goes that should be the minimum done.\n\nMSF said they were going to do some things to provide help for the children, but I\'m don\'t know what being a kid is like now so can\'t judge if it\'s enough or not.', 'Actually that’s what OP is saying, it shouldn’t be tied to divorce and reducing its rates.', 'Nice, thanks for the insights!', ""Given that the phenomenon of divorce has probably been well studied internationally, I wonder if there are reasons why further research may be difficult. And even if we could discover the ultimate causal factors, aren't they likely going to be social issues that are already being addressed by the government in their own right like problem gambling? \n\nIn any case deciding whether or not to go through with a divorce is probably a decision best made at the ground level considering the different circumstances families face. Social workers who deal with issues like this on a day to day basis are best placed to judge whether a marriage can be salvaged or not. But I think most would agree that the default position should not be immediately jumping to divorce as the first option."", 'it is tied to divorce so that we can deliver more support and  ensure better outcomes for children of divorcees']"
poppraline,hwl2do,My dad has been self-radicalising every night with extreme pro-China/anti-non-China propaganda videos. Anyone experienced similar behaviour? What should I do?,2020-07-24 02:27:50,singapore,378762,398,864,"I write this from a point of fear and exasperation. My life at home revolves around avoiding and fearing my dad. But in the last year or so he has gained a new habit that scares and triggers me. 

Every night (and every morning + afternoon since WFH started), he plays a series of videos about China. They are usually either videos with robot voices, or videos with a human talking angrily. (Added: Most videos are in Mandarin, and some are in American English.)

The views and content I've heard from these videos include: 
- China is a lion, that is only sleeping right now
- The islands in the South China sea are China's, because China got them first in a past dynasty. All other countries opposing China are flawed, barbaric, have violent histories, etc. and they should be ashamed; or they used to be under the barbaric rule of the west, and so should side with China instead 
- Back when the Hong Kong courts overturned the mask ban last year, one video said about the judges involved: ""Foreigners are not Chinese, they don't have Chinese blood, that's why they don't care about China""
- If I don't pay attention, all I hear is 中国的 (China's) and 美国的 (America's) on loop

All this began when our Chinese TV channels started showing mainly shows from China, and removed most shows from Taiwan. He got interested in watching those shows online, and got steadily into angrier-sounding videos via recommendations. Now every day and night I'm bombarded with anti-US videos with strident robotic voices, and my dad has been making increasingly extreme and hostile comments, like: 
- Spouting conspiracy theories about SARS and COVID being a western weapon targeting Asian races/genes and leaving non-Asian races unaffected. He could not believe it when the first Germans were reported to have contracted COVID. (Edits for clarification)
- Using ""angmoh"" as an actual slur against any European/Australian/American white people
- Gloating that more angmohs are dying from COVID, meaning they are inferior to the Chinese
- Joking about invading the US because they seem weak right now  


My mum is gradually being influenced too (she also gloated about the COVID deaths). I'm a major pacifist so all this makes me struggle to live peacefully at home. 

I think that this behaviour is self-radicalisation, no less harmful than the kind promoting ISIS/terrorism that got people in trouble with ISA. Has anyone else observed those around them getting similarly radicalised? And does anyone know what I can do about it? I have been frantically searching for a suitable de-radicalisation video/article to drop into the family group chat, but most content I find discussing biased or rage-inducing media is US/UK-centric. Any suggestions would be appreciated! 

Note: In case it's not obvious, I am neither pro- nor anti- China.  

Second note: Can y'all not downvote comments unless they're really irrelevant? I'm not looking for an echo chamber. I'm willing to hear the other side as long as they're not ads or trolls.

Third note, 2 days later: To give context on why I am troubled by this, here are three reasons. 
>1. My safety: Peace in my family depends on my dad's moods. Between periods of calm, he can have unpredictable outbursts of anger, violence and insults, and I am usually his main target. These videos are making him angrier, and reducing my space of ""safe"" actions and opinions I can express. I don't currently have an acceptable excuse to move out that definitely won't trigger some backlash.
>2. Social impact: My dad has turned a lot more racist since starting this habit, and is influencing my mum. I've also been reading that others have seen their family members get addicted to such videos, forgoing other activities. 
>3. Possible future consequences: Is there a risk that some like my dad may act further on their beliefs, possibly ending up like [Dickson Yeo](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hxeqe4/how_a_singaporean_man_went_from_nus_phd_student/)?  


...............


Edit: Adding more anecdotes as I remember them. Plus more context in response to the comments here: 
- My dad is tech-savvy (tech career). His devices are controlled by him.  
- He's English-educated, but didn't have much education in the humanities and critical thinking.  
- He was pro-Trump not long ago. And I think my parents occasionally watch Dr Oz
- My dad has been to China a few times with my mum in the past year, to see scenic mountains.
- I think some of the videos are from Whatsapp as well

What I'm trying:
- My preferred way to take action is non-confrontational, so I'd be most grateful for any links I can drop into my family group chat! Like [this one](https://www.chinafile.com/conversation/our-daily-media-consumption-completely-different)
- I have read about [deep canvassing](https://www.vox.com/2020/1/29/21065620/broockman-kalla-deep-canvassing) as a good method to reduce prejudice, and am trying out the ideas (non-judgmental listening, sharing more personal stories, nudging towards reflection)

China has Ministry such as Ministry of State Security where they monitor and actively curtail any medium and information that will cause issue to the party leadership. You will never hear them mention any bad news about themselves in their news outlet, there's only good news and neutral news (sugarcoated bad news), otherwise, no news.\n\nIf you observe the kind of harsh actions that they are willing to take against and companies or individuals, you would rethink about what kind of country they are. Just look at Animal Crossing in China, and it's just a game. {TODO: Insert better examples}\n\nRemind him that this is the same country that sent Huang Jing to influence our Foreign Policy.\n\nDuring this stage, your goal is to establish credibility about understanding geopolitics and bolster your image, while also discrediting his source of information, be it china or the channel he follows. This step is very important as when not done well, will reduce the effectiveness of the following steps.\n\n2. Showing alternative viewpoints\n\nTry influencing or watching Foreign news media dealing with the same information that they are watching, show that there's an alternative viewpoint. It should be from the perspective of the third party to the same issue.\n\nFor e.g. \n\nI've observed, that my parents can relate to Taiwanese news and so sometimes they will pickup things along the way about how things are moving with a view possibly biased against china. As mainland media rarely mentions their personal failing, it shows the usefulness of alternative viewpoints. They also need to understand that most, if not all media outlets are biased.\n\nDuring this stage, your goal is to show that there are alternative viewpoints that they should look at, and that they should look at things from a rational and centrist POV when it comes to geopolitics.\n\n3. Remind them of their Identity\n\nRemind them of who they are and the identity that they associate with. As Singaporeans, we should take the stance and POV that are aligned as our Government (Maybe just me being patriotic). Singapore is the Switzerland of Asia and will remain so. The day we stop being neutral might be the day your cai png have to deduct 1 meat. We are too small and too fragile to not have a neutral stance.\n\nExperience: So during this period of time, was when Ho Ching pulled the 'Err...' stunt, and i found that my mom was somehow taking sides with the Taiwanese media, this was when i reminded her that we as Singaporeans, should take the stance and have our own personal interest at heart. The important thing is to rationalize with a slight bias to our personal interest. If we don't look out for our own interest, who will ?\n\n4. Providing sources of Information\n\nAt this point of time, they should be a lot less staunch on their viewpoint and is more likely to take in new sources of information. It's a good time to introduce to them our local think tanks that could provide curated information in a neutral basis. e.g. RSIS and LKYSPP, they hold talks and send mailers on their commentary every now and then. Even Zaobao and Straits Times could be good sources of information (Subjective, but for Foreign Policy i think its still fine).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nConcluding\n\nI feel that regardless of age, people tend to be complacent when it comes to things like FP where it's easier to just echo the same opinion as what's popular.

ISIS aimed to get people to follow them, support them financially, carry out attacks in their names, or move to the Islamic State. The Islamic State was aspiring to be a real and legitimate state, so it wanted inhabitants, skilled workers, and so on (it wanted to have an airforce, for eg). Now these video only aim to influence people\'s perception of China vis-a-vis the anti-China countries. It doesn\'t ask people to do things that are illegal or harmful to their countries in the name of China, for eg. It may influence the domestic politics atmosphere of the ""radicalised""; but even then, it\'s very indirect. Then the logic and geostrategic interests of the elite ruling class usually override the domestic wills.\n\nIt is only harmful in the sense that if the ""radicalised"" start to talk about their ideas very loudly and vocally in the wrong companies and become a social pariah or something, which will not be a problem since the Chinese Singaporean population is quite sympathetic to China, pro-China, and anti-Western views.\n\nSo at the moment, I can see that right now, it\'s just a personal annoyance to you. You can put boundaries: to make them into ""social pariahs"" to *you*. Only by imposing a cost to a behaviour, you can discourage the behaviour. Things like: please don\'t put that on loud speaker, I need to work or something. Or rules that if you start talking about that at the table, I will leave. Be very firm, and they shut up. Then you can also go on the counter-offensive. ""You got so much time on your hands, ma? Go get an essential service job or sth"".\n\nOn the other hand, the ease of radicalisation of a population is also sort of an indication of how unstable people\'s lives are.

There are concerns that this pro-China thinking might feed into Chinese chauvinism. That's worrying because Singapore is supposed to be multiracial, and the powers that be don't want people to think of Singapore as a Chinese nation, or a country within a Chinese sphere of influence. This has nothing to do with foreign affairs per-se and everything to do with domestic harmony.\n\nIn fairness, I don't know if anyone in China is specifically trying to undermine Singapore's racial harmony... that might not even be on the radar of Chinese IBs or whoever's cranking out YouTube videos.

In amercian terms, he is not on the right, he is not on the left. He is ONLY for himself, so are his supporters. They used the right ideology as a cover for self-entitlement and selfishness. If we inspect his policies carefully, they are all over the place. For example, the right strongly believes in ""rule of the law"", but he and his supporters only pay lip-service to it. Being self-entitled, selfish and self-deluded may feel good, and in the long term, it will be self-defeating. It will end up badly for both him and his supporters, regardless of the election outcomes.

I don’t think they have extra correspondents there for Ch8 alone, so why is Ch8 having independent reporting deviating from its sister channels? It makes no sense! Both are Singaporean and under the same company, both should get their reports from the same source and Ch8 should be more or less a translation of CNA, instead of having a weird independent streak of pro-China-ness.\n\nLooking at Ch8’s website, many China related news articles aren’t just a translation of CNA, but plucked from Chinese media outlets with a rather obvious stance. Make it even worse is their sloppiness, the lack of source attribution, and proper objective reporting from whatever garbage source they are sourcing. At least CNA articles states where they got it from (e.g, Reuters).\n\nEdit: and oh, during the first day when China made the announcement of that National Security Law, the ridiculous *Ch8 website* showed their intense biasedness and hinted at their blatant sourcing of articles from Chinese media. How did I know? \n\nThey omitted any mention of that law when the media outlets worldwide is on fire for something that big. It was the second article on CNA and no mention by Ch8’s bullshit website!

Where it is “extremely hard to convince” someone to seek help, one possible reason would be because the person does not feel safe or in control. For example, a person with family or financial issues may feel a sense of shame or helplessness. This person may need a combination of factors to feel safe. This may include having anonymity, having others who can relate to their issues, or able to clarify their priorities on what is needed to overcome the challenges. Communication with your friend, establishing trust and understanding what your friend needs will be key to supporting them.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', '^ to add on to this, is it possible to treat someone with SAD? Can someone actually fully recover from it? How would the treatment be like?', 'The short answer is, there may not be a definite way to test and ascertain 100% whether the said person is SAD or shy. Unlike Wuhan virus or AIDS, where we can run a test to trace to a clear biological cause to confirm the disease, mental health does not work this way. There is no clear biological origins, and the basis of a mental health diagnosis is still based on what is called a matching method. How it works is the client will report symptoms observed based on the psychiatrist’s questions and then these symptoms are matched to the disorder prescribed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual. In DSM IV, it is established within the wider psychiatric community that at least 5 symptoms need to match with the said disorder before we can be more confident in saying someone has SAD (or any disorder). But you must know that the reliability of diagnostic reliability is still perceived poorly within the industry, based on research published in 2007.\n\nIn essence, there is a limitation to self-diagnosis or professional diagnosis, and is why a lot of caution is exercised towards diagnosis. Laymen are discouraged from self-diagnosis because of how intricate and complex this exercise could be, and which requires a sound understanding of the disorder and experience to make a good professional judgment.\n\nTreatment, or ongoing management, works best when we are clear on the underlying mechanisms that drive a particular condition. Treatment is really personal, it is difficult to say what works for one will definitely work for the other. What is useful to consider is what might work if one is to consider therapy. Taste and preference, and patient choice, plays a big role in achieving a successful outcome. Patient choice comes down to what one beliefs is helpful. To that, it may be good to consider if having a professional challenge your negative belief, or positive framing or drawing your attention away from negative stimuli towards positive stimuli, or providing strategies to enhance your social support, or a combination of these approaches will work best for you.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', 'The pathways for anorexia and other eating disorder is not too different from the general mental health condition. One will have to have an assessment at the Community Health Assessment Team or polyclinic and then with the referral, gain access to services in hospitals that specializes in the treatment of anorexia and other eating disorders. It’s a two-step process.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', 'In a project I did with two other tertiary institutions, I see about 10% of the student population having self-harm tendencies. And the means of self-harming in discreet manner gets more creative due to access to information on social media. \n\nWhat I know of self-harming is that it is an attempt of the student to cope with intense negative emotions such as fear, anger, anxiety or sadness. The act offers a temporary relief, and is one of the reasons why it becomes addictive. \n\nThe fact that a person who is vulnerable and suffering would rather perform a self-injurious act on oneself than reaching out to professional help or friends reflect a strong desire of the person to stay in control and be independent in solving their problems even in the worst of times. \n\nIt is a concern where as a friend, we see that someone we care only see that their only option to relieve their pain is through self-harm. The friend in question may not see that he/she is putting himself/herself at risk, but because it is a behaviour that one may continue, we also do not know at what point will self-harm become life-threatening. Some who self-harm increases their lethality over time and that can be life-threatening. For these reasons, it is important not to dismiss or judge a person who self-harm as attention-seeking, or find faults with the person, because that will directly feed into the system of negative emotions which will require more self-harming. What one can do is to see these as a desire for independence and control, and an attempt to cope with one’s issue, and have an honest conversation with the friend to understand the underlying troubles that is driving this behaviour. This requires patience and kindness, and is one of the best things that a friend can offer to another in times of need. Your friend who self-harms may need a non-judgemental listening ear, or talk through the thoughts in his/her head to clarify priorities and make choices that improves his/her well-being. And if there are risks that you feel is beyond your ability to help, find more resources, like professional help, that could advise you on managing and supporting of your friend. \n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', 'One of the benchmarks that may suggest one would benefit from professional help would be if one is suffering and unable to function for more than a month. Whether that would constitute mental illness, it is best to leave it to the professional judgment of the therapist that you are seeing to make an informed assessment.\n\nThere are several ways to seek help. Currently, there are the pathways like seeing a counsellor in a school or community setting. One can also turn to trusted network of friends, family, or any caring adult in one’s life to disclose one’s issues and seek support. \n\nThere has been discussion within the sector about the potential of digital technologies in bringing support to low resource settings (i.e. bringing it to places that has high demand and low supply of professional counsellors). If any of the emerging technologies earn the trust of stakeholders in school or community settings, then online help may be an option for you in the future too.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', 'Hey man, I could really relate to your question and I wanted to provide my experience.   \n\n\nNo one really knows they have a mental illness, it\'s usually a suspicion that there is something going on. And this is why you can see many people who believe that they are mentally ill being very paranoid and insisting on seeing a psychologist/psychiatrist because once they get a professional diagnosis, they know what they have and what they don\'t, which gives them calmness (even though they might have been diagnosed with a lot of mental illnesses).   \n\n\nYou can actually seek help for it anytime you prefer. Early on, or later. It should be up to your convenience and comfort. But I just wanted to say, before you do, please please please please consider this. The stigma around mental health is still extremely strong and wide spread in Singapore. You might not think or feel so, but once you get diagnosed with a mental illness, you\'ll feel very prejudiced and judged. For example, there is this thing called ""insurance  discrimination"" and it is present in Singapore. Once you get diagnosed with a mental illness, you lose the right to purchase insurance or medical schemes from insurance companies even when they have a direct link to the Ministry of Health. Banks can deny providing loans for you when you want to buy a house, a car, etc. Basically, right now, getting diagnosed with a mental illness in Singapore is a lifetime sentence of punishments. (I know, it hurts)  \n\n\nBut if you would still want to seek help, go see a psychologist or a psychiatrist first. They do the upfront diagnosis and then give you a prescription (maybe drugs or therapy, etc). Just a useful tip, psychologist focuses on talking and therapy-like ways while psychiatrists focus on drugs. Then after receiving a prescription, you can go see a therapist if you would like to or if you are refereed by the doctor.   \n\n\nBut if you do not wish to be diagnosed, seeing a school counsellor helps. There are also counsellors outside you may wish to visit but the ones in schools are free of charge. I\'m not sure whether seeing a therapist without getting a diagnosis is possible or maybe if the therapist himself/herself would give you a diagnosis. I\'m sorry I couldn\'t help much but I hope all these will help.   \n\n\nStay strong.', 'In cases where there is bullying in schools, ranging from physical or verbal or cyber bullying, it can be detrimental to mental health. This is especially so for teenagers who place a high value on peer acceptance. Not being accepted and not having a sense of belonging in an environment like school can be very alienating, and may cause some form of self-doubt or self-harming behavior if the bullying is extensive.\n\nParental expectations can become overwhelming if it makes the student feel that they are not in control. A sense of being trapped, or resentment or other negative emotions, may result from it. Yet, there are opportunities to talk to friends and teachers or other caring adults about the stress from not meeting expectations and find ways to meet these challenges.\n\nBased on a British Cohort Study, good schooling experiences have a moderate effects on a person’s life satisfaction at 34. Good emotional health has about 3x more influence than good schooling experience in creating positive life satisfaction.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', ""One of the resources that I would recommend is the Tinkle Friend hotline \\[1800 2744 788 (24h)\\]. It is managed by Singapore Children's Society. That would be a good avenue to seek support and also advise on navigating the landscape to receive help for potential mental illness.\n\nAnother hotline one can consider is the Singapore Association of Mental Health toll-free line. It operates from Monday to Friday 9am to 6pm and the number is 1800-283-7019. There may not be a requirement to verify the age of callers, and given the toll is managed by counsellors, this is also an avenue to reach out for help from the community.\n\nThe other organization that provides counselling support for youth 12-25 is Limitless ([www.limitless.sg](http://www.limitless.sg/)). They do not have a fixed counselling location or operating hours and can meet you at a time and location of your convenience. While parental consent will be preferable, the organization has counseled minors without parental consent before. \n\nIf the child is 16 years and above this calendar year, there would be free mental health assessment available at CHAT, or community health assessment team. They would be able to support the evaluation and referral should one need a specific treatment for mental illness.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)"", 'This is a personal opinion - I think it becomes unhealthy when we rely solely on the exam grades as the only signal of our self-worth. In other words, if we do well academically. If not, we feel unworthy. A temporary sense of unworthiness may ease up, but it’s the prolonged sense of unworthiness that inhibit one’s ability and motivation to go about their tasks and responsibilities that will be of utmost concern.\n\nSelf-worth is so important to our functioning, to our confidence and belief in our own importance, that it is worth “hedging bets” on more than one area where we can draw positivity and confidence from. \n\nWhere we hedge our bets on is a question of what resources we have. Do we have people we trust or close to who rely on us for something or who value us and see us as important? Do we have activities or passion or interest that we like, which we can draw on, to build confidence and a sense of significance? In other words, it’s good to consider and evaluate, apart from examinations and academics, are there other opportunities to have fun or build skills.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', 'The part on rarely leaving home is a challenge, and a concern because it is a self-isolation behaviour. What could possibly motivate such behaviour is either a sense of not belonging or a sense of low self-esteem, or both. \n\nThere may also be other unmet psychological needs. Maybe he does not feel safe, or he feels incompetent, trapped or lonely. Based on the Instagram posts, you may be in a better position to assess what his needs are, and how your conversations with him can help to meet a specific unmet psychological need.\n\nTo help a person requires an opportunity and a mode of help that the person is comfortable and believes in. If you are in close contact with your friend, then spending time with him will be the first step. Find opportunities to restore his confidence, and letting him know that he matters to you. The message you want to get across in every conversation is that you care, and that he will hopefully also conclude at some point that it is not a case of “no one cares” and see hope. \n\nHowever, if your friend does not warm up to you chatting with him or engaging in activities together, such as playing online games, the other means for help-seeking may be through online counselling. In Singapore, one of the family service centres run a platform called ec2 ([https://www.ec2.sg/](https://www.ec2.sg/)), which may be something that your friend can consider. \n\nHaving said that, an opportunity needs to be created for help to be administered. There may be reasons why your friend may resist help-seeking at this point, and it’s good to understand what his resistance are, even if we may not be able to fully comprehend or relate fully. Helping a friend get out of a sticky situation will require patience and kindness, and it’s not easy. But do know that even if your friend resist help now, that does not mean he will not be open to help in future.  \n\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', 'If your friend projects negativity to you in the course of you helping him/her and it is disrupting your sleep and ability to function, then it may be best to identify alternative sources of help for your friend.\n\nAlso, if the issue you are helping your friend with is complex, such as risk management to keep a friend safe who is thinking about suicide, then it may be best not to go it alone in helping your friend, but also consult professionals and adults on how to construct a safety plan to keep your friend safe.\n\n\\- Matt from [Acceset](https://www.acceset.com/)', ""Hey, Matt also touched upon this topic in his reply to the original commenter. Do check it out if you haven't done so already :)"", '>at least 5 symptoms need to match with the said disorder before we can be more confident in saying someone has SAD (or any disorder).\n\nSo what are some symptoms that match with SAD?', ""hey, the AMAs over but i thought this was an important follow-up question so i asked Matt anyways. here's his reply:\n\nYou can refer to this website, https://www.psycom.net/social-anxiety-disorder-overview, and the symptoms listed on it.

\---

Now that the 2020 General Election is firmly in our rear-view mirror, there is something that I have been meaning to write about: institutionalized racism affecting the minorities, especially the Malays, in Singapore. If you are groaning at this thinking you have been misled by this post’s title, I assure you that by the end of this post you will understand the caveat behind the above-mentioned title. I plead for a little of your time and patience.

We have seen many discussions online about majority privilege and systemic racism impacting the minorities. Many of you may have even participated in some of these discussions. I will not try to explain those terms for they have already been repeatedly debated to death. What this post aims to achieve is to bring to light Singapore’s history and government policies that have either benefited the majority race or kneecapped the minority race. Or both.

**Why am I doing this?**

It is frustrating to see some Singaporeans fully buying into the narrative that Singapore is a truly meritocratic society; that the government’s policies do not discriminate against minorities, or if a Singaporean worked hard enough he or she will succeed (whatever the definition of success is), or that we have anti-discriminatory laws that protect the minorities. Some even claim that the Malays enjoy special privileges due to Section 152 of the Constitution describing the special position of Malays, and that the Malays are blessed with free education in Singapore.

**Section 152, “Special Position”, free education for all Malays?**

>[***Minorities and special position of Malays***](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/CONS1963?ProvIds=P1XIII-.)  
>  
>***152.****—(1)  It shall be the responsibility of the Government constantly to care for the interests of the racial and religious minorities in Singapore.*  
>  
>*(2)  The Government shall exercise its functions in such manner as to recognise the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and accordingly it shall be the responsibility of the Government to protect, safeguard, support, foster and promote their political, educational, religious, economic, social and cultural interests and the Malay language.*

[The oft-mentioned Section 152 of the Constitution was an administrative continuation of previously existing colonial policy towards the Malays \[Col: 126\].](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic?reportid=004_19900612_S0004_T0005) Regardless of the “special position” of the Malays, the only form of assistance rendered to the Malays was the policy of free education for all Malay students. This minimal approach of the government did little to improve the educational and socio-economic standing of the Malays as revealed by the 1980 national census. The free tertiary education policy was ultimately removed in 1990, [despite opposition from Malays who questioned the constitutionality of its removal \[col: 126\].](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic?reportid=004_19900612_S0004_T0005)

**With free education for all Malays, why haven’t their socio-economic and educational standings improved?**

There are many factors to look at, and the issue goes way back to the colonial era so that’s where we shall start. The colonial administrators of Singapore, in their pursuit of capitalistic gains, had little use for the native inhabitants. The natives who were already living off their own land had no desire to work for the British as labourers. [The British saw this unwillingness to work for them as indolence, and ascribed many other negative cultural stereotypes to the locals \[pdf\].](http://www.citizens-international.org/ci2017/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/the-myth-of-lazy-native.pdf) Nailing home the capitalistic intent of colonial presence in Singapore, the British Director of Education R. O. Winstedt explained their [policy for education for the natives in 1920 \[pg. 2\]:](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/sbs19890520s.pdf)

>""The aim of the government is not to turn out a few well-educated youths, nor a number of less well-educated boys; rather it is to improve the bulk of the people, and to make the son of a fisherman or a peasant a more intelligent fisherman or peasant than his father had been, and a man whose education will enable him to understand how his lot in life fits in with the scheme of life around him"".

And in 1915, a British resident revealed the [colonial attitude towards education \[pg. 3\]:](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/sbs19890520s.pdf)

>""The great object of education is to train a man to make a living.... you can teach Malays so that they do not lose their skill and craft in fishing and jungle work. Teach them the dignity of manual labour, so that they do not all become krannies (clerks) and I am sure you will not have the trouble which has arisen in India through over education""

The type and quality of education that the British set up for the native inhabitants show that they had no intentions to empower the locals with skills for a new economy. The education provided, while free, was to make sure the locals were kept out of trouble for the British, and remain subservient to the colonial causes. Further impeding the socio-economic status of Malays, the British actively discouraged Malays in switching from agricultural production to more lucrative cash crops, preventing the building of wealth among the Malay communities (Shahruddin Ma’arof, 1988: 51). In contrast to the British suppression of the buildup of Malay wealth and provision of vernacular education, Chinese businessmen, clan associations and Christian missionaries established Chinese schools where students were taught skills like letter-writing and the use of the abacus. By the turn of the 20th century, the [curriculum in these Chinese-language schools expanded to include arithmetic, science, history and geography](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-03_094744.html) while Malay-language schools under [Winstedt’s educational policies focused on vernacular subjects such as basket-weaving.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1629_2010-01-30.html)

**So, when Singapore attained self-governance, did things get better?**

Discontent with the education system and social inequalities was already a big issue in the mid 1950s that the parties that contested for the Legislative Assembly championed for reforms to social issues like [better education systems, housing subsidies and workers rights. ](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19550402-1.2.6)

The People’s Action Party (PAP) won the 1959 Legislative Assembly general elections by running on a rather progressive platform of [low-cost housing, improvement of employment opportunities for locals and a stronger education.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2019-04-08_145822.html) They also campaigned for abolishing the inequality of wealth in their election manifesto (Petir, 1958: 2), with PAP chairman Dr Toh Chin Chye expressing his disgust at seeing [“so many of our people reduced to living like animals because under the present social and economic system, the good things of life are for the ruthless few, those who believe that the poor and the humble are despicable failures.”](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19590429-1.2.4)

With the PAP in power, assurances were made to Singaporeans that no community would be left behind. In 1965, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew [promised aid specifically to help raise the economic and education levels of the Malays](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19650813-1.2.3). In 1967 during a mass rally at Geylang Serai, PM Lee again promised that [“the Government with the support of the non-Malays are prepared to concentrate more than the average share of our resources on our Malay citizens \[pdf\].”](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/lky19670611.pdf) He emphasized the importance of lifting all sections of the community to an even footing, reasoning that “if one section of the community were to lag behind it would harm the unity and integrity of the nation” (Bedlington, 1974: 289).

Despite these promises to help the minorities narrow the inequality gap, very little was done to realize it. Instead, the government took a ruthless approach towards economic growth, sparing no expense. Deputy Prime Minister Goh Keng Swee explained the government’s main concern was “to generate fast economic growth by any and every possible means. . . . If unequal distribution of income induced greater savings and investment . . . then this must be accepted as the price of fighting unemployment.” (Goh, 1972: 275)

By the late 1970s, a strong shift in parents’ preference towards an English-medium education for their children had resulted in a rapid decline in the number of vernacular schools.

Throughout the 1960s and 1970s, there was a shift of parents’ [preference towards educating their child in the English stream.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-09-01_093402.html) This shift, together with a period of minimal intervention in terms of educational policy and assistance to the minorities by the government, caused the [number of enrolments in vernacular schools to rapidly decline.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-10-03_094744.html) The socio-economic gap also widened between the Malays and Chinese, as the Chinese community enjoyed greater occupational mobility relative to the minorities. This can be seen in the shift in the lower manual occupation category, from a relatively equal proportion in 1957 to a 10 percent difference in 1980 \[Table A\]. In 1980, the average Malay household income was only 73.8 percent of the average Chinese household income. The income gap widened considerably by 1990, where the average Malay household income dropped to 69.8 percent of the average Chinese household income \[Table B\] (Rahim, 1998: 19-22). Decades after the lofty promises were made by the government, the Malay community’s slide into marginality continued.

**Wait, the gap got bigger? Did the government do anything?**

In 1979, Education Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee with the Education Study Team released a report on the Ministry of Education, more widely known as the [Goh Report.](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/data2/BookSG/publish/6/6614bee6-52e9-458f-8f89-4c1a9b0529e6/web/html5/index.html?opf=tablet/BOOKSG.xml&launchlogo=tablet/BOOKSG_BrandingLogo_.png) The team was made up of 13 members, most of them systems analysts and economists, and none of whom ‘possess much knowledge or expertise on education’ (Goh Report, 1979: 1). The all-Chinese team excluded social scientists and educationalists, as the Education Minister had little regard for their expertise (Rahim, 1998: 121). The Goh Report made recommendations for radical changes to the educational system, recommendations which then became the basis of the [New Education System (NES).](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2017-11-01_135530.html)

During a time when Tamil, Malay and Chinese schools were getting closed down due to declining enrolment numbers due to the popularity of English medium ones, the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) was introduced in 1978 to [preserve and develop nine Chinese schools into bilingual (Mandarin and English) schools while retaining the values and traditions of a Chinese school.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-07-21_154021.html) As part of the NES, these schools were to be the only ones to offer the Special course which the [top 10 percent scorers of the PSLE are eligible to opt for.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2017-11-01_135530.html) With these schools getting [more resources, better facilities and the best teachers](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19890321-1.2.2), the SAP contradicts the multi-racial principle of giving equal treatment to the non-English language streams. This exclusivity and the elite status of SAP schools affords its students better opportunities and advantages that are virtually out of reach for many minorities in Singapore. Effectively, the SAP is an institutionalized form of ethnic/cultural favouritism (Rahim, 1998: 130)

The NES also introduced [early streaming for students](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2017-11-01_135530.html) which further exacerbated existing inequalities. Despite primary school education being free for all Singaporeans, [families with better financial means have a huge advantage in preparing their child for streaming through additional tuition and better preschool choices#.](https://doi.org/10.1080/14631360500226606) (Barr & Low, 2005: 177) As we have seen from the disparity in household incomes between the Chinese and Malays, early streaming served to widen the gap between the haves and have-nots. The have-nots, more often than not, find themselves in the lower streams, trapped with very limited options providing upward social mobility. They will have to face an insurmountable task to lift themselves and their future generations out of their current predicament.

In 1982, the PAP slogan [“a more just and equal society”](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/lky19600224.pdf) was quietly dropped from the [party’s constitution](https://www.pap.org.sg/party-constitution/). This signaled an end to the socialist ideals that the party built its identity upon.

**Why? It can’t be that the government favours one race over another...can it?**

Examining the PAP leadership’s attitude towards the different cultures and ethnicities is key to understanding what the government values and how these values shaped its policies. Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew, as quoted in the Goh Report, extolled the values of East Asian philosophies: [""The greatest value in the teaching and learning of Chinese is in the transmission of the norms of social or moral behaviour. This means principally Confucianist beliefs and ideas, of man \[sic\], society and the state""](https://eservice.nlb.gov.sg/data2/BookSG/publish/6/6614bee6-52e9-458f-8f89-4c1a9b0529e6/web/html5/index.html?opf=tablet/BOOKSG.xml&launchlogo=tablet/BOOKSG_BrandingLogo_.png&pn=9) (Goh, 1979: v). The government’s championing of SAP schools and ‘Chinese values’ is also complemented by the launch of [‘Speak Mandarin Campaign’](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2013-07-04_122007.html) in 1979.

In 1991, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong espoused similar values as his predecessor, praising the virtues of ‘Confucian dynamism’ and claiming that [Singapore would not be able to thrive and prosper without the Confucian core values of thrift, hard work and group cohesion.](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/gct19910726.pdf) The fear of erosion of the Chinese cultural identity was never matched with a similar concern for the erosion of minority cultural identities, where the minorities were [“expected to submit to a form of partial or incomplete assimilation into a Chinese-generated, Chinese-dominated society.#”](https://doi.org/10.1080/14631360500226606) (Barr & Low, 2005: 167)

On top of favouring Chinese cultural values and identities, the PAP leadership associated the cultures of the minorities with negative connotations. Speaking about a Malay who did well in business, Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew described the man as [“acting just like a Chinese. You know, he’s bouncing around, running around, to-ing and fro-ing. In the old culture, he would not be doing that”](https://graphics.straitstimes.com/STI/STIMEDIA/ebooks/LKY_The_Man_And_His_Ideas.pdf) (Han, et al., 1998: 184). In a Straits Times article on 26 June 1992, SM Lee also implied that the Chinese are inherently better at Maths, and that [""If you pretend that the problem does not exist, and that in fact (the Malays) can score as well as the Chinese in Maths, then you have created yourself an enormous myth which you will be stuck with.+""](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes19920626-1)

These attitudes from the ruling elite translated into more policies that preserved the advantage of the majority. When faced with the “pressing national problem”\* of a declining birth-rate of the Chinese, the government took steps to ensure Chinese numerical dominance in Singapore. The Singapore government encouraged the immigration of skilled workers from countries like Hong Kong, Korea, and Macau, countries which were accorded the status of ‘traditional sources’ of foreign labour (Rahim, 1998: 72). Meanwhile, showing the government’s preference and/or dislike for specific groups of people, Malaysian Malays faced great difficulty in getting work permits. ([“‘Harder’ for bumiputras to get S’pore work permits.+”](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Issue/straitstimes19910307-1), The Straits Times, 7 Mar 1991)

Another policy which worked to preserve the advantage of the majority was the [urban resettlement programmes of the 1960s and 1970s.](https://www.psd.gov.sg/heartofpublicservice/our-institutions/housing-a-nation-building-a-city/) This resulted in the dissolution of the Malay electoral strongholds in the east, undermining the organic growth of Malay political grassroots. When it became apparent in the 1980s that the Malays were moving back to the traditional Malay residential areas, [an ethnic residential quota, labelled the Ethnic Integration Policy, was implemented.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/history/events/d8fea656-d86e-4658-9509-974225951607) The rationale behind the quota was to ensure a balanced racial mix, purportedly for racial harmony. However, this rationale does not stand up to scrutiny in the face of numerous academic studies on interethnic urban attitudes and relations\*\*. Another consequence of the policy is the [reinforcement of racial segregation when taking into account the income disparity between the races.](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/gia/article/multiracial-singapore-ensuring-inclusivity-and-integration) Underlining the weakness of the government’s reasoning, constituencies like Hougang were allowed to remain Chinese residential enclaves despite its population being approximately 80 percent Chinese. (Rahim, 1998: 73-77)

Perhaps the most controversial policy introduced was the Graduate Mothers Scheme. It was introduced in 1983 to reverse the [trend of falling fertility rates of graduate women versus the rising birth-rate of non-graduate women\*\*\*.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19861215-1.2.32.3) In a push to encourage graduate mothers to get married and have children, Deputy Prime Minister Dr Goh Keng Swee unveiled a suite of incentives; [all-expenses paid love-boat cruises for eligible graduate singles in the civil service, a computer dating service, fiscal incentives, and special admissions to National University of Singapore (NUS) to even out the male-female student ratio#.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45130834) At the other end of the spectrum, lesser-educated women were encouraged to have smaller families in a scheme called the Small Family Incentive Scheme. This was achieved by paying out a [housing grant worth S$10,000 to women who were able to meet the following set of conditions: be below 30 years of age, have two or less children, educational level not beyond secondary school, have a household income totalling not more than S$1,500 and willing to be sterilized#.](https://www.jstor.org/stable/45130834)

Based on the average household income statistics, a simple deduction could be made that those eligible for the sterilization programme were disproportionately from the minority communities.

**Isn’t that eugenics?**

Yes. [Singapore had a government-established Eugenics Board.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_2016-11-09_103740.html)

The graduate mothers and sterilization programmes were [greatly unpopular and were ultimately abandoned or modified](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/did-mr-lee-kuan-yew-create-a-singapore-in-his-own-image) after the PAP’s mandate took a [12.9 percent hit in the 1984 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1984_Singaporean_general_election). However that did not mean that eugenics stopped being an influence in policy-making.

In his 1983 National Day address, PM Lee stated that when it comes to intelligence, [“80 per cent is nature, or inherited, and 20 per cent the differences from different environments and upbringing.”](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19830815-1.2.30) This is telling of the role that eugenics, biological determinist and cultural deficit theories played in the formation of PAP policies.

To further safeguard Singapore from “genetic pollution” (Rahim, 1998: 55, [Tremewan, 1994: 113](https://b-ok.asia/book/3307827/16b78c)), the Ministry of Labour in 1984 issued a [marriage restriction between work permit holders and Singaporeans.](https://www.nas.gov.sg/archivesonline/data/pdfdoc/269-1984-07-07.pdf) The work permit holder would have his work permit cancelled, be deported and be permanently barred from re-entering Singapore if he were to marry a Singaporean or permanent resident without obtaining prior approval. Approval from the Commissioner for Employment would only be given if the work permit holder possesses skills and qualifications of value to Singapore.

**Doesn’t sound to me like the government targets any particular race with its policies.**

Deputy Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong in 1987 rationalized that [certain posts in the Singapore Armed Forces had been closed to Malays for ""national security"" reasons.](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870720-1.2.22.26) He claimed that this policy was implemented to avoid placing Malays in an awkward position when loyalty to nation and religion came into conflict. PM Lee also added that the [Malays behaved more as Malay Muslims than as loyal Singaporeans.](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870720-1.2.22.26) PM Lee and DPM Lee’s statements finally made explicit what many suspected to have been an implicit rule. It could be observed that, despite being overrepresented in the civil service, Malays tend to stay in the lower-to-middle rungs of organizations like the SAF. It is also noteworthy that, to date, no Malay has held important Cabinet portfolios such as Minister of Defence, Minister of Home Affairs, Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Minister of Trade and Industry.

The conflation of loyalty to the country with approval of the ruling party proved to be patently flawed, as [studies by the Institute of Policy Studies](https://lkyspp.nus.edu.sg/docs/default-source/ips/cnp__pol_part_survey_media_release_slides_300710_circulation2.pdf) (ST, 30 Sept 1990: 22; IPS, 2010) indicate that Singaporean Malays showed a stronger sense of national pride and identification compared to the other major ethnic groups. The study also found that Citizen-Nation Psychological Ties (CNP) scores, that is, national loyalty, weakens with: higher socio-economic status, Chinese, youth, and political alienation. Even when the Malays have been historically disenfranchised, they were found to be proud to be Singaporeans, loyal to Singapore and more willing to sacrifice for the nation than the other ethnic groups.

Additionally, Minister of Defence and Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong [threatened to withhold aid to the Malay self-help organization Mendaki in 1988.](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880924-1.2.24.27) The threat was issued over an incident during election night where several Malays in a crowd of Workers Party supporters had jeered at PM Goh at a vote counting centre. It became apparent from this incident that [any aid offered by the government was tied to loyalty to the PAP instead of it being the duty of the government to serve Singaporeans regardless of party affiliation\^\^.](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19880929-1.2.37.1.1)

**There have always been Malay PAP Members of Parliament (MP), did they not help fight for these issues?**

The Malay PAP MPs are in the unique position of having to represent not only people of their constituents but also the rest of the Malay Singaporeans while toeing the party line. With many of the government policies being unhelpful towards the Malays, it is near impossible to fulfill this role satisfactorily. PAP MPs Ahmad Haleem (Telok Blangah) and Sha’ari Tadin (Kampong Chai Chee, Bedok) were both made to enjoy early retirements from their political careers for bringing up “sensitive” issues of the Malay community\^\^\^. This set the tone for future PAP Malay MPs to remain unquestioningly in step with the leadership, regardless of their personal agreement, in order to have a long career within the party. Today, Malay PAP MPs have continued with the trend of parroting PAP policies that ran against the interests of the Malay/Muslim community (e.g. [Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/masagos-criticises-faisal-for-raising-divisive-issues) and [Minister-in-charge of Muslim Affairs Yaacob Ibrahim](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/allowing-hijab-problematic-some-jobs-yaacob) with regards to the *tudung* issue).

**What about the Mendaki and the Tertiary Tuition Fee Subsidy (TTFS)?**

The policy providing free education for all Malays was ended in 1990 despite [opposition from the Malays and the opposition party\[Col: 126\].](https://sprs.parl.gov.sg/search/topic?reportid=004_19900612_S0004_T0005) In its place, Mendaki introduced TTFS in 1991 to subsidise the cost of tertiary education in local institutions for those living in low household income. Due to the long history of marginalization and the widening of the inequality gap, the number of Malays who were able to make it to tertiary education institutions, especially in local universities, have been disproportionately low compared to the other ethnic groups. As such, the number of students able to benefit from this subsidy is even lower.

It was only recently, 20 years after the introduction of the subsidy, that the criteria for eligibility underwent revision. [The revision takes into account the size of the family of the applicant, allowing for more Malay students to benefit from it.](https://www.mendaki.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TTFS%20FAQ%202020_revised14Feb.pdf) However, this subsidy is only one measure in an attempt to ensure that Malays students who were able to qualify for tertiary education are able to do so. Short of totally ditching streaming, more care, thought and resources are needed to lift the quality and accessibility of education for the Malays, especially in the [early years of a child’s education.](https://doi.org/10.1080/14631360500226606)

**So what needs to happen now?**

Singaporeans, especially politicians, need to move on from making assertions similar to what PM Lee had made in 1987, that the [""problem is psychological  . . .  if they try hard enough and long enough, then the education gap between them and the Chinese, or them and the Indians, would close. . . .  Progress or achievement depends on ability and effort.""](http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19870707-1.2.33.3) It is important for Singaporeans to recognize the nearly Sisyphean task faced by marginalized communities in improving their socio-economic standing. Handicapped right from the start, their perceived failures in our “meritocratic” society should not be judged as an indictment of their efforts, but influenced in no small measure by the failings of the state in dragging their feet to take action. As a community, Singaporeans need to actively combat negative stereotyping, and move away from policies that were rooted in eugenics. Government intervention into ensuring unbiased, fair hiring practices would also help in raising the standing of the marginalized minorities. It would be impossible for Singapore to live up to its multiracial, meritocratic ideals without making fundamental changes to the above mentioned policies.

*\*\* From Lily Zubaidah Rahim’s* The Singapore Dilemma *(1998: 76-77): Rabushka’s (Rabushka, Alvin (1971),* ‘Integration in Urban Malaya: Ethnic Attitudes Among Malays and Chinese’*, 91-107) study found that it was common for people living in ethnically homogeneous areas to adopt favourable attitudes towards other ethnic groups. People who resided in ethnically mixed areas but did not mix with other ethnic groups were also found to hold negative attitudes towards others. He postulated that physical proximity coupled with superficial interaction across ethnic lines may in fact lead to heightened contempt for other ethnic groups. Urban studies (Fischer, Claude (1976),* The Urban Experiment\*) have similarly found that close physical distance of different ethnic groups does not necessarily result in narrowing the social distance between the communities. Indeed, physical ethnic proximity in large cities may well engender mutual revulsion and a heightening of ethnocentrism. These research findings have been corroborated by several Singaporean studies (Hassan, Riaz (1977),\* ‘Families in Flats: A Study of Low Income Families in Public Housing’*; Lai, Ah Eng (1995),* ‘Meanings of Multiethnicity: A Case Study of Ethnicity and Ethnic Relations in Singapore’*) which have found interethnic relations in the ethnically integrated public housing flats to be relatively superficial.*

*\*\*\* In the same article, PM Lee drew a straight line connecting the Malays with lower educational levels in this line of rhetoric questioning: “Why is the birth rate between the Malays, and the Chinese and Indians so different? Because the educational levels achieved are also different.”*

*\^ The stronger representation of Malays in civil service and Western multinational corporations was likely due to the difficulty in seeking employment in local firms.

This shift, together with a period of minimal intervention in terms of educational policy and assistance to the minorities by the government, caused the number of enrolments in vernacular schools to rapidly decline. \n\nWhen the PSLE was first launched in the 1960s, Singapore Malays did far better at English than Singapore Chinese. It took decades for Singapore Chinese school leavers to catch up and surpass Singapore Malays - the switchover only occurred in the 1990s.\n\nThe \'fact\' of unambiguous Malay educational underperformance only dates from that point - before then, Singapore Malays would consistently surpass Singapore Chinese at English, and Singapore Chinese chauvinists would whisper how it was evidence that the PAP was favouring the Malays, by forcing everyone to use an ostensibly neutral common language that actually benefited the Malays (and elite English-speaking Chinese).\n\nThe 60s/70s passive shift in preference to English medium education was the PAP\'s excuse of choice to justify abolishing Chinese medium education (in the Goh report), but it was an initially Malay phenomenon - the emotive support for the Chinese-medium Nantah university being indicative of sentiments on the Chinese side. The planned destruction of Chinese medium education would proceed in the face of enormous resistance by Singapore Chinese, with the Nantah albatross going on to hang around the PAP\'s electoral neck for two decades. Low Thia Khiang did not build his success on nothing.\n\nToday we still see e.g. the Malaysian Chinese community clinging on ferociously to their vernacular schools. It is ironically the Singapore Chinese who have switched over to English as the de facto mother tongue (main language spoke at home), to the extent they no longer even remember once ferociously demanding Chinese medium education.\n\nThere is definitely a racial element, nonetheless - with the Chinese community, the PAP felt entitled to wage (culture) war over the decades to decisively reshape it in its own colonial-anglophone-elite image: English-speaking, internationally connected, comfortable with the language of material progress. If this cost it its own cultural heritage, then so be it. An entire generation of grandchildren cannot talk to their grandparents: tough, that is life.  But with the Malay community, the PAP has generally adopted a largely laissez-faire ""well, what can we do about it"" attitude to the community turning more religious and more insular over time (the Ethnic Integration Policy being a notable exception). \n\nIt\'s not that the government is *unaware* that Singapore Malays, uniquely, are turning more religious even as Singapore Chinese and Singapore Indians secularize. The MHRA white paper at the turn of the 1990s already remarked on the phenomenon. But the government - not normally known to recoil from grand projects of social engineering - has treated it as inviolate. Even recent reforms to e.g. compel the tiny cohort of Madrasah students to sit for the PSLE has been handled with a light touch and generous cycles of consultation (by Singapore standards, anyway).\n\nThe underlying reason is not mainly domestic, I think, but is obviously related to the shadow of Malaysia, which has taken upon itself to regularly comment on the Singapore government\'s relations to its own Malay community (compare, e.g., the symmetry of UMNO\'s own delicate handling of the Malaysian Chinese vernacular schools - repression but not abolition, and hence stagnation). \n\nThat is a difficult dynamic to navigate, but I think very different from your proposed narrative of events.', ""> During a time when Tamil, Malay and Chinese schools were getting closed down due to declining enrolment numbers due to the popularity of English medium ones, the Special Assistance Plan (SAP) was introduced in 1978 to preserve and develop nine Chinese schools into bilingual (Mandarin and English) schools while retaining the values and traditions of a Chinese school. As part of the NES, these schools were to be the only ones to offer the Special course which the top 10 percent scorers of the PSLE are eligible to opt for. With these schools getting more resources, better facilities and the best teachers, the SAP contradicts the multi-racial principle of giving equal treatment to the non-English language streams. This exclusivity and the elite status of SAP schools affords its students better opportunities and advantages that are virtually out of reach for many minorities in Singapore. Effectively, the SAP is an institutionalized form of ethnic/cultural favouritism (Rahim, 1998: 130)\n\nHow do you think that squares with [this comment thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gv3bw3/people_who_are_attendinghave_attended_sap_schools/fsm9vny/) - excerpts below:\n\n> Upon Singapore's independence, these Chinese-medium schools were further suppressed by government policies favoring English-educated workers and the government's crackdown on communism. Those who had a Chinese-language education soon found themselves despised by the government and society. Many of the older taxi drivers in Singapore (especially the anti-government ones) are taxi drivers precisely because the societal changes of their time rendered their Chinese-language education utterly worthless.\n\n> SAP schools were thus created afterwards to placate this group of Singaporeans who experienced having their culture, traditions, and education stripped away from them. The irony is that a program meant to help the disenfranchised is now seen as a tool for further disenfranchisement."", ""From what I understand how the current education part of the system is considered meritocratic (and its caveats)\n\nAll children have access to quality primary school education.

But to argue that it is the main cause for the racial disparity is a bridge too far to cross for me.', ""I appreciate the effort that went into this, but I have to disagree with you on a few points.\n\nIf you are measuring 'success' by economic prosperity, like what others have mentioned, you are already using a metric that is not inherent to the cultural fabric of malays and hence they will always be 'disadvantaged'. Within the muslim malay community, the values commonly taught to younger generations is a mix of family values and being loyal to the muslim faith - of which they excel in with a higher birth rate and extremely high religious adherence! This obviously comes at the expense of having scarce focus on being economically outstanding. This is evidenced most strongly in the region with our Malaysian and Indonesian neighbours - even with all the affirmative action going on, they still lag behind their chinese and indian counterparts. Its also no secret that chinese and indians unapologetically worship money as part of their culture and extol a good education as the path to that money. Results-based analysis is inherently flawed as it assumes the demographic not only identifies with the goal you have assigned them, but is also doing absolutely everything possible to achieve that, which I do not agree with in this situation.\n\nLocking the demographic ratios as it is forms a core part of Singapore's identity. If left to our own devices without new citizens, we will become a muslim majority nation in a few generations simply because of the higher birthrate enjoyed by the malay community. Once again, look to our neighbours to see what a muslim majority does to its non-muslim minority - even for Malaysia, which has muslim malays at 55% (2017 census), has harsh policies installed to sideline minorities, and yet, to reinforce my first point, they STILL succeed despite the marginalization. Not enforcing the quota will never be an option for our government.\n\nOthers have brought up the issue of malays in the armed forces and the simple fact that indians are not 'sidelined' whatsoever by these policies mean that its not a racial issue.\n\nIt was, and always will be, a religious issue.\n\nMalays are inextricably linked with their faith, either through choice or out of fear of being branded with apostasy by their community. What our government wants is for Singaporeans to be loyal to the state over everything else. That includes your race and religion. Notice how every single muslim majority nation enshrines islam in some legal way and provides it preferential treatment? There's no way, as of now, to disassociate malays with islam and the government is absolutely right in not taking this risk, especially when we had some people actually harbouring Mas Selamat years back as he tried to escape. Having islamic adherence as part of your identity is fine. Putting it above the interests of the state is an absolute no-go. The stronger one's adherence to islam, the harder it is for one to fully integrate into any non-islamic environment because of the demands made upon the adherent by the religion to put it above all else, even loyalty to one's country. If you follow it to its letter, its demands make it inherently divisive - something we cannot afford.\n\nRemember, all religions aim to subjugate its audience in one way or another. The less educated a group is, the more easy it is to keep them in check. That the christian/buddhist/taoist/hindu communities have a significantly weaker grip on their adherents compared to islam is a result of the values preached by the faith that actively discourages critically analyzing it. Just give birth to more children and maintain family harmony, which contributes to more children which means more adherents to the islamic faith. Absolutely foolproof strategy. Not to mention if you marry a muslim you have to convert, but that's a discussion for another thread. \n\nI remember LKY debating CST on this issue and his conclusion was basically - the less religious a malay is, the easier it is for him to integrate and excel. Absolving oneself of the restrictions and baggage that islam gives you more liberty in absorbing other schools of thought and realigning yourself with different values - e.g. to have a stronger focus on academic excellence, earning capability, etc. These are not 'chinese values' or 'indian values'. These are simply values that have historically not enjoyed the limelight in the malay muslim community. If they prove to be useful in the 21st century, I believe the malay community should strive to adopt them to better their lot in life. I have no doubt that many SG malays already do."", ""Disagreements and/or clarifications that I have are stated below. Any points in your post that I do not address, take it as agreement with your points.\n\n**1\\] Population planning, specifically Graduate Mothers Scheme (GMS)**\n\n\\- Firstly, the GMS, in and of itself, did not have any specific racial component.\n\n\\- 2nd, GMS was introduced in 1984, not 1983. Listing quote from  [https://www.womensaction.sg/article/reproductive](https://www.womensaction.sg/article/reproductive)\n\n>It established the Social Development Unit (SDU) in 1984 to encourage matches between graduate women and men in the public service. \n\nListing quote from   [https://www.aware.org.sg/2010/11/the-birth-of-awarepart-one/](https://www.aware.org.sg/2010/11/the-birth-of-awarepart-one/) \n\n>First, in 1984 the Ministry of Education announced a new priority scheme for registration of Primary One Children called “the Graduate Mothers Priority Scheme”.\n\n\\- 3rd, Stop-At-Two policy (from 1968), legalization of abortion, sterilisation in 1970  \n\n The financial and educational disincentives of the Stop-At-Two policy, social pressure for voluntary sterilisation (eg hospital workers strongly encouraging sterilisation) coupled with $ incentives, arguably had greater impact on the socio-economic structure of SG. Popular criticism of Stop-At-Two was that it was targeted at minority groups, since generally, the Malays and Indians have a higher birth rate and bigger family size compared to the Chinese.\n\n\\- 4th, impact of Stop-At-Two policy + GMS \n\nWhether the Stop-At-Two policy further entrenched the socio-economic structure and hastened the demographic transition/shift or whether it was inevitable, I am unsure. As for GMS, since it was rather short-lived, the impact was minimal.\n\n\\- 5th, Three-Or-More policy from 1987 plus baby-making incentives in recent times\n\nJust to note, incentives from 1987 on-wards to encourage Singaporeans to have more babies have no racial component, afaik.\n\n**2\\] Eugenics**\n\n\\- Firstly, call it the Singapore Family Planning and Population Board (SFPPB), not the Eugenics Board. That it espoused the eugenics thinking of LKY, no argument there unfortunately.\n\n\\- Whether LKY's eugenics thinking had any racial component, hard to say. If he was racist, he would not have been in favor of the merger with Malaya. Whether the failure of the merger in 1965 impacted his thinking, I am not sure. No data on that that I know of.\n\n**3\\] EIP**\n\n   \\- I would phrase the EIP as having failed in its aim for social integration. I disagree with your phrasing of ”purportedly for racial harmony“. There is evidence of unintended racial segregation. I would say EIP did both positively for social integration as well as negatively with unintended impact on the socio-economic structure/racial segregation.\n\n   \\- Moving forward, EIP has to be changed again, as SG is now having to include more immigrants as part of the population ponzi scheme to address economic shortfall from a population with declining birth-rate.\n\n**4\\] SAP**\n\n   \\- As I remember it, the SAP (from 1979) was more for appeasement and placating of the Chinese community leaders, for the merging of Nanyang University (a Chinese University) with NUS, in 1980.\n\n   \\- The policy at fault should not be the SAP per se, but more with the Mother Tongue Language (MTL) policy. SAP accepts Chinese-Speaking students. Due to MTL assigning mother tongue based on ethnicity, this meant SAP ended up with students from either Chinese or mixed background.\n\n**5\\] Streaming**\n\n   \\- Early streaming impacted all from lower socio-economic status equally, not just minority groups. So I would disagree with mentioning early streaming as part of the problem of systemic bias against minority groups.\n\n**6\\] Meritocracy of SG, or lack thereof**\n\n   \\- Just curious why your post focuses on minority groups within the so-called meritocratic system in SG.\n\n   \\- As it stands now, the bias in SG education system is less in ethnicity and more with financial status. A Chinese kid from a lower-income group is just as disadvantaged as a kid from both a minority and lower-income group."", ""I think our education system is about as meritocratic as it is going to get. The hiring in companies is something else though. \n\nOne of the surest indications is that if you're in an MNC, just compare the differences between the Singapore and Malaysia office in terms of diversity."", 'I\'ve said this before and I\'ll say it again (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hwefb7/imran_rahim_releases_public_statement_about/fz1r6mg/). Malays in Singapore are ""unequal"" and ""behind"" if you take education and income to be the sole metrics of success.\n\nThe Fertility rate for Singaporean Malays is 1.8. For Singapore Chinese, 0.99, and for Singapore Indians, 0.98 (https://www.tablebuilder.singstat.gov.sg/publicfacing/createDataTable.action?refId=13273). Malays also marry the youngest (https://data.gov.sg/dataset/median-age-of-brides-by-ethnic-group-annual, https://data.gov.sg/dataset/median-age-of-grooms-by-ethnic-group-annual).\n\nIf you define ""success"" as getting married as a young adult and having children, Malays are successful, Indians and Chinese are behind and falling back further. Also note that marrying young, and having children, is negatively correlated with income worldwide.\n\n0.2% of Malays identify as irreligious, while this number is 21.8% for Chinese and 1.1% for Indians. 57.4% of Chinese identify as Taoist or Buddhist, 98.7% of Malays identify as Muslim, while 80.6% of Indians identify as Hindu or Muslim. (https://www.singstat.gov.sg/-/media/files/publications/cop2010/census_2010_release1/findings.pdf)\n\nIf you define ""success"" as following your ancestral faith, then Malays are very successful, Indians somewhat less, and Chinese are severely underprivileged.\n\nAnd in general, does the Malay Singaporean community value faith and having children, over education and income? I\'d say yes. Does he Chinese Singaporean community value education and income, over faith and having children? I\'d also say yes.\n\nOf course, racism (at the individual and institutional level) is very much real and should be counteracted. A Malay person should have the same opportunities as an equally-qualified Chinese person. That\'s what meritocracy entails.\n\nBut different cultures hold different values, and it\'s really sinocentric to believe that Malay Singaporeans as a community should have exactly the same values and behaviours as the Chinese Singaporean community, let alone have exactly the same socio-economic outcomes. Why not put it the other way around? Why not say that Chinese Singaporeans are backwards by Malay Singaporean standards, because they produce fewer children on average and are less religious, and create a task force to reduce inequality by boosting Chinese fertility/religiosity?\n\nMeaningful diversity inherently leads to inequality, and there\'s nothing wrong with that per se.

They are a good comparison to use because they have neither Malay nor Chinese privilege to rely upon. They face the same job discrimination by the Chinese too, but they seem to enjoy better socioeconomic status. Even the Indian Muslims and Acehnese are viewed in Malaysia as being more economically dominant than the Malays. \n\n2) A Chinese or more broadly an East Asian income gap exists in a lot of countries, so we can\'t fully blame ""Mandarin only"" job discrimination or racism for the alleged income gap. But that also means that the ""Lazy Malay"" narrative does not fully explain such a gap either. Perhaps its the immigrant effect?\n\n3) The issue of a Malay-Chinese income gap isn\'t unique. Similar experiences were faced in Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and Philippines with Chinese populations. Much more draconian forms of ""Malay Rights"" have been tried too, actually and it seems like Chinese economic dominance remained even after assimilation. \n\n4) Job discrimination angle is a bit more complicated than people think. A study was done in Malaysia and it was found that Malay firms themselves discriminate against their own kind. /shrug\n\nTLDR: We cant blame all of it on Chinese racism, but its probably not because the Malays are ""lazy"" either.', ""Not much to add personally.

The latter would suggest that either the race is privileged or there is something about the race that disallow them from economic and educational prosperity. Inequality affects all Singaporeans, not just malays, and if they get more help it should be because there is a bigger proportion of them in the lower income. I don't think Singapore should adopt the racial politics of Malaysia.\n\nWith that, the question now turns to how can we reduce inequality in a meritocratic country. It is not possible to give the amount of resources millionaire parents can give to their children to everybody, nor is it possible to stop parents from giving their children all the help that they can give.

There was a time where Malays were not called up to serve\n\n\n\n In [The Roar of the Lion City: Ethnicity, Gender, and Culture in the Singapore Armed Forces: ](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0095327X06291854)\n\n>This fear of the Muslim Malay population has led to a systematic discrimination in the military by Singapore\'s leadership after 1965. Most of the senior military officers appointed to the SAF immediately after independence came from the civil service and shared the view that the Malay population could not be trusted.. At the time, however, Malays made up the vast majority of both the Singaporean military and police force. Yet, the new, postindependence SAF leadership, though possessing minimal martial experience, proceeded to exclude the Malay population forcibly from the military. Recruitment of Singaporean Malays virtually was halted after 1967, despite the fact that Malays made up 50 to 80 percent of the first cohort of volunteers for the new armed force.. Experienced Malay officers and noncommissioned officers were transferred from field commands to logistics and support, while many others were forced to retire or were shut off from promotion.. Prime Minister Lee Kwan Yew and the rest of the Chinese leadership feared that the Malay population would surrender in a conflict with Malaysia so much that they sacrificed virtually all of the experience and professionalism that had been built up before 1965 in exchange for a Chinese-dominated military.\n\n-\n\n>At present, official discrimination against the Malay population remains an open secret among the Singaporean military!\' Although there have been some improvements in recent years, Malays systematically are kept from serving in areas of the military considered sensitive, to include signal, intelligence, and elite-guards units!. This exclusion is so extreme that SAF intelligence uses ethnic Chinese trained in Malay as analysts to read Malay newspapers rather than take advantage of their own ethnic Malay soldiers.. Also, it was not until 2004 that Singapore\'s first non-Chinese officer reached flag rank!. \n\n\n\n\nIn the 1960-1970s, Malays were excluded from conscription. This lead to mass unemployment among Malay men.\n\n> There was an unfortunate side effect to the non-recruitment of Malays into National Service. Employers in Singapore are generally unwilling to recruit or train young male workers who have not completed National Service or obtained exemption papers as these youths can be called up at any time. Since Malays were not officially exempted from National Service, Malay youths were unable to obtain apprenticeships or regular jobs, and many were forced into an extended limbo period of about 10\xa0years from ages 14 to 24 … (this) was in part responsible for the high percentage of Malay youths who became involved in heroin abuse during the late 1970s”. \n\n- Tania Li argues in her book\xa0Malays in Singapore: Culture, Economy, and Ideology\n\nUntil this day you will notice a lack of Malays in ""sensitive"" SAF units.

I just want to share some thoughts regarding meritocracy in Singapore.\r\n\r\nI think there are two prevalent beliefs about meritocracy in Singapore which make it difficult to have a conversation about meritocracy and related issues such as inequality. Firstly, that the meritocratic system is self-evidently superior and any alternative is inferior. Secondly, a perfectly realised meritocracy is already in place in Singapore. With these two beliefs, it follows that the current state of our social-economic system must already be The Best of All Possible Worlds and any attempt to improve things or change things is doomed to make things worse.', ' w.r.t the point about the graduate mothers scheme specifically, while obviously the eugenics aspect was misguided, I think there is some merit to the idea of encouraging family planning based on socio-economic ability. \n\nanecdotally, lower income households are more likely to have more children, trapping them in a cycle of poverty as already scarce resources are spread thinly among many siblings. this only serves to exacerbate inequality especially in the crucial area of education where some are forced into the workforce early or are unable to pursue higher education. better family planning and smaller family sizes in this group would mean that they can focus their resources on a single child and give them the best opportunity to succeed and break out of the poverty cycle, as well as increase the chances that their childhood is a happy and comfortable one rather than one of hardship. \n\nimo this is the an effective way to reduce both inequality and poverty while preserving the advantages of the meritocratic system', 'I may not be as well-read as you, but as a Chinese I feel that racism, or at least social injustice definitely occurs in some way. In a group of people with differences, it is inevitable that there exists individuals who favour those who are similar to them.

When you put prejudice together with a group of different people, the majority has a higher chance of winning in any scenario. Ultimately, is the solution to help the “less fortunate” or to get rid of prejudice completely?

Yes, not even once on all his titahs.\n\nIt is much much much more harder being Chinese, Indians and Ibans in Brunei than Malays in Singapore. If the policies in Singapore \'disadvantaged\' Malays, the policies in Brunei are hell for Chinese and Indians. Chinese and Indians in Brunei don\'t like to complain about this because Brunei is an absolute monarchy, citizens have no right even to vote, and there is no election. You complain too much be careful ISD officials turn up at your door.\n\nYet despite this the private sectors in Brunei are still being dominated by non-Malays.

Article 152 of the Constitution, inter alia, states quite clearly that the Government recognises the special position of the Malays, who are the indigenous people of Singapore, and that it shall, amongst other things, support the educational interest of the Malays. Free education to the Malays has been part of our life since the colonial time. The PAP Government took office in 1959 and later on we became independent in 1965. Throughout this period up to the present day, the Malays in Singapore have enjoyed free education up to tertiary levels. In other words, there is implementation of this part of our Constitution by the Government. And in accordance with the British constitutional law which we inherit, the carrying out of that part of the Constitution over time has made it become part of the Constitution by convention and practice. Therefore, it would appear that the Government\'s attempt to take away free education of the Malays is unconstitutional. It is a breach against well-established convention of the Constitution. I think this is the main complaint of the Malays - a deprivation of their established constitutional rights.” Hansard, Debate on President’s Address.

Premised on this logic, PAP Malay MP Harun Abdul Ghani advised the Malays that ‘trailing behind the Chinese does not mean that the Malays are losing out.

The joint Madrasah P1 Entrance Test conducted by MUIS admits [only half](https://irsyad.sg/?page_id=9776) of applicants to Madrasahs at P1, partly because parents can apply to only 1 of the 4 madrasahs offering primary education, two of which are girls-only. \n\nMeanwhile, single-sex and co-ed SAP schools and non-SAP schools with strong Chinese heritage/education are dotted all over the island. \n\nFrom Educational Statistics Digest 2019 from MOE, preliminary figures for govt (may not just be MOE) recurring spending per pri, sec, and pre-U student was 12,020 15,518 17,702 respectively in AY18/19. The government definitely does not spend this amount on madrasahs. \n\n2018 enrolment for full time madrasahs was 3,589, 2,258 of which are girls, and 258 teachers.

The 2003 annual intake was 400 as per Yaacob Ibrahim in parliament. \n\nThe per student funding model from MUIS as per the first link means falling enrolment and more teaching staff, perhaps to raise outcomes in secular subjects, results in madrasahs that are even more underresourced.

Meanwhile, with discrimination in government and local firms (See the [Racism and the Pinkerton syndrome in Singapore: effects of race on hiring decisions](https://doi.org/10.1017/prp.2019.9) study) restricting the number of Malays getting fair pay and employment chances, we won't reach that tipping point any time soon."", 'Thank you, and thanks for bringing that up!

One only has to wonder what kind of culture and society this is, and why it is insular and not progressive and has not developed the way other countries have . So even in OPs ideal scenario which is effectively Brunei where the dominant malay muslim demographic have been in control and heavily elevated , they have failed to modernize , develop and progress , even when compared to the chinese whom they have to restrict land ownership and impose many other heavy restrictions so that they themselves do not get overrun .\n\nThe real issue that the malays are unwilling to confront,  that is also made taboo to discuss, is their social race religious structure namely strict religious laws , insistence on 'malay' and adherence to monarchy (ten Sultans for ten Malay states in Malaysia and Brunei) - as social identity and philosophy. In Brunei it is made law. This critically holds them back from realizing their full potential as members of modern society despite many affirmative policies.\n\n The UK has one queen and 70mil pop. Japan is something like 130mil pop and 1 emperor. Malaysia and Brunei is 30mil pop with ten Sultans, and these Sultans have real power and authority until even PMs have to defer to them. Or in Brunei's case the Sultan is the PM as well. To say that there's a conflict of interest is an understatement.\n\nTherefore to blame other cultures and claim that they have been not given or restricted opportunities is inane. They really need to look at themselves first.\n\nThe Chinese haven't always been dominant. In the past they were similar to the malays. Previously they were called the sick men of asia (from opium addiction) and had to suffer what's been called a century of humiliation for insisting on their racial and cultural identity first and foremost. That lesson was painfully learnt .\n\n The malays lived much better than the other races when our ancestors came. But while other races had to struggle and modernize , such as the chinese learning and adopting English and other cultures , the malays went on a ultra race and religious (hak ketuanan melayu ) political bender instead . Look at the education system in Malaysia. It's indoctrinated and choke full of race and religious politics at the high cost of actual learning and knowledge. Desperate attempts to reverse and revert to English in maths and science by Mahatir have been overwritten by race and religious agendas and have not gone through.\n\n Sadly the malays have become the new sick men of asia who are unwilling to let go of race and religion , and unwilling to modernize and adapt . As a Bruneian I am sympathetic to their cause.

It would also seem fair to extrapolate from the education levels of Malay-Muslims, that it would stand to reason that once the Malay-Muslims attain a higher overall level of education, this rate would taper off too into a stable percentage of the population. \n\nAs for the comparisons with Malaysia and Indonesia, I find it a bit difficult to make broad assumptions when there are too many variables to take into account.  \n\nAbout the demographic ratios, to lock it is to permanently create an unnatural majority: how will it be done?

If we’re talking about loyalty to country, perhaps it would be in the interest of Singapore that we have more Malays in positions of sensitive nature?

However, with lower Malay incomes, the cost of raising children is still high. \n\nEdit: Forgot to point out that the latest median first age of marriage for men in 2018 31.2 and 29, and for women in 2017 is 29.2 and 27.4, for Chinese and Malay newlyweds respectively. The difference in age between these two races is 2.2 and 1.8 for men and women respectively. I'm not sure if this is huge.  \n\nAlso, I noticed a trend in falling birth rate during the 2008 economic crisis that persisted until 2010. The birth rate yearly from 2008 was 1.19 1.14 1.13 for Indians, 1.14\t1.08\t 1.02 for Chinese, and 1.91 1.82 1.65 for Malays. Birthrates then remained dropped and remained stagnant for Chinese and Indians, while they returned to the previous level afterwards for Malays. This was not observed in 1998 or 2003.\n\n The fall in birth rate correlated to the economic crisis was significantly greater for Malays compared to the other races. This may also be due to Malays disproportionately affected in loss of income. \n\nSo there is evidence that Malays are increasingly as good, if not better, at making reproductive choices based on income.

I’m assuming it was just a matter of an example that came out unsavorily, but just because faith and family are valued doesn’t mean education and income are not. There are more barriers for the Malay community to attain education/income levels at the same rate as Chinese/Indian counterparts, and it cannot simply be attributed to individual, community differences (see: all of what the OP has explained).

But read it as a historian, as a snapshot of the period in which it was written, to understand why the PAP of the 1970s and 1980s is reacting as it does. Who or what is Syed arguing *with* throughout the text, from a safe perch in the then-University of Singapore? Why does the Singapore establishment (in particular the Singapore Malay elite, pre-1980s-Islamic-revival) of the 1970s *want* to attack the 'lazy native' concept?\n\nSyed is writing in 1977. He is responding to Mahathir's 1970 *The Malay Dilemma*, written at a point where Mahathir was a Malay ultranationalist so extreme that the Tunku exiled him from the party, and Mahathir would lead a post-May-1969 'Young Turk' reaction so vicious that Malaysia's founding father would be forced from politics himself. By 1977 Mahathir is the de facto anointed Prime Minister in waiting. \n\nThe wider context is the shift in Malay-Chinese relations as the Malaysian New Economic Policy sets in across the 1970s. Politics was previously dominated by the generation of anticolonial Anglophone liberals (much like, say, Syed himself), who found it relatively easy to work the reins of British colonial politics - journalists, lawyers, teachers, academics. This set were either influenced by or reacting to the British vision of a multiracial post-British Malaya, and envisioned, as the British did, a nativised but otherwise recognisable society - a trilingual, multiracial population with the progressive politics of a highly educated intelligentsia, albeit with Hang Tuah rather than Richard the Lionheart as a shared cultural touchstone. \n\nThis generation was sidelined in the face of both Malay ultranationalism and Chinese embrace of appeasement of that ultranationalism (to escape the fate of the Indonesian Chinese), rather than rallying to support multiracialism proper (don't commit that too-common sin of Singapore scholars to engage in parochialism and only focus on the Singapore terrain, especially for 60s-80s Singapore - a Singapore so self-evidently economically successful as to not spend much of its attention on affairs across the border is remarkably recent). This, ultimately, is what a 'lazy Malay' idiom in the 1970s is speaking to: a rising ultranationalism that takes it as a natural fact of the universe justifying a new and radical economic programme. It's a very different audience to the 1990s or today. \n\nIn the 1970s, the old liberal Malay bourgeois outlook survives in Singapore as its outpost. It is comfortable amongst the relatively secular PAP elite - CMIOization in Singapore is decades in the future, Malay Islamic insurgence likewise waiting for the Iranian revolution. Material factors mattered too: the Singapore civil service is still disproportionately Malay (especially the army and police), and Singapore Malays are, relative to their Malaysian counterparts, relatively urban and educated and find it easier to adapt to the industrial economic miracle, which is *everywhere* in Singapore rather than limited to Chinese-dominated cities. Certainly more easily than the Chinese-educated Chinese. Across the 1970s and 1980s the household income gap between Singapore Chinese and Malays narrowed rapidly (although the abrupt British withdrawal 'east of Suez' in 1975 set things back for several years; most of the tens of thousands of base workers were Malay). The system is - mostly - working well for Singapore Malay.\n\nThose who disagreed - there *were* Malay elites in Singapore who believed that Singapore would be forced by the Malaysian boycott (on Singapore entrepot trade) to crumble in humiliation - do the logical thing and leave for Malaysia (similar to how Chinese community leaders in Malaya who believed in pan-Chineseness largely left for the mainland and therefore ceased to be relevant in Malayan politics, leaving the leaders who instead embraced a Malayan identity). Former Utusan journos were notoriously pro-Dasar Ekonomi Baru. They left and made careers in Kuala Lumpur. Why not? Malaysia was really then richer and offered more opportunities, even to Singapore Chinese (average household income in Malaysia was still higher than in Singapore for the Chinese, even with all the Chinese kampung bahru). \n\nThe liberal collapse in Malaysia plus these factors in Singapore led to a counterreaction in Singapore. Singapore Malay intelligentsia reacted sharply to the crude communalism across the border. It was the *Singapore Malay Teacher's Union* which first pushed for the abolition of the vernacular schools and embrace of English medium education as early as 1970; the government uncomfortably resisted it (Singapore and Malaysia would not crush campus politics until their respective campus acts in 1975; only afterwards would the Goh report terminate vernacular education: in 1979 taking effect 1983)."", '> A Purely speculation, but it seems like the government was on a relentless push towards English medium schools regardless of the collateral, but seeing that there were some huge benefactors behind some Chinese schools, there might have been push-back from that corner. ... All that said, that the government decided only to save Chinese schools, preserve their values, bolster their facilities and provided better teachers made it unfair for minorities who, if they were lucky enough to not be trapped by the school closings, were not given the option to pursue a similar kind of premium education.\n\nSo [this fits in with one of the links](https://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/newspapers/Digitised/Article/straitstimes19890321-1.2.2) you\'ve provided: \n\n> Asked when a similar programme would be implemented for Malay and Tamil, he said the initiative would have to come from the communities. \n\n> He added that his feedback from the Malay community was that they were less concerned with language than with other subjects and preferred to see how the 10 schools progressed first. ...\n\n> Parents responded by enrolling their children in English-medium schools so that by the mid-1980s, the Chinese-, Malay- and Tamil-medium schools had been phased out and all schools converted to a national system of education with pupils learning English as a first language and their mother tongue as a second language. \n\nYou\'ve said that ""there were some huge benefactors behind some Chinese schools"".

Or was it not on their priority list (as suggested by the source provided)? \n\nOne other question: how do you think madrasahs fit into this picture? [Based on wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrasahs_in_Singapore), it seems that madrasahs provided a means of instruction up to at least O levels from 1973.

muttutanman,hn14p3,A take on Chinese privilege (very long post),2020-07-08 03:20:50,singapore,378762,68,230,"Raeesah Khan's intentions are noble: she points out the inequalities present in Singaporean society and makes it clear that she wants to eliminate them. My gripe with her analysis, and by extension some of the proposed aspects of alleged Chinese privilege, is that it fails to consider the more subtle lines of division, which have far more effects on Singapore's social dynamics. I will address some of the very common arguments put forth by those who claim that there is Chinese privilege. There are my opinions based on personal experience as well as some readings that I have done, so feel free to challenge them.

&#x200B;

**Prelude: Chinese people are not a monolith**

From the 1960's to the early 2000's the Chinese community is not linguistically homogeneous. One can broadly divide the community into three categories - the dialect-speaking, the Mandarin-speaking and the English-speaking. Access to resources is predicated on a wider access to society. Naturally, English proficiency (reflected by use of English as a main language in a household) is strongly correlated with social mobility in Singapore ( [https://repository.nie.edu.sg/bitstream/10497/3339/1/CRP22and23\_04AL\_Conf08%28AERA%29\_VaishTan.pdf](https://repository.nie.edu.sg/bitstream/10497/3339/1/CRP22and23_04AL_Conf08%28AERA%29_VaishTan.pdf) ) . Problem is that English-medium schools are inaccessible to poorer dialect and Mandarin-speaking Chinese, because they are expensive and foreign, and instead opt for Chinese-medium schools which were more familiar and cheap. Today, this is not as big of an issue, but the remnants of past linguistic divides are still prevalent ( [https://repository.nie.edu.sg/bitstream/10497/3339/1/CRP22and23\_04AL\_Conf08%28AERA%29\_VaishTan.pdf](https://repository.nie.edu.sg/bitstream/10497/3339/1/CRP22and23_04AL_Conf08%28AERA%29_VaishTan.pdf) ).

&#x200B;

**Argument 1: The British favoured the Chinese population. That was when it all began.**

Answer: Yes and no. Malays were favoured politically, and the immigrant Chinese and Indians economically ( [https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/The-impact-of-British-rule](https://www.britannica.com/place/Malaysia/The-impact-of-British-rule) ). This accounts for a very strong overseas Chinese and overseas Indian economic presence in the Malay world until today, despite them being the political and numerical minority (discounting Singapore). The British set up English-medium and Malay-medium schools, but schools specially dedicated to immigrants are funded through community donations (keep in mind for later on). This is probably why in Singapore, Brunei and Malaysia, the Chinese population has shown to be the least assimilated overseas Chinese community. By contrast, Thai Chinese are considered to be the most successfully integrated diaspora in SEA.

**Argument 2: Chinese culture receives protection.**

Answer: On the contrary I would claim the converse. Chinese culture is actually being slowly dismantled. Chinese education in today's Singapore is nowhere the level in 1960's or 70's Singapore. Several points to note: Use of Chinese dialects, use of Mandarin, Chinese academia and Chinese intellectual culture. I can confidently say all four are almost nonexistent in the public sphere today. The use of Chinese dialects has been systematically wiped out by the Speak Mandarin Campaign since 1979. The use of Mandarin is eroding in light of greater English proficiency and more evocative Western media, and is now being used as more of an auxiliary language (one that has little cultural significance, and is instead used for practical reasons like business and commerce). Heavy policing of Chinese intellectual culture and academia since the 1960's is due to the latter's extensive affiliation with socialist movements. There are Chinese bookstores in Bras Basah Complex where I used to visit as a kid (next to Popular). The bookstore owner was a prolific writer (mostly non-fiction such as the history of Malaya from a Chinese perspective) and from what I heard from my dad, he was once jailed and persecuted for suspected leftist ties in the 70's. As far as I know, Chinese culture is considered disposable for the sake of national unity. Nowadays, conversing with grandparents is not a luxury many Chinese households have ( [https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/young-people-speak-up-for-dialects](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/young-people-speak-up-for-dialects) ).

**Argument 3: Chinese culture is domineering and threatens to assimilate minorities.** (Alfian Sa’at might have mentioned this before in 2014 on FB)

Answer: As previously mentioned, authentic Singaporean Chinese culture has most of its defining elements heavily excised. Current Chinese culture pertains more to popular music and film, which is mostly commercial, non-confrontational and non-political. Thus, one cannot go so far as to claim that it is domineering in the sense that people are forced to conform. It is a harmless culture that one can choose to participate in or abstain from. Same applies to dialect pop, Malay pop, Tamil pop and Western pop.

&#x200B;

**Argument 4: SAP is the Singaporean Chinese equivalent of Malaysia's bumiputera policy.** (https://equalitydemocracy.commons.yale-nus.edu.sg/2017/12/07/the-special-assistance-plan-singapores-own-bumiputera-policy/)

Answer: The whole point of the SAP was to ensure opportunity for bright Chinese-educated youth so that they would not be excluded from progress. SAP does not ascertain the cultural or racial superiority of the Chinese race. SAP is also exclusively for the academically inclined. And no, instead of preserving Chinese culture in a meaningful way, SAP molds the Chinese speaker into the English-speaking world. This might be the trickiest point to tackle so bear with me.

SAP schools today don't actually have a distinct identity of their own. Medium of instruction is in English. Medium of administration is in English. Teachers are drawn from MOE, and themselves may not necessarily be from the Chinese-educated background. Most homages to Chinese culture are superficial at best. No one knows the significance of a tea ceremony. ""Higher Chinese"" passages are barely entry-level and written in the blandest and most mediocre fashion. Classical Chinese is no longer taught. Calligraphy, though beautiful, is not as popular a hobby anymore. Special Chinese classes (Chinese literature, Chinese history etc.) are normally taken up by mainland Chinese and Malaysian immigrants who have a far greater mastery of the language. Dizigui is rote learning about principles non-Chinese respect anyways (respect parents, respect authority etc.)

Leap back in time to the 1980s. My parents were among the pioneer batches of SAP students. Their SAP education was infused with more traditional Chinese elements, albeit amounting to no practical significance. It was distinct. Their older siblings and low-achieving peers however could not be part of the SAP and as a result, they have a much poorer command of the English language. Fast forward to today, my parents are qualified professionals (accountant and engineer) whereas my older uncles and aunts could only find jobs among the more traditional Chinese-speaking elements within society. My parents culturally lean towards their Chinese identity, but I notice they place great(er) emphasis on English as a lingua franca and Mandarin as an auxiliary language. They did not bother teaching dialects to their children. I unabashedly state that my nuclear family is way better off than my extended family in terms of socioeconomic status and education level. They achieved this not because of them being Chinese, but because they spoke what was considered a prestige language then. SAP did not reinforce their ""Chineseness"", but instead gave the them a chance to connect with mainstream society while still assuaging their fears of further cultural repressions in light of events laid out in Argument 2.

Not implementing the SAP in the first place would have led to greater social divide in Singapore. Since Chinese-medium schools used to be funded by the community, it would have led to greater differentiation and alienation. The Chinese-educated community believes itself to be self-sustaining and goes off to live in its own world separated from the mainstream.

&#x200B;

**Argument 5: There is no minority equivalent of SAP. This is evidence of Chinese privilege.**

Answer: Agree, which is why I said that the Chinese have the privilege of being a majority. Any government in the world would first pander to its most vocal, most numerous group. The Chinese are already the majority. The Chinese-speaking Chinese are the most vocal and sizeable chunk of this majority. Back in the 20th century, in every radio broadcast they are accusing the government of repressing Chinese culture. As such, the government prioritises the appeasement of this Chinese-speaking population. The balance of bargaining power tilts towards the majority.

&#x200B;

**Argument 6: Microaggression by the Chinese.**

Answer: Definitely agree. Be it intentional malice or benign ignorance, tension is cultivated regardless and it is counterproductive towards maintaining racial harmony. Most cite incidences of casual racism and ethnic slurs. A person of any race can be capable of microaggression, but the danger is particularly due to the fact that the Chinese are the majority. Hence, it is inevitable that a racist remark from a Chinese person would carry more harm, but at the same time be protected by the safety in sheer numbers. The older generation of Chinese usually cite negative experiences of ketuanan melayu to justify their slurs against minorities. While their pain is valid, past tensions should not define the present relations, especially so when the idea of ketuanan melayu no longer exists in the Singaporean context.

**Interesting questions: Why is there no Malay SAP? Why is social mobility lower for Malays?**

Speculation: I think there may be a conflict between the government's duty and its ambitions when it comes to transitioning the Malay community from primarily speaking their mother tongues to speaking English. The constitution states that any incumbent government has to acknowledge the Malay's special position in Singapore, and has an obligation to protect and preserve Malay languages, customs and culture. One might claim that the government is merely paying lip service, but it IS a constitutional right of the Malays to defend their culture. The government has no legal justification to use heavy-handed methods to force the Malay population to use English. Thus, any kind of transition has to be voluntary. A Malay SAP would have facilitated this transition for the best Malays, but therein lies two problems.

Firstly, SAP is a government policy operating on a principle of assimilation. This gives the impression that the transition to English is not organic, but rather subtly influenced by policy-making. Article 152 would not have been respected.

Secondly, the prevailing identity for the most academically inclined Malays, would be the English-speaking identity, leaving the root problem of lower English proficiency among the lower class Malay-speaking Malays unsolved.

(Just a personal observation) Malays tend to use Malay when it comes to their close friends and family. It is also commonly reported in studies that it is respected within the community as a way to pass down familial and cultural values ( [https://repository.nie.edu.sg/bitstream/10497/15174/1/IPCS-1994-306.pdf](https://repository.nie.edu.sg/bitstream/10497/15174/1/IPCS-1994-306.pdf) ).

Perhaps this was why the main use of English among Malays were much lower in the 2000's ( [https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/english-use-soars-malay-households-many-still-use-malay-much-possible-parents-educators](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/english-use-soars-malay-households-many-still-use-malay-much-possible-parents-educators) ) and if I were to follow my premise of English primacy being the precursor to social mobility, maybe this can be a factor to consider.

In addition, improvements in social mobility take a very long time to precipitate. Between now and the time when my parents first enrolled in SAP, 38 years have passed. We all know that LKY was shameless in proclaiming superior genes and whatever nonsensical eugenic ideologies. His rhetoric was very damaging to the position of Malays in terms of how society perceived them, and as such wasted precious time that could have been used to promote them. If one were to start a plan similar to the SAP in the 2000's, the 2030s would be the time when the disproportionate representation of Malays in the lower class start to see improvements.

&#x200B;

**Conclusion**

A privileged class over-represented by Chinese people? Yes. A majority ethnic group that has safety in numbers? Yes. I acknowledge the unforgettable facts and condemn the unforgivable acts, but ultimately, one must not conflate culture with ethnicity.

Before one examines the idea of privilege in Singapore, I strongly urge not to take our demographics at face value. PAP is wrong in saying ""you can't use a western lens on an eastern society."" I believe it is perfectly fine to bring in methods commonly employed in the western social scientific tradition. The more important aspect is the holism of one's analysis. What I find disturbing about certain takes on this issue is that it leaves out extremely vital considerations from our country's history and the collective experiences of the Chinese-educated community, giving the incumbent government an impression of the presented analysis poorly imitating criticisms of Western societies.",0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hn14p3/a_take_on_chinese_privilege_very_long_post/,"[""Saved for reading later, but I'd like to point out that people don't approach this conversation properly.

Then it's a contest for the high ground and upvotes, so high that Luke will surrender.\n\nMaybe the Chinese should exercise their privilege like the malays do in Malaysia to further validate the cries of privilege and racism. That would be the best show of support.\n\nWhenever there's a panel of speakers requiring a degree of intellect and qualifications, more often than not, you're going to see Indians.

A little background: I have always been the person that is easily alarmed and panic. I also tend to worry excessively everyday to the point that I can easily be worn out just by worrying and being anxious. But I thought it was normal for everyone to feel some stress. 

However, since enlistment I feel like my mental health has been deteriorating. In BMT, my sergeants told me that I am just adjusting to military life. So, I did not pay much attention to it. However, in unit i notice that I became increasingly more forgetful and blur... Like people have to repeat many many times in a row before I can even understand. I just feel like zoned out and anxious all the time... 

I did a google search and did a self-diagnosis test and I think I do experience some symptoms of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD). 

I am from a front-line unit and I worry that I make mistake that cause harm to anyone because of my anxiety and inability to concentrate...

([https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fnt581/life\_pro\_tip\_if\_youre\_going\_to\_the\_gp\_for/](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fnt581/life_pro_tip_if_youre_going_to_the_gp_for/) ) a

few days ago and I felt there was a need to add to it.

I have been working in the screening center (SC) since its operation for COVID19 on 29/1/2020. Then till now, I've met plenty of people who have entered through the doors of the screening center with fear and anxiety. I just wanna allay these emotions with some helpful info, being informed, I feel, really helps people in this stressful situations.

Following the above post, yes there are some helpful things like:

1. Photo identification (NRIC, 11B, drivers license, passport)
2. Phone (for contact purposes)
3. Try to remember any medicine allergies, past medical history
4. Phone charger (We don't have chargers or cables for you unfortunately to charge your device) Please don't bring too many electrical devices.
5. You don't need to bring water as we provide water.
6. You don't need to bring snacks, we provide 3 simple meals and snacks upon request.
7. Please bring yourself a jacket, it gets cold, but we also do have blankets.
8. You don't need to bring a change of clothing, even if you are admitted, you'll wear hospital baju.
9. Personal toiletries, we have soap dispensers.
10. Mask, gloves, goggles, sanitizes (We provide masks, you don't need gloves, goggles. There are plenty of hand sanitizes scatter around, please use a full pump, hand rub thoroughly and let it dry)

Sorry for the above wordy message.

Below ill include some more information about the happenings inside the SC to better inform anyone paying a visit.

1. Please visit a PHPC/ Polyclinic and obtain a referral before coming to SC. (It is vital that you have a referral before coming, hard or softcopy. PHPC charges 10 SGD for Sgporeans and PR, 5 SGD if you are PG or MG. The PHPC doctor, might give you MC first to rest at home, but after MC you still feel unwell, please go visit the same doctor again, this time, the doctor might get an ambulance for you to come to SC, as this happened to a personal friend of mine) (Lastly, without a referral letter dated on the same day or previous day, you will have to pay 128 SGD, so go see the GP/ poly first).
2. The SC does not allow visitors. Your mother/father/son/daughter is in good hands. We will take care of them.
3. SC does not do swabs for children below 16, we will inform you to go KKH for that.
4. When you enter SC, you will be sorted, what we call, high risk and low risk area. I will not go into detail on our sorting procedure. Both areas operate the same. The care is the same. Please prepare your NRIC and referral.
5. At these areas, you will be allocated a seat, with a form to fill up, a pencil, a bottle of water and a tiny plastic bag to throw any wrapper or trash. Please fill up the form to the best of your knowledge. Our lovely patient svc associate will register you, and our triage nurses will triage you.
6. Do inform us what happened to you, provide us with a history of your symptoms, where you have been and if possible, any contact with suspected or confirmed cases.
7. After triage, you might need to do a Xray, ECG or blood sugar, this depends on the assessment.
8. After the procedure, if any, the doctor will come speak to you to find out more information.
9. After consultation, the doctor will decide on then for disposition/discharge or admission.
10. But before that, he might decide for a COVID19 swab. This is the swab which many have been speaking about. Yes it is unpleasant, but necessary.
11. We usually perform (nurses) a nasal swab, both nostrils, all the way back into the nasopharynx. The sensation is like water entering your nose, it might or might not hurt for some. Please inform us if you have had any surgeries or trauma of your nose before. We will provide you a tissue to wipe your tears, as tearing is normal, try your best to not cough or sneeze, breathe through your mouth.
12. The results will take about 3 days, you'll receive a SMS if its negative, you'll receive a call in 1 day if its, touch wood. So no news is good news.
13. Once swab is done, we will prepare and provide you the documents you need. HL and discharge advise is the most common combo. Please clarify with us about the documents if need to, there are plenty of patients and the lack of oxygen though the N95 does not help, thank you. Please stay at home during the HL days, and read the advise given to you. If you are taking a cab home, inform the driver to wind down the windows, mask up and keep the receipt for yourself.
14. If you are for admission, the doctor would speak to you why you are getting admitted and the nurses would prepare the documents and call the ward. You'll be sent to the ward for admission.
15. It might be hard to see who is who with us all wearing full PPE, so do look out for coloured tags on our PPE to see who is who:

&#x200B;

    Black / Green - Doctors
    Blue / Red - Nurses
    Yellow - Pharmacists, Radiographers, Patient Svc Associates
    Brown - Housekeeping
    Silver - Health attendant (Porters) / Security

Thats all I can think if for now, if there are any questions, will try my best to answer them here. My reason to post this is to allay any anxiety or fears people might have during their time at SC. Please stay home, take care and be well.

>I hear that for negative cases, usually will take lower priority in informing the results. So no news is literally good news. May I ask for your inputs on this?

It really depends on the day and time and even ""luck"", Mondays and Fridays are usually busier, 10AM starting till the crowd dips at 4PM (my guess is the GPs and polyclinics open and start to send patients in), as short as 3 hours to as long as 8 hours.

If so happens that day a new cluster is found and contact tracing has already begun, expect a surge. (Please dont quote me on the timings, its from my experience.)

No news is literally good news. I have to agree on that. Don't think of it as lower priority, but instead we have more negative cases than positive, so the reporting would naturally be slower.

\-----

u/tangotrash asked:

>Out of curiosity, if there’s surgeries or trauma for the nose, what do you guys do?

If the patient informs us, we would then inform the doctor, he'll take into account past history of the OP or injury then give us the greenlight, otherwise we will perform a throat / oropharyx swab.

A nasal swab is always preferred. Patient might've have had food or water which could affect the swab. Not to mention, not everyone can ""ahhh"" well, even with a tongue depressor. Swab has to go past your uvula to reach the back of your throat.

\-----

u/ongcs asked:

>Do you mean that, if someone is without symptoms, but wants to be tested just to find out, he/she can go NCID SC to do so, and he will be charged $128?

We would reject. On the basis of no travel history, no contact with confirmed or suspected cases, no contact with stay home notice, leave of absence or quarantine order, no visits to hotspots, no referral from GP / poly / MOH, no symptoms whatsoever. The person is putting themself in harms way with exposure by entering, that wont help their situation.

u/yt2007 asked:

>Suppose if a couple went out for work in the morning, & through out the course of the day, one of them somehow got diagnosed & sent for isolation, Qn1: the diagnosed one will be immediately & explicitly prevented from going anywhere in SG & sent to isolation centers right? Cannot even go home to pack a hospital bag right? Qn2: the other person can still go home? But immediately kena SHN right?

Please refer to u/lub-shh-dub explanation:

>What would most likely happen is that say husband has flu symptoms at work. His colleagues will make a fuss and insist he take MC and go see a GP.  
>  
>He then apologises to his colleagues for going to work when sick and goes to see his GP (Preferably at a PHPC clinic so he only pays $10). GP checks him and if patient doesnt meet suspect critetia, GP gives him a 5 day MC and reminds him he CANNOT leave his house for 5 days.  
>  
>If GP is worried enough, will call ambulance to send him to NCID. He needs to stay in clinic till ambulance arrives. Now sometimes if ambulance takes 3+ hours to arrive the GP will pass patient the referral letter and tell the patient to wait for the ambulance at home. This can only happen if his home is within walking distance. Ambulance then collects patient from his home and goes to NCID.  
>  
>At NCID patient gets an Xray and swabbed if he is assessed to meet suspect criteria for COVID. If xray is clear and patient is stable, he is told to go home and given a nice long hospitalisation leave. If touchwood the swab is positive, he will get contacted and be brought back for admission. Contact tracing begins. His wife inevitably will be deemed to be a high risk contact and will require to stay at home for 14 days.

u/Confused_AF_help asked:

dr-bebe,hqfvt9,[rant] feeling discouraged and demotivated,2020-07-13 22:07:54,SGExams,77673,11,9,"hii, i'm so sorry for the long rant but i really needed to get this off my chest. i'm sec 2 this year. it's currently wa3s season and i'm feeling very stressed out. i've always been facing terrible stress (led to hair loss during eoys season last year) during exam periods, and i never really knew how to cope with these emotions properly.

today, i had my first paper and i didn't manage complete it. i really felt like crying right after the test and i couldn't focus during my next few periods as i couldn't stop thinking about it. it's not the first time i've cried after a paper, and it's so embarrassing but i can't really help it.

i slacked a lot in primary school, and my disappointing psle results gave me a huge wake-up call. hence, i started to take my studies seriously in sec 1, maybe even way too serious about it. i feel like studies have become a huge part of my self-worth, and i feel inclined to do well so as to not disappoint others around me. some of my classmates also claim that i am one of the ""smartest"" pupils in class, so i shouldn't have much trouble. i know they mean no harm, but it's really giving me more pressure. i really want to stop placing huge expectations on myself, but i don't know how.

hbl has also caused me to lose a lot of motivation for my studies, and i slowly started handing up late work frequently, which honestly isn't like me at all. before the circuit breaker, i would spend my time studying in my classroom before lessons started and occasionally during recess. however, i felt so unmotivated during the may holidays that i barely even touched my books. i'm really losing track of my studies and struggling these days. 

since last year, i've would sleep at odd hours on some days (i.e. usually between 2-4am) in order to study. however, this became a daily occurence this year during the hbl period. i stayed up almost everyday, either to do my work or procrastinate. i even had to take naps in the morning after taking my attendance because i was so tired. this subsequently led to me missing an online lesson. during the holidays, i had to basically carry my group assignment, and i ended up going to sleep around 4:30am-6am for an entire week because of it. i know this isn't normal for a 14 year old, and i desperately need to fix my sleep schedule, but i don't know how to start...

i know my friends love and care for me, but these days i've been feeling like distancing myself from them. don't get me wrong; i love and care for them as well but i don't know why i'm feeling this way. i just want these emotions to pass quickly... my immune system and body have also become weaker these days. i've been getting more frequent headaches, my neck is constantly sore and i was sick as well recently. i'm assuming it's because of my poor sleep schedule + stress.

i've just been so emotionally drained these days and i'm really exhausted. i just want to cry, and i really really want these feelings to go away... i feel like my life is slowly falling apart... and i want to fix it but i don't know how to. i still have more tests this week, and i really don't have any motivation to study for them but at the same time, i'm anxious and worried about my grades.

if anyone is still reading this, please give me some advice on how to motivate myself to study, cope with stress, fix my sleeping schedule, as well as recognize burnout. thank u.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hqfvt9/rant_feeling_discouraged_and_demotivated/,"[""Hello!

###Race, Language, and Uncomfortable Questions

Here's a tricky governing problem for you.

Imagine your country had historically encouraged a minority group to segregate into lower income communities with poor living conditions.

Picture, too, that that minority group had historically underperformed in school compared to others.

Say that your country had faced [large-scale riots in the 1960s](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1964_race_riots_in_Singapore) over concerns about perceived government discrimination and oppression.

To spice things up, let's add that they're the country's indigenous people, and that they speak a different language and practice a different faith than everybody else in the country.

...and that initially, they formed the vast majority of the military and the police force, and the majority in your much larger neighbor country. It's hardly going to mirror other countries exactly, after all.^\(12)

How do you ensure justice for them and for all citizens?

Singapore has its advantages over other countries, true. It's... what was the quote?... ""a single city with a beautiful natural harbor right smack in the middle of a fantastic chokepoint in one of the biggest trade routes in the world."" ^[1](https://slatestarcodex.com/2013/03/08/we-sail-tonight-for-singapore/)

But demographically, it's *complicated*, to say the least. 75 percent of Singaporeans are Chinese. Of that majority, about a third speak English at home, half speak Mandarin, and the rest speak other dialects. They split between Buddhist, Taoist, Christian, and irreligious. 15 percent are Malay, and almost all of them speak Malay (90%) and practice Islam (99%). Another 7 percent are Indian, and they tend to speak Tamil and practice Hinduism, but there's a long tail of other languages and faiths. That's *after* 50 years of coming together. To pull one example of the past, in 1957, [97 percent of Chinese Singaporeans](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speak_Mandarin_Campaign#Outcome) spoke a language other than English or Mandarin at home. 

What LKY did to ensure his country's economic prosperity was remarkable and prescient, but where he truly cements his legacy and confounds expectation, in my eyes, is the way in which he handled the most sensitive issues around race and language.

######The Malaise of the Malays

Let's return to the governing problem introduced at the start of this section, the complex situation of Malays in Singapore. Assuming absolute power, how do you get a nation to stop self-segregating, particularly when a minority group you're not a part of is concentrated in a slum?

A month after independence, LKY promised the 60000 Malays living in shanty huts in one area that ""in 10 years all their shacks would be demolished and [the area] would be another and a better 'Queenstown,'"" then their most modern housing. ^\(207) Rather than approach them himself and create a sheer top-down push around difficult decisions like replacing mosques, he spoke privately with Malay members of parliament (MPs), got buy-in from the Muslim governing body of Singapore (MUIS) to allow an old wooden mosque to be demolished, and set up a building fund for the MUIS to build replacement mosques. Compensate homeowners, give them priority in new housing estates, take the 40 families who refuse to vacate to court... done.

...and then, when he realized that people would [naturally re-segregate](https://ncase.me/polygons/), he got the support of minority parliament members to create race-based quota ceilings for government apartments so that people would have no choice but to intermingle. 

You should be used to the pattern by now. Every solution on the table, go for the most direct and efficient way to achieve a goal, push forward regardless of decorum. That part's predictable. What I found more compelling was his emphasis on working with and through minority government members each time he worked with minority communities. 

Which raises the question: how could he guarantee he would have minority representatives, given that citizens would naturally prefer MPs who empathized with them, spoke their language, so forth? What's the most Singapore way to solve that particular problem?

That's right, snap your fingers and merge constituencies into clusters of three or four, require candidates to run as groups, and mandate that each group include at least one minority candidate. After all, LKY reminds readers with what sounds like a shrug, ""To end up with a Parliament without Malay, Indian, and other minority MPs would be damaging. We had to change the rules."" ^\(210) To [quote](https://old.reddit.com/r/slatestarcodex/comments/9vipw3/friday_fun_thread_for_november_9th_2018/e9co5n0/?context=3) /u/lunaranus: ""For an American politician this kind of change would be the legislative achievement of a lifetime. For LKY it was Tuesday.""

So that's segregation taken care of. Is there another, more controversial issue to bring into focus?

""To have people believe all children were equal, whatever their race, and that equal opportunities would allow all to qualify for a place in a university, must lead to discontent. The less successful would believe that the government was not treating them equally."" ^\(210)

I'll let that quote speak for itself.

Again, though, the interesting part isn't the blunt diagnosis of problems. The interesting part is the solution. He privately gathered Malay community leaders together, provided them the test results, and promised them the government's full support as they sought solutions. Every time a Malay-focused issue came up, he emphasizes, he would consult with his Malay colleagues and get their input and buy-in. This approach upset some of his senior ministers, one of whom he mentions ""was a total multiracialist [who] saw my plan not as a pragmatic acceptance of realities, but as backsliding."" ^\(211)

I'll keep his own wording for his response to the concerns:

> While I shared [the minister's] ideal of a completely color-blind policy, I had to face reality and produce results. From experience, we knew that Chinese or Indian officials could not reach out to Malay parents and students in the way their own community leaders did. The respect these leaders enjoyed and their sincere interest in the welfare of the less successful persuaded parents and children to make the effort. *Paid bureaucrats could never have the same commitment, zest, and rapport to move parents and their children.* ...On such personal-emotional issues involving ethnic and family pride, only leaders of the wider ethnic family can reach out to the parents and their children. ^\(211)

In the end, the Malay leaders formed a government-assisted council to help struggling students with extra tutoring in evenings, and the government provided funding for them and a group of Muslims who wanted to approach the same objective more independently of government. Indians and Chinese community leaders followed with their own similar associations not long after.

As of 2005, Singaporean Malays have [shrunk, but not closed the gap with other Singaporeans](http://web.archive.org/web/20150815061558/http://www.mccy.gov.sg/~/media/MCCY-corp/Publications/ProgressofMalayCommunity1980.ashx), and leapfrogged most non-Singaporean students in educational outcomes.

LKY's handling of these issues is one reason I see it as futile to place him on a traditional US-style left-right axis when looking at his decision-making. His approach blends traditional, family values and blunt realism easy to associate with the right with a determination to work with affected minorities and concern for their welfare that pattern-matches more clearly to the left. That mixture of familiarity and foreignness in his approach, and that tension between traditional and progressive values, is one reason this work was so refreshing for me, coming from a US background. 

When he discusses Chinese schools and the transition to English education, he reveals more about his personal life than anywhere else, and some of that mix begins to make sense.

######Chinese schools, English language

Lee Kuan Yew describes his education, in English-language schools and then overseas in England, in mixed terms: ""deculturalized,"" textbooks and teachers ""totally unrelated to the world [he] lived in,"" ""a sense of loss at having been educated in a stepmother tongue,"" ""not formally tutored in [his] own Asian culture... not belonging to British culture either, lost between two cultures."" ^\(145)

He talks about his decision to send his children to Chinese schools to give them a firmer footing in their own culture, and talks about his appreciation of the ""vitality, dynamism, discipline, and social and political commitment"" in those schools. English-language schools, on the other hand, ""dismayed"" him with the ""apathy, self-centeredness, and lack of self-confidence"" in their students ^\(149). Later, he speaks with regret about Western media and tourism eroding ""traditional moral values"" of Singapore's students, about how ""the values of America's consumer society were permeating Singapore faster... because of our education in the English language."" ^\(153)

But they had a common culture to build, an English-centric business world to look towards, and a need for unity in their armed forces and elsewhere. So English, as LKY tells it, was needed as a common language, his concerns and those of his countrypeople aside. In Chinese, Malay, and Tamil schools, he mandated English courses. In English schools, he mandated the teaching of mother tongues. Malay and Indian parents shifted quickly to English schools, but Chinese parents were less satisfied and a hard core of resistance formed.

In this issue, again, some of the reasons for LKY's success as Singapore's leader become clear. At times, he opted for simple authoritarian solutions: arresting newspaper managers for glamorizing communism, deporting Malaysian leaders of student demonstrations, removing a union leader who ""instigated his fellow students to use Chinese instead of English in their examination papers."" ^\(148) But then he talks about how his English education allowed Malays and Indians to see him as Singaporean rather than a ""Chinese chauvinist,"" and how his ""intense efforts to master both Mandarin and the Hokkien dialect,"" and the experience of his children in Chinese-speaking schools, let him relate to and be accepted by the Chinese-educated ^\(149), and it becomes clearer that something more than authoritarianism was at play.

That sensitivity became critical when issues with Chinese-language education came to a head. Students in the Chinese language Nantah University--the flagship symbol of Chinese language, culture, and education, fundraised and built by the Chinese community--struggled to find jobs. He describes the decision to switch the university and most Chinese schools to English in conflicted tones, emphasizing that he could speak with authority and ""[maintain] the political strength to make those changes"" primarily because he had sent his children to Chinese schools. 

It bears repeating that Lee Kuan Yew is pretty dismissive of a lot of Western traits. He cites Japan approvingly as a culture able to ""absorb American influence and remain basically Japanese,"" with their youth ""more hardworking and committed to the greater good of their society than Europeans or Americans"" ^\(154). In an effort to preserve the best in Chinese schools and retain that sort of cultural influence, he set aside the top nine Chinese schools as selective institutions, admitting only the top 10 percent of students. 

So--did LKY successfully lead his country to a new common language while preserving culture? Sort of. Even now, the policy has had mixed impact, and LKY sounds more torn here than in any other part of the work:

> Bilingualism in English and Malay, Chinese, or Tamil is a heavy load for our children. The three mother tongues are completely unrelated to English. But if we were monolingual in our mother tongues, we would not make a living. Becoming monolingual in English would have been a setback. We would have lost our cultural identity, that quiet confidence about ourselves and our place in the world. ...

> Hence, in spite of the criticism from many quarters that our people have mastered neither language, it is our best way forward. ^\(155)

Later in life, LKY expressed [regrets](https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2009/11/18/mm-lee-my-insistence-on-bilingualism-was-wrong/) about his insistence on bilingualism: ""Nobody can master two languages at the same level. If (you think) you can, you’re deceiving yourself."" 

I had a Singaporean friend a while back who sometimes joked that you could tell she was Singaporean because she spoke bad English and bad Chinese. I wasn't in a place to judge the truth of that, at the time speaking no Chinese myself, but there was a hint of sadness behind the joke that stuck with me and comes to mind with LKY's eventual hesitance around the policy. Since then, I've expended a lot of effort on learning Chinese myself, and the same distance between the languages is clear and discouraging. It's a tough problem, and I don't know that there was an ideal answer in a society as multicultural and multilingual as Singapore's. I get the sense from this section of Singapore, at least in LKY's eyes, sometimes reflecting his own torn feelings, between languages and between cultures.

Still, Singapore made it through the shift and has developed a strong culture and [its own satisfying twist on English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singlish), so it would be unfair to mark the policy as a failure overall. To find a true failed policy, we need to turn to a different topic.

######The limits of tweaking culture

A paraphrasing of Lee Kuan Yew to the Malay community: I am not one of you, but I will listen to you. I will ensure you have equal opportunity to the rest of our citizens. I will push to allow you proportional representation. Every step of the way, I will listen to you and your leaders when deciding on policies that affect you. When I need you to make changes in sensitive areas, I won't enforce it top-down and bureaucratically, I will approach your trusted family and community leaders and ask them to take charge.

The same, for the Chinese community: I recognize your fears about your culture being lost if your language fades. I lost it myself, educated in foreign schools and a foreign language, and have since fought to regain it. It is a priority for my children. I love the best parts of our culture and want to preserve them. Understand that the only reason I am asking you to make a difficult transition away from it is because that is what our country needs in the world as it stands.

It's in light of those two cautious, thoughtful, empathetic approaches that this third story frustrates me so much.

Singapore, more than any other country in the world, is facing a [birthrate crisis](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/number-of-babies-born-here-drops-to-8-year-low). Current numbers place its fertility rate at 1.14, lowest in the world. It's a pressing issue, tricky and multifaceted, one reflective of trends around the world. It's also deeply sensitive, tied into people's sense of self-determination and autonomy, their most personal goals, and a whole lot else. Further complicating it is the uncomfortable reality that education and birthrate typically have an inverse correlation. As of Singapore's 1980 census, ""the tertiary- [and secondary-]educated had [a birthrate of] 1.6, the primary-educated, 2.3, and the unschooled, 4.4"" ^\(140).

Lee Kuan Yew noticed the issue, because he noticed every issue. He also noticed that [women tend to prefer ""marrying up"", men ""marrying down""](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0272775719301104), because of course he did, how a lot of the country's graduate women were remaining single, and how that could impact his nation's future talent. So, how did a leader who relied so much on his ability to inspire trust react to the challenge?

> **I decided to shock the young men out of their stupid, old-fashioned, and damaging prejudices.** ^\(137)

That's right, by telling everyone they're stupid and trying to strong-arm a change:

> On the night of 14 August 1983, I dropped a bombshell in my annual National Day Rally address. Live on both our television channels, with maximum viewership, I said it was stupid for our graduate men to choose less-educated and less-intelligent wives if they wanted their children to do as well as they had done. ^\(135)

In the comment thread when I first wrote this, a user pointed out that LKY sounds ""like a nerdy, rationalist, technocratic dictator. Disregarding society's irrational feelings, speaking the truth plainly, and changing your views with new evidence."" I agree. In this instance, though, it's easy to see in him the caricatured side of that image: a stubborn insistence that [everyone be convinced by a waterfall of pure facts](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/08/10/getting-eulered/), eagerness to phrase those facts in the bluntest possible way, and deliberately apathetic to the role emotion plays in changing minds.

Genetic influences on intelligence remain just as controversial as they were in LKY's day. To avoid getting caught in those weeds, I'll proceed assuming he was entirely correct. Given his track record, it's not a stretch. Even granting that, even granting the difficulty of the problem, I can't help but feel his approach was dead wrong.

First: Provide preferential school selection for children of graduate mothers who have at least three kids. He mentioned expecting nongraduate mothers to be angry at being discriminated against. Instead, graduate mothers rose up against the change, saying things like:

> ""I am deeply insulted by the suggestion that some miserable financial incentives will make me jump into bed with the first attractive man I meet and proceed to produce a highly talented child for the sake of Singapore's future."" ^\(137)

Next: Establish a government matchmaking system to ""facilitate socializing between men and women graduates"" ^\(138).

Finally: Support both of the above with repeated reminders of statistical analyses, genetic research, assertions of cultural prejudices, and round condemnation of misleading but politically correct Western writers.

The results were predictable. Western media, of course, rose up against him. His party, famously leading an effective one-party state, lost 12 percent of the vote in the next year's election. Half his cabinet condemned his decisions. Only those who already saw the same issues he did--the ""hard-headed realist[s]"" in his cabinet ^\(140), R. H. Herrnstein--really stood by him. Eventually, he gave up on the policies and rested his hopes on immigration instead.

It's possible to look at the whole saga and conclude that he was pushing against impossible trends that not even the most prescient could avoid, ready with a bluntness and willingness to speak hard truths as a lonely, brave [Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cassandra). That certainly seems to be his portrayal of his approach. But I can't help but feel that, in this case, all he accomplished was poisoning the well for every future attempt to address the real problems he identified. While it's impossible to say whether another approach would have succeeded, this one emphatically did not.

######Conclusion

One of LKY's greatest strengths that comes through as I read the book is his relentless determination to follow the facts where they lead. Just as important, though, is leading others to follow those facts. In some incredibly sensitive situations, like when he helped his Malay citizens and led the charge towards English as a common language, he did a fantastic job of this--not just by leading with his head, but by demonstrating good faith and doing what it took to build genuine trust with others. 

But no leader is perfect, and it's as instructive to learn from failures as from successes. When people feel misunderstood, insulted, or attacked, it doesn't matter how sure you are of the facts. They will withdraw and entrench. LKY admits to his own impatience here: ""Intellectually, I agreed... that overcoming this cultural lag would be a slow adjustment process, but emotionally I could not accept that we could not jolt the men out of their prejudices sooner."" ^\(141)

As someone with my own tendencies in the same direction, I feel inclined to translate: *I knew I was making a mistake, but [they were **wrong!**](https://xkcd.com/386/)*.

###Interlude Three

One of my favorite small moments from the book comes when LKY discusses the process of greening Singapore. As he points out, ""Singapore's size forced us to work, play, and reside in the same small place, and this made it necessary to preserve a clean and gracious environment for rich and poor alike."" ^\(181) From their independence in the early 60s, they made planting trees and cultivating greenery a priority. When LKY noticed some planted trees were dying off, he presented the quintessentially Singaporean solution of a government department ""dedicated to the care of trees after they had been planted"" ^\(175).

The best bit, though, comes when he mentions how a friendly competition started among Southeast Asia in the 1970s. Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, and the Philippines all got involved. In LKY's telling: 

> No other project has brought richer rewards to the region. Our neighbors have tried to out-green and out-bloom each other. Greening was positive competition that benefitted everyone--it was good for morale, for tourism, and for investors. It was immensely better that we competed to be the greenest and cleanest in Asia. I can think of many areas where competition could be harmful, even deadly. ^\(177)

> Greening is the most cost-effective project I have launched. ^\(178)

As for the results? [Judge for yourself.](https://d22ir9aoo7cbf6.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/07/Gardens-by-the-Bay.jpg)

In Singapore, masks, hand sanitizers, and alcohol wipes are now precious commodities. People are recoiling whenever someone sneezes or coughs. Supermarket shelves are rapidly being cleared up and plans are being cancelled. We are experiencing a lot of fear.

𝗪𝗵𝘆 𝗗𝗼 𝗣𝗲𝗼𝗽𝗹𝗲 𝗥𝗲𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗪𝗮𝘆 𝗧𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗗𝗼?

In modern society, numerous risks (e.g., terrorism, catastrophes, and pandemic outbreaks) lurk around every corner. Whenever people witness an emergency situation or see someone getting harmed, our brains are hardwired to react in a certain way. The amygdala of the brain (emotional system) gets activated together with regions of the cortex (cognitive system) that analyze and interpret behavior. In times of stress and uncertainty, this thinking part of our brain gets hijacked by the emotional system, resulting in 𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗶𝗰 and 𝗴𝗿𝗼𝘂𝗽𝘁𝗵𝗶𝗻𝗸 𝗯𝗲𝗵𝗮𝘃𝗶𝗼𝗿. This translates into a phenomenon more commonly known as survival mode or fight-or-flight, which is driven by the need for self-preservation, protection, and safety. Such primal instincts date back to prehistoric times, where we needed to be on the constant lookout for danger in order to survive. The same primal instincts are activated in our present-day crises. We are hyper-focusing on the virus.

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗖𝗼𝘀𝘁 𝘁𝗼 𝗨𝘀 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗦𝗼𝗰𝗶𝗲𝘁𝘆

While our brains react to keep us safe and protected, the resulting panic inadvertently leads to massive costs borne by our society. Chinese nationals or people of Chinese descent are experiencing discrimination. Tension, stress, and anxiety are at an all-time high; we worry about our health, our job security, and the larger economy. Panic buying has also led to stocks running out. Consequently, people who are sick have found themselves deprived of essential items like masks and Vitamin C.  Panic buying further breeds anxiety rather than alleviates it, creating a downward spiral of panic and anxiety. Thankfully, our Government has taken action to monitor black market sales, protecting us from the cost of inflated prices.

𝗛𝗼𝘄 𝗗𝗼 𝗪𝗲 𝗣𝗿𝗼𝘁𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗔𝗻𝗱 𝗖𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗔𝘁 𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗦𝗮𝗺𝗲 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲?

Interestingly, while we are wired for self-preservation, research has shown that in times of crises, people are also capable of responding in prosocial ways. Last week, netizens shared accounts of people giving out free masks and hand sanitizers – a counter-intuitive move when we should be considering our self-preservation. How do we dig deep, and find in ourselves this capacity to manage our fight-or-flight responses?

𝟭. 𝗔𝗰𝗸𝗻𝗼𝘄𝗹𝗲𝗱𝗴𝗲 𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗼𝗻𝗮𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗿𝗶𝘀𝗶𝘀. We are all struggling with fear, to varying degrees. Validating and acknowledging our fears, knowing that we may get triggered by each other is a first step to managing our anxieties. Name the fear and pause to consider our responses. Resource-sharing could unite rather than divide our community in this time of need.

𝟮. 𝗥𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗲𝗮𝗰𝗵 𝗼𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗿. As this would be a hot topic, be assertive with your feelings of discomfort or anxiety should this topic be too difficult for you. Also notice if this topic escalates fear and anxiety in your friends and family. Listen and respect if they prefer not to engage in this.

𝟯. 𝗘𝘅𝗲𝗿𝗰𝗶𝘀𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝗱𝗶𝘃𝗶𝗱𝘂𝗮𝗹 𝗿𝗲𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗻𝘀𝗶𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗯𝘂𝘆 𝗮𝘀 𝘆𝗼𝘂 𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗱.  It is not necessary to stockpile on food and other essential items as this breeds undue panic. Hoarding necessities also prevents others from attaining them, especially those who may need it more than you do. This creates huge inconvenience to others, and in turn, promotes a climate of hostility. 

𝟰. 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝘆𝗼𝘂𝗿 𝗶𝗻𝗳𝗼𝘁𝗮𝗶𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁.The virus situation would inevitably be on major headlines. Be intentional with your choice of information and entertainment rather than be consumed by inaccurate updates and precautions borne largely by fear and panic.

YQLOO,g3x5bb,[A Levels] The Secret to Getting Distinction for H2 History,2020-04-19 07:14:48,SGExams,77673,5,37,"Hello A-Level students! Ever wished H2 History was more manageable? It turns out, History does not have to be as stressful and content-heavy as it is. Today, I am releasing critical tips to help you to hit the highest marks with as little effort as possible. Being a tutor and having achieved distinction under the 2017 first batch of the new syllabus, I am sharing strategies that I hope will point each of you in the right direction, regardless of where you currently stand. I know A-Levels can be tough, but I sincerely think that if you can find the smartest ways to study, you will find things much easier.

**Strategy #1: It can be easy to underestimate the importance of the essay section but it is absolutely necessary to focus the bulk of the preparation on the essay section.**

The essays constitute a massive 60% of the A-Level marks. But this section is really significant because of the amount of preparation that can be done. The A Level questions are limited in scope with the focus for each topic made explicitly clear in the syllabus document. What this means is that you can prepare the arguments, supporting evidences and thoughtful conclusions well before the A-Levels. Of course, there is still a need to be volatile and be able answer the question, but you will benefit immensely from preparation. 

If you are able to find convincing evaluative points that, for instance, prove that the Security Council was constrained by fundamental institutional constrains, or evaluative points on the long-term consequences of the Asian Financial Crisis, you will be able to use it across a wide range of questions. This is because the syllabus document makes it clear what you have to know, which is why you can and must prepare evaluative points.

This is an advantage that you must not take for granted; to put things into perspective, if you secure 55% of the marks, only about one-third of the case study marks would be required to secure distinction. In contrast to essays, case studies, while important, are primarily focused on your on-the-spot ability to interpret sources– so study smart.

**Strategy #2: Prioritise quality over quantity in each essay that you write.**

There is a perception for H2 History that the more examples you memorize and write, the higher the marks. This is not the case. A short essay could get the high marks, while a long essay could get low marks. As a matter of fact, writing as much as you can could do more harm than good. In the process, you may, for instance, end up leaving one counter argument alone without having time to address it with a substantiated rebuttal, undermining the requirement of a consistent stand and putting you off track of attaining band L-7. It is about the quality of your arguments and how well you are able to back them up rather than about many pages you write. Of course, the key content elements must be reflected in the essay.

**Strategy #3: Outsource your H2 History notes if you there is a need.**

Every school uses different notes and has a different interpretation of the syllabus document. Using their own history notes, certain “lower-ranked” schools consistently achieve high rates of distinction, even having over 80% of students’ distinction in recent years. On the other hand, certain “top” schools consistently fare poorly. For a subject that requires such so much self-studying, this consistent disparity is surprising to say the least. The difference in notes certainly could have a role to play in it. If you fall into category of schools that consistently fare poorly over the past few years, I strongly advise you to expose yourself to different perspectives, examples and interpretations by outsourcing your notes – you want start off on the same playing field.

**Strategy #4: Only create notes once you are very familiar with the content.**

“Cheat sheets” and “visualisation” material such as skeletons and cards can be helpful, but they will only be helpful if you know exactly where you can use each example to substantiate your argument. Before you make your own study notes, find out from your teachers, tutors and the syllabus document exactly what you need to know, what are all the questions you need to prepare for, and what elements you need to incorporate. Then, when you know exactly how the examples fit in the context of your arguments, create the notes, learn the examples and how you can use them in your arguments. It is important not to have notes filled with content that cannot be used; there would simply be too much for you to memorize,

**Strategy #5: Closer to the exams, you can save valuable time by writing essay outlines rather writing the entire essays out.**

When you approach an essay at an exam, the most fundamental things you must have are arguments and examples. Reaching this end goal can be done by writing essays and outlines. The difference between these two methods, however, is that an outline can be done in 15 minutes, but an essay would take you about an hour to write. Clearly, writing outlines is more time productive. Writing essays will improve your English skills, but content is the priority for H2 History – you must therefore be careful not to drain valuable time writing essays at the expense of developing more arguments nearing your exams. At the same time, you should still strive to write essays to improve your essay skills.

**Strategy #6:**  **Use model essays if you are unable to reach the L-7 grade standard**

If you have the time to write very high quality essay, I strongly encourage you to do it. I do not doubt that everyone can write quality essays, but I know how much time is a struggle for many of you. in the interest of time and to be able to focus on your other subjects, you can opt to use this method to save a huge amount of time.

There is one way to reach a level of analysis and a depth of conclusion on a level far above that of most students and getting the highest marks – it is by taking reference from a model essay. If your essay is on a much higher level than other essays, you will hardly be faulted for it even if lacks originality because of how band marking works. If you look closely at the syllabus document, it is made clear that if an essay contains elements of a higher band, such as a sustained stand and accurate examples, it will be placed within this band. According to the marking scheme, it will not be possible to place it in a lower band because it simply does not possess the elements to be treated as such. 

If you are interested in the complete guides for each topic, you can check out [https://www.h2historyguides.com/](https://www.h2historyguides.com/) which has quality documents that you can use.

I hope each of you can learn from these 6 strategies and not repeat the mistakes that many of your seniors have made. Remember, your time is limited. Use it wisely.

Fundamentally, it is really asking yourself what you want to get out of your education. \n\nOP is right in pointing out that there are ways to study History smarter. Nonetheless, I have several comments that I hope future history candidates can find helpful in their journey. \n\n**Comment on Strategy # 1** \\- Absolutely correct in pointing out that the essay portion is essential because you can memorize content more easily. However, I would like to caution against using ""prepared arguments"".  \n\nTo do so successfully, you must really understand how to ATQ properly. This means to really understand the demands of the question and the implications behind it. Sometimes in exams, my friends picked a question because they ""prepared the most canned arguments"" for that particular topic. \n\nHowever, this can go horribly wrong in two ways. The first is to misread the question and wrongly apply those canned arguments. The easiest way to tell if the essay has been prepared, is to read the evaluation. Each essay demands a different evaluation, because each question is inherently different. \n\nThus, for each essay that you do practice, it is essential that you ***practice writing the evaluation and analysis***. Memorizing the content can help you get to that occasional B, but it is always about making sense of it. \n\n**Comment of Strategy # 2** \\- I beg to differ on this. Definitely, quality > quantity. However, many even fail to hit the quantity mark. There are several reasons that are often inter-related. \n\n1) Not used to writing under exam conditions (i.e. too used to typing on computers, hand cramp on the day, stress)  \n\n2) Not knowing content well \n\nIf you cannot produce either quantity and quality, I\'d recommend that you stick to generating the quantity first. ***Learn the content, learn to write fast.*** That should get you to a high C and a B. After all, beggars can\'t be choosers. \n\nIn understanding history\'s Level system (L1 to L5), you should know that you can only get to L4 if you have L3. Analysis is useless if your content paragraphs are not strong. Evaluation is useless if your analysis is not strong. If you imagine a pyramid, the summit of a beautiful evaluation and that L6 / L7 band needs the building blocks of solid historical content and analysis. ***Hence, understand what you need to write in an essay.***\n\nNow, let us discuss about essays seeking to rest at a comfortable A. \n\nMany essays that do well range around four to six pages (i.e. variance based on handwriting and personal writing style). Some do well because they express the memorized content lucidly, some express hints of refreshing new ideas, some are highly analytical consistently, and some are different mixes of the above. \n\nThe only reason that a short piece can score well, is that every word was purposefully written. Since the marker can see it as well, they can credit them with marks. A strong student can score well writing a short piece, because the marker has confidence that if he or she wrote longer, every sentence would be of the same, if not higher quality. \n\nThe importance is to maintain that quality of writing, the quality of examples and the depth of analysis. ***To do so, you need to be purposeful in your writing.*** Instead of cramming examples into a content paragraph, ask how efficiently you can be using the time to write analysis. Or, improve your ordering of sentences to ensure the logic flows within paragraphs, and from there the logical flow throughout the essay.\n\n**Comment on Strategy # 3** \\- Personally, I find that this is caused by variance in the strategies of History departments across different schools in how they interpret the syllabus. Secondly, it is caused by differences in quality of history teachers. I was fortunate to have amazing history teachers, but I have heard peers lament about how useless their tutorials were. \n\nSo how do we bridge that gap? ***By being proactive in our own learning*****.** It means preparing essays and arranging consultations with your teachers. For me, ***what is important is to not be afraid to question your teacher.*** Sometimes, teachers make guesses about A level questions based on past trends. However, they aren\'t always right. They are just making a gamble such that your lives as students become ever so slightly easier. In the end, if you don\'t do well for your A levels, your history tutor can\'t do anything to save you. By learning to question, you find lapses in your own understanding. You can see the flaws in your essays. You can see the flaws in your teacher\'s notes.\n\nIf you think your teacher doesn\'t meet the mark, by all means consult your seniors, peers or even get tuition. Share notes, study together, or do whatever that works for you. Don\'t just copy strategies off Reddit or from your teachers/ peers. ***Understand yourself. And make sure that whatever you do works for you. If not, make it work for you.*** \n\n**Comment on Strategy # 4 -**  No, no, and no. The process of making notes is essential to learning humanities. Taking notes during lectures and tutorials is the best way to engage the content. Sure, those scratches you make during the first tutorial of the Asian Financial Crisis may not be directly relevant to the essay you\'ll write during Prelims, but those scratches eventually become more coherent. Those scratches and random thoughts are the way in which I learned to understand the content. You should not start the note process making too late. It is more like a process of drafting, continuously in pursuit of self-improvement. Know the difference between ***regular note taking and exam cheat sheets (i.e. final product).*** \n\nThose cheat sheets are only a means of memorization. Because of the sheer amount of content, those ***cheat sheets are a page limit that force you to memorize only the most essential content, as recommended by the syllabus and/ or your teachers.*** These are notes that I recommend writing close to the exams, to ensure that you have the content where it needs to be. \n\n**Comment on Strategy # 5 -** ***Highly dependent on your own needs.*** If your writing sucks, then write more. If you cannot plan, plan more. If you cannot think, evaluate more or fake it till you make it. ***So, constantly evaluate your strengths and weaknesses are.*** Consult your teachers, read their comments, ask your peers/ seniors. \n\n**Comment on Strategy # 6 -** ***Use with caution****.* Learn to develop your own judgment to tell what is good and why. ***Don\'t be disheartened*** when you see people scoring 26s and 28s, and you think to yourself, ""eh f\\*\\*\\*, I can never write like that leh."" \n\nEveryone can score an A with their own style of writing. You do not need to write like Shakespeare to write so beautifully. You do not need to have photographic memory to produce those perfect content points. ***Ultimately, you need to know that you can write an A essay that is distinctively yours.*** \n\nMy advice may not help everyone, but I hope it has made a difference to some. I don\'t really have an advertisement to make or a link to purchase study guides. I just hope that you guys can learn to love history as much as I did (even if you don\'t intend to take it for university rip). With that, I wish all of you the best. Do let me know if I have made any errors or if there are any questions I can try to answer.', ""Yay I'll bump this because I really grew to extra enjoy learning history when I took it. \n\nI super second strat 5 :') because time becomes far more precious closer to As."", 'Thank you so much for offering help! :)', 'Hello,\n\nThank you for taking your time and talking about your approach to learning H2 History.

cyanseha,cid7re,I'm feeling confused and trapped,2019-07-27 12:37:07,singapore,378762,54,40,"Not sure if this is the best place to post but I feel like I should discuss about this topic online and in the local context. 

At the beginning of this year, I decided to convert to Christianity. As a guy who browses reddit and meme pages quite a bit, I knew of the reputation that Christians have. Nevertheless, I decided to convert because I felt that I could rely on Jesus Christ for my problems with self-confidence and self-doubt. 

I did have encounters with Jesus (or I perceived to have encounters) and I felt that I liked the idea of having a God who was always looking out for you and a God whom you can have a relationship with as well as the friends in church. I also enjoyed praising and worshipping God.

But recently, I've been feeling conflicted about Christianity, mainly about LGBT. I've have had a liberal-ish mindset ever since I was exposed to the internet so I've been supportive of LGBT ideas. But I've had friends who've been asking me about my views on LGBT. And it got me feeling like I can't be Christian and support LGBT at the same time. I love having a God who is all-powerful and able to look after you and perform miracles but I also love people who are different from me and I am neutral about, if not supportive of what they do as long as it doesn't intrude on my life. And the recent post on Truelove.is (https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ci2v6f/trueloveis_has_proven_that_its_not_interested_in/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) has made me even more confused on what my stand is. It feels like everyone hates Christians. It makes me feel like Christians are terrible people who constantly go around persecuting others even though that's not what I experienced in church. Yes, they may not like the idea of LGBT but they are still nice people.

I hope you can understand that I don't have the most clarity of thought when writing this as I'm still sorting myself out. I'm willing to provide any details as long as it doesn't harm me and it adds to the discussion. I just hope that I can get a discussion going and I can get some advice from the discussion. I hope you can understand that I don't wish to discuss with my church people because I know what kind of response I will get, mainly that they will tell me to give up LGBT support. I hope to discuss it here to get a more diverse view and to understand what Singaporeans generally feel. I really hope you guys can be supportive.",0.7,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/cid7re/im_feeling_confused_and_trapped/,"['Christians can be nice people yes. Anyone can be a nice person, you don’t have to be a Christian to be nice and you can be nice without being a Christian :) \n\nYour faith is something meaningful and personal to you, you can choose to support anything you wish to. It’s called a personal opinion for a reason. \n\nBut to harass and use horrible methods to “convert” people, that’s awful. \n\nStay true to what you believe in, be it your faith, your views on controversial issues or other things. Don’t feel pressured to alter your views because of your friends (Christian or not). You’ll be happier that way and likely less confused', 'As a person who supports LGBT rights, let me humbly offer my perspective.\n\nI hope I\'m not being controversial when I say it\'s all right for people to feel uncomfortable over LGBT. In fact, I think that in Singapore, it\'s almost the norm to feel disturbed by the idea, thanks to the older generation and our conservative society in general. I myself grew up with a warped, shallow, abhorrent view towards the LGBT community, thanks to the influence of other adults and peers. It took some time to understand LGBT individuals better and get over my shallow thinking.\n\nHowever, I think it is an asshole move to **openly denounce the LGBT community** (like all the cunt ""pastors"" with god complexes, eg lawrence khong) and **dehumanize them**, and worse, **encourage others to do the same**. Does your god teach you to be an insufferable cunt to a fellow human being?\n\nYou must remember that LGBT individuals have hurt no one, and their sexuality is purely consensual and between them. We have no business infringing upon their right to live a normal life. A person is not defined by their sexuality, but by their character and actions. To judge a person\'s worth by their sexual orientation is no different than looking down on the disabled, handicapped, terminally ill etc.\n\nI would say, stick by your principles! You seem to be a kind person who doesn\'t wave religion around like a dick or enforce your morality on others. \n\nPerhaps try not to think about ""is it alright to support LGBT"", but ""is it alright to treat others poorly without provocation?""', 'Personal opinion is that friends from mega churches tend to be aggressive about evangelism and are kind brain washed. Those from the smaller family churches are much milder and are much more tolerant.', 'have you considered simply changing to another church whose belief more closely aligned with yours?\n\nyou can keep your religion, it just doesnt have to be that specific church\n\nyou have your own innate morals, ethics and values, and evidently this church doesnt share them\n\nthe options available to you are simply\n\n1) tolerate this difference, focus on the common values instead, and keep the status quo, keeping in mind that it is a future source of conflict\n\n2) compromise on your values and morals and accept their\n\n3) lead them and get them to adopt yours (easier said than done)\n\n4) leave, find another place instead\n\nif you try to find another place instead, you might find one that shares your values and ethics and also give you the sense of belonging you wanted\n\n>feels like everyone hates Christians\n\ndont, coz it is simply untrue, that may be unhappiness directed towards specific individuals/organisation for their specific belief, but that is different from a broad general hatred, it is just so easy to blame the world/everyone else for things, it is a dangerous trap, dont spiral into this rabbit hole\n\nhow about you take a step back, focus on other activities, and see if that gives you a clearer perspective', 'Why should you be concerned about the perception of your religion in the eyes of others? Is your faith dependent on external validation? \n\nChristianity gets a lot of flak for its LGBT opposition, but people gloss over the good it has done for people struggling in life. Look through the Generation Grit series by ST, and you’d realise that religion (Christianity or not) was involved in a significant number of those who turned their life around, only that ST may not feature it prominently since it’s supposed to be a secular news source. \n\nAlso, not all Christians are vehemently opposed to LGBT persons. There are Christians out there who may not be able to wrap their heads about LGBT yet  treat LGBT persons no differently in real life. In other words, majority of moderately religious/slightly or non-religious people just don’t give a shit about LGBT. They just couldn’t care less if the persons they interact with are LGBT or not.\n\nEdit: not a Christian myself ok', 'Disclaimer: I am a Christian\n\nHaving these thoughts while being a Christian isn\'t abnormal (confliction about certain topics which the bible abhors or states as a sin). I mean, how can a religion which preaches \'love thy neighbour\' as one of its commandments have such hateful followers that persecute and harass others (LGBTQ)?\n\nI suppose you are looking for a \'Christian\' explanation. I am no preacher nor pastor, I most probably am in the same boat as you when it comes to finding my answers to these questions, but imma just give you my 2 cents worth on my experience and conversations with people thus far on this issue.\n\nChristianity is your own walk with God, no one can influence your journey as much as you yourself can. This (kinda) means that you\'re responsible for your own walk with God. Now you know the bible\'s stance on such issues. But confronted with these issues, which are real people with feelings and emotions, some people (me) wonder, how can God hate these people and persecute them? It probably has something to do with sinning (I guess) and a lot of other factors that I would probably think your church goes through extensively to tell you guys why these people are \'evil\'. (eg. unwilling to repent, live a life of debauchery and sin blah blah blah).\n\nNow I wasn\'t born a Christian. I was like you, I converted because I saw that it was one of the many ways that I could \'become\' a better person. I wouldn\'t say that I am (I\'m not one for self-praise), but i sure did learn a hell lot in my journey as a Christian.\n\nI hold a few verses close to myself, one of them being John 8:7. It goes like this "" *When they kept on questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, “Let any one of you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone* *at her.”*  Its a verse found in the Book of John in the New Testament, and describes how the Pharisees and Teachers of Law wanted a woman stoned to death for committing adultery. But Jesus replied as in John 8:7. And this provides (at least for me) a moral compass when dealing with such issues. Am I without sin? No. Who am I to persecute others for their sins? I am nobody. Therefore, it is not in my place nor power to condemn or decree who is sinning or should be punished. Therefore, in my life, I view everyone as an equal. There are no labels or tags, everyone is treated equally and respectfully. Now, a rule of thumb (at least for myself). If the church I\'m going to is spending more time preaching hate and inciting hate about such issues, it probably isn\'t a good place to be at or to grow in your journey with God. I suggest finding another one. \n\nThe next would be found in Mark 2: 13-17. It describes Jesus dining with tax collectors (one of the most hated professions in that era). Now Jesus constantly was in the company of \'undesirable\' people. Prostitutes, tax collectors, the lepers. All these whom society had abandoned and shunned away from. But he chose to be there for them, to show them hope. And in church, they always say, live your life so that others can see the love of God through you. So that\'s another guiding point for me. Be there for those who need help the most, dosen\'t matter the poor, sick, LGBTQ or whatever. What matters is that you\'re there for people who need help the most, cos that\'s what Jesus did. So since you\'re focusing on the issue of LGBTQ, treat your friends (who are), the same as anyone who are not. You\'re not a Christian to convert them to heterosexuality, or to tell them they are going to burn in hell. If people are telling u to do that, stay farrrr awayyyyyy. You\'re not on earth as an adjudicator (John Wick 3, great movie).  You\'re there to support them no matter what their decision is, or what they choose to be. This is how you show your \'Christianity\', at least to me. \n\nChristianity is your own walk with God. I\'ll say that again. The church assists you in your walk, but there are right and wrong paths to follow. Take the 2 extremes for an example: The KKK in America (Kkona Clap) or the Gay Churches (GachiHyper). These are radicals, and the people who follow these and subscribe to their ideals are, imo, not Christian at all. They take select parts of scripture and bend and twist it to serve their wicked purpose, and they have to answer to God in the end. Matthew 7:21-23 says that.  *""Not everyone who says to me, ‘Lord, Lord,’ will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. Many will say to me on that day, ‘Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?’ Then I will tell them plainly, ‘I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!* "" And the same thing goes for everything you encounter while you are a Christian. Whatever you do, always ask yourself these 2 questions. Am I doing something that isn\'t pleasant if I\'m in the other party\'s shoes? Am I doing what I can for someone who comes to me for help? (Thoughts and prayers don\'t really count). At the end of the day (sobering), whether you go to heaven really just falls on one thing. Are you rooted in God? Or do you root yourself in something other than Him (Your Pride, Wealth, Power, Sexuality, etc etc). That\'s why I say that the road to heaven is one you pave yourself.\n\nThis is like my MOST condensed thoughts on this issue. I think there will definitely be opposing views or counter arguments and what not. I am not a pastor, take what i say with a huge load of salt in case what I say is blasphemous.  For me, there exists an emotional and scientific part, and then the religious part. I try to find the balance everyday, and live my life out. Just don\'t expect answers to drop, but that doesn\'t mean you should give up and stop finding them either. \n\nI\'m more than happy to share my views on this with you if u wna drop me a msg. Can\'t guarantee answers but hope my experiences can help. Peace to everyone out there if I offended you with my essay just lmk haha apologies in advance.', ""You do you. I am a Christian but not a stereotypical one. I was from a megachurch but I left. I'm fine with LGBT. To me,  your relationship with God is more important than anything else. Rely on Him and go to a Church where you are comfortable with. :) That's my interpretation."", ""I see it this way: Even as Christians it is not our place to force our own convictions on others, through the law or otherwise. \n\nJust like how other religions may have restrictions e.g. on the food they eat, but don't push these rules onto others who don't share the same beliefs.\n\nWe should just focus on trying to be the best Christians that we can be, and remember that any obligations that we may have with our walk in life is our own choice, is self-imposed, and that we should be no means hold others, especially those not of the faith, to what we choose as standards for ourselves. \n\nI feel like when I started to think this way, then I began to recognise a lot of my previous prejudices against the LGBT community and began to see alot of my own self-righteousness. And changing my perspective of them is my way of supporting them in a sense, seeing how society sometimes does reflect them in a negative light.\n\nBeing a Christian is our individual choice, so society as a whole should not be held to Christian standards, but only those of the faith. When we stop consciously or subconsciously imposing these beliefs on others, it may help the issues with prejudice that the LGBT community face today."", ""I used to go to a megachurch, the atmosphere was awesome, it felt awesome during the praise and worship with thousands of others singing along (much like a weekly concert, don't you think?)\n\nUltimately, i realised that everyone in there doea not express their personal views. They agree to whatever is given to them, whatever that was deemed acceptable or not in church, all of us started to agree without reasoning. Thinking back, it was quite.. scary?\n\nDon't get me wrong. I'm not shitting on Christianity, it's just megachurches man. If you don't feel comfortable being Christian while maintaining your views on issues, the church isn't for you. Seek other churches. There are many different churches or groups that have varying views on many issues here, and you are always free to choose which suits you best.\n\nI find it annoying that certain christians frown on people who 'hop' around, findinf a fit for themselves. Come on, it aint hookups kiddos."", 'Hello u/cyanseha, I am the writer of the thread that you linked and I thought it\'d be apt for me to respond directly to you. \n\nFirst of all, I am sorry that you are experiencing this fear as a result of the [Truelove.is](https://Truelove.is) conflict. I, as a gay ex-Christian who has been shamed and attacked for my identity, do not at all wish for anyone else - including you, a Christian - to feel like you cannot be who you are. Nobody should have to go through the trauma of hatred and discrimination. \n\nNow, I want to address a few points you have raised:\n\n>""It feels like everyone hates Christians.""\n\nHere, I want to draw a distinction between Christians *as people* and Christians *as ideology*. I myself, and I hope most other people as well, truly have nothing against the Christian identity. If you derive peace from subscribing to this religion, I am happy for you. What I attack in my article is not the Christian persona, but a complex of discriminatory and socially divisive thought processes that Christians *tend to subscribe to*. Note that nobody has said ""we hate Christians""; we say, ""we hate that some Christians are using their beliefs as a means to traumatise and marginalise people they don\'t agree with"". \n\n>It makes me feel like Christians are terrible people who constantly go around persecuting others even though that\'s not what I experienced in church. Yes, they may not like the idea of LGBT but they are still nice people.\n\nI want you to interrogate this notion of whether one can be excused from criticism if they are not explicitly homophobic. Yes, it is good that these people don\'t go around beating up gay people and rioting at Pink Dot. However, this ""niceness"" comes with a cost; even if they are outwardly nice and seem to have nothing against gay people, these sort of people are often happy to support a discriminatory system in which gay people cannot marry, adopt, buy houses at heterosexual rates and times, use their CPF for each other\'s medical emergencies, be left into critical care wards under the label of ""life partner"", and will never enjoy the dignity of being a full citizen in the system. So what if they are nice, if they are happy to systemically rob gay people of being a full person in their own country?\n\nBeing nice to me in manners really doesn\'t matter if you are happy for me to live a life less vivid just because you don\'t ""like the idea of LGBT people"". In fact, it is precisely because you only think of us as ""ideas"", and not as full, embodied people with dreams, hopes and disappointments - because you refuse us empathy and dignity - that you perpetuate our suffering.\n\nNiceness doesn\'t count for much if its cost is our continued happiness in Singapore. \n\nHaving said all this, what do I think you can do?\n\nFirst, read your Bible properly. Every interpretation of the Bible is done within the social mores of its time. For example, it is now fashionable to interpret injunctions against female pastors as artifacts of their time. Why, then, can\'t we say that in today\'s scientifically informed context, we can also recognise that injunctions against homosexuality are products of their time? I hope you will read your Bible in the most intelligent and kind manner to bring happiness to the most number of people and minimise discrimination. \n\nSecondly, I want you to raise this topic with your Christian friends. I know that you fear the friction this will provoke. Imagine how hard it must be for queer folk to survive in a church; this is why we need straight religious allies like you to stir these conversations within places that queer folk cannot thrive. I want you to work against the friction, to provoke their thinking, to stir within them the same sense of moral discomfort that you are experiencing now, because it is a productive discomfort that will force them to reckon with the humanity of the people they hate.\n\nI hope this has been a fruitful message for you. Thank you for your thoughts and your kindness.', 'I just want to address the confusion with Christians being nice/well-meaning people and dicks at the same time in certain areas.\n\nConsider an extreme example of religious dickishness: ISIS. They did all these horrible, well documented things while at the same time having normal day to day lives and concerns. They raised children and were probably not much different from normal parents except in some obvious ways. But surely they also played with their children, taught them about different animals, fed them and cared for them. While at the same time treating their household slave like they\'re not human, cheering on executions and believing that it is a privilege to die for their religion.\n\nIf you look at this objectively, it almost appears as if these people were not evil themselves, but rather infected with an evil (mind-)virus that hijacked part of their thinking.\n\nThe same is true for most major ideologies across the world. Be it communists, religious extremists, nazis or whoever. Most of them believed they were working for the common good.\n\n  \nTo me, ""normal"" religion is just a much weaker version of such a mind virus. But the principles are the same.\n\n  \nSee also [The banality of evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eichmann_in_Jerusalem)', ""Christians are a diverse group. I'm sure you can find Christians who support homosexuals."", ""There's an objective answer to what Singaporeans generally feel - a shrinking majority is against homosexuality. \n\nI'm not sure if this answer helps you, but the general Christian position is that homosexual activity is not acceptable. There're then different views on whether same-sex attraction is something that can and should be be changed. If you want to find Christians who say that homosexuality is okay, you will be able to, but it's very much a fringe position."", 'I feel you. I\'m a Christian and I really don\'t get the focus on anti-LGBT notions although it\'s important to note that it\'s mostly with the older generation. I say ""focus"" because I do feel like it\'s especially targeted as in issue, among everything else. It\'s almost convenient.\n\nMy stand is this: Homosexuality is a sin and is not an acceptable, Christ-like behaviour. And so is lying, lusting, envy, pride, etc etc you get the point. When someone has a habit of lying, we don\'t oppress or condemn them. Apply it to every other sin.\n\nRegarding how Christianity is rather disliked, I actually thing it\'s a good sign that it\'s disliked i.e. people have an opinion of Christianity. What I\'m much more worried about is that people don\'t even give a thought to religion in general. Singapore is a very comfortable environment and people really don\'t need to know God to lead a ""happy"" life here. This is the real potential killer.\n\nAt the end of the day, I hope that you\'ve truly experienced God and know that he is real, that way it won\'t matter what anyone else says. LGBT people are still people and children of God, in the end it\'s about sharing Christ with people so that they may know and accept God.', 'You got to decide if you can live with the internal (and eternal) conflict or not. This LGBT thing is literally not for the church to decide anyway.', ""I do have friends who are Christian and support LGBT, the most important thing is to know that you don't need to feel condemned over this, God loves you no matter what and that He loves the LGBT just the same."", ""hey, fellow gay Christian here. I'm really sorry you've had that experience, and would like to invite you to Free Community Church - it's the only LGBT-affirming Christian church in Singapore. It could help you to hear different perspectives and be in fellowship with other LGBT Christians (and pastors), even if you may not agree with them in the end. I've been there for over 5 years now, and it's an amazing community. Feel free to PM me if you like!"", ""Hi there, thanks for sharing. I too feel saddened reading that thread because I don't agree with how many Christians in SG approach this issue of LGBT rights.\n\nI believe that the Bible is very clear that sexual relations is only permissive within a monogamous heterosexual marriage, and there is no room for contextual revisionist re-reading of this. However, the bible does not say that experiencing temptation is a sin, but giving into temptation is sin (1 Corinthians 10:13). Therefore I disagree with conversion therapy, as it is misguided, as one does not need to be free from non-heterosexual tendencies to be accepted by God. \n\nYes I acknowledge that this is a very high moral bar to set. However I also believe that the church should not impose its morals on people who are outside the church. 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 says: “For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge? God judges those outside. Purge the evil person from among you.” Yes, evangelism is required of all Christians (Matthew 28:9-10), but it is only after one accepts Jesus as their Lord and Savior that they begin the process of aligning their morals with God's.\n\nChristian morality needs to be read together in context of the full Christian worldview, if not it does not make sense, and its not just about right and wrong. God is supposed to be our only source of fulfillment (John 6:35). However we have all turned away from God and looked for satisfaction in other things such as sex, marriage, family, career, money etc., though these things are good things in themselves. Placing our satisfaction back in God is not an overnight process, it is a lifelong journey for every Christian.\n\nTherefore I cannot support the Wear White movement or Truelove.is, or the effort to keep 377A. But I also cannot support Pink Dot as well. I am going against all the popular movements of the day (bracing for downvotes from all sides) but I know that my stance is supported by a robust reading of the Bible.\n\nThe problem is many churches have double standards regarding sin within the church and outside. It is difficult to deal with their own sins, so they prefer to point out the sins of those outside as a form of virtue signalling. This is hypocrisy, so I am not surprised of the hostility that they face.\n\nI believe that the Bible is the Word of God and is of ultimate authority, so my advice is to read your Bible, and learn more about theology. Best to find a church that equips its members to read the Bible for themselves. If you can do that, you know whether what is taught in church is from God or not. If this is so, then it would be more likely that the church would be confident enough in their own beliefs such that they will not afraid to discuss difficult issues like this."", ""It doesn't sound very Christian to judge about the lives of others. I do not have a religion but it is my belief that religion is supposed to be there to supplement existing values and morals you have. So just focus on yourself and stop caring about what others may think."", ""Not sure why there is a Travel flair but I hope it doesn't affect anything"", 'Which denomination of Christianity did you join ?', 'Just go with what you feel dude. I’m sure jesus is a loving god. even if christianity is against the LGBT group, it is not our place to judge. \n\nMyself - I tried to get into christianity myself, but i could get pass the idea of the whole thing. God created man who committed the original sin in the beginning. Centuries later he made a woman pregnant so he can come to earth in human form. then he had to die on the cross to save humanity from our sins. I mean, cant he just forgive us since he’s all forgiving and loving. A bit unnecessary to die. Him dying to appease himself sounds a bit wacky.\n\nmaybe im just too stupid to understand. haha. you just do what you feel is right buddy!', '>Yes, they may not like the idea of LGBT but they are still nice people.\n\nThis can be an analogy towards people who are supremacist towards a certain race, in which case they treat you nicely because you are straight\n\n\nIf you still like the idea of a god watching you, maybe consider other religion? Am i saying christians who dislike lgbt people bad? Yes of course because they are denying the rights of an individual based on their sexual preference.', ""Your relationship with whichever/whatever God you connected with is your own.

If your Christian friends tell you to change your stance, tell them to fuck off.', ""Jesus said nothing about LGBT people but we know from the 4 Gospels that Jesus often associate himself with unsavory people which earn him the ire of the Jewish rabbis. It was said that Jesus sat and ate with tax collectors and whores. \n\nMost Christians are against LGBT on the virtue of the Old Testaments and some passages in the NT. However, the NT verses are also against people who act in an 'effeminate' manner, fornicators, adulterers and all manner of sexual perversity so if you are gay, you are in good company with the rest of us\n\nMy interpretation is that in Christianity, since Jesus died for the sins of the world and if I dont sin, it makes his sacrifice in vain....so sin all you want"", 'Hello!

But my family is just 1 of many in society at large. Therefore its none of my business what LBGTs want to do with their lives as long as they do not push their ideas on me or my family. If they enjoy anal sex, good for them. But they have no right to say that I am homophobic just because I do not wish to share their pain in the ass. \n\nTo me the Christian community I am exposed to has too many annoying hypocrites that I know of. But applying the same yard stick, as long as they keep their noses where they belong and not try to stick it in my face, it's their freedom to congregate and feel good about themselves.\n\nDon't the opinion floating around in social media dictate how you want to see the world.

For I have come to turn  “\u2006‘a man against his father,  a daughter against her mother,  a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law—   a man’s enemies will be the members of his own household.’    “Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.  Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me.\nMatthew 10:34\u202d-\u202c38 NIV\n\nOur role model united people, but He also divided! Jesus wasn't liked by everyone and was persecuted for speaking the truth to the point of crucifixion. This doesn't excuse evil behaviour under the cover of Christianity though!! If you think Christians are hated now, you should have seen them burning on sticks during Emperor Nero's reign. This isn't to say we should be happy to be hated, but just that by human nature and by the nature of God's word, hate will come. But so will love and grace!! \n\nAs for the LGBT community, truelove.is doesn't support conversion therapy and they've made that abundantly clear! They aren't perfect, but they're definitely bringing the subject of LGBT into more conversations in many churches, a subject that should be addressed! Find a church that deals with these conversations with respect and love. Methodists are pretty progressive in that aspect imo. \n\nHate the sin, love the sinner. We as Christians should take LGBT Christians as they are! Works in progress to be more like Christ, and aren't we (Christians) all? To be Christian is to strive to be more like Jesus and we'll always be a work in progress! The problem arrives when human nature in Christian communities results in judgement and discrimination based on what we are currently. Good Christian communities should see each other as who they're trying to become more like (Jesus), and encourage each other with love!\n\nI encourage you to keep going! Learn more about what it means to be more like Jesus!"", '> At the beginning of this year, I decided to convert to Christianity.\n\nDid Jesus appear in your dreams or something?', 'I think the difficulty lies in the **distinction**. As Christians, we are taught to hate the sin (LGBT acts), not the sinner (LGBT).', ""Good point. I like how you put it in the last one.

Bit late to the discussion here but would like to share my thoughts...\n\nFirstly I am a Christian and with that said, I want to apologize on behalf of the Christian community to those people that have felt hurt, victimized or ostracized about this. This is, frankly, disgraceful. \n\nI think there are a couple points that sort of complicate the discussion when this issue is brought up. To begin with, there is no one single church that passes down doctrine to all Christians, each denomination or individual church has its own church traditions and ways of interpreting the faith. And honestly there are many churches who disagree with mega churches on a whole variety of theological issues, LGBTQ+ being one of them. Throw all these opinions into a thorny issue and unfortunately, it is the angriest voices that shout the loudest. So again I must apologize for this. \n\nSecondly, Christianity is really about a personal relationship with God. The church exists to support, guide and grow a community of believers - but guess what, the church is flawed and not perfect! The church does not have the authority to pass moral judgment or “let people into heaven” or whatever. Only God (if you believe God exists) can do that. So if you hear a church pastor say “God hates gays and wants them to burn in hell” or whatever, that is complete and utter BS, and the pastor will have to answer to God for that heresy. No matter who you are, what you believe etc, no one has the right to tell you that you are not accepted or loved. \n\nSo once again- I apologize on behalf of the Christian community for the way that we have persecuted, ostracized and hated others. We may agree to disagree, but in a loving and even headed manner and leave personal attacks out of it. Sorry guys. \n\nGo to talk a Christian, have a drink with them, and if they start spouting hateful BS at you, tell them that an anonymous random Christian on reddit is hugely ashamed of their behavior and tired of their hate.', 'Yup. Megachurches have some characteristics of an MLM\n\nThankfully many mature Christians eventually migrate to smaller, community based churches that are more moderate and sane.

But I do feel like I belong with the people in the church, just that we do not share the same views on certain things"", ""> Is your faith dependent on external validation?\n\nHear hear. A personal relationship with God doesn't have to be justified to anyone else."", 'I know that we shouldn\'t impose our beliefs on others and I hate doing that.

These were jesus's own instructions to the apostles when he sent them out to evangelize. \n\nOne takeaway of matthew 10 is that if the person is not welcome or receptive, there is no point in forcing it. A person must encounter god for themselves, and also choose to listen. \n\nI find effective evangelism rarely comes from 'street evangelism' or prothelystizing. Real evangelism is hard work; it involves being invested and genuinely caring for someone. No one listens to what you have to say unless they know you care for them. Making disciples is not about hitting some kpi number, but making real life change over a long time. \n\nOverall, I encourage you to continue to ponder and think on such issues. It's very good to think critically about what you believe in, understand why you believe. It is only by questioning that your faith grows stronger. Discuss this with your friends and dont be afraid to ask difficult questions."", ""I think the important thing to remember is that the Gospel is needed because by the laws of God, we're all in the wrong in one way or another, because His standards are perfectly holy beyond what we can achieve. This is why Jesus had to die for us on the cross and this is our hope for salvation. And so when we believe in Jesus and accept Him then we are inclined to do and follow what He says.\n\nSharing the Gospel is about telling everyone that we were once ALL guilty sinners, but can now still receive salvation from punishment because of what Christ did. And there will be people who will not accept this, and that's ok. At the end of the day our role is to spread it so that all will know, but in doing so it is inevitable that not all will accept this. We cannot control what a person accepts, no matter the amount of evangelism we do. It has to be a personal choice and conviction to truly be faith.\n\nThe issue of telling what is right and wrong is more internal, within fellow Christians, because we need to keep one another in check to be wary of sin so that we can please God. Once we choose God, our rights and wrongs are defined by His Word, but for those who haven't, they naturally would have a different sense of what is right and wrong.\n\nThe personal conviction of sin or a personal need for Christ cannot be given. It is a choice for everyone to make, out of the free will that God has given us."", ""Yea I am from a megachurch. But on the judgmental part, I would like to add on. Through my conversations with my friends, I've found out some things. There are some bad habits (such as gluttony, smoking, alcoholism) that they don't like but don't really judge. But it seems like it's LGBT where they really have an opinion which seems strange to me"", ""Should I convert to Ironmanism because his heroic act in Endgame made me feel moved? You do realize religion has much more depth beyond superficial feelings?

Good luck!', 'Its not strange at all. Its easy to be judgmental about LGBT because most of them are not attracted to the same sex. But stuff like gluttony, smoking, drinking? Oh, that may require passing judgment on themselves which is obviously uncomfortable.', 'Generally, churches in Singapore will not encourage LGBT, that’s understandable, just like how they won’t encourage smoking and alcoholism. But there are certainly a few that are a lot more anti-LGBT than others, and seem to be exceptionally so. Used to go to FCBC, one of the megachurches in Singapore, and while I prefer being straight myself the really anti-LGBT message they preach there was sickening; the pastors even actively initiates campaigns against LGBTs.\n\nThat’s why I eventually switched to another megachurch sure, though they rarely touch on the LGBT topic here and will probably go on a spectrum of being neutral to politely suggesting that heterosexuality to be better if you proactively ask them about LGBT, but at least they won’t go blaring all day every day about how LGBT people are immoral and deserve to go to hell and all that.', 'A sin is a sin, and if we were to listen to the word of Christ, we are all sinners. Sure there are sins that are ""worse"" than others, but Catholicsm teaches me not to judge others. Will you go to hell for your sins? I don\'t know. Peter pursecuted and murdered Christians, but he was called to be a saint and he spent almost the rest of his life in prison while doing the work of God. Also, if your friends judge your sins, you can point them to the first two verses of Matthew 7. No one can judge anyone\'s sins except God.', 'No need to be an ass right.']"

Peristalsis - Peristalsis is the rhythmic wavelike muscular contractions in the walls of the alimentary canal where the longitudinal and circular muscles work antagonistically to move food along.


*Deamination - Deamination is the process by which amino groups are removed from amino acids and converted to urea.


Digestion - Digestion is the process of breaking down large complex insoluble food molecules into smaller simpler soluble molecules. Digestion involves the physical breakdown of food substances which mechanically breaks down food into smaller pieces to increase the surface area to volume ratio for digestive enzymes to work on. Digestion is also a chemical process involving breaking of bonds with the aid of enzymes.


Absorption - Absorption is the process whereby digested food molecules are taken into the blood capillaries for glucose and amino acids and the lacteal capillaries for fats. This takes place in the villi in the small intestine. The digested food molecules move into the villi in the small intestine by diffusion and active transport.


Assimilation - Assimilation is the distribution and use of products of digestion as as energy source and conversion into other nutrients needed for growth and repair of body parts

Diploid - A diploid cell contains 2 sets of chromosomes or the full number of chromosomes found in normal body cells.



Chapter 17: Reproduction in Plants


Asexual Reproduction - Asexual reproduction is the process resulting in the production a genetically identical offspring from one parent, without the fusion of gametes.


Sexual Reproduction - Sexual reproduction is the process involving the fusion of gametes to form a zygote. It produces genetically dissimilar offspring.


Pollination - Pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the sigma


Self-pollination - Self-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from the anther to the stigma of the same flower or of a different flower on the same plant.


Cross-pollination - Cross-pollination is the transfer of pollen grains from one plant to the stigma of a flower of another plant of the same species.

jaydxn1,c0kym1,r/SGExams' Soft Launch: exams.sg,2019-06-14 22:48:14,SGExams,77673,14,168,"Hello everyone,

&#x200B;

Awhile back we mentioned that we were on a hunt for notes because we were building up a notes repository that we wanted to share with everyone. This idea actually started way back in Nov 2018 when we realized how much impact we have made to the student population. We knew that this would be a steep uphill battle because of how many countless sites that have tried this before us and failed ([tick.ninja](https://tick.ninja), [owlcove.sg](https://owlcove.sg) and even private tuition agencies). So in this rather niche area in the education system, we wanted to create a self-sufficient platform for students to use.

&#x200B;

As someone who self-studied throughout my entire A levels journey, I saw the importance of online resources. Without them, I would've never had gotten the practice I needed to achieve the grades I have today. A year ago, I had nothing but a little dream in mind and after meeting like-minded individuals from all walks of life, this dream today has become what we know as [exams.sg](https://exams.sg)

&#x200B;

Enough of the sob stories though, let's talk about what exactly [exams.sg](https://exams.sg) has to offer!

&#x200B;

**Library**

&#x200B;

Our note repository is open for all O, A levels and IB students to freely navigate or contribute. For individual subjects, we have also made a bunch of categorizations for everyone to find specific chapters they wish to study. In addition, a ""practice"" segment is also added for students that wish to transfer the knowledge they have learnt down on paper. An upvote system is active to filter good content upwards for more users to view, while poorly/inaccurate content is flagged for moderation.

&#x200B;

**Forum**

&#x200B;

r/SGExams has also been a jewel of mine, from building it up during its days of infancy to what it is now. We have heard the feedback/concerns of users and will not separate our community but making another independent one on [exams.sg](https://exams.sg). However, we have embedded the subreddit on the forum page for easy viewing (in dark mode of course). In the future, we hope to increase functionality and solve some issues we are facing on the current subreddit (yes we heard you guys!).

&#x200B;

**Scoreboard**

&#x200B;

What's the use of a website without a little fun right? We have added a scoreboard for schools to compete in terms of contributing content. At the end of an examination cycle (1 year), the top schools will received mystery rewards that will be decided by our resident web developer. The scoreboard is also a useful platform for you to view your fellow friends' contribution. Perhaps maybe even trade notes with your fellow schoolmates! We will not implement a private messaging function as we believe it does more harm than good. Anyway, it's much cooler to find out your friend was a ""certain user"" in real life!

&#x200B;

**Profile**

&#x200B;

Did you really contribute something if there's no records of it? Of course not, and that's where your profile page comes in. You will be recognized for your contributions and participation in events via the ""awards"" panel. What better way to brag to your friends than to show off all your accolades huh. On your profile page,  you will also be able to view past contributions and comments made on the website for easy reference. There are many more functions we wish to implement which will be explained further down below this post.

&#x200B;

**Merit Points**

&#x200B;

Merit points are part of our karma system to reward users for their contributions to the website. There are many ways to earn them, here's an excerpt from our FAQ:

    How do I earn merit points?
    Currently, you earn 1 merit point for creating an account, 5 merit points for uploading a set of notes to our library, 1 merit point per upvote earned on your notes and comments, and 10 merit points for participation in our CIP activities.
    
    Curators (our SGExams team members who vet the notes uploaded for academic accuracy and relevance) also get 3 merit points per set of notes vetted.
    
    In the future, you can look forward to more ways of earning merit points. For example, answering a fellow student’s question on a difficult piece of homework, writing an insightful article for other students etc.

So what exactly is the use of merit points? In the near future, we plan to add a reward system to complement merit points. Users will be able to redeem all sorts of goodies, here are some potential examples:

* Free Bubble Tea
* Grab Vouchers
* Popular Vouchers
* McDonalds Vouchers
* Single Free Admission Movie Tickets
* Discounted Meals @ Pastamania

&#x200B;

While we have yet to establish any sort of partnerships to provide such goodies, we plan to do them once we have made sufficient prudent planning to prevent inflation/deflation of merit point worth. The last thing we want to do is to shortchange you of benefits (looking at you GrabPoints)

**What can I do to help make this a thing?**

&#x200B;

Well I'm glad you asked, we'd honestly appreciate if you could spread the news of our endeavor through word of mouth. Bring your friends in and start contributing! The only way for others to help us is if we help them first, and this sharing resources will only benefit all our juniors down the road. If you have any resources just lying around whether it's on your desktop or on your desk top, start uploading them onto our website! Unfortunately, we only accept PDF formats for now but you can work around this by using free online PDF converters.

&#x200B;

**Plans for the future**

&#x200B;

Specific to this website, we have a lot of features we plan on implementing. However, some take precedence over others so yes we will implement night mode as soon as possible. On top of that, features will slowly be updated into the website every now and then to increase user optimization and make [exams.sg](https://exams.sg) worth going to in the first place, an upcoming feature you should expect to see in the following weeks as a new article section which serves 3 different purposes. We will archive all motivational posts from our subreddit there for students who are struggling to find inspiration. We will archive all past informative posts separately as a mega ""FYI"" section for bored students who want something useful to read during their travels. Lastly, there will be an academia section specifically for passionate students to write essays on topics they are interested about; this allows everyone to practice their writing while sharing different topics for all to learn about. I'd say this is extremely helpful for GP students. We are always open for recruitment if you find the project interesting enough. You can find the available roles here:

     https://exams.sg/join_us 

We are also open to partnership with other organisations so long as they are benefiting the students. However, it should not include monetized/paid services as we believe education should be made free to students.

kodomodragon,cj6tj0,Questions about wildlife in Singapore; Part 38: Blind Snakes,2019-07-29 13:21:13,singapore,378762,11,60,"Hi r/singapore, this week I'll be discussing the blind snakes, a family comprising harmless, non-venomous snakes that are not often seen due to their subterranean habits.

**Blind Snakes (Typhlopidae)**

The blind snakes are very worm-like in appearance, but can be differentiated from earthworms by features such as the [forked tongue](https://flic.kr/p/a87nS7), a body [covered in tiny, smooth scales](https://flic.kr/p/9KnhwV), and [serpentine movements](https://youtu.be/f44aIFmTkBM). The snout is blunt, overhangs the mouth, and is used to push through the soil. Because they spend most of their time underground, [their eyes are vestigial](https://flic.kr/p/2bDRHdQ). Burrowing through the soil, they feed on small, soft-bodied invertebrates.

These tiny snakes appear to be binge feeders, feeding infrequently, but when they do feed, they  consume large numbers of tiny prey in one sitting. Most species are not well-studied, but based on examination of gut contents of specimens, blind snakes appear to be dietary specialists that feed mainly on [ant larvae and pupae](https://youtu.be/IjNwcw3ZuyA) or termites. Ant-eating species likely search for food by digging and following tunnels until they breach the chamber of an ant nest, then feed on the helpless larvae and pupae until they've had their fill. Worker ants are sometimes swallowed, but usually by accident, such as when an ant is tending to the brood chamber and happened to be carrying a larva or pupa that the snake grabbed. The blind snake species that feed on termites target workers, since they lack the defensive capabilities of the soldiers. The smooth scales, useful for moving through the soil, may also help protect the snake to some extent from the bites of worker ants or soldier termites defending the colony. The snake eats as much as it can, then leaves the nest before the ants or termites cause any serious harm.

Because of their tiny mouths, blind snakes are unable to bite in self-defense, so they resort to other methods to ward off potential threats, such as releasing pungent secretions from anal glands, or jabbing with the tip of the tail, which has a hard, sharp point.

There are two species of blind snake known to occur in Singapore, with the status of a third species not confirmed. 

**Brahminy Blind Snake (*Indotyphlops braminus*)**

The [Brahminy Blind Snake](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/brahminy_blind_snake.htm) is also known as the Flowerpot Snake. This snake is uniformly dark brown or black, and is the [smallest snake species](https://flic.kr/p/6gb3Fb) in Singapore, growing less than 20 centimetres in length.

This species is [common and widespread](http://www.wildsingapore.per.sg/fauna/facts/snake_blind.htm), and has been recorded all over Singapore, in forested, rural, and urban habitats. However, it is usually only encountered when digging in the soil, although it might also be seen slithering across the pavement (especially after heavy rain), or stuck in small drains next to fields, grass verges, and other vegetated areas. As the name suggests, you might even find one while you're gardening.

The Brahminy Blind Snake is thought to be native to the Indian subcontinent, but due to its small size and ability to live undetected in the soil, it has been inadvertently transported to many other parts of the world, and now has the largest distribution of any snake species. It's been recorded all over Southeast Asia, including the islands of Indonesia and the Philippines, to New Guinea, Australia's Northern Territory, and various island groups in the South Pacific, even as far as Hawaii. It's present in southern China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Japan's Ryukyu Islands. It has been introduced to the Middle East, parts of Africa, Madagascar and other islands in the Indian Ocean, as well as Madeira and the Canary Islands in the eastern Atlantic. It has even made it to the Americas, and has been documented in Mexico and other parts of Central America, some islands in the Caribbean, and the southeastern United States.

Another reason why this snake has managed to spread all over the tropics is the fact that the Brahminy Blind Snake is currently the only [fully parthenogenetic snake species](http://digitallibrary.amnh.org/handle/2246/5203), meaning it reproduces asexually. Scientists have examined large numbers of individuals, and they were all female; to date, not a single male of this species has ever been confirmed. Furthermore, the species appears to be triploid, i.e. possessing three sets of chromosomes instead of the usual two, a trait shared with several all-female lizard species that also reproduce through parthenogenesis.

So the Brahminy Blind Snake appears to have spread around the world by stowing away in shipments of soil and plants. Even if only a single individual gets transported to a new place, as long as she survives the journey, and manages to thrive in her new home, she can lay fertile eggs, since she doesn't need to mate at all. If the eggs hatch successfully, and enough of her offspring survive to maturity, yet another population of Brahminy Blind Snakes will become established.

The status of the Brahminy Blind Snake in Singapore is unclear; it could be native, but given that a tiny burrowing snake has limited natural dispersal capability, it could also have been accidentally introduced by people a long time ago; Theodore Edward Cantor's [*Catalogue of reptiles inhabiting the Malayan peninsula and islands*](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4085188), published in 1847, already notes the Brahminy Blind Snake's presence in Singapore.

Most snakes swallow their prey whole, but [recent research](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/jzo.12268) shows some very interesting feeding behaviour in the Brahminy Blind Snake - when it's feeding on worker termites, it often [decapitates its prey first](http://www.bbc.com/earth/story/20150709-the-snake-that-decapitates-its-prey). First the snake grabs the termite's body in its mouth, then rubs the termite's head against a surface until it breaks off. The termite's body is then swallowed, while the indigestible head is discarded. This entire process takes only a few seconds, allowing the snake to rapidly consume large numbers of termites.

**White-bellied Blind Snake (*Argyrophis muelleri*)**

The second species of blind snake found in Singapore is a lot larger, and rarely seen. The [White-bellied Blind Snake](https://www.ecologyasia.com/verts/snakes/white-bellied_blind_snake.htm) grows up to 50 centimetres in length, and is much thicker-bodied compared to the Brahminy Blind Snake, although it too shares the worm-like body, blunt snout, and rudimentary eyes. The dorsal surface is black, while the underside is white.

In Singapore, this species is thought to be restricted to the forests of the Bukit Timah Nature Reserve, Central Catchment Nature Reserve, and Pulau Ubin. Recent sightings have included one found in a drain outside a plant nursery in the [Ulu Sembawang area](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2014-257.pdf), north of Mandai Road, and a carcass found in a drain [near Upper Peirce Reservoir](https://lkcnhm.nus.edu.sg/app/uploads/2017/04/sbr2014-257.pdf).

**Lined Blind Snake (*Ramphotyphlops lineatus*)**

A third species of blind snake has supposedly been recorded in Singapore - the Lined Blind Snake is pinkish brown, with several rows of brown stripes running along the body from the head to the tip of the tail. Like the White-bellied Blind Snake, this is a large species that can reach close to 50 centimetres in length. Here's a photo of an individual [found in Java](https://www.instagram.com/p/BjG7YRTAtPU/).

Several historical accounts list this species as being present in Singapore - for example, Cantor (1847) [includes Singapore as part of its range](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/4085190), and George Albert Boulenger's *Catalogue of the snakes in the British Museum (Natural History)*, published in 1893, lists a specimen that was [reportedly collected in Singapore](https://biodiversitylibrary.org/page/37334174), presumably in the early 19th century, although there are no further details.

However, due to a lack of recent records, the presence of this species here is considered indeterminate for now; it occurs in Peninsular Malaysia, Sumatra, and Java, so it certainly could also occur in Singapore. However, we don't know whether it's extant, if it's gone locally extinct, or if the original specimen was actually collected elsewhere, but was then wrongly labelled as coming from Singapore. Considering that this is a snake that spends almost its entire life underground, finding it (if it exists here) is going to be very challenging.

Soon after a snake detected the presence of prey (presumably via chemosensory cues obtained through tongue-flicking), it initiated a tactile search for individual prey items by rapidly sweeping its head from side to side in an erratic fashion as it progressed forward. Once the snake's head contacted an ant larva or pupa, the snake maneuvered its head so that its mouth was positioned directly over the prey. The snake would then open its mouth to initiate capture and ingestion.\n\nAs for basking, there doesn't seem to be much information on whether these snakes do so; they probably get sufficient heat from the soil."", 'What a bizarre, spammy subreddit.', 'according to your post, pretty sure it was a brahminy.
