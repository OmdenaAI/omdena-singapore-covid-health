Most of them appeared to be above the age of 50.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> Staff members were seen handing out paper slips for people to leave their details so that the clinic could contact them once the shots were available. Nearly 1,000 names were given to the clinic, according to the clinic’s director Dr Seow Yu Jin.\n\n> ""It\'s just been manic and busy ... Some patients, unfortunately, couldn\'t get through on the phone and had to personally come down and there was a long queue outside of the clinic, which I really wasn\'t expecting,"" said Dr Seow.\n\n> \n\n> A fair number of patients enquiring about the Sinovac vaccines appeared to be middle-aged, when CNA visited Wee HealthFirst Medical Clinic at around 2.30pm on Jun 17.

(Photo: Dr Seow Yu Jin)\n\n> He said the clinic is currently waiting for its first batch of Sinovac shots to arrive.\n\n> ""Hopefully they\'ll come tomorrow, (meanwhile) we\'re bedding down the processes, such as finalising patient leaflets tonight and then hopefully, (we can) start vaccinating by the weekend,"" he said.\n\n> He added that the clinic plans to open outside its usual operating hours in order to administer the vaccine.\n\n> Advertisement\n\n> ""For example, this weekend, my clinic runs from 8am to 1pm, however, to deal with this response, we will probably have to open after, from 1pm to about 6pm, purely for vaccinations so that we can just get through the numbers,"" he said.\n\n> It was a similar situation at StarMed Specialist Centre, a clinic in Farrer Park, which has seen an “overwhelming” response since its phone lines opened at 8am on Thursday.\n\n> \n\n> “We already have over 400 bookings for the Sinovac (vaccine) and ... it\'s fair to say that we have seen a larger number of patients who are above the age of 40 making enquiries on the vaccinations,” the centre’s chief executive officer Dr Louis Tan told CNA.\n\n> \n\n> The centre has placed an order of 1,000 doses of the Sinovac vaccine, which was the maximum amount it was allowed, according to Dr Tan. It will be receiving 200 doses, with the first batch expected on Friday.\n\n> To cope with the demand, the clinic intends to bring in more nurses to support its current staff members, he said. If necessary, the clinic may consider extending its operating hours.\n\n> \n\n> When CNA tried calling the other clinics between 3pm and 5pm, most of the phone lines were busy.\n\n> \n\n> Two of them who picked up - iCare Medical and Wellness Clinic, and Chinatown Wellness - told CNA that they were “swamped” with enquiries from the public, but did not give figures.\n\n> Meanwhile, Pinnacle Family Clinic’s Pasir Ris branch told CNA it has received more than 200 enquiries over the phone about the vaccine.\n\n> \n\n> StarMed Specialist Centre at Farrer Park Station Rd. (Photo: Neo Rong Wei)\n\n> StarMed Specialist Centre, which was involved in previous vaccination exercises in migrant worker dormitories, said it will apply the same safety precautions when administering the Sinovac jabs.\n\n> \n\n> ""We will screen patients for recent illnesses, fever, possibility of pregnancy and so forth, these are all standard questions that we would ask patients before we administer the vaccine,"" said Dr Tan.\n\n> \n\n> He added that the clinic was waiting for more guidelines from MOH.\n\n> \n\n> (Table: MOH)\n\n> MOH reiterated on Wednesday that the Sinovac vaccine is not part of the national vaccine programme and those taking the Sinovac jabs will not be covered under the Vaccine Injury Financial Assistance Programme for COVID-19 Vaccination.\n\n> \n\n> The ministry added that those who still wish to receive the vaccine through the Special Access Route should discuss the risks and benefits with their doctors at their selected private healthcare institutions.\n\n> \n\n> Download our app or subscribe to our Telegram channel for the latest updates on the coronavirus outbreak: https://cna.asia/telegram\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', ""At least they are getting vaccinated, there is no need for any backlash as long as we do our part to keep the community safe.

This is how cancer is able to begin and grow in the first place. Researchers are using adjuvants in vaccines to try to fix this problem. An adjuvant is a substance added to a vaccine to improve the body\'s immune response.\n\nCancer cells start from a person\'s own healthy cells. As a result, the cancer cells may not ""look"" harmful to the immune system. The immune system may ignore the cells instead of finding and fighting them.\n\nLarger or more advanced tumors are hard to get rid of using only a vaccine. This is 1 reason why doctors often give a cancer vaccine along with other treatment.\n\nPeople who are sick or older can have weak immune systems. Their bodies may not be able to produce a strong immune response after they receive a vaccine. That limits how well a vaccine works. Also, some cancer treatments may weaken a person\'s immune system. This limits how well the body can respond to a vaccine.\n\nFor these reasons, some researchers think cancer treatment vaccines may work better for smaller tumors or cancer in its early stages.""\n\n&#x200B;\n\nVaccines are itself not curative. A vaccine works by stimulating your own immune system to recognise and attack an ""entity"" deemed foreign in your body. If your immune system is weak or suppressed, a vaccine is basically useless. The issue with cancer is that it is not a foreign body but your own body cell that has turn rogue from mutation. Usually those cells are destroyed by our immune system (i.e. in fact daily we have such cancerous cells that is destroyed by our own immune system) until suppression happens and our immune system ceased to recognise and destroy the cancerous cells, that is when it will manifest pathologically as cancer in our body.', "">Cancer cells often overexpress various genes/proteins or in some cases have cancer specific genes/proteins.\n\nI must remind you that when you have cancer, these cancerous cells with it's associated proteins are already in your body and your own immune system failed to mount an effective response against them.\n\nAnd prior to your cancer manifesting, your immune system is actually getting rid of cancerous cells efficiently on a daily basis. The only logical conclusion is that some things changes your immune system so that your immune system is either now suppressed from responding or it has been weaken to a state of not capable of mounting an effective response.\n\nA vaccine relies on stimulating your immune system. If your immune system is compromised, a vaccine is useless as your immune system cannot mount the required response."", 'You have to consider that in this case, the ""cancer"" is already in your body (i.e. there is at least a tumour in your body, that is why you can gather the cancerous cell and identify the proteins unique to your cancer), and your immune system did not attack these cancerous cells with the proteins in the first place.\n\nIf the immune system is unable to recognise these proteins as foreign, a vaccine with these proteins will be practically ""invisible"" to them.

The same limitation applies to cancer cells. This is the key challenges for ""preventive vaccine"".\n\nThe more critical issue is the fact that cancerous cells are naturally occurring in our body on a daily basis and that it did not manifest as cancer because our own immune system is getting rid of it efficiently on a daily basis (i.e.  preventive vaccine is not required to create the required response, at least not when our immune system is still healthy).

The destruction of “destructive (i.e. cancerous)” cells are 100%, else a cancerous tumour will be growing in your body, even if it start from just one cell. \nBecause cancer cells are derived from mutations, no two cancer cells are exactly alike and a “preventive vaccine” for cancer is very unlikely. This is not unlike the covid-19 vaccine where the efficacy is reduced with every minor variation of the virus spike protein introduced through mutation.\n \nIf you read Moderna’s website carefully, I quote “  One approach is to administer a cancer vaccine that encodes for peptides containing mutations found in their cancer, i.e., to create a personalized cancer vaccine composed of neoantigens unique to a patient’s tumor”. It is obvious they are referring to a curative vaccine tailor-made to cancer tumours already present in your body, not a preventive vaccine, that will have the problem I stated above. \n\nIn such instances, the cancer in your body will already have suppressed your immune system to the point of it being unable to produce an immune-response against it. Just providing more of that same protein unique to your cancer via a vaccine does not address the fundamental problem that your immune system is currently being suppressed by the cancer present in your body and is unable to produce a immune-response against it. \n\nThat is my point.

5,ttheng3810,o9d4h9,Overloading with MUA1168 and MUA1169: will it be too overwhelming?,2021-06-28 12:43:23,nus,21212,4,4,"Hi, incoming CHS freshman here! I am planning to take Mathematics as my primary major and also take one second major in Music programmes (maybe Performance or Composition, not sure yet).

According to the [YST website](https://www.ystmusic.nus.edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/4.-YST-SECOND-MAJORS-OUTLINES-Cohort-2019-and-After.pdf), one prerequisite for me to be eligible to take their second majors is to complete their Access to Major Study modules, i.e. MUA1168 and MUA1169. However, ***both*** of the modules can only be read during Sem. 1 of the coming AY21/22 but they alone have already occupied *8 MCs* for that semester. Since I still have other core modules to clear, I think I have to overload that semester.

According to [NUSMODS](https://nusmods.com/modules/MUA1168/foundational-area-study-1), the modules only have a workload of 2-hour tutorials (but weirdly enough, the two modules do not show up on the LumiNUS webpage). 

Hence, I'd like to ask the following:-
1. Can I overload Y1S1?
1. If I can, can I overload for 28 MCs with MUA1168 and MUA1169?
1. Will it be too overwhelming, or occupy lots of time?
1. Why aren't the two modules listed on the LumiNUS webpage?

Thanks!",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/o9d4h9/overloading_with_mua1168_and_mua1169_will_it_be/,"[""You can't overload on y1s1. Only from y1s2 onwards"", ""You can overload in Y1S1, up to 23 MCs except for those in DDPs and some other special programmes like E-Scholars where they can go up to 27 MCs. However, most mods are 4 MCs each, so if you are a non-DDP student, you are pretty much almost prevented from overloading, unless you somehow take a 1-3 MC module of course. However, you can request to increase this maximum to beyond the default value but only after Y1S1. So regardless, you still essentially cannot overload in Y1S1 in general unless you are a DDP student.\n\nThis means for Q1, the answer is no.\n\nFor Q2, the answer is yes based on how I interpreted your question. If you could overload in Y1S1 and you could extend the limit like in sems after Y1S1, then you could extend the limit to 28 MCs or more and take those modules. Of course, to reiterate, you are pretty much prevented from overloading and you cannot extend the limit in Y1S1 unless you have a DDP so the first part is false. But the statement is still vacuously true so I guess the answer is still yes even if the first part is false.\n\nFor Q3, I never took those modules so I don't know, you're gonna need somebody else to reply you on this one. Maybe that person you did not actually reply to.\n\nFor Q4, sometimes the module coordinators/lecturers don't post the module on Luminus, sometimes until as late as the start of the sem. Just chill first.\n\nFor the extra Q5 you added in your reply to the other person, for a second major, I would generally recommend starting as soon as possible, even in Y1S1, but it depends. Some of the module pre-requisite chains are de facto restrictive in how you take them, and yet you have to take more modules in a second major so it is generally better to start early. For example, some modules are only available in 1 sem in an AY, let's say WLOG sem 1, but it's a chain of four modules, so you must take one in each of Y1S1, Y2S1, Y3S1, and Y4S1, in order to complete all of the four in the chain. If you started in Y2S1, then you cannot complete the chain by the time you graduate in Y4. But of course, it really depends on the pre-req chains. For example, the modules may be available every sem, or only one sem but the sems alternate, so even if the chain is longer than the four module chain above, say six modules (though I don't think this exists), you can take one in each of Y2S1, Y2S2, Y3S1, Y3S2, Y4S1, Y4S2, and still graduate in time even though you started as late as Y2S1. If you want to take this up, you probably know your second major's pre-req chains, so you could probably determine this by planning out all your mods.\n\nIf you really must take it in Y1S1, my recommendation is, if possible, drop some of your CHS core modules and take it in a later sem.

There's just so many things to look at. So many terms, schemes, stocks, REITs, ETFs, banks, interests, your whole laundry list of things to learn and keep track of. You have to be a mercenary if you want the best for yourself, always looking out for the next best thing.

Granted, you can just give it all up because no good thing comes for free right, you've got to work for it, but there seems to be infinite pressure to be always in the chase.

How do you guys cope? I'm trying to have only three accounts open, right now I'm at POSB, Stan Chart, and Singlife, but with Stan Chart tanking I have to consider closing that one and starting afresh someplace else.

Looking at how stuffed other people's wallets are as they sift through for the perfect one for the cashier is quite daunting.

But the 2 most important steps are:\n\n1) Cut down on expenses such as buying expebsive clothes every month, etc\n\n2) upskill yourself so that you can go for better paying jobs.\n\nThen you can start investing in etfs, etc with a higher disposable amount.', ""In my opinion, all the things you mentioned in your post can be simplified. If I try to put it more simply (at risk of understating some risks or investment characteristics), you can lump your first paragraph into the investments umbrella. \n\nStocks, reits, etfs are different mediums of investments. A REIT is a real estate investment trust and gives you income-like returns. I.e higher dividend rate where you get more income from holding them through dividends.\n\nA stock, on the other hand, is owning a part of a company. An ETF (exchange traded fund) is a fund that buy multiple stocks that could be based on industry or investment themes (think electric vehicles, energy, etc). Because the ETF is a portfolio of stocks, it is likely more diversified than buying a single stock. \n\nReasons for preferences for ETF over single stocks could be diversification, which is a protection against ignorance, or lack of time and/or expertise to stock pick.\n\nDon't be so fixated on knowing everything about stocks, reits, or etfs. It gets very overwhelming. What many investors do is to choose a highly diversified etf like VOO or SPY and grow your portfolio at the same rate as the market. Don't be too worried about outperforming the market. The power of compounding means that even at 7-8% growth rate, you will double your money in about 10 years. \n\nAlternatively, you can try a robo advisor like StashAway which makes investment decisions for you based on your risk level, which you can set. \n\nOn using cards for miles, you don't need a gazillion cards. In all honesty, 2-3 cards will do. I'm sure we don't need to squeeze out every single bit of extra rewards. Weighed against time spent managing the different cards and bank accounts, I believe have a few but good set of cards are enough. For example, online shopping has dbs woman's world card and paywave has preferred Platinum by uob. Outside of that, either Premier miles by citi or prvi miles by uob is sufficient. \n\nKeep it simple.

You could become 'rich' in a matter of weeks if you're into the WSB casino kind of thing (lol don't). If you're looking at years or decades, you could do crypto, you could put money in tech startups and hope a few of them make it big in the end, or start your own business.

Personal finance, when it\'s all set up properly, is invisible and above all *boring*. It shouldn\'t be inspiring any emotions - it is simply the mechanism you use to determine whether you *can* do something, whether you\'re on track *for* something.\n\nWhere the emotions come in is - *what* you want to do with life. I personally adopt a minimal approach where I go in to check once every other months or so to make sure that I am on track and I do a review every quarter/half a year to see what kind of other options are out there in the market and if they align with my plan. My investments/savings/salary/any other expenses are all automated and routed to where they should be. It may take some time to set it up and coming up with a plan that suits you but it is worth the time and effort once you get it running. \n\nTLDR: Have a realistic plan.

So that should be your only focus if moving up status is your foremost concern as a young person. Everything else, while also good to do, is secondary. Those are not going to push you up slightly in the long-run. If you are already in the workforce, don't let all these secondary stuff take away focus and attention on the primary goal, and so should ideally be passive. I know this sounds unconstructive, but let me give some examples.\n\nA person who saves and invest $500 per month with a $3K/month gross salary has to need 4x more on their monthly investments to match someone who saves and invest $2,000 per month on a $7K/month gross salary. Necessities spending don't differ too much between people who make $3K/month and $7K/month, which is why life is more expensive for people who make less. I used $7K/month as an example because your take-home salary is 82.9% as compared to 80% as CPF cut-off is $6K/month. If you make $10K/month, your take-home is 88%, meaning more liquid income. You get the drift.\n\nSay if you can save $3K/month, even if you allocate most of it to ETF on monthly basis, your gain with ETF on an absolute basis is going to beat a whiz who can generate 15%/annum return consistently with $500-$1K/month investible monies through day trading as their side-job. There's hardly any individual who can consistently generate 15%/annum return in long run. If they have such an ability, I don't think they will work in a job which gives them only $500-$1K/month savings.\n\nAll these miles and cashback credit cards are all side stuff. You need to spend to unlock value. In the grand scheme of things, unless you are spending lots of money (counter-intuitive on spend within means) or pinching pennies due to low income, it's not going to push you up a status. I personally only use miles cards and don't sweat about it.\n\nWhen your main income is great, trust me, there will naturally be more options opened up to you for higher-return on lower-risk brain-dead products which are not availed to everyone in the market.\n\nSo if you have time, spend more time on upskilling, improving interpersonal skills, and networking with people who can help you either with your career or business. There are more people who are rich just because they are good networkers as compared to people who are competent at their job.

it’s week 9 of y1s1 and i rly just feel like my content knowledge is only at week 3 and idk if i’m feeling bummed or drained or what 

prior to uni i was set on studying accountancy but now that i managed to get in to accountancy i feel so...... for the past 2 weeks everyday i just drag myself to class especially for modules like business law and accounting 1 heck i feel so darn hopeless in these 2 modules because people are just shooting off answers and i just can’t process anything i feel so overwhelmed and want to cry 

also, i feel like i shouldn’t feel this way but to me, online classes (business law) feels more draining because my head, eye sockets and ear drums feel so pain after 4h to the point i can’t study anymore after the lesson because i just can’t function anymore (my prof always delay the class from 3h to 4h) sitting in front of my laptop listening to my prof. my prof is a nice guy going the extra mile for us but here i am complaining about my lethargy, i feel like an unappreciative prick but i really just can’t focus past the 2h mark and my aches start to appear, i get fidgety and tend to use my phone and not pay attention because i’m so tired 

i’m not doing well academically. i did below average for FM mid terms (mean is 11 but i got a single digit out of 20) and for accounting 1 idek what i was doing so i’m probably flunking that too 

idk man i just feel so hopeless and drained with the slap of projects and deadlines after mid terms and individual assignments. i am generally a positive and happy person but i feel like i’ve been in this unproductive, sad slump for the past 1 week so i feel like i really need to get this off my chest and possibly let out my negative emotions 

if anyone is willing to offer me any advice or opinions i’d gladly take them because at this point idek what i’m doing i’m just living each day as it is",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/jaraf3/advice_neededmy_feelings_of_being_overwhelmed_and/,"['Year 3 accountancy student here.\n\n>prior to uni i was set on studying accountancy\n\nI don\'t know if this applies to all other universities (or even other majors in NTU), but I find that the syllabus is very rigorous. There have only been 2-3 times in the past 3 years where I could tell the syllabus was designed for breadth and not depth. \n\nWith that in mind, whatever you want to study before uni, it is likely you will start hating the major once you start studying it, because things are just difficult. At least for most people.\n\nI took POA in secondary school and my diploma was also accountancy. Even for me, I feel that the business and accounting concepts are a big step up from poly. I really feel for anyone who have not had any exposure to business or accountancy to university, because it must be *absolute shit*.\n\n> my prof is a nice guy going the extra mile for us but here i am complaining about my lethargy, i feel like an unappreciative prick\n\nI think it\'s nice that you recognize such behaviours, but also\n\n>my prof always delay the class from 3h to 4h\n\nI think this is being on the inconsiderate side, especially because these are online classes. Give feedback at the end of the semester, not to target your prof, but to ask the school to reconsider how online classes are being held. It should not be a 1:1 translation from offline classes, because like you mentioned it\'s hard to concentrate past a certain point.\n\n>i’m not doing well academically. i did below average for FM mid terms\n\nI spent my first semester feeling like crap, because I took quite a long time off of studying and I was quite convinced that I\'ve lost my mojo. I did below average for an economics mid-term, but looking back I\'m almost glad that happened, because it really showed me it\'s important to have faith in the bell curve. I ended up clearing up whatever knowledge I wasn\'t sure of and got an A- for economics. It\'s not *the best*, but going from below average to A- was more than I expected.\n\n>idk man i just feel so hopeless and drained with the slap of projects and deadlines after mid terms and individual assignments.\n\nIt\'s going to be cliche but everyone feels this. The key is to not give up and soldier through, because it\'s the people who give up that will end up on the left side of the bellcurve. Every semester is going to be like this, so the faster you can get to grips with this, the better.\n\nComing into NTU, I was really concerned that there are going to be elites everywhere I go, but my past 2 years in school has shown me that it\'s not true. Yes, I\'m no longer at the top, but if I was good enough to be able to purposefully come into NTU (as in, I did well enough to secure a spot based on merit alone), then I\'m good enough, and at least whatever study strategy I had will translate and work. The key is to be comfortable in being uncomfortable from feeling like you know nothing, that everyone else is much smarter than you.\n\nIt\'s very easy for me to say all this since I know whatever I\'m doing works, and, well, frankly you don\'t, being in Y1S1, so I really understand if you read this and think, ""Well fuck me, what use is all this information?"" Just try your best, know that everyone else is feeling shitty also, and hopefully you will see for yourself what I\'m saying is true when you get your Y1S1 results.', ""I'm a yr 1 com sci student and I feel exactly how you feel been trying my best to keep up with mods but am still so far behind.

11,redtealeaves,njw8a8,Call from MOH,2021-05-24 19:56:12,askSingapore,44614,29,96,"This evening I got a call from MOH stating that I was a close contact of a Covid-19 patient. I was unable to verify the legitimacy today as the MOH hotline was busy, but the call did not ask for personal information (the person on the line did know my name, IC and address).

So I am to expect a call from a CISCO officer within 48 hours to talk about which hotel I will be posted to. I would like to ask what are the follow up procedures after this? Such as what will the officer do, do I need to wait until their call to do a swab test, and what can I expect from the quarantine order?

Sorry for asking so many as I am only 18 and am nervous about this as I am the only one in my family to receive this call. Any help will be appreciated!

UPDATE (if anyone would like to refer to this or something): Some of my friends also experienced the same situation as some of the commenters, where no body arrived to pick them up. For me, someone did pick me up the next day. 

In my experience, the shuttle bus picked up a few others also going the same hotel. The check in process was easy, and they asked me if I have a preference for Chinese, Malay, Indian or Western food. I have yet to take my swab test however, but will be proceeding with it tomorrow.

> This encapsulates how i felt like at Ground Zero today due the Bubble Tea Shops temporarily halting businesses during this Circuit Breaker period. As a Grabfood Rider, 8.45pm i received order to collect bubble tea from Blk 461 Yishun Ave 6, at that time, i was actually pretty far away near to Khatib MRT, was actually surprised ""wah! so far away get order there"", as soon as got closer, i noticed a whole stretch of vehicles and bicycles and PMDs and PABs. So there i was at Ground Zero.
> 
> Firstly, It was the Liho Staff, They were overwhelmed with non-stop orders and no way to stop it from coming in. There were only 2 staffs working in that outlet and over 400 cups of orders + about 100 grabriders waiting there.. IF there ever was a time when keep social distance failed, it was there and then. (100+ riders confined to a pretty small space)
> 
> Secondly, GRAB itself (cannot speak for Deliveroo, but i heard Panda also has this same issue), they were uncontactable, the Liho staffs were trying to call in to GRAB hotline (majority of the riders there were grab riders) to tell them that they were truly overwhelmed and they couldn't get through to grab.
> 
> Thirdly, The Riders themselves looking for Rice Bowls (i am pretty sure the Waterway fight also is along this stance) our system is pretty bad actually, say, we have an order we couldn't complete, if we were to cancel it on our end, grab will not compensate us if we were to report it basically ""You cancelled, not our pasal"" However, if we were to call into grab and ask them to cancel on our behalf, we will be compensated for our time and effort, but, being uncontactable, most of us really have no choice but to cancel, some of us waited almost 2 hours for our orders and customers mostly refuse to cancel (mine was basically :teary eyed: please don't cancel, i don't mind waiting) but to no avail cause that outlet was beginning to run out of time and ingredients so they had to close their shop at 10.50pm. all other orders were rejected, i think over 80 of us didn't manage to get any orders complete, and since we can't contact grab, we basically forfeit our efforts there (2 hours waiting, no compensation)

13,throwthewholemeaway-,o0e9u7,How much have you had to pay for STD testing after a rape?,2021-06-15 21:23:59,askSingapore,44614,64,258,"***TLDR; I was raped, tried to get medical help for my injuries had a police ‘pink form’ exam done on me unexpectedly and without the said ‘pink form’, and which included STD testing, and was made to pay $600. Is this normal procedure / an expected cost to pay for having been raped?***

I was raped (I’m not even going to say ‘assaulted’ anymore, because it was clearly rape) a little less than 2 weeks ago. I think this is day 12…? Anyway, my police case has been a mess of my IO taking half statements, giving contradictory advice, and closing my case prematurely without telling me, even though he had told me not to tell him certain things during my statement, as I would be able to tell them to the CID officer that would handle my case. 

My case was never referred, because somehow, me trying to push this guy that I’d just met (so it’s not like I was in a relationship with this dude for him to test the boundaries of my indent) away, crying, telling him he was hurting me, and him acknowledging that he was, his deliberate infliction of additional hurt unto me after him acknowledging it (with the intention to make me cry even harder — so he clearly did not stop when he realised I was crying, because he wanted me to), and the use of force to make me do things that I physically was in too much pain or too disoriented (from being choked) to do, didn’t raise any sexual assault alarm bells with the IO who took my statement. The police had closed my case on the day that I made my statement, even when I was advised to wait for a follow-up, because no offences were found from all of *that*. 

It’s been impossible to seek any medical help. The GP didn’t want to see me for my injuries. I went there first because I didn’t want to have to make a report. But because they were injuries from a sexual assault, the GP told me to go to KKH’s UOGC instead. That meant needing to make a report in order to be seen at the hospital for sexual assault. I asked the IO about what I should do for medical treatment at the UOGC, and he said to just give them my report number. I ended up being denied medical assistance completely at UOGC (couldn’t even be registered) because I didn’t have a pink police form — I wasn’t aware that I needed the form. The IO had to call UOGC and discuss something, because I’d been inconsolable over the phone over the fact that no medical staff was willing to see me for my injuries from the assault. I wasn’t even asking for an exam or anything, just someone to talk through and explain the pains I felt and the pain that I was still feeling even 8 days after. 

I don’t know what was discussed between the IO and UOGC. Honestly I was so distressed at the time that I remember my consult with the doctors just as faintly as I remember the rape. But they didn’t really end up consulting for what I wanted, and spent most of the time doing this “police pink form” exam on me, except without the form itself, checking for abrasions, tears and lacerations, putting different swabs in me. I had to get my blood drawn as well. And I ended up being hit with a $500+ worth of checking and testing fees because they did the exam without the form. 

Is this normal? To be given the “pink form” exam I wasn’t expecting, but without the form, and then be made to pay $500+ for a post-rape STI screening? Would it have been covered if the police had given me the form? Or would I still have had to pay this large amount? Does anyone know?

Unfortunately, the police aren’t giving me any answers about this. I’m not sure who I could raise my concerns about the bill with as well. I’m sure if I go to KKH, they’d say it was because I didn’t have the form, because the IO didn’t think I had experienced an assault. I’d try to claim it under my company’s medical insurance, but the diagnosis on my documents from the exam don’t state “sexual assault”, only “sti screen”, and routine screenings for STIs / STDs are exclusions, so I can’t do that either.

I work part-time, school part-time. I’m paying for my own medication and therapy for severe clinical depression and PTSD and ED, which chalks up to nearly $1k per month, nearly 80% of my take-home income. My family don’t know about the rape yet and I don’t think I’ll be telling them anytime soon, so I’m incurring these costs on my own. 

So I’m just wondering if there’ll be any way to recoup some of the $500+ lost to being a victim of rape. If anyone knows, or has any suggestions, hope you can help me out. 

TIA

What does it even mean rough sex? Is the officer present to justify that it was rough sex instead of rape? If he is not there and he is not the victim, how can he concludes that? Have they perhaps reached out to the rapist and conclude it as such? I seriously want to question the standard of the case being handled here.\n\nJust because you met a guy and he forced onto you is consider as consensual. No mean no. If he continue to push himself onto you then it’s a rape. Nothing else.\n\nI hope you cope well and have your case handled much better tomorrow. And hope the guy get the justice he deserved. Stay strong', 'Yeah, unfortunately that happened. It’s not the first time that someone has been rough with me, but it’s definitely the first time that the boundaries that were agreed upon prior, weren’t adhered to. \n\nI’ve had past partners who were almost just as rough, but they’ve also been the most respectful ones too. They’ve been pretty stand-up dudes and honestly have respected my body more than I respect it myself — I’ve had them tell me that there’s a difference between not minding something and enjoying something, and that sex should be both parties doing what they enjoy as opposed to one party ‘not minding’ it just because their partner enjoys it. So it’s really no excuse at all for someone to think that they have the right to test and breach boundaries, just because it’s rough sex. That’s not rough sex, that’s just predatory. \n\nThankfully I’ve already been attending therapy for depression and PTSD related to my past assaults (prolonged molest incidents, and another one where someone pushed me up against a wall from behind, wrapped his leg around mine and rubbed his genitals into my butt-crack — i don’t even know what to call this one tbh, it’s just so weird) that’ve been giving me mad hypervigilance and hopeless worldview issues. Honestly it was my poor coping methods for these traumas that led to why I ended up meeting this complete stranger for sex in the first place. So I still have a ton of self-blame over putting myself in that position to be raped in the first place. It really is overwhelming and can mess us up so much. \n\nI hope you’ve been coping well with your PTSD from your assault. Sending hugs back.', 'No problem.

For some reason the doctors just sprung the kit and tests on me (exactly as per police procedure aka the ‘pink form’), which I didn’t ask for because I know it’s also mostly useless in terms of DNA evidence and such since it was already day 9 + I had already booked STI screenings for myself elsewhere (cheaper haha). \n\nIn short, they pink-formed me without the pink form, despite me already noting that i wasn’t there to be pink-formed, and then gave me an itemised bill for everything done according to the pink form, because they (for some unbeknownst reason) chose to do it on me anyway despite knowing that I didn’t have one and wasn’t there for one.

Got my results within the week.', 'I don’t know if they reached out to the rapist. They closed my case within the same day, so i don’t think they even did. I also only knew the guy’s online contacts like his tele ID / online site username, so they wouldn’t have been able to contact his mobile because I didn’t have one to give. Plus I think the rapist would have sent me threatening messages over the online site, if they had contacted him about me reporting him for assault. I haven’t received one yet, so probably they didn’t. \n\nThank you for validating that it’s rape. I’ve really been needing to hear it. So far I’ve just been saying it to myself, for myself, because the police and medical staff so far haven’t believed that that’s what happened. I’ve even been reading the penal code, online SG lawyer resources, anything that I can get my hands on to see what constitutes rape and assault in singapore, and why my case wasn’t either of those. I thought that maybe there was something in Singapore law that was different from the general consensus of what’s considered rape in other parts of the world, that would explain why they said it wasn’t a rape or assault at all. I’ve honestly been questioning my reality and feeling like everyone else knows why it isn’t rape or assault, except me (perhaps because i’m stupid).\n\nI hope tomorrow goes well too. I don’t think I can emotionally take one more person of authority minimising my assault to just “rough sex”. \n\n(On a side note, the IO was aware that the person who assaulted me was into BDSM. Although I did also tell him that I did not know the guy would turn up with BDSM stuff, because we didn’t discuss it, but I also still kind of went with it anyway, so maybe my IO thought I was into that kind of thing too and perceived my statement as just a BDSM thing that got too rough. He also kept referring to it as “the 50 shades of grey kind of stuff”. And also brought up how his neighbour did partner swaps where the neighbour and his wife would swap partners with another couple, with their son in the living room. It was a bit weird tbh, he never once referred to what happened as “assault”, just “50 shades of grey”.)', 'hmm i’m not sure what the plan is but i’m supposed to be speaking to someone in CID. i’m guessing that if any of the info gathered from the kit is used during investigations, maybe i may be able to claim it? my AWARE counsellor has also recommended emailing the hospital’s finance department but i’m not sure whether to wait for my case to progress and then see how it goes, or to try my luck with the hospital haha. if you have any suggestions though, i’m all ears!', 'thank you! 🙏🏻 do the doctors there tell you during the consult about what version of the tests / screenings you should do? i was wracking my brains few weeks back trying to figure out which ones i was supposed to be going for hahaha because some conditions have a few tests', 'It must have been very difficult and traumatic for you to have undergone what happened and had to deal with an IO who was not empathetic. \n\nI believe every IO is different and the one handling your case probably let his own values and beliefs cloud his judgment. I cannot fathom why he does not even dare to use the term “rape”, as you had perceived the incident to be, or more neutral terms such as “alleged” or “assault” whatever. Calling it “50 shades of grey kind of stuff” is just unprofessional on top of trivialising the issue (given that in 50 shades it was not rape). \n\nIt pains me further that the IO had to bring in his own personal experiences, which were not only irrelevant to the case (what was he trying to even say?) but unprofessional (so what if others were doing it? It should not discount the fact of what you had experienced). Furthermore, it would seem that he was trying to normalise the matter (i.e. don’t make a mountain out of a mole hill, my neighbours had even freakier sex y’know). \n\nI truly hope things go better from here on with your meeting with his female colleague and supervisor.

I’m overwhelmed by the support and upvotes. It was a very difficult subject for me to talk about but I am glad that I did. Some comments did bring up some details and I’ll share it here for ease of reading - I gave birth when I’m 14 in 1998. It was a sexual assault case, hence I don’t want things to go viral as the truth may be hurtful to my daughter and the attention will bring up bad memories for my family.

I gave up my daughter for adoption close to 20 years ago due to personal reasons. I was not in a good financial situation to support her.

I think in Singapore adoption is anonymous and it is not possible to request for adoption records.

Are there any ways where I can get in touch? I put myself on a few DNA tests, e.g 23andMe but never gotten a match.

Is there an online forum where I can post details to see if anyone gets in touch?

I just wanted to see how she is doing and hoping to get to know her, if she wants to. I am not trying to break up her current family. I also hope to share health history in the family as that’s often something adoptees don’t have info on that may be crucial to their health in future.

16,Dizzy_Peanut_9167,ne6uor,"WhatsApp message going around allegedly from Director of Infectious Disease Research, NCID. Legit?",2021-05-17 12:39:53,singapore,378640,167,709,"*Important message from Dr David Lye, Director of Infectious Disease Research @NCID:*  Our current status is likely more dangerous than just before circuit breaker last year.  2020 was bad because of the huge outbreak in dormitories among migrant workers which could be contained by locking down albeit with a lot of resources.  The many cases with no linkage now suggest the spread to community from the Changi Airport outbreak may be wide and far.  40-50% of infected have no symptoms and can be equally infectious. 10% can get sick enough to need oxygen.  Yes we have effective vaccines and treatment, and expanded testing capacity but against us is the new mutant strains that infected TTSH and Changi Airport staff despite masks and vaccination.  This is serious. We should all do much more beyond what government dictates. (1) Stay home (2) Avoid crowded places (3) Avoid big groups (4) Form your small social bubble who must be committed to the bubble not to socialise beyond the bubble; for many this is your immediate family (5) Wear mask over mouth and nose including walking in parks (6) Get vaccinated, the TTSH outbreak shows not enough vulnerable old people get vaccinated  If you want to keep your family safe, you need to listen and do the above. If a country is overwhelmed like India, many will die including children and young people. Sick people cannot get a bed and dead bodies cannot get cremated or buried.  My colleagues and I do not want to see you in NCID or any of the public hospitals.  Please feel free to share by copying into your own social media wall or WhatsApp groups.

Policymaking inevitably involves (often controversial) trade-offs between different values, priorities, and interests, including considerations related to public opinion, expected health outcomes, intervention cost, economic costs, etc etc. \n\n2. However, the priority of public health experts would be to prioritise public health outcomes (over economic costs etc). The difficulty for public health experts is in ""[coordinating public health values and priorities with other values and priorities in society](https://academic.oup.com/eurpub/article/28/suppl_3/1/5149575)"".\n\n3. The role of the government is to strike a balance when policymaking. \n\n4. The above does not consider questions like how public health concerns or decisions should be communicated. It does not consider the risk of the evidence-based approach is that approaches change over time and [""early pronouncements often need to be revisited, and frequently revised, as new discoveries are made.""](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/370/6515/385) This creates a problem: [on the one hand, public health officials must communicate clearly and authoritatively. However, if they are too certain of a specific fact that is later discovered to be untrue, that breach of trust can easily open a crack that detractors can exploit.](https://carnegieendowment.org/2020/07/16/unmasking-truth-public-health-experts-coronavirus-and-raucous-marketplace-of-ideas-pub-82314) For example: r/singapore in April last year where people complained that the decisions making the mask mandatory came at too short notice. \n\n5. Because of the above concerns, I don\'t think it\'s surprising that public health / doctors would propose more restrictive guidelines. That is their role.\n\n6. The comment I\'m replying to starts with a premise and builds a whole theory on it, concluding that it ""might suggest that medical experts have given up attempting to convince the government to follow their medical advice, and they have been left with no choice but to directly inform the public"" and ""medical experts no longer believe that the government will act based on scientific advice"". The problem is that there\'s a spectrum between ""not acting on scientific advice"" (which can include the views of political scientists / economists), ""adopting some aspects of scientific advice"" and ""fully adopting scientific advice"". \n\n7. There\'s also the problem that scientists disagree with each other. Amid competing scientific advice, what should a government do? Remember that any choice can be criticised.\n\n8. There\'s also a difference between what a government can tell people to do, and what people should do (of their own accord). This looks like a guy telling people to do the latter, and I don\'t see it contradicting with the government\'s position.\n\nAnother aspect is that I\'m reading this comment in r/singapore and I often see comments extrapolating to achieve any anti-government reading of events. I just hope that this comment provides a contrasting viewpoint. \n\nLast note: I found this article instructive:\n\n> [Of course a government official who doesn\'t carefully consider public health advice is irresponsible. But so is an official who follows that advice slavishly, without balancing it against other priorities. / I hate it when officials claim to be adhering strictly to The Science.

The virus variant have caught all the departments so ""off guard""(despite the public outrage for months) that it\'s every man for himself right now, so people are leaking things left and right to warn people\n2. This is leaked on purpose in order to get everyone into the mindset of ""vaccine will protect us from the new variant"", spurring all the kiasee people to rush for it now instead of being afraid of side effects.\n\nI strongly believe it\'s the latter, as the entire new variant clusterfuck unfolds, it\'s seems like government already knew it was going to happen and was just biding their time.

17,PC26678837,n8dr28,Saw the amount of support there was on the sexual assault post and wanted to share my own experience with racism.,2021-05-09 20:59:23,singapore,378640,389,1651,"Hello my Singaporean friends.

To preface, I'm not trying to compare anything to OP's experience being sexually assaulted. It just inspired me to share my story because of the overwhelming support I saw given there.

I'm a Singaporean Indian male. Parents and grandparents were both Singaporeans as well. Needless to say, as a Singaporean I should deserve to be treated as one and not unfairly right? As it says in our very pledge "" regardless of race, language or religion.""

I can't help but disagree. Throughout my entire life ( I was born in the 90s) I've been treated differently or patronisingly because of my race. It honestly feels like a crutch. Back when I was a kid, mother tongue was more of the norm so most of my friends were always speaking in broken English. It sucked because I can't speak Tamil and the Indian kids in my school bullied me badly and exiled me from their friendship. Needless to say the other races would call me ""apu neh neh"" or ""dirty/smelly"" and I literally got beat up bad on multiple occasions to which my mother would complain to the school and the principal gave 0 fucks. It was that bad.

I've been denied so many job applications because ""they prefer Chinese"" and I do understand the bigger crowd is the Chinese demographic here but that is part of the disadvantage for me. It sucks so bad that despite how talented I am I never got to try things because of my race. In secondary school I had a teacher use me as a example for so many stereotypes that didn't even apply to me. I had him straight up laugh in my face when I wanted to be a class representative (because I already struggled with believing I was worth anything so I wanted to prove to myself that I had what it takes). Not even a chance given. Immediately shut down. I cried and wanted to commit suicide on SO many occasions because of him.

I see other issues being taken so seriously in Singapore but then even til today there is RAMPANT racism. Seriously. I shit you not almost everywhere I go, no matter how nice the people are I'm bound to hear racist comments. I personally believe this stems from our parents generation. They push their beliefs onto their children and sometimes I can't really blame the Chinese people for saying the shit they say because it's so normalised. They don't even know it's wrong. It's not like they're bad people but they're just simply ignorant when it comes to this. It sounds very accusatory I know, but it's honestly an issue.

I remember there was a post about a foreign exchange student who did the ""chinese eyes"" and everyone was outraged saying Singapore absolutely does not welcome racists. In my heart I was honestly scoffing because a lot of these ""woke"" Gen Z people jump on the bandwagon to become a victim. Let's not sugar coat it, these days in spite of a lot of people suffering from mental health/assault etc. There is a HUGE fetishisation of being a victim. People just want in the sympathy for things they don't really suffer from or doesn't really affect them. Not saying it's right what the lady did, but how does that actually affect any of these people in Singapore. Majority of them here are still Chinese. Let's just put it into perspective for a bit:

Chinese people being racist towards Malays

Malays being racist towards Chinese.

at the end of the day, you have to understand Chinese people in Singapore are the majority. It's shitty to be racist on both ends but the one's actually taking the damage are the minorities.

In a class full of chinese and malay kids I was the only Indian in most cases. Same when I worked part time jobs, I'm always the only Indian. People being racist affects me the most because I bear the full load of it from multiple people who unforunately share the same mindset whether they're good people or not. A lot of it is deep rooted in ignorance and taught by ignorant older generation parents.

&#x200B;

Another shitty thing that these people do, they decide for you what's racist or isnt'. I remember getting upset as a teen at my friends because one of them said ""apu neh neh"" and I confronted him. Every one of his friends immediately got defensive/aggressive about it and said ""aiyah it's not even a bad word, is you dont know"". Like what the fuck? If I, an Indian, feel offended by a derogatory word directed towards people of my race, you have the audacity to tell me that I shouldn't be offended by it? This shit has happened on THOUSANDS of occasion I can't even keep count. How many times I got annoyed/upset by racist remarks and I had someone tell me I'm overreacting.

Controversial opinion: (Maybe I'm looking too much into this one)

Last year I told a malay friend of mine, if you look at ""Singapore ads"" as a foreigner, you'd think this was China. When I went to the cinema on multiple occasions there were 0 mainstream ads (at least from what I saw) that showed ""Singapore"" as a country with all the races. It's mostly chinese actors/actresses even if it was English speaking. But to my surprise, they had an ad about drugs and theft and it just so happened the thief was malay and the drug-addict was Indian. Like I said I might be reading too much into it but it feels like shit when you're already going through so much and so insecure and you see these things. They fuck with your mind.

&#x200B;

Everywhere I go it's so normal for me to hear at some point jokes like.

""Eh that Indian guy your father ah?""\*turns off the lights\* ""Eh OP where you go sia can only see your teeth?""

etc etc. It's not just ""a few people"" or ""the people I hang out with"". Recently after enlisting in NS I witnessed the same thing going down. How brazen some of these people are with their racism.

Don't even get me started with dating. I've had multiple girlfriends, all races. It doesn't matter to me. But whenever I was with a chinese girl I'd get the DIRTIEST stares I've ever seen in my life from other chinese guys or older generation uncles/aunties.

The worst one so far:At one point I had an aunty come up to my then-girlfriend and said in mandarin (yes i do speak a bit of mandarin):

Are you okay?

Are you sure you want to be with this guy?

You know if your baby come out ""hei hei"" not beautiful.

This bitch kept going and going. And my girlfriend didn't even say anything back to her I was just walking with my jaw on the floor and I absolutely couldn't believe this was happening to me.

&#x200B;

This fucking happened this year lol. In 2021. This is the reality sadly. I had a Korean girlfriend at one point, and one of my chinese male friends (Nice guy, just simply fucking ignorant) said to me after seeing her picture:

""Huh? When you met, she knows you're Indian anot?"" like it was some sort of disease lmao. What the fuck? How would I have been with her without her knowing my race. The concept of this relationship was so unreal to this guy. This is a perfect example of the ignorance most people have. They're not bad people they're just so ignorant.

I also had multiple people speak down to me as if I can't speak English. It was extremely condescending.

I had an autistic friend in school and whenever he heard Indian people speaking he'd just start laughing uncontrollably and not when other races spoke. How is it that an autistic person is wired to react this way? Basically our society's perspective on Indians here.

I worked on an occasion with an entirely chinese staff. And they had a secret dinner entirely without me. I found out by accident when I was looking for someone at work and I opened the door to their dinner and they all just looked so dumbstruck when they saw me.

From the constant bullying, denial of basic things and harassment. I just can't believe nothing's being done about this in 2021.

Something Indians do because of this that I can't stand:

Indian guys who develop a ""Chinese singlish accent"".

Singlish is Singlish. Chinese people sound chinese , Malays sound malay, Indians sound Indian when they speak it. You can tell easily right? There's a group of Indian guys out there who are so affected by this racism that they try to disassociate from being Indian. I guarantee you have that one Indian friend. I saw this Indian guy wearing a hypebeast looking outfit with the korean glasses and centre parting hair and his accent sounded so forced chinese I almost died from second hand embarassment. But this is the state of how things are based on how normalised racism is here. A lot of the Indians just accept it. They can't do anything about it either way right?

PS: There might be some hint of anger/hatred or insinuated accusations but I assure you I don't bear any hatred for my Chinese friends. In fact the ones I hang out with are actually amongst the kindest most sweet people I have ever met. It's just the reality of the struggle I face as an Indian in my own home. I deserve to feel like I'm entitled to the same thing every other Singaporean because I'm not just a colour. I'm a human being. I am absolutely not justifying the racism that chinese people face from Indians and Malays either.

&#x200B;

I just made this post to show you that from my days as a kid up til today I'm still heavily affected by racism and it's not just a few bad apples. It's a deep rooted in a lot of people and we really need to teach our kids in the future so they know better. I really hope this gets some traction so I can hear perspectives from others because I was hesitating posting this for the longest time out of fear but I have to get this off my chest.

&#x200B;

UPDATE: I see a lot of people DMing me and asking stupid questions in the thread so I just wanted to point something out.  


Me saying I had a chinese/korean gf at one point was to show the racist reactions I got from my chinese peers indicating shock at an Indian being able to do such things. I don't understand how some people can look at it as a ""flex"" and the only way I imagine that happening is if they hold races above another which I DONT. That's why I don't see it as a flex. So those people who are making such accusations, stop projecting.   


Also, unrelated. I never had an indian gf because when I was younger the Indian girls treated me like shit and left me out of circles of friendships. As I grew older, indian girls were very scarce and I'm not seeking women by race. It just so happened that the girls I dated were chinese/malays etc. For you to come after me for ""not dating indian girls"" is bullshit gaslighting and you have no understanding of how things work. I have dated Indian girls in the past years fyi, it just didn't work out. Stop saying stupid things without knowing context.

They never really understood it though, till some of them went overseas to study and faced it first hand. \n\nDating Chinese girls on the other hand was a bloody nightmare.

Good thing none of those relationships worked out.\n\nBut I do think there\'s hope, even for the boomers.

But my brother and sister-in-law usually tell them off for me, to which they\'ll apologise for being rude. \n\nThe thing that made me think this could change was when I was out with them, and they saw me experience casual racism first hand. We went to a Chinese restaurant and we had a reservation. It was for an occassion so we were all dressed up. Got to the counter and they gave their name and confirmed their reservation. Waitress then walked us to our table, half way through she turned around and looked at me. She then said ""Grab delivery is outside"". It wasn\'t the first time someone mistook me for a delivery rider, but like wtf, my drip was fire. Not something that would be comfortable to be delivering food all day in. \n\nAnyways, my parent in-laws took real fucking offense to it. Made noise and all to the manager, but what made me feel so much better was that they wanted to find out more about other times their race has made me feel horrible and what other minorities gotta deal with. We had a good talk and it seemed like they understood. They\'re also a lot more aware now and if they criticise anybody these days, it\'s never based on stereotype.

Lots of people trying to stand out through outrage over perceived victimhood, even if what they go through is far milder than the actual victims.

Those businesses who prefer a certain race over another shld be exposed about their discrimination and lose money. In a professional setting and in law, racism cannot be tolerated.\n\nHowever, law should not be used to control social interactions, which is what i ultimately disagree with the ""woke"" types. Stuff like banning racist speech won\'t stop racism, it would only drive them out from view to fester somewhere else.\n\n### On social interactions\n\nOne thing I\'ve been taught about by several people is how as long as casual racism is done as jokes in a two-way affair (i.e. u race X, i race Y, i make fun of u, u make fun of me, we both laugh) it can actually be seen as a strength in sg, in that we dont just push aside our differences we laugh at them and the false stereotypes attributed to them. Hell lets joke about it till it gets old, that would literally invalidate any power in that racist stereotype. Comedy is that powerful.\n\nHowever, I think this should not serve to encourage casual racism, but i think it should be made aware that sometimes the little things are that powerful.\n\nOften people who can dish it out can actually take it. So laugh at people\'s casual racism and shoot back at them, if they get offended, inform them they are hypocrites and disengage from any futher interaction if they dun get it, lest it become bullying. Hypocrites aren\'t worth your time.\n\nWhat you don\'t want is to have society slowly renounce your identity if you can help it, I\'d say an individual\'s identity need not only be of heritage, but its a convenient and natural identity to have as you find others that you can call your own.\n\n###  On bullying\n\nI must say that i dont have the answers for this case. But I\'d like to express some empathy.\n\nBullying on the other hand is where casual racism becomes toxic. Its one-sided social attacks which may turn physical at times. Even the most sensible of laws can only mitigate it. But that\'s not to say that authority figures aren\'t important to help fight bullying. I was also bullied before, it may not be for race but I\'ve felt the same hopelessness to see these teachers turn a blind eye and in the worst case, victim-blamed me for it. It has affect my grades, enough for me to spiral down from my ambitions.

I admit it, I was from a chinese primary school and I was pretty darn ignorant. I grew up with racist parents (I grew up hearing things like if you don't behave ah pu neh neh will catch you - you can imagine why kids repeat what their parents say). \n\nI went to a mixed race secondary school and thats when I learnt to get along with other races.. even in my first year of sec school, I said pretty racist stuff that I didn't realise was racist.. it was only through seeing my classmate's reaction that made me realise my response was wrong and hurt them. I was appalled at myself but I didn't say sorry either because I was embarassed of myself. I never repeated the same mistakes however. It was really making friends of different races in my secondary school years that taught me how to be tactful and got rid of my biases. I was lucky I have friends of different races who were willing to teach me about their religion and language. So I can imagine the vast variety of 'chinese' or 'religious' schools would render many other people ignorant of the things they say. I had encountered a situation where my classmate is Sikh, and another Chinese classmate asked if she was Singaporean. I was super dumbfounded because that classmate was speaking Singlish like any one of us, and yet she still asked that question. I felt really bad and hope that classmate didn't take it to heart.\n\n\nThat being said, I do think that things are getting better with the younger generation and its mainly a larger portion older generation that are racist. The birth rate will also even out the race demographics in the future (i think). Also about the skin thing, a lot of older generation still hold the mindset that pale is good... (asian thinking), but the younger generation don't really see much issue with it. There are a lot more interracial marriages. My friends are happily dating and their parents accept their partners, but I think they still do get stares from the mostly the older gen, but they don't really care. Its really sad to see the adults enabling their kids to be racist, and I can imagine how horrible it feels to be in that situation myself. I do hope Singaporeans can be more accepting of one another. I do see things improving too because a lot of eateries and restaurants are becoming halal, and that allows us to dine with our muslim friends more easily. \n\nLet us hope for a better future, be it fairness of race or lgbt in general. :)"", 'Tbh, we are like this cause of what was passed on from generation to generation. Unless these uncles and aunties stop teaching their children this stuff. I don’t think the racism will stop.', 'yup, casual racism is racism. End of story.', ""First of all, very sorry to hear your experience with racism. As a Chinese person I've almost never had to put up with all this and frankly we don't really understand how it's really like to be faced with racism unless we go and live in a place where we become the minority. Racism sucks. Let me share with you my personal experience and understanding of such issues. I moved to China since 12 and have never been back to Singapore until the time came for me to serve NS.\n\nSo first of all there is definitely a correlation between racism and one's level of education. Back in BMT I was enlisted into a JC batch. People there generally were not racist at all. I never heard any casual racist remarks being thrown around ever. Not against indians or malays or 'chinamen' or whatever. Everyone was really nice, and the only people they would make jokes about were those selfish idiots who always got us into trouble.\n\nFast forward to unit life, I was assigned to a unit where the majority around me were from ITE or poly, with only 2-3 'JC kids', and all of a sudden it became very natural to throw racist slurs around on a daily basis. Well, maybe not just racist slurs. The jokes ranged from 'indians are so smelly', 'fucking indogs (when playing ml)' to '____'s face looks stupid sia'. Sometimes the indians would also come with up insults like 'fucking Chinese with small eyes'. 99% of the time everyone gets a laugh and no one gets offended, at least from what I saw. As someone who's 'from China' (technically Singaporean with half my family from China), I've also been the target of some Chinamen jokes, which, not gonna lie, were quite funny at times. They would say I run so fast because I was accustomed to the shitty air pollution in China or insist that I probably ate dog meat some point in my life although I said I have not. I'd say they did not mean any harm and were only trying to lighten the mood sometimes, since NS is so shag, but I've also gotten pissed at times if they make the same jokes repeatedly. So I guess I can relate to a limited extent, but I'm sure it's nothing compared to what you guys deal with, since I completely come off as a Singaporean Chinese until someone starts asking where I went to school etc., and it's at that point I tell them I'm actually kind of from China. I'm also relieved that I finished my NS pre-covid because I can't imagine what kind of shit I'll have to deal with as a 'China person' in Singapore right now.\n\nNow regarding cinema/ads, I'm not sure I see that in a racist light. I was a little surprised to see all the movies here in Chinese subtitles only (not even English) at first, but after a bit of contemplation it seems the reasonable thing to do, given that over 70% of the population speak Chinese and that subtitles in more than one language would probably block too much of the screen. I wonder if some older Malay or Indian citizens would struggle with understanding English movies without subtitles but I can't think of a good solution. Maybe it would be a good idea to allocate separate screenings for different language subtitles, similar to how subbed/dubbed movies are sold separately. And regarding ads, it's kind of just how the market works. They have to cater to their own target audience and more often than not, their targets happen to be part of the majority.\n\nI also knew an Indian guy who pretty much only hung out with Chinese people and could even understand/speak some Chinese. Maybe part of it is trying to blend in the majority, but under the currently extremely popular Japanese/Korean/anime/Taiwanese trends in Singapore, I would also not be surprised if they are genuinely more interested in such cultures. A significant portion of Chinese people also take an appeal to Japanese/Korean culture more than their own culture.\n\nSo at the end of the day, racism sucks, but looking on the bright side, the younger, more educated people are generally much less racist, and even those who appear racist may not be as mean as they appear to be. We can hope that things change for the better but change takes time so for the time being, I advise minorities to try not to actively look for how they are subject to racism in every aspect of life because the mind sees whatever it wants to and it just fuels more hate against each other."", 'There’s racism everywhere. You should hear the racist shit my Indian friends say about their own people who are of a different class or skin darker colour.

You should hear what my white friends say about POC.\n\nRacism is universal.', 'Hey OP, congratulations on getting your post out of new and overcoming the large numbers of dislikes you would have received at the start.

It is that we accept there are differences , we make jokes about stereotypes and move on from it. My best friends in sec school were Indians and Malays and it really cuts both way. We should take a leaf from our forefathers ,embrace the differences rather than talk about racism in the form of trying to eradicate it. It’s just not possible. Look at how our president is a Malay, we had numerous dpms that were Indians, the head of Temasek and DBS(naturalise) are both local Indians. Our law minister , the head of our strongest opposition party who has a strong Chinese base, it goes on... Singapore is as tolerant a country you can find in terms of embracing diversity. We all have small little stories about feeling ostracised , is it always race related ? Seriously ... folks don’t make it sound like society is against you, there is no Utopia on earth .', 'I strongly emphatize with  you and can understand what you’ve been through. Unfortunately this is an issue which wouldn’t be resolved in a day and here are some suggestions, especially for young kids but some apply to adults as well\n\n1) it’s not about just racism in school. Youngsters that age are just learning what to do - initially with first experiences of a mass social set up like a school, and later with raging hormones they don’t know how to deal with. Therefore they will always behave awkwardly with someone who is different. Not just race, but maybe fat or weird nose, stutters or anything. It is just one of the coping mechanisms to earn an alpha status in the peer group. This stems from an in brewing insecurity that given the person in front is different, I need to do something eccentric to stand out. However, the fomo then leads to others in the group joining in. But remember, the abuser is the one more insecure than the sufferer here. He is the one that needs help. Else this grows into what can be called downright racism where the person starts believing their jokes and taunts. \n\n2) As is insecurity grows low key in them, they become adolescent and then adults. Given they cannot outright body shame someone for their looks once they join the workforce, race becomes a form of weapon against jobs and promotions at work place. But this kind of obsession is not healthy, given it leads to unoptimised workforce and hence org performance. It’s a fact that only truly global companies which have a diverse mix of talent with a performance driven organisation make it big globally (I am not counting Chinese companies because most of them have regional dominance instead, with most of their revenues coming from China. Even the larger Chinese companies have a bug expat population with a healthy mix). \n\n3) The only way to ensure such racism doesn’t effect you is in your hands. Learn about your culture. Identify what you are good at. Op, Given you are of Indian origin you must know that a lot of global conglomerate CEOs are Indian origin. Having the power to understand where your own race has been, will dilute out the thorny statements made by others. Again, I am not saying racists are right, but just saying why shouldn’t it impact you because it is the insecurity of the accused and nothing to do with the victim. Again taking your example OP, the Chinese lady who spoke to your Chinese gf was really concerned about racial mixing and nothing else. Else why would a stranger be concerned on how the future child of a stranger looks? To be honest if I were you and I knew some Chinese, I would have told/ asked my gf to tell her that the beauty of genetically diverse children is that they take the best genes from both parents. So maybe the child would be good looking like the mother but have brains and confidence of the father. ;) you of course would need to believe in yourself to have made that statement and feel food about it. \n\nI know that racism is bad, be it against anyone (Indians, Malay, Chinese, blacks) but again we must realise there is something wrong with the one being racist rather than us. And it’s up to us how we take it. 90% of hard core racists just end up being like the Karen who end up recording videos in mrt. 10% will still be successful and be powerful positions to impact a job etc. but there also it is up to you to find a truly global workplace where promotions and jobs are performance driven. \n\nHope this helps.', 'To be honest, i was guilty of some of the acts when i was younger (like until before secondary school probably) and it was because some of my older relatives used to always warn us to not randomly run away because ""ar pu neh neh will catch you"" and because i always see groups of workers at night in the grass field drinking and stuff. The impression i had of the indians i know in my primary school wasnt good too, but it was mostly them as a person (eg.

And there wasn\'t much racism in secondary that i can remember. The indians there were fairly popular in school too. \n\nSo yea racism is still very prominent in Singapore, but i think because the younger ones are more exposed to it and also because of the pandemic racist attacks/campaigns, we are slowly progressing.

18,MaoAankh,nj3rfs,Just turned 21 recently and life got really hard,2021-05-23 16:55:11,singapore,378640,126,443,"If my life was a game, I think the difficulty scaling is broken.

Its been a few months since I turned 21 this year, and thought that things are finally going to change for the better. But suddenly a lot of things happened and it felt as if the whole world came down on me.

I have always been living with my father, the two of us were borrowing a room from our relatives. It was crammed but we lived there for about a good 10+ years, since I was in primary school.

My parents were divorced, I don't really keep in contact with my mom anymore. The reason me and my dad didn't apply for a rental flat was because my mom used my name to rent a flat and she stayed with her new boyfriend.

Life was pretty comfortable. Me and my father got so used to living in our relative's home. My PC setup was a small coffee table propped right in front of my mattress, as soon as I wake up I was already in gaming position. Anyway we just stayed there until when I was nearing the end of my poly years, that's when my relative told us we need to find a way to move out.

As every Singaporean would know, getting a property in Singapore is like a really huge milestone. I don't know how me and my father are going to pull it off, so we came up with a plan.

Instead of wasting 2 years in NS, I decided to sign on and landed my self a nice 2.9k vocation (Of cause I didn't make this decision lightly, I have weighted many factors in, including which vocation would suit me best). Now that I have stable income, we should be able to get a decent loan from HDB or bank. Together with my father's 80k in his CPF OA, we just might be able to get a BTO or SBF.

That's when I learnt that my father had deferred a HDB loan a long time ago, back in 1997. The interest has accumulated until a good 200k+. HDB was kind enough to waiver off half of this resale levy, but its still over 100k. Okay fine, how about public resale? We went back to crunching numbers and smashing calculators. My father has already applied for HLE twice so HDB loan is out of the question, we went down to DBS bank to ask for a loan, and after assessing me and my father's situation, we learnt that instead of the expected 170k we could loan for 25 year tenure, we could only get 100k+ due to my father's income and age.

Forget about getting resale, we couldn't even pay the upfront cost for the cheapest options out there, and we haven't even factor in the COV yet. I have only started working for a few months so I don't have much savings as well yet.

So we went back to try and apply for a rental flat, and HDB rejected us because our combined income exceeds 1.5k.

A few days ago my relative gave me and my father a deadline, we need to move out by the end of June 2021. I have already wrote a letter to MP to try and help us out with our situation, and am still currently waiting for reply.

I have also applied and got accepted for a part-time degree program. I am awaiting payment of school fees and have set aside 16k so that's even less savings for housing. I will be enrolled in July.

With increasing property price the trend, plus the recent Covid-19 situation, BTO delay, etc, I feel I got caught in a really bad timing. I admit some of the issues I'm facing is due to our poor decision making in the past, even way before I was born. There is still a lot of things I don't know about the world but with the decisions I need to make, I can't help but feel overwhelmed.

If HDB rejects us again, we may have to look for a private rental. But honestly the reality of working just to pay rent and continue cramming in a single room, and we don't even know what kind of restrictions the landlord might impose on us. Things seem to be turning for the worse, and if my salary goes to paying rent, how can we break out of the cycle?

EDIT 23/5/2021:I am thinking of asking my father to stop working so that our combined salary is just nice below 1.5k. We will have to wait until our next reporting of income tax statement. I don't know how well this plan might work or if it might backfire on us.

EDIT 24/5/2021:Currently looking out for private rentals while awaiting HDB response, I don't have any experience with this so I may contact an agent. If anybody has experience with this I would really appreciate it if you can share your knowledge. I heard there are some rental offers out there that are out to scam foreigners, there was a story about a flat that rented out to like 10+ people.",0.94,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nj3rfs/just_turned_21_recently_and_life_got_really_hard/,"['Well, at the moment you have no choice. \n\nSince you mentioned that you borrow a room from your relative I am assuming no rent?

We will have to wait until our next reporting of income tax statement. I don't know how well this plan might work or if it might backfire on us.\n\nBut it's gross household income right? Your pay of 2.7k will still be above the threshold? Unless you mean you want to quit to qualify for the rental flat? Then you don't intend to ever make more than 1.5k a month? Please don't ruin your own future. And from HDB's website, it doesn't even seem like you definitely will get a rental flat just because your income is below 1.5k at present. I don't know how HDB assesses but if I'm the HDB officer and I see this guy who seems perfectly capable of getting paid at least 2.7k a month applying for a rental flat, I will start asking questions. Don't throw letter until you have thought things through, you may end up digging a bigger hole for yourself if you end up without a job and don't qualify for a rental flat. \n\nI'm not sure how much cash and CPF you have but you may want to consider doing this\n- check with a bank or a mortgage broker again on the loan and your maximum affordability for a place. You can google property affordability calculator online to get a rough gauge too but the bank's assessment would be more accurate and is free;\n-  then based on that affordability you can decide on your next step since you will have a better idea of whether you are in a position to buy a resale HDB. Even if you can afford to buy one, do think through whether it's worth it to do so at this point given the currently elevated prices and whether this will have an impact on the grants you can get in the future when you find a partner and want to settle down.\n\nI think it's actually a bit hard to think things through properly when you're stressed and facing such an imminent deadline to move out. That seems like a recipe for making a rushed and potentially wrong decision with long lasting impact. You may want to consider renting a room in an ulu place first to have some breathing room to think through things properly and consider your options. Perhaps you could rent a couple of years and see if the crazy HDB prices situation improves and in the meantime, your income will increase which will allow you to get a higher loan and you can also save for your downpayment along with building up your CPF.\n\nAnother possible option is to try finding housemates and rent a whole HDB together. This could work out cheaper but may take some time depending on your network. \n\n>I admit some of the issues I'm facing is due to our poor decision making in the past, even way before I was born. \n\nPlease don't be so harsh on yourself.

For rental flat, salary is taken **at the point of application**. I.e. if father stops working now and you haven't enlisted, actually it is the best time to apply.

Appealing, if you've beginning to receive your income, might be tricky cuz your income exceeds by a lot alot. And appeals takes a bloody darn long time as well.

Agreed that the biggest hurdle to appeal will your salary. Your father's declining health and unsustainable income *may* be grounds for appeal. (How old is he?) Does he require you to provide caregiving? Like bring to hospital, assist in daily living etc? This may be further grounds to argue why you need a sustainable housing in rental flat as you need to crave out time to support him, which may affect your employment which directly impacts your open market accommodation plan.\n\n\n Giving rental flat allows for greater breathing room while you works towards home ownership (might want to use this to sell to hdb that you're not planning to stay in rental flat forever).\n\n\nThat said, it is going to be a tight wriggle.

So I hope it can work out for you too! :)"", 'Hi OP. Just remember that this too shall pass. I can’t imagine going through this at 21. Your comment about being stuck in this poverty cycle really struck me, and I would like to cheer you up a bit.\n\nFor a bit of context, home ownership is not a must! Many people rent. From what I’ve seen on Western media, renting seems to be the norm in other countries. \n\nRenting can make you almost as rich as a home owner in Singapore!! Let me explain, but bear with me as it may get a bit confusing and it involves the concept of investing (which definitely isn’t scary at all). \n\nLet’s say there is a $300K resale house on the market. The rental on it is $15K/year (5% rental per year). Let’s also assume you have $85K saved (25% needed for down payment if you’re borrowing from the bank, and $10K renovations), and you make $40K/year including bonuses (with no change in salary for the next 25 years), and spend $9K/year excluding housing. \n\nIf you choose to rent, you’ll have $16K of spare savings/year, and will also have $85K cash in the bank. If you invest this in the stock market for the next 25 years and get average returns of 7%/year, you’ll have a cool net worth of $1.5M (I can DM you the calculations if you want to).\n\nIf you choose to buy this resale house, you will have to pay $12.5K/year ($950/month using the MAS home loan calculator + maintenance cost of about $1K/year for town council and repairs). Given your $40K/year salary, you will get $18.5K in savings every year. If we assume that you put all of this $18.5K into stocks every year, and your house, after 25 years, appreciates to $550K, you will have a net worth of about $1.8M (assuming 7%/year returns in the stock market - DM for calculations). Even though you save more every month, and even though you buy your own house, you would only have a net worth that is 20% higher, \n\nMy assumptions are quite modest. Nevertheless, if you feel like I’m spouting nonsense, that’s fine HAHA. The point I am getting at is that home ownership is not the way out of the poverty cycle, prudent financial decisions are. If you save a lot, and you invest these savings in pretty basic stuff, you can have a decent nest egg in 25 years at 45 years old, one that is comparable to a home owner’s nest egg. The key is not to focus on owning a home. The key is to devote the time to learn more about personal finance and investing. There are numerous books out there for this and at 21, if you start now, it can make a huge difference!! \n\nI would even go so far as to argue that home ownership can really set you back financially in some cases, especially if you buy an older flat for the sake of buying one. Don’t think of rent payments as money down the drain. Think of it as an opportunity to invest that downpayment/renovation money into something else that can yield you higher returns. Cheers!', 'Hi OP, you are still young. With maturity beyond your age, Life can only get better. As many peeps mentioned earlier, the most important thing to do when making important decisions is to think long term instead. Getting BTO with your dad will only create more problems in the future. Rental seems to be a wiser decision. 21 to 35 will pass very fast. When you are 35, more options will open up to you. If you manage to get a partner before 35 and apply for BTO, you can consider giving a room to your DAD? \n\nIn any case your situation is not ideal but not dire as well. Stay positive like your dad.

Your father does not need to stop working (but do look up as many assistance avenues as you can find. Getting a counselor involved to help in this regard is very recommended).

You will need public transport at least for work since you can't WFH in SAF so that's $100 more. How about other essentials? e.g. Soap, Shampoo, dishwashing liquid, detergent. Does your dad need to pay off part of the loan owed to HDB in cash? How much leeway is left? \n\nGoing private rental is probably the best solution for you right now. At least for the near future. If you're willing to stay a little more ulu, say Sembawang or Yishun, it would likely be a little cheaper. \n\nOnce you've worked a couple of years, and perhaps after your father has retired, you could start looking for a flat again.

Every decision is basically a stepping stone in life. Everyone is smart, and you want to be smart too, blahblahblah. It\'s actually a very flawed mindset, but that is a different subject. I just want to address your social anxiety, about the cycle of poverty.\n\nThe truth is, you already broke the cycle of poverty. The real cycle of poverty is much much bleaker. Fact is, you already took advantage of your relative\'s kindness to stay rent free at their place. (Maybe you paid bills? I dunno) Put it another way, you were already very fortunate to have that option, else you may not even be where you are today. And where you are today, is what gives you the options to explore around and still be able to make ""educated"" choices. True poverty, only have choices handed to them.\n\nAnyway, after you come out to work and finish studying, it should be a priority to move out with your new income stream. Unless your relative insist that you can stay, cause maybe you can ""help"" out with the house. But unfortunately, that\'s not the case so you are overstaying your welcome. First thing first, you need to be appreciative of everything thus far.\n\nIt would be best if the government can understand your plight and ""help"" you out. Don\'t we all? Heck, I want the government to help me too, but the way our government work is to help only when you are totally fked. Even after I committed suicide and survive, I got no government help, ok? It\'s fucked up, and actually I don\'t think there\'s a Singaporean that actually help me with my problem after that too. Life is tough, even the rich don\'t want to extend their hands to what they feel are people who aren\'t working hard enough.\n\nNow, you aren\'t fked up. So they can\'t help, and that is the reality. If they help you, tons of people will ask why they never help them then. The government will say, our reserves will run out of money if we help everyone that needs help. So their model is for you to force yourself to help yourself, so they don\'t have to solve your problem. And its not a big problem if you can solve it, so that proves their model is right. It\'s somewhat morally flawed, but the age of chivalry is long gone. Welcome to selfish capitalism.\n\nRent a house, that\'s what you should have done in the first place. Your degree, your army has an option to sponsor you as you mentioned. Take that, use your 16k for your more immediate needs. Worst case, you go homeless and ask MSF for shelter. When they ask you why, you can tell them cause you don\'t want to waste money. That doesn\'t sounds bright, right? So now, we go back a full cycle to you having choices. And the ability to make and afford an ""educated"" choice which is to rent a short term stay. Then work out with HDB or MSF (actually it should be MSF\'s problem) on how you can afford your own place to stay. But everything takes time, and you need an interim solution. The keyword here is interim, not long term. Rental may ""waste"" money but in ""empowers"" you to do better now. It\'s important to identify what ""now"" is and stop living in the ""future"", while expecting the world to help you achieve that ""future"". That future was never yours. It could be, but that\'s only if you have the life for it. If you don\'t have the life for it, you are just depriving yourself of ""now"" which is just dumb. Once again, your situation is not fked.

Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was a 25 year old officer living in Singapore during World War II. His platoon of 42 soldiers were positioned on Bukit Chandu (Opium Hill) when they spotted something unusual about some troops dressed as Punjabi soldiers from the British Army patrolling parts of the hill. They opened fire, and  true enough, those were Japanese  soldiers in disguise.

They held their position for a frustrating 2 days. The invading Japanese  battalion finally launched their all-out infamous Banzai attack up on Bukit Chandu. The platoon held out until their ammunition was spent. With no  ammunition and no hope of any support but refusing to give in, Lieutenant Adnan gave the order to make a last charge against the enemy  with bayonets and their fists.

The Japanese killed most of the platoon, and captured the rest. Lieutenant Adnan Saidi was executed by being strung up on a tree, then stabbed to death with bayonets for his resistance. The rest of his surviving platoon was given the option of surrendering and joining the Japanese effort against the British.

They chose to honour their vow of ""Taat Setia"" (Faithfulness and Loyalty) and were executed instead. Their motto was,*“Biar putih tulang, jangan putih mata.”*  (better to die in battle than live with tears of regret).

22,mangopangoh,nnncy8,Secondary school dropout pondering what to do with my life,2021-05-29 21:20:35,singapore,378640,140,586,"I dropped out about 6 years ago when I was in Sec 3 because of 2 and a half years of bullying... perpetrated by my teachers of all people. I did go back to school for a while the year after but after the dams burst, they couldn’t be closed and the mental toll it took on me proved to be too much at that time (depression, anxiety, communication disorder).

From then until now, I’ve been mostly doing part time online work - doing write ups for some websites, helping out with brand promotion material, translating freelance etc. I had such a hard time coping with trusting adults/authority figures after I dropped out that I didn’t even consider any further education.

Recently though, since I’m about to become an adult myself (21F) I’ve been thinking about the future and whether I can actually earn a living for myself this way... I’m thinking of maybe starting to study for the O Levels privately (is there an age limit?) since I did pretty well in school before dropping out. I’m also considering going to a specialised language school since I’ve saved up quite a bit and afaik, being a translator doesn’t absolutely require a specialised degree beyond language certifications. (I’ve taken HSK6 and JLPT3 so it seems plausible to me... Might need time adjusting back to being in a school environment though.)

But to be honest, I don’t really have any passions or interests in life... I just want to be able to make a living and let my parents retire without needing to worry even more about their immature child (AKA me) :’) 

Anyone been in similar situations looking for your future? Or any advice would be appreciated as well.

23,jabbadastripper,mus1se,Lost 9.5k to an insurance company...Big oof moment but nonetheless a valuable lesson on why we cannot trust Financial Advisors in Singapore to advise us on our finances,2021-04-20 22:51:02,singapore,378640,312,1455,"2 years back when I have just graduated from university and started working, I wanted to take charge of my finances back then. For a lack of better judgement, I was acquainted with two agents from AIA to understand how I could outsource my wealth management and foolishly I signed a policy known as the AIA Wealth Pro Advantage which is touted to help save and invest money that you lock in. The terms were $5k per year for 25 years. At that point of time, with no interest in investing that seemed pretty good. Just park your money somewhere and not think about it and just wait till it magically grows.  


However, everything changed when Covid-19 happened. With so much free time at hand, I was checking out roboadvisors and index funds, and how historically they have pretty good performance. If you are familiar with such sites, they tend to provide a projection on the estimated returns based on your lump sum and monthly investments. Across the various sites, what struck me was that for the same length of time (25 years), they were on average returning around 3 times more than that of the AIA policy. Even the portfolios with half the expected rate of return performed almost equally compared to the AIA policy. In addition, the policy is an **obligation**. If for some reason you are unable to sustain it for 25 years (and many things can happen in 25 years), you will be hit with a huge penalty.  

  
I was flabbergasted by my findings and decided to drill my insurance agents on the huge gap between investing on my own and the policy. After much back and forth, they admitted that the policies from insurance policies tend to carry high costs. In fact, the compounded costs were about 30% of the value of premiums. On the other hand, a roboadvisor may only be charging around $25 per year for managing the same amount of money. At this point of time, I had $9.5k of premiums locked in. However, given the huge opportunity cost, I decided to bite the bullet and forfeited the $9.5k, as I figured they would be recouped when I start investing the future money that was freed from the policy.  

  
This was a costly lesson for me, but I am glad I managed to pull myself out of the rut before the sunk cost gets too overbearing (to put things in perspective, the opportunity cost of staying in the policy adds up to about $200k to $300k at the 25th year). 

  
My word of advice for those who are looking to secure your finances is to AVOID INSURANCE COMPANIES for investment purposes. There are better options out there, and you just need to have a teeny bit of interest. Do not be like me :’) The whole experience left a sour taste in my mouth, but I do hope I can save some other fellow workers from a similar fate. I have also attached my policy tables as well as similar projections from Roboadvisors such as Syfe and Endowus in the imgur link for your reference ([https://imgur.com/a/mCAL2I1](https://imgur.com/a/mCAL2I1)). I think the most important screenshot to share, is the one where the agent admits that the cost of endowment plans are literally the highest amongst all wealth management options.

  
Hope you find this helpful and avoid the pitfalls. If you were like me and inadvertently bought a similar plan, do the math. In most scenarios, it is worthwhile to terminate the plan to unlock the true potential of your future cash flows.

Edit: Wow I'm overwhelmed by how this post resonated with so many people. I do see many comments on insurance linked policies. Actually this particular policy doesn't even have an insurance component, yet the charges are insane. I can't imagine how the charges would increase when insurance costs are accounted for.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/mus1se/lost_95k_to_an_insurance_companybig_oof_moment/,"[""For posts flaired as such (by OP), we will be exercising greater moderation in the comments section against joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion.

Insurance is important as much as I shit on the predatory practices of insurance agents or retail bankers (those peddling these products) in Singapore. Start off with those shield plan immediately when you start making $$$, then term and life. \n\nLife insurance afaik, will not terminate after you finish paying for it, as long as you don't redeem it. So you are covered up till you die. It's more expensive, but you know you can stop paying at a definite time in future and still be covered.\n\nTerm insurance will terminate after your coverage term ends. But their benefits are more for critical illness, disability, etc as they pay out more for these. Since they are finite and term restricted, these are cheaper.\n\nThose are the only 3 products most people should consider and only the vanilla type. Alongside with some other basic general insurance depending on needs and lifestyle. \n\nInvestment should never co-mingle with Insurance. Say if you are met with an emergency, you shouldn't have to be forced to draw down on your investment value to cover for it. Investment for most people is to have a growing egg nest. So in times of emergency, touching your egg nest should be your last line while insurance is your first line. If you put these together such as an ILP, you are setting yourself up in a mutually exclusive condition during difficult times. Plus, money locked up is always worth less than liquid money. \n\nAlso, important financial 101. In fund management, any money paid out to the service provider is deducted from the money that should be invested. To make a $1 gain on $99 is 1.01%, whilst it's 1% to make the same $1 on $100. Meaning, if the upfront expense (commission) is $1, your remaining money will need to generate a higher return as compared to a hypothetical zero cost service. So your main aim for investment is to always minimize expense with your investment, especially for lower return passive investments - which most of the ILP products invest in but at a significantly higher cost. So it is extremely contradictory for people who want fuss-free investments to buy into ILP when there are many low-cost options these days, such as robo-advisors. \n\nPlus robo-advisors have no lock-up, so your money is definitely worth more in that than illiquid money even if you have to take it out at loss comparatively. So even money in your bank account is worth more than whatever projected gain in your lock-up money in those ILP saving plans on a dollar to dollar basis. Think of how much you hate CPF when you are barely making $$$ as you start working, why would you volunteer to chunk off your take-home salary into another lock-up scheme?? That doesn't make any sense.\n\nSame for insurance, you should always buy a product that costs the lowest so you maximize your coverage.

Agents will tell you that you can do partial withdrawal after X years have passed but what if you want out before that?\n\nFurthermore, a large amount of the premium paid in the first few years goes towards commissions for the agent. ILPs also happen to have the highest commission rates. This money that goes into commissions could have been used to invest and gain more returns!

Assuming that one already has their basic coverage for disability or critical illness, the lump sum payout is to replace their would-be income and to ease the transition into their new life. Would one then prioritise investing? After all it likely is doom and gloom in their heads and investing stops. But what if after a long time the person is still alive, or a full recovery is made? Retirement is still bound to happen whether we like it or not. Do we keep checking our bank accounts hoping that our payouts then could last us for the rest of our lives (which is till when)? \n\nThis is when an ILP with waiver riders come in, because it continues to invest for you ensuring that you have a basic pool of funds for retirement. \n\n\n\n\n2.

His reasons were because the charges are lower and basically the thing invests better than ILP. I don\'t disagree. A recent meetup with him, I learnt that he recently withdrew everything just before the peak of the pandemic because of both fear of loss and to buy stuff for his new house. Lucky for him at that time he managed to turn over a profit, but many of us are not that lucky.

These can be used in any medium or platform, be it stocks, funds, etf, etc...\n\nNote: 3 and 4 are investment concepts that you see used in ILPs, but can be applied to investment in general. \n\n1. Only invest using your own money (do not borrow money or use leverage to invest, unless you are willing to take the risk)\n\n2. Invest using funds that you do not urgently need (funds that you can leave and not cash out if the market is doing poorly). Do not invest using your university fees/House downpayment or money you know you will need to spend in the short term, so that if the market suddenly goes down, you do not need to cash out and immediately make a loss. You can continue to hold on to those stocks/funds/etc... Until the market picks up again.\n\n3. A concept called Dollar cost Averaging. Instead of investing one lump sum at one go, break it up to regular periodic investment (assuming you are not charged per transaction). Instead of investing $12,000 at one go, put in $1000 per month for a year, or $500 a month over 2 years, etc... This is useful for new investors to reduce the impact of market votility. By investing a fixed amount over a long period of time, you let the market votility work to your advantage. When the market is high, you $1,000 will get you less lots/units. When the market is low, the same $1,000 will get you more lots/units. So over the longer investment period, you will find you buy less when the unit price is higher, and more when lower. Do note, the fundamental assumption of this concept is that while the markets may be volatile, the overall market performance trends upwards in the long term. This strategy thus helps you to indirectly ""buy low sell high"". Caveat: this is a poor strategy if you are charged high transaction fees to purchase lots/units.\n\n4. Another investment concept called periodic portfolio rebalancing. The first step is to determine your personal portfolio allocation. Maybe you want 30% bonds 70% equities allocation, or maybe you use geographical allocation like 20% US funds, 20% European, 30% Asian, 30% Emerging markets. Maybe you prefer looking at industries instead: 30% Reits, 20% Tech companies, 30% Medical & Pharmaceutical, 20% Oil & Gas. Next, after determining your portfolio allocation, determine how often do you want to rebalanced. Every month? quarter? Year?\n\nSo what happens when you rebalance? Basically you adjust your portfolio back to your original portfolio allocation.\n\nFor example, assume you have invested 10k over the course of a year on a 50% equity 50% bonds strategy. The overall market is not doing well and the total value of your portfolio is now 9k, of which 3.5k is equities and 5.5k is bonds.

You then sell off 1.5k of equities to buy bonds. When you track this over a long term, you will find that everytime you rebalanced, you sell off lots/units at a higher unit price that the average price you purchased them. Likewise, everytime you buy lots/units during rebalancing, you buy them lower than the average transaction price.\n\nHope you find this helpful', ""Everyone will surely confirm + chop burn their hand on any stock or investment in the short term cos you can't predict volatility.

For example, in January, SIA launched 5 year (USD) bonds, promising to pay 3% interest per annum. So if you put in $1,000, at the end of 5 years you get $1,159 when this bond matures. However you might not want to hold it for 5 years. Also, you can buy and sell the bond on a bond market. So maybe 3 year in, you decide to sell your bond at $1,080, and realise a 2.6% earning per annum. Government can also issue bonds like the Singapore Savings bond, or US treasury Bonds. So bonds are generally one of the safest investment instruments as you rarely see companies' (or governments) default on their bonds, but note they are not completely risk free. Obviously if a company goes bankrupt (like hyflux), they will be unable to repay their bonds, and investors will lose their money. Note: the economic environment where bonds do well is when bank interest rates are high (thus corporate debt is preferable to bank loans).\n\nEquity is where company sells part of the company's ownership to raise money in the form of shares or equity. Therefore the value of a share or equity is related to a company's value and revenue. As a company grows in value, your equity will correspondingly grow in value. So the popular example this year is Gamestop, a US game company that was trading at below $20 a share, when it suddenly surged to almost $350. This means if you invested $1,000 in early January, and sold at the peak, you would have gotten back over $17k. However, about a week later, it dropped back to about $60+ a share. So investors that entered at $350 and exited at $60+ would have lost about $280+ per share. With regards to equities, there can be a lot of volatility in the day to day market price, but if you are investing in a reliable company, you know your price will probably go up in the long run, assuming no major changes in company practices, legislation, etc... This is why more Conservative investors will just invest in big stable companies like Blue Chips (Stocks in a company with a national reputation for quality, reliability, and the ability to operate profitably in good and bad times) or like S&P 500 companies (500 largest U.S. publicly traded companies).\n\nHope this is useful.\n\nIf I have made any mistake here, hope any of you will let me know.

And also, my contract states that my working hours are weekdays, Monday to Friday. Now he wants me to work during one of the weekend without any lieu or pay. Anyone knows if it’s legal for employers to do that in Singapore? Is it too much for me to say that I already have plans on that day? It’s after all a weekend. 

I’ve been with them for years, but recently the overtime during weekdays have been overwhelming and already working weekends once in a while. 

He rejected my leave before cause I wanted to take it to accompany my friend for a day before she migrates overseas. I’ve applied for that one day leave one month in advance, not just a few days notice. And it wasn’t the busy period for our department.

26,Doinkmeisters,njzzyz,[UNI] My experience as a first-year Accountancy undergraduate at SUSS (Singapore University of Social Sciences),2021-05-24 23:02:44,SGExams,77662,75,199,"Hi everyone! I am currently in my last week of finals as a first-year and I thought it'd be a good opportunity to share with upcoming freshmen about how SUSS has been like for me. I will talk about my experience and thereafter, give tips to freshmen which I hope will help you all feel more situated. 

I also would like to put a disclaimer that I am NOT a dean's lister and my experience may be different from other students. But, I hope that my experience and tips can help someone who might encounter similar situations as I do. 

*Background*  
My route: ITE Higher Nitec in Accountancy (2 years) > SP Banking and Finance(3 years) > SUSS Accountancy (4 years Full-Time) 

*Experience (1st Semester)* 

Prior to the semester, I (and all other students) had to complete PCOQ or Pre-Course Quizzes. These are quizzes that must be passed with a 60% minimum in order to be enrolled in the classes. I had 5 modules that semester, each worth 5 CUs (Credit Units) which are heavy modules. Attempting these quizzes were tough because the quizzes tested all the units in the modules BEFORE even attending these classes. This made me so confused and rushed because I did not know this prior and spent a few days trying to cram. However, with the help of St\*\*\*cu (censored this although it is a well-known source for students) and resources from several Telegram groups which I had to painstakingly figure out on my own, I managed to complete the PCOQ and passed the 60% mark. 

The next step was to figure out Canvas. Having come from Blackboard, Canvas is easier to navigate however, SUSS has separated modules into two groups: LG (Lecture Group for all students in that module) and TG (Tutorial Group for all students in your class). For a few weeks, I had to get used to the two because I would get confused as to where my online classes were accessed and where the resources were. But after a while, I became familiar and things became much easier. 

During my first semester, I felt extremely bombarded by personal and group assignments also known as TMA (Tutor-Marked Assignment) and GBA (Group-Based Assignment). Even though I had viewed the course curriculum before the semester started, I still felt overwhelmed because I did not know what were the expectations of my professors/tutors for my assignments. When I summarised all the deadlines for my assignments, I realized that I had 10 or more deadlines to complete over 5 modules and it really made me feel pressured to complete all those and still have time to prepare for exams. For my TMA and GBA, I averaged around a C to B+ for each assignment. One positive thing I have loved since polytechnic and is still carried out in SUSS is that a lot of our GBA groups are pre-assigned. I feel that pre-assigned groups take the stress out of forming groups and the prevention of annoying people who only want to group with smart people. I personally like this because it forces students to actually learn how to deal with different skill sets and learning abilities which is useful in the workplace. 

In addition, participation score in SUSS is really important because professors/tutors really will observe and reflect it in your grades. As an introvert + still confused about the school curriculum, this affected me because I still had not digested the content. In addition, since the first lesson is partial briefing and partial diving into the introduction of the class, I became even more overwhelmed when my classmates were able to answer thus gaining participation points. Note that participation points also include having the RIGHT answers. For my participation score, I also ranged around C to B+. 

Lessons-wise, we only had 6 lessons with the professor/tutor and I really, really feel that it wasn't enough for me to digest the topic for that day. I regretted not asking questions even though we could email or talk to the prof/tutor after class. I felt that I was just too afraid of looking too dumb because it could come off as me not doing enough reading or understanding concepts much slower than others. 

As a result of my TMA and GBA deadlines being so close to one another and/or had heavy requirements, I felt that I did not prepare for my exams well and I basically did everything to the best of my ability. I did not actually do that well for my first semester and got below 3.0. Looking back, I felt that the first semester at SUSS was extremely rough and I don't really have many positive academic experiences from it. 

For our exams, it is mainly conducted online. They are known as Timed Online Assignments (TOA). Students will have to access the exam paper from Canvas at the start of the exam and then upload their TOA into Canvas again to have it vetted by Turnitin for plagiarism. For my first round of TOA, I really felt underprepared to say the least. I've never done online exams before and it really felt like everything was a time crunch. Sure, some might feel that because the exams are online, you don't have to worry about hand cramps or with Excel, calculations might be easier. However, I still feel the time crunch. In addition, having to worry and avoid plagiarism is extremely burdensome because having to refer from notes and then rewriting/rephrasing it is a skill that I have yet to master. Most importantly, past year papers are provided with NO answers. From my knowledge, professors can't discuss or publish past year answers (?) At the very most, exam reports are published which reports the performance of the students overall and for each question.  

Aside from school, I finally got to feel the lack of student life in SUSS. I can vouch there really is little to no student life in SUSS. I was prepared with this knowledge before joining SUSS as I knew that UniSIM actually catered towards working students. There are Interest Groups (IG) that you may join however, I did not join any. But one perk that I really enjoy about the lack of student life in SUSS is that I could work part-time. I worked 3 days a week (including weekends) and went to school for about 2-3 days. This allowed me to earn money on the side for my own personal expenses. 

Lastly, I really barely made any friends during that semester. I met some friendly individuals from my GBAs with whom I try to keep in contact. However, I feel that with majority of our lessons being virtual, it's hard to know people personally. 

*Experience (2nd semester)* 

During my second semester, I felt that everything from my first semester remained pretty much the same but I did notice some slight improvements. 

For my TMA, I had started researching about the topic before I started. This allowed me to just word-vomit all the sources I could find and give me a basic outline as to what I should write about. For my GBA, I always messaged my teammates on Canvas or using our school email and created the Whatsapp/Telegram groups. I feel that doing this made our group discussions start earlier which gave us more time to work on the assignment together. However, the complexity and expectations that our professors/tutors had for our assignments remained and I felt that I really still couldn't grasp what they wanted. Yes, there are rubrics but you have to know that these professors can come from academia previously or teach in other universities too. Therefore, the expectations might be higher and when they don't really communicate this with you, it's really hard. I just got back my TMA and GBA grades and the range remained between C and B+. 

In terms of participation, I tried to participate in class more even though I knew that my answers were inadequate. I didn't really know what I was hoping for but I tried to ask my professors and it made me feel less uncomfortable over time. My participation also remained C and B+. 

In terms of lessons, I still feel that 6 lessons for an entire module is really too little. Knowing that other universities have maybe 8 or more lessons for similar modules, I feel a bit cheated (?) because I am not given ample time to digest the content. Even if I did try to study on my time, I couldn't manage to catch up during class. So during the weeks leading up to my finals, I spent it teaching myself the entire module all over again. The good thing about this is that revision slides and lectures are uploaded which actually gave me an outline as to what I should study for. 

For my TOA, examining past year papers allowed me to see what the trend was for the questions although there were no answers given. Finally, St\*\*\*cu notes were helpful and I also purchased notes on the side. The good thing about TOA is that I am able to pre-type answers that I feel would come out in exam including in-text citation. I felt that this saved me time during the exams from worrying about plagiarism so that I can concentrate doing calculations or attempt heavier theory questions. 

Lastly, in terms of student life, nothing much has changed other than being added into Telegram groups for modules. I cannot stress this enough that these Telegram groups provide so much information about TMA, GBA and TOA and I can't believe that I wasn't added or couldn't find these groups in my first semester. Although the number of friends remain abysmal, I feel that these Telegram groups allow me to reach out to others for help much easier. I still work part-time too on some days and also, I have more rest days. 

*Overall Experience*

As a whole, I get why SUSS has been coined the acronym ""Singapore University of Self Study"". I basically taught myself a whole module, didn't make many friends so far whom I want to have at my wedding and I still don't really know what my professors/tutors want despite having rubrics. It has been really stressful getting myself situated because of the pressure to just pass (not even aiming A at this point) because I cannot seem to get information easily. Good resources like notes or past year papers are so hard to come by unless you have friends. This means that connections are everything in SUSS because students barely meet or talk to one another. Although there have been slight improvements in how I adjust to the university life here, I still feel like a freshman who is lost and confused. I know that with time, I will get used to it and know how to cope with the situations in my first year. 

*School Tips* 

1. Bring your charger to class so that your laptop doesn't run out of battery during the 3-hour lessons 
2. Find Telegram groups for the modules that you are taking and the course that you are in. For example, if you are taking Statistics this semester, try to find the Telegram group for Statistics this term. If you are in Accountancy course, try to find the Accountancy degree Telegram group. These Telegram groups provide helpful resources for TOA, TMA, GBA and other things that might be of interest. 
3. Have a format of the SUSS cover page ready for all your TMA and GBA. This will save you a lot of time formatting for every assignment. 
4. For exam revision, ALWAYS check your LG group in Canvas for revision slides and lectures. They will cover the basics of what you need to know and to be used as supplement for your finals revision. 
5. Compile all your class tutorials and activities on top of your revision slides and lectures. Read through everything! Be thorough! 
6. For TOA, pre-type all your answers into a Word document. Always include citation because the university does not condone plagiarism. The standard font and size is Times New Roman, 12, double-space (?) and the citation is APA 7. 
7. For citation, citethisforme isn't actually reliable. (If you have any suggestions, please comment because I want to know too) 
8. Name all your TOA BEFORE you start start your paper so that you can CTRL+S regularly. This is helpful when you're rushing to half-ass or complete the paper to the best of your ability. 
9. For TOA, cite only from the Study Guide or the textbook for the particular module. 
10. Having a mouse is very helpful for school work 
11. Use the online school library to find for reliable articles that you can cite in your assignments 
12. If possible, try to find friends who can help you check your work or share answers for tutorials. This would be helpful because you can at least check your understanding about the concepts before asking the professor/tutor 

TAKE NOTE THAT IF YOUR GPA IS <3.0, you can take MAXIMUM 32.5CU for that semester. For >3.01, you can take MAX 35CU that semester

*General Tips* 

1. Taking the bus from King Albert Park MRT is less crowded than taking the bus from Clementi MRT so if you want to avoid a large crowd, King Albert Park MRT is the way to go. 
2. Avoid taking a Grab if you're late and your route goes through Woodlands Road, Upper Bukit Timah Road and Clementi Road. Take the MRT to avoid jams. 
3. Food at SUSS building is not much so if possible, have your meals at SIM or somewhere else before arriving. 
4. There is not much power points at the first level of the SUSS Block B building near Subway or the food stalls. The power points are situated at the benches facing Starbucks and tables near the wall. 
5. Connect to the school wifi the first time you ever set foot in school.

I hope that this post is helpful for those that are going to be matriculating or are in the same boat as me. I also know this post isn't overly positive but it's my honest and true experience which I feel like I shouldn't sugarcoat. Please comment or PM for any questions and I'll do my best to answer you :)

27,pprobablyneedtherapy,n5b237,"Trauma from sexual violence is being seen as a joke in our local community, and I hate that I can’t feel safe here.",2021-05-05 16:30:14,singapore,378640,207,1476,"As a survivor of sexual assault (even as a minor) + having been on the receiving end of constant sexual harassment (yes, also as a minor), it has been really really hard to see a future where I’ll ever feel safe in this world both physically and mentally. 

In singapore, I was assaulted as a lower secondary school student by an older man. Possibly on the receiving end of attempted grooming as young child too (it’s really vague). Older men have stared at my chest, my ass, my legs, my face, etc. nearly everyday for over a decade complete with a cheeky grin, have tried to ‘brush past’ me with their body (and then stare and smile at me from across the road before walking off), and have stalked and followed me outside of my workplace. They’ve tried to follow me home into the lift as a kindergartener. They’ve been cab drivers that are older than my father himself, asking me to join them for lunch, dinner, drinks, asking for my number or to add me on their Facebook. They’ve been a line manager at my internship workplace saying that me adjusting my dress turned them on, and that they’d be so happy if I did it outside of the office instead. They’ve been hiring managers trying to hire department staff based on their bikini photos. 

And despite all of these personal experiences (far beyond 100+ and counting) that I’ve already mentioned, I can’t even begin to cover exactly how horrible the sexual harassment and violence culture is in this country (but read on). 

I’m doing my best to deal with my own trauma from my experiences with sexual violence right now — I am in therapy with a mental health professional (don’t worry). That’s the work that I have to do, because I walk around everyday completely convinced that it’s just a matter of time before someone is going to forcibly rape me. I leave my house everyday, going to work and school, going to therapy, going to psychiatric appointments, and coming home, in a state of hypervigilance — I can *feel* people walking up from behind me, even if it’s just to walk past me (which is what people do, of course), and every time someone happens to be surprisingly close by, I get startled and dissociate. That’s what I’m left with, fear of the world around me. 

What makes it worse is the amount of victim shaming and jokes that a vast number of Singaporeans have made repeatedly across many instances of reported sexual harassment, assault, and rape, in the local news. I remember seeing an ST News post on Facebook reporting the molestation of a woman who let a male friend stay overnight after a party  — she slept in her room, and she offered him the couch for him to sleep off all of the drinks he’d had. He proceeded to crawl into her bed, whip out his hard dick, and ‘poke-poke’ her in between her butt cheeks. In her own bed, in her own house. 

And guess what the comments were? 
- “She shouldn’t have told him to stay over in the first place if she didn’t want this to happen”
- “If she knew he was drunk, she should have locked her bedroom door”
- “She didn’t lock herself in the bedroom, clearly she was asking for it”
- “Everyone knows that not locking your door is an open invitation that you want them to come in” 
- “Obviously she was leading him on since she didn’t lock her bedroom door. Now she’s acting like the victim? The real victim is the guy being reported.”
- “What did she think would happen by letting a guy stay in her house?”
- “It was an open invitation. She wanted it to happen the moment she let him stay over and didn’t lock the door.”
- “As a woman, I would’ve had the common sense to lock my bedroom door so that this wouldn’t happen to me.” 
- “When he did it to him, she didn’t say no and push him away what. It’s not considered assault if she didn’t fight him off”
- “I’m sure she wanted him to come in and join her. But then she got uncomfortable and changed her mind then reported him to the police for sexual assault. Why are all of you women like this? Why try to make life difficult for guys who did nothing wrong, by making false reports because you changed your mind?” (i acknowledge that false reports do exist, and i don’t condone it either, but this is irrelevant in the context of an actual assault and tbh... there’s a time and place where this will be a valid argument, but this isn’t it) 
- “Eh, next time when we stay over at other people’s house, must also find a girl to ‘poke-poke’ too hahahaha” **(what the actual fuck bro)**

This is what anyone in our country who is trying to heal from sexual trauma has to deal with. A community of people who believe that the onus is on the victim to have taken more precautions because predators exist, and disregard the fact that the responsibility lies on people who commit rape, assault and harassment to just... ***not rape, assault or harass***. A community that thinks, “well, some people are creeps so it’s bound to happen, are you that surprised?” — which by the way is not good enough of a reason to excuse this unsafe behaviour. A community that insists that if we’re assaulted then we probably asked for it, based on what we wore (even if we’re wearing the same exact thing as everyone else; even if i’m wearing a kindergarten school uniform), or based on the decisions that we made (oh well, i shouldn’t have left my house to get food because then nobody would feel the need to stare at my chest and make attempts to feel it). 

A community that I’m convinced will one day tell me that it’s my fault for getting raped by a stranger, because I wasn’t vigilant enough, or that I should’ve worn pants instead of a dress, overalls instead of a school uniform, or that it was because I wore make-up, or looked at the perpetrator a certain way and made him feel turned on. Or because I didn’t start fighting him off or running away — which by the way, as a 14yo, I didn’t do because I was completely frozen with fear of the grown man that was assaulting me at the void deck of my house; freezing and fawning are stress responses too, go read a research journal or two before insisting otherwise. A community that will make a joke about my assault, and say that they want to try it on other people too.

For a second, just think about how hopeless any of this feels, especially on top of all the guilt, shame, and self-blame and self-hate that comes with being assaulted? Even with therapy and trauma counselling. Even with the possibility of pressing charges on a perpetrator (if the justice system is even willing to do anything, but if the perpetrator was a promising local uni student...). To be surrounded by a community of people that would shame victims and make jokes about committing sexual assault / violence themselves? To be faced with the possibility that anyone that I and/or other survivors of sexual violence happen to cross paths with might be part of this community that trivialises the repercussions of sexual assault, simply because it’s been so rampant in the nature of how we exist as Singaporeans? 

Good people exist here and I appreciate all of them that are, but good god, can people of this country stop perpetuating a culture that encourages sexual violence? Is it that hard to stop being trolls about something that’s extremely traumatic and deeply damaging? What’s so funny about sexual violence, that some of you feel the need to joke about it and even think to try it out on someone else?

I can’t breathe here. I don’t feel safe, and it’s not like I’ll be able to do anything else (like leave the country). All I can do is stay here, and feel mortified everyday with a heavy weight on my chest that won’t go away, and cry about it, and deal with constant reminders that dying would feel better than this, and try to heal in an environment that has been making it impossibly hard to. 

This is an immensely painful and dark place to be in for myself, and any other person who feels stuck in the same place too. I’m sorry if anyone reading this is able to relate.

edit:
*got some comments saying that I need therapy, that nobody owes me anything to help me or other survivors of SA feel safe even after being traumatised, and that I shouldn’t be blaming it on everything else when it’s my anxiety making me scared of the world. so I’d just like to clarify a few things:*

*• I am in therapy and getting the professional help I need for my trauma. I am acknowledging that this is the work I need to do to resolve my fear of the world, so don’t worry about me being unaware about needing to get this done. I’ve been an advocate for mental health, and have been trying to heal from poor mental health, long enough to know the importance of holding myself accountable for my own mental well-being. I assure you, the inner work is underway, so thank you for expressing concern for it — much appreciated effort.*

*• I get that nobody owes me, or anyone, anything to help me/them feel safe. Like mentioned, all I’m saying is that there’s just as much of a need for people to not assault / harass / rape / perpetuate a culture that creates an environment that becomes unsafe. Why would anyone intentionally want to make another person feel unsafe? Does one person’s safety mean less than another person’s? This argument of “no-one owes you anything to help you feel safe” is exactly why I’m pointing out in this post that so little people take trauma seriously. You don’t have to carry this baggage for the rest of your life, but I do. People like me do. The least that people that don’t have this baggage can do is maybe just... not encourage it / do it? Unless you can share a reason about why you think it’s okay to encourage or participate in sexual harassment / assault / rape. Does a reasonable explanation honestly exist?*

*• Regarding blame, I’m not blaming it on everything else except myself. Like aforementioned in the above points, the work goes both ways. I have to work on myself to find personal safety again, and people just have to not do it or encourage it. Trauma from sexual assault involves a lot of self-blame (“I shouldn’t have been doing x”; “if I didn’t go to y, this wouldn’t have happened”). Simple analogy — if you were stabbed, how much of the blame falls on you for not being more aware of your surroundings, and how much of the blame falls on the assailant that decided to hurt you?*

*If these still don’t explain things well enough, then I’d appreciate it if you just not involve yourself in this thread.*

*To other survivors who have spoken up, and anyone who has shared their empathy, understanding and support, and anyone who didn’t really agree but was kind enough to discuss these points respectfully without any blame-placing, thank you! Y’all are reasons why the little voice in my head goes: “good people exist”, and I appreciate all of you. Sorry in advance if I don’t manage to reply to you, as it’s all really a bit overwhelming right now, but I’ll try!*",0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/n5b237/trauma_from_sexual_violence_is_being_seen_as_a/,"[""For posts flaired as such (by OP), we will be exercising greater moderation in the comments section against joke replies and irrelevant or off-topic comments and discussion.

Stereotypically, we view victims as weak and mentally unstable, but there’s some who really do hold their pain so tightly that no one knows anything beyond the surface. \n\nI also truly do despise victim blaming when the argument against a victim’s experience is the victim’s response to the situation e.g. “she/he did not push them off so obviously she wanted it...” or something of the sorts. It’s completely invalidating the victim’s experience & feelings, and really just perpetuates this toxic cycle of victim blaming. There really does need to be more talk around the different ways victims respond to trauma - it’s not just “fight or flight”. As a victim of S/A from the past, I know personally that “freezing in response to a traumatic/dangerous situation” is not mentioned enough. Then again, as victims, it shouldn’t really be pushed upon us to spread this awareness! It’s just facts around human behaviour and how we all differ in our reactions. \n\nI’m also from Australia and have moved to SG for my tertiary studies and have experienced some of the “culture” around the way men view women, e.g. walking through coffee shops has always made me feel like I was a piece of meat with all the stares. Eventually I just got used to it because well, that’s all I can do right? I can’t control people’s stares despite how uncomfortable I am. It’s the sad reality. There’s also still a cat calling culture from the older generations of men I’ve experienced too upon moving here which honestly SHOCKED me as I thought Singapore had regarded itself such a respectful society... But, all I could do was just bitterly accept there was nothing I could do. \n\nAnyways, to conclude my ‘rant’ as well... I just want to say that your experiences are so valid, and I also feel the same frustrations with you for how invalidating and cruel the treatment is towards victims of SA, and even just trauma, or feelings of vulnerability in general.

Because apparently, girls don’t get harassed in Singapore.\n\nThose victim shaming comments that you’ve mentioned were also echoed by our fellow Redditors, whom I assume are more educated... which makes it even worse. One would think education would reduce mindsets like this, but it doesn’t and every time I see comments like those it makes me really sad.  \n\nBut I think that is life, and you will often come across people who make ugly and abhorrent remarks, and you shouldn’t let it have too much of an impact on your life. You can stand up to those people and try to change them, but it shouldn’t affect your mental health. \n\nAll the best.', 'I\'m so sorry you had to go through this, and I hope you will one day find peace of mind and no longer feel as anxious or afraid!\n\nI have to agree with you on the the culture of victim-blaming here. Whenever we share stories of being harassed, there seem to always be questions such as ""what were you doing there so late"", ""why did you walk back alone"" etc. Even when the cases happens in broad daylight to students in uniform, most people see this as an \'anomaly\' and downplay the frequency and severity of such events.\n\nI believe many Singaporean women have had such encounters, from when they were school kids to adults. No hard evidence behind this, but this is just from talking to my female friends from school, talking to colleagues which made me realise that way too many women have experienced something similar.\n\nI find that Singaporean men in general tend to brush away this topic, perhaps because of the discomfort of the truth. The lack of a male voice in this thread is also quite telling. \n\nI hope that as a society, we will stop tolerating such behaviour and be more active in calling this out. Whether on the streets, or in forums. And not just women, but men to do this as well, or this mindset/behaviour will continue to perpetuate in certain circles.\n\nOnce again, all the best in your healing and recovery, and may SG improve as a society and be a safer place for you in the near future.', 'After moving here with my family 18 months ago I’m shocked when I hear about male colleagues personal lives. \n\nThe objectification of women in public or stories that are often regaled seeking affirmation of actions is abhorrent and reading things like the above remind me that I need to speak out and up and not remain silent even if it means risking my own personal gain in the future. \n\nIt’s our responsibility as fathers to make sure our sons are crystal clear on consent so young women like yourselves don’t have to live with such fear. \n\nAll the best moving forward.', 'Thank you for sharing. I\'m a survivor of attempted rape and tons of harassment as well, and lots of people I know have experienced similar things.

[Sexual assault myths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rape_myth) are still widely believed here.\n\nI completely understand your frustration and hopelessness. I feel like there\'s a huge lack of empathy and tons of deep-rooted misogyny here, both in men and women. Especially when discussing topics like this. The jokes are the worst - I don\'t know if it\'s because some people are inherently uncomfortable discussing such things seriously (thus having to make it ""funny"") or if they are really just that tactless. Maybe it\'s both.\n\nIt\'s disheartening reading some of the comments on this subreddit sometimes, and let\'s not even get into HWZ or Facebook. It\'s almost as if it needs to happen to them on a personal level before they can even see things from another perspective. Also, the comments are doubly insane because they are insulting to both genders. Saying things like ""why would you do \\_\\_ when a man is around?"" shows how little they think of men on a whole, as if every man is some kind of pervert. It\'s ridiculous. I also hate the double standard. Women can be predators and men can be victims.\n\nI know things seem awful right now but with all that being said, I really do think that things are slowly changing for the better. Society has a long way to go but there are definitely good people around and more are speaking up. I truly hope you\'re able to work through your issues and surround yourself with people who are kind and understanding <3', 'I’m sorry you have to go through this, OP. I’m a survivor of sexual assault too and my parents always blame me for it. My mom always goes “wow, I have to pay for your psychiatrist because YOU made bad choices. The second you graduate from uni, I’m not paying anymore.” I find that a significant number of people from that age group think the same way, which is really depressing. It discourages me from seeking alternative avenues for help, because I fear that my therapist will judge me too. I’m fortunate that I at least have a psychiatrist, but it’s so difficult for me to find a psychologist I can trust. \n\nI constantly fear that someone is going to rape me and I always check my 6, but my friends tell me I’m paranoid. Like wtf? No shit I’m paranoid, I got beaten up, had my abuser threaten my life and was very nearly raped.\n\nI also absolutely despise Singapore news forums. The comments under articles of sexual assault are always a toxic cesspool of people blaming the survivor. “Why did she go to his house?”, “Why did she wear X?” etc. How is it her fault that someone violated her in one of the most demented ways possible? Sure, you could argue that she should’ve taken more precautions, but how does that diminish whatever he’s done? Why is she being blamed for her actions but not the person who actually committed the crime?', 'People seem to lack understanding of the situation and it is really hard to move on if I have people constantly reinforcing all this values into my head and making it unsafe for me to be around.

There\'s this constant victim blaming and shifting the focus of the crimes back to the victim. I\'m tired of people and the judiciary system brushing aside these concerns. They are real, valid and genuinely hurt a lot. \n\nIt really hurts extra when its people you know personally or people you are friends with saying things like ""Well, she shouldn\'t have been drunk at a party and wear revealing clothes"" None of that matters. A crime is a crime.', ""Yup. It isn't too bad here but I've seen posts on HWZ especially and the comments are absolutely vile, and comments from irl friends can be less than savoury as well, though still a far cry from the shit you see on HWZ.

Just a couple of hours ago I stumbled on the nudes post and had to exit out almost immediately with all the comments stating that blame should be placed on ""both sides"" as if it isn\'t a clear violation of trust on the women\'s parts. I don\'t know how this ""but what did you do to deserve it"" mentality still persists in this country, when the burden of blame clearly rests on perpetrators/violators. I hope you don\'t continue to blame yourself for what happened to you, because no one places themselves in any situation expecting to be violated, especially if it involves someone you trusted enough to let near you while you were in a vulnerable state. Honestly fuck everyone else telling you what you do and don\'t deserve. This place can be just downright toxic sometimes. You don\'t owe anyone else an explanation.', 'As a young Singaporean woman, I can do relate to this. Sexual trauma is so downplayed and taken as a joke most of the time. It’s always a “you were asking for it” situation. Why is society blaming women for harm that is being done to them? Why do women have to learn to protect themselves? Why can’t men learn to respect women? I had certain private and confidential stuff about me leaked before and it’s been 2-3 years and it is okay now but it is still haunting me to this day.

I haven't had women I know (friends/family) come to me to share that they had been violated (and I wish that it doesn't happen to them!) but if anyone did, I will for one side with the lady a 100% and report it to the appropriate authorities and defend as I may on behalf. \n\nIt's going to be hard to ignore all the people out there victim shaming or blaming the women in sexual related violence, but it's going to be harder changing people. So you have to somehow learn to ignore them. \n\nI wish you all the best"", 'Logged into my throwaway for this haha \n\nWhen I was in primary school, my parents asked my aunt to take care of me since they were both working. So I went to their house everyday after school. Things were fine for a while but I ended up getting sexually abused by my older teenage cousin for a period of time. I was below 10 years old. I wasn’t asking for it. I didn’t even know what was happening was wrong. \n\nWhen I got older it wreaked havoc on my mind and I hated myself. I tried to kill myself when I was 10/11 years old because of the guilt and shame. I eventually told my mum a couple of years ago, when I was 22, but long story short, she didn’t really seem to care and made excuses for him. That was when I realised that she would never defend me for this. I still have to see him at family gatherings. \n\nI don’t share or tell my experiences because I was afraid of the victim blaming that you mentioned. As a result, I ended up struggling mentally for more than a decade. It’s been almost 20 years and I still get anxiety attacks when I have to go for family gatherings. I can’t even count the number of CNYs and weddings that I have skipped. I was always that person who would work on PH and pretend that it was for the double pay. It was so that I didn’t have to face the person who assaulted me. \n\nI find it sad that as a child I was afraid of being victim blamed. I was a kid who didn’t know how to protect herself and was told that I could trust that person. How was I asking for it? How is it my fault that I didn’t guard myself when I was a literal CHILD in the care of a fucking RELATIVE. You’re right that victim blaming is so harmful. The actual act of sexual abuse is so damaging but the fear of being judged and blamed afterwards is equally lasting and damaging.', 'Once had a pedophilic uncle kept groping me in the ass when I was 7 when swimming, even though my siblings and cousins were there.', 'Not sexual harassment but I feel like this in general is applicable to all sorts of mental health issues, irregardless of the amount of outreach to the public, those suffering are still more than often misunderstood or never even understood in the first place.\n\nThat being said, there are people who understand, albeit a small bunch of them, and for obvious reasons I avoid looking at comments on social media sites such as fb, insta and reddit at times because of how outright obnoxious it can be.', 'I have noticed that some men here (not all, SOME) (saying this so people don’t get mad at me), seem to want to take advantage of younger women when they can.

Even after this he came back later and said he “just had to give it another shot”. If she had not said she was only 16, this wouldn’t be a problem. But the fact that she made it CLEAR she was a minor and was still approached again made me feel very creeped out. Would not be bad if the man was 18-19 but he looked about 25. \n\nI have also experienced several guys looking at me funny or asking me questions when I was 13-16. I remember a grab driver telling me I had “a very good body to be a ballerina” in a taxi when I was about 15. He said this because he picked me up from a place near a dance school. I felt so uncomfortable that the driver was looking at my teenage body while I was alone in a cab with him. \n\nI am very sorry for your experiences and I hear you, I have a friend who suffered from the same thing and she is slowly getting better, I hope the same for you <3', '/u/pprobablyneedtherapy\n\n> I leave my house every day, going to work and school, going to therapy, going to psychiatric appointments, and coming home, in a state of hypervigilance — I can feel people walking up from behind me\n\nAll the best in working through things out with the therapist, and in the meantime, for greater peace of mind, do get smartwatches that come with inbuilt emergency features.

But please also  call. shit. out. when you see it happen. This is why:\n\nThe perverts on HWZ? Half of them probably behave decently in real life despite having wildly misogynistic/sexually violent thoughts; anonymity and groupthink simply emboldens them in an online space. They could be people you know and respect in other circumstances. They just don’t put their wild misogyny on display irl because they know it would not be socially appropriate — and that’s GREAT. That’s one half of the equation: Making sure that people don’t harass and harm other people for sexual pleasure/power hang-ups despite whatever they may be thinking inside. So please amply name and shame perverts so they don’t feel like they can reasonably harass or hurt others in the public eye.\n\nThe second half of the equation is changing what people think.

I do already attend therapy to help to resolve my PTSD from all of this, if you hadn’t noted that in my post. \n\nwhat I’m saying is that even with therapy and doing the inner work for myself to improve my outlook of the world, still doesn’t negate the fact that there are people in our local community that can make explicit, public comments about their intention to assault other people. my feelings about it can change with time, but the fact still remains that people still do this and this sets up a background of victimising other people if one completes an assault. i think it’s completely valid that at least a portion of the blame goes into that — the fact that people aren’t holding themselves accountable for perpetuating this culture and making it hard for the rest of us to feel safe, which is even harder with PTSD as a result of such a culture. \n\nmy anxiety is not the only thing making me feel unsafe. if people didn’t do things like this, if people didn’t perpetuate this culture of harassment, rape and assault, i wouldn’t have this anxiety in the first place. the repercussions of assault also include a a lot of self-blame. so i hope you acknowledge that before being convinced that i’m blaming it on everything else other than myself for why i feel the world is unsafe. i blame myself, and i blame the people who do it, and that isn’t wrong, and the work to heal from it goes both ways. otherwise i’m just healing myself to only have someone else threaten to do it again, and how does that make sense?', ""You will get there :) \n\nDon't hesitate to get help if you feel overwhelmed!

(Twenge's Generation Me covers a lot of this, but I am sure there is more recent research as well)\n\nRape is still a very taboo issue and women (and while less common, this applies even more to men) are not likely to want to come forward about it. But with the culture changing, some people now feel they gain social status among particular groups from being victims, so on the margin we should see more people reporting rapes and attempted rapes than previously when it was even more taboo. So stats probably aren't missing it unless there is a new group of at-risk individuals open to exploitation that weren't around before.\n\nAnother effect would be from putting people who commit these crimes in jail at a higher rate - there is a deterrence effect both to people who think they might get caught (hard to measure but we see people with parents or siblings who served time are less likely to serve time themselves when you control for relevant factors*) and there is an incapacitation effect of putting people who habitually rape in jail where they cannot interact with the general population.  \n\nThe question is where a society is currently messing up and what they could do better. I don't have a strong opinion on what is going on in Singapore (I have visited many times but don't live there - might live there later), though my impression is that it is both a law and order society that will come down hard on offenders and a traditional society that will be relatively slow to recognize that certain people are offenders.\n\n*This research is from the US.

As much as it’s my own responsibility to manage the way I perceive threat (I agree with you on this, just putting it out here), I also really urge you to understand that I didn’t choose to think this way, and that if less people engaged in the threatening behaviour itself, that bit really helps too. \n\nAt the moment it’s not like I can’t tell myself “welp, just don’t think like that”, because trust me I’ve tried it a ton and while I cognitively can think it, my body still holds **a lot** of fear and that’s what I can’t resolve. \n\nSpeaking scientifically, the part of the brain that perceive threat and physically respond to it are lower in the limbic system than the parts that provide higher level processing for cognitive interpretation. What this means is that when the body feels threatened, it reacts first before the threatening stimulus travels further up the brain stem to the brain itself, where it then gets properly processed in the relevant cognitive centres of the brain that then help to filter what’s normal and what isn’t. That’s why the fight flight freeze fawn stress responses exist. That’s why your heart races when someone suddenly shouts in your ear, before you’re able to take the time to realise that it’s just your friend. \n\nAnd PTSD put rather simply is when the responses to threat get stuck in the limbic system and get re-fired no matter how much cognition you try to apply to it. Basically, the body feels threatened even when we try to tell it that it’s not in threat. That’s why trying to think that you’re safe, when your body can’t calm down to feel safe, doesn’t work, and that’s what PTSD is. Therapy soothes this. People in the environment scaling back on threatening behaviour being performed also helps by way of providing less instances for the PTSD brain to go “fuck fuck fuck fuck fuck”. A combination of both is most conducive — re: the work goes both ways.\n\nIf you’re keen to better understand this and why this is not just a mindset thing, you can search up “flipping the lid”.

28,Twrd4321,ncv0yu,First doses First. Now.,2021-05-15 17:34:55,singapore,378640,119,216,"The current uptick in cases highlights the urgency to vaccinate everyone.

Currently, Singapore uses two different vaccines that require 2 doses. The Pfizer-BionTech vaccine is administered 3 weeks apart, and the Moderna vaccine is administered 4 weeks. This requires the health ministry to ensure there is adequate supply for the second dose before appointments can be opened up for the first dose. This greatly limits the number of people who are able to get the first dose.

The first dose is more important than the second dose because even with the first dose, it is able to reduce the number of cases significantly, as well as to reduce the severity of anyone infected with the virus. Reducing the number of cases, as well as preventing hospitals from being overwhelmed, is why more people should be offered the first dose now. To do that, the government must offer first doses to groups who have not been offered the vaccine now.

All high risk groups, such as the elderly, healthcare workers and airport staff have been fully vaccinated, which reduces the risk that comes with deviating from the recommended vaccine schedule. But more importantly, delaying the second dose is a strategy that is currently being used in the UK and Canada, with great results.

In British Columbia, Canada, there were several case hotspots that have led to an increase in cases. BC Health set up vaccination sites in these areas to accelerate vaccinations in these areas. Since Canada delays the second dose, everyone who is vaccinated only received the first dose. As seen from this chart, this has led to an accelerated decrease in cases, and now the area is down to single digit cases.

Delaying the second dose is used at a larger scale in the UK, with research papers being released validating the effectiveness. A Public Health England study showed a single dose of the COVID vaccine [halved transmission of virus](https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2021/apr/28/single-dose-of-covid-vaccine-can-nearly-halve-transmission-of-virus-study-finds). Researchers modelled delaying the second dose [reduced mortality rates](https://www.bmj.com/content/373/bmj.n1087) if the vaccines used have efficacy rates at or above 80%, which is the efficacy of both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. More importantly, the UK has seen substantial decreases in the number of cases, as more than half of its population has received the first dose. This allowed the UK to roll back COVID restrictions, and achieve case rates lower than the US.

Ever since coming to jc, I can't say that I'm having a horrible time tbh, but my thoughts have been keeping me on my toes a lot. I'm 100% aware that this is to be expected in jc, especially since I'm still trying to cope with the new environment/syllabus/pace etc, but I've been feeling quite off lately. (ngl I felt the same way in sec 1, but got over it rather quickly so I'm worried as to why I'm still feeling this)

I take H2 Bio, Math and Econs. So far there hasn't been any important tests since I'm only j1 lol, but I'm constantly feeling anxious to the point where I can’t relax, even during the weekends at home. I worry that I won't be able to keep up with my peers, or just with work in general. I've honestly never fallen behind any class in sec sch so this is scary for me haha. So far content that I've covered is still manageable, but I've been having trouble keeping up with lectures.

1. All lectures are cancelled in light of the virus situation, and all lectures are online. This is fine but the problems here are that lecture time in my timetable is all replaced by tutorials, so teachers each send like 4 30min lectures to you expecting you to finish them all in like 3 days. I’ve been falling behind because clearly I couldn’t finish them all. What can I do? :((
2. For seniors, how are your thoughts like (in terms of studying) during j1? Do you do some light study but only grind near tests/exams, or do you mug everyday? The full intensity of j1 haven’t even hit yet but this anxiety is killing me LMAO. I’m someone who works at random bursts of energy and completely rest at all other times, but I feel super guilty for not working to my fullest yet. This worked for me during Os but I’m sure it might not for As, yet I’m feeling quite exhausted already trying to catch up with everything. How was it like for you?
3. Is it possible for a jc student to be able to sleep by 12am every night? I always hear of students saying they sleep at 2—4am and I hope I can maintain my sleep throughout the two years while keeping up on work. Is weekends and holidays always all work no play? I’m just the kind of person that NEEDS at least a little play everyday or else I’ll go insane lol. I’m not looking to be a top scorer or anything, just good enough that I’m average or above.

I’ve been warned that jc will be the worst time of my life, but I was still holding on the the hope that I can have some fun and feel happy, but it seems to just be sucking the life out of me recently. I can find ways to destress, but it doesn’t last long enough before my heart starts beating again. There are good and bad days I guess, maybe it’s just negative thinking and pessimism. How did you all get over and above this? 

As of now whenever I get super anxious and my heart beats too hard, I’ll go rest and watch some YouTube or browse social media, but after that I’ll feel guilty and feel anxious again. Rinse and repeat. I’m stuck in a vicious cycle lol. Hoping to get some advice to feel better hahahaha :’)

My specialist, who I\'d been seeing for what I thought was a stomach problem because of severe loss of appetite and frequent vomiting, suspected Wilson\'s and did the urine test.

Hence, diagnosis.\n\nPeople with Wilson\'s can present liver damage, neurological failings and more. Not everyone has all three, but I do.

Fortunately, I responded to stronger medication, and was taken off the list.\n\nWork became impossible. I was really weak and got exhausted easily. I had to resign, and am now trying with some degree of success to recuperate. I already had experience with disgnosed clinical depression, some time before.

I'm all for acknowledging the issue, and I've had fruitful discussions with redditors on it.

Consider [some of the articles](https://i.imgur.com/dhFoq57.png) published on ST this morning:

['Has Singapore run out of Chinese boys?'](https://i.imgur.com/h4aBw1C.png)

[Why do racial stereotypes persist in Singapore?](https://i.imgur.com/d8Mcliu.png)

[Life in Singapore as an interracial couple](https://i.imgur.com/0dpbSPh.jpg)

[Still much work to be done in fight against racism](https://i.imgur.com/vuUOqGN.png)

[We need to talk about race issues](https://i.imgur.com/ivsgAxx.png)

I don't know, but it's a little bit overwhelming for me. It is a problem to be addressed in Singapore, but is it ever appropriate to say that it might be too much of a good thing in this scenario? Yah articles on racial issues are not unexpected if one were to read ST, but at this point of time at least for me it becomes somewhat overbearing.

I'm sorry if this was offensive but I bear no malicious intentions in wanting to discuss if anybody feels that the messaging from our media might be excessive in this scenario.

Edit: An example of how the coverage may lead to some misunderstandings could be seen in this recent post: [https://web.archive.org/web/20210613112912/https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nyta2f/didnt\_know\_alcohol\_is\_an\_indian\_cuisine/](https://web.archive.org/web/20210613112912/https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/nyta2f/didnt_know_alcohol_is_an_indian_cuisine/)

Similarly they've left things like cinemas and churches open, which feature 50 people gathered together in poorly ventilated, indoor spaces -- yet they patrol the outdoor parks, slapping people with $300 fines for getting slightly too close to another person despite the minimal risk.

Yes, we do not have sufficient *disposable N95 filtering face piece* so the logical solution has to be *reusable* elastomeric respirators. These are not expensive and they accumulate over time. One pair of filter, if you know what you are doing, last over a year of use. After the Myanmar military took over the country and the people of Myanmar started to protest on the streets, as protests started to be put down with tear gases and rubber bullets, protestors started wearing Chinese-made half-face respirators and safety goggles. That tells me if we wanted to outfit a lot of people with respirators that work, we can. The quality of Chinese-made respirators may be suspecting but a) they seal better than surgical masks, and b) the filtration layer that air has to come through a well-sealed respirator is much thicker than on a surgical mask; meaning it should work much better than a surgical mask.\n\nThere\'s a funny saying in sex-ed: if you can\'t afford to buy a condom, you definitely cannot afford the consequence of not wearing a condom.

Another 4 days later, one more person is sick and now there are 3 stupid coughing in the office. At the 12th day, you are now sick LMAO. Why? Because the first 8 days the virus amount is not high enough so your body can keep up and fight off, but when the 3rd person starts to contribute too, it is past your immune system threshold and you join them. ~~You then proceed to join them in the coughing because your boss is an asshole that don\'t allow MC unless fever. Slowly one by one everyone in the office should fall sick and this is how herd immunity comes to be :D~~\n\ntl:dr Having poor ventilation means the ""number"" of virus isn\'t spread out, which in turns increases your chance of being sick as the real determining factor of whether you fall sick or not, is how well your body can fight off the number of virus that has enter your body.

The inventor of PCR said that it should not be used for diagnostic uses and certainly not alone.

You will need to get a Court order for maintenance.  This can be done via the Family Court website.  [https://ifams.gov.sg/sop/#iFAMS](https://ifams.gov.sg/sop/#iFAMS)\n\nIt is possible to apply for the Court order yourself but I would suggest you get a lawyer to do so as the lawyer would be more familiar with the process and the factors the Court will take into consideration in deciding the amount of maintenance.  If legal fees is an issue, you can apply for Legal Aid through the button marked ""Legal Aid Matters"" on the Family Court website.  Legal advice is provided free.  Legal work (for example, representing you in Court) is usually free as well if the lawyer acts pro bono otherwise you may be asked to pay a contribution (usually not more than S$1,500).  Some disbursements are payable by you as well.  You can get more details when attending at the Legal Aid Bureau.\n\nBest of luck and I hope all turns out well for you and your daughter.\n\nEdit:  You can ask maintenance for your daughter without giving the father custody.

So I think some of my tips could help you?\n\n1.  Make it a lifestyle and a habit - Ask yourself, what is your motivation for wanting to go to a gym? You want to look good for an event? Or you want to be healthier for a long time? If you motivation is the latter, it will be easier for you to get through your anxiety of going to a gym and going there consistently.\n\n2. Is gymming really for you? - There are many ways to exercise/lose weight. Find something that you ENJOY and have fun with rather than give you pressure. You can exercise simply by hiking / dancing/ playing sports with your friends etc. Like for me personally, i managed to lose some fats just by playing JUST DANCE on my nitendo switch for at least 30 mins everyday and I do it because I enjoy it, losing weight becomes naturally part of the process and it is an enjoyable one. Don\'t force yourself to do what you don\'t like. Getting healthier should be an enjoyable proccess (that\'s how you make it a long term thing!)\n\n3. Get a friend to go with you - get a friend that is EQUALLY or even more motivated to get healthy and fit with you to gym together. He/She would help to distract you from the ""unwanted attention"" from others. I remembered feeling the same way as you when I first started gymming. It got better when I went with a friend and I eventually prefer to go alone.\n\n4.  Remember that everyone else in the gym is FOCUSED on their own workout rather than others- IF your anxiety of going to the gym because you are scared of being judged by others then dont worry...everyone else is busy with their own workouts to care about others. Is ok to look stupid or bad in the gym because it is a place of self improvments. Other people look bad too, is just we dont know because we never look at them!\n\n5. Blast your own music, wear a cap - So you can focus on yourself and your workout durinng your gymming sessions\n\n\n\nSome other tips that are not related to gymming that might help with your weight loss journey: \n\n6. To lose body fat , your diet > exercise. For losing weight, is always 30% exercise, 70% diet. Focus on your diet more, cut down on oily foods, sauces, sugar and processed food. Eat super clean and make sure you shit almost everyday. What you eat is what you are. Have the mentality that you are eating for energy/survival, cut down on all the indulgences like snacks or cakes, anything unnecessary. Dont ever eat supper too. But is ok to have some cheat days (with control lol)\n\n7. More movements - What I meant by this is not necessarily exercise but increase your daily movements. Meaning, instead of lying down on the sofa, go for a walk or do some housework. Instead of sitting down most of your time, do some stretches. Gymming wont really make a huge difference if you are just going to gym once a week because easily 70% of your week is still dependent on your day to day movements. You will be surprised at how simply just choosing to walk more/ doing more simple movements could affect you weight in the long term.\n\n8. To lose weight, cardio is the way - When you exercise, you dont transform fats into muscle (no such thing). Infact, you lose fats and gain muscle. Hence lifting weights or using those strength training equipment in the gym would  build muscles but not necssarily help u lose  your fats - you might end up looking bulky/muscular (nth wrong with that).CARDIO is the best way to lose fats and become the leanest in the fastest time so going for intense hikes ( e.g. diary farm route at Bukit Timah Hill) , jogging outdoors would help alot more. This is really based on my personal experience but this could work differently for different people.\n\n9.  Can try intermittent fasting - this is super effective but requires lots of discipline. I would usually havs my first meal at 1pm and last meal before 8pm. If intermittent fasting is too hadd on you, can try to stop eating entirely after 8pm.', 'Give a finger to anyone who doubts you or your appearance! Then get to work.

38,chemisdie,n9q5rw,[Rant] can’t do this anymore,2021-05-11 13:59:28,SGExams,77662,44,279,"tw: suicidal thoughts, self harm
(using a throwaway acc bc my friends know about my main one)

I am in school right now, and I wish more than anything else to be home, to be in my bed, away from everyone and everything.

I was getting better. I’ve been getting better. So when and how did I end up like this? I’m so unimaginably tired. Like, my head is literally in constant pain and I can feel the fatigue weighing me down. 

For context, ever since I started JC last year, I’ve been struggling. I went from being a great student in secondary school to failing everything. In summary, I hit rock bottom last year- my depression and anxiety got so bad that my parents (despite me trying to hide it) realised how not okay I was and sent me to a doctor for treatment.

I advanced to J2, and slowly got better. My grades were improving, and for my recent tests, I passed Math and got a B for bio. Did okay for the other subjects too. (BCMe) 

However, about 3 weeks ago, I started to feel like I was burning out. I’ve been studying much more than I used to, so I expected that, and therefore I decided to take a short break. But right then I got into a huge fight with my best friend in school because she found out about my self harm habits during the holidays last year when I was still struggling (she saw the scars and i usually wear a jacket and i didnt that day). She was angry that I didn’t ask for help, and she told me that she couldn’t be friends with someone who didn’t want to help herself. So she ignored me in school for a while, and that exhausted me a lot because I’m an introvert so I don’t have many friends other than her to hang out with. (shes the only one i’m close to in our friend group) After a couple of days we talked it out and things were fine, but then more things started happening- another girl in my friend group started to break down in school non-stop, then our whole group got into a conflict, then my sister had to be admitted into the hospital, then I started fighting with my parents again...

Today I came to school and another friend of mine got pissed off at me because I was supposed to go eat lunch with her but I totally forgot because I’ve been so out of it lately, and I can’t make it because of another school commitment.

So now I’m in the toilet trying to not cry while I type this stupid rant.

There’s only so much I can take, I just feel so overwhelmed, and the past few weeks I’ve been feeling like I’m back at square one. They’ve been foggy and tainted with suicidal thoughts and just constant anxiety. I have no energy to study, no will to do anything. All my friends are leaving me. I’m a burden to my family. Nothing good ever happens in my life because I don’t deserve it. Last weekend I found the suicide note I wrote last year and had this thought that even though it felt like things were getting better, nothing has changed, and nothing will.

I haven’t been to therapy in a while because my parents had a falling out with the clinic. Of course they did. (they had some complaints idk tho didnt really talk about it to me and never asked me if i wanted to go to another clinic so) So I havent had professional help for months now. But i’m so close to breaking, I can feel it and i’m scared. 

Is it possible for me to see a doctor at a polyclinic for mental health issues? Without my parents knowing? They are under the impression that I’m okay now and it’s not worth the fight and emotional struggle to explain to them what’s going on. 

Thanks for reading this rant.

39,RysonRonald,mb44b9,Friendly Neighbourhood Ang Moh needs some advice from r/Singapore,2021-03-23 10:12:01,singapore,378640,241,830,"Hey guys this may be a little long. Also, apologies if this is in the wrong place but I felt that it is too long story for a daily thread and the story adds some context to the questions I have. 

Story time....a year and a half ago before this COVID mess met and fell madly in love with a lovely Singaporean girl. I was working in your beautiful city  at the time and we have been inseparable ever since. Last September I got the phone call that everyone dreads. My father unexpectedly and suddenly passed away. 

I flew back to Scotland and generally had a miserable time until this little ray of Singaporean sunshine called to say she had booked flights to come and see me and check up on her guy....half the world away. This blew me away. 

What happened next turned our worlds upside down again....she fell pregnant. This was amazing news, although we didnt directly plan it, this little surprise bump has brought meaning and after the misery of 2020 things are looking up. 

Late Feb 2021, after a full month in quarantine (2 weeks in Dubai then 2 weeks in Singapore). We were back in the Garden City when once again more bad news hit us. The job I had been promised was no longer an option and with that it's going to be doubtful that I will be allowed to stay in Singapore with my love and my kid thats on the way (g/f is currently 21 weeks along). 

I had always planned to marry this girl but now it looks like I am going to have to hurry this plan up if I want to be here to support my girlfriend, baby and actually be here for the birth. 

So, my questions are:
1. Where can I get a ring that wont cost me an arm and a leg? (I am on a super low budget, havent had a wage since October)
2. Where would you recommend for a romantic proposal? Again I am absolutely out of money but i want to make this special for this wonderful human. 
3. Do you guys have any other advice for a guy in my situation? 

Also, I'm trying to keep this a secret from her for obvious reasons and I know she doesnt have a Reddit account so ideally the discussion would stay here rather than making its way to Stomp etc. 

Thanks in advance Singapore. Your Friendly Neighbourhood Ang Moh.

*EDIT*
Guys, thank you so much for the great advice and the condolences and congratulations so far. I knew you good hearted Singaporeans would help out and I have been overwhelmed by the support and advice. Sincere thanks. 

I completely appreciate the advice about focusing on the Visa and job situation and trust me that is the main priority and we are working hard in that regard, it is most definately the primary focus but adding a little romance into the mix never hurt anyone! But i definately will be going for as cheap a ring as possible and pushing through the ROM asap. 

I am already working on a short term contract to fix one aircraft which will hopefully lead to something more concrete and longer term which will in turn support my Visa case. Even though I am almost jobless I have never been busier in preparation for the birth of this kid. I am also working on a side project upcycling old aircraft parts into furniture which although wont help the Visa situation it will hopefully bear fruit soon in a monetary sense. 

Yes, you guys are right. I am up against it. Big time. But, like they say, and this statement is rather fitting.

If she likes the outdoors, Seletar Reservoir Park is dead quiet at almost any time of day so you have a pretty view of the reservoir and not a lot of public eyes (no nearby good food and getting there may make her suspicious if you are going for a surprise, but there is always lots of parking).

It's all just De Beers advertising. Younger people nowadays are getting smarter about stupid products like this. To spend excessively nowadays may instead incur concern about your financial decision making skills (depending on your girl's personality). Always spend within your means. \n\nFrom personal observation, $1k+ and mass-produced rings (which are still overpriced for being useless things) are socially acceptable nowadays. Gone are the days where you have to spend 2.5x your monthly salary on a ring, when people were stupidly falling for the De Beers advertisement. \n\n1) You can get cheap rings everywhere. Try those major jewellery chains, they are bound to have some sale somewhere with good quality GIA diamonds. \n\n2) If you want something customised but still cheap, try eClarity. You can search their website for their database of diamond specs (all GIA certified). My personal recommendation is to focus on the size and the Holloway Cut Advisor calculation, as that calculation tells you the **shine** factor. You can find a calculator [here](https://www.pricescope.com/tools/hca). \n\n3) You don't need to be so demanding with stuff like colour (IMO anything J and above should be fine) or clarity (IMO anything VS and above is fine). Anything J and above appears white. It only appears off-white when you place it next right to a much higher grade demanding (e.g. D and above) and inspect it under a perfectly white light. It won't show when you're wearing it in your daily life. Same for clarity, it can only be seen with jeweller's magnifying lenses. Your friends won't be walking around with those on their eyes.\n\n4) A focus on size and shine (i.e. HCA) will impress the most people in passing.

That’s like saying any offensive term in, let’s say English, cannot be called out by a non-English speaking person. So if an American uses a term for a Spanish person that is offensive, the Spanish person has no right to say it is offensive. Honestly, there is so little logic to your argument it is laughable. Particularly the part where you assume “most Ang Moh here know”. I don’t think you can speak on their behalf…\n\nOr the part where you assume all Black Americans use the N-word themselves where I’m sure many would not. I really recommend you educate yourself on this word because you seem very ignorant of it. \n\nAnyway, does anyone else have thoughts on this? I would like to know if anyone has examples of how it is/isn’t offensive? Sometimes it is used matter of fact and I think it’s just about acceptable (although again, in my opinion labels are always dangerous and shouldn’t be used).

I already graduated with a Bachelor's in Animation before but it never really went further than 2D animation. I'd previously wanted to go to SG as my first choice before here, but I was still a confused applicant then so I just decided on studying in the Philippines instead.

My parents have already given me the go signal for it, but since I don't understand the economy too much, I don't know what kind of place is ""too cheap"" or ""too expensive"" or somewhere in between. My parents are supportive and have the money, but they can be a little too shrewd with money sometimes so when I tried looking for places to rent out earlier, I got really overwhelmed and confused. I don't know what's good or not, nor the reputation of certain places or how hard it is to get from A to B.

I'd appreciate any kind of jumping off point so I can look into it better myself or advice from anyone who's had experience looking for places to rent as well. As of right now, I'm just completely stumped. Thanks to anyone who could help in advance!

43,Outrageous_Judge_750,nuf85a,[Rant] Too high expectations on myself ?,2021-06-07 23:25:47,SGExams,77662,9,47,"I am a Secondary 4 student taking o levels this year. 

Some background information on what happen in my Secondary school journey : 

In Sec 1, I had very bad results and didnt really care much about studying and hence failed quite a number of subjects. But despite having bad results, I was the chairperson of the class so all was good then apart from failing exams. 

In Sec 2, I joined student council and also another leadership group and started to put in more effort when it comes to studying. However, I had a really bad friendship issue with my friend(s) and well this resulted me to be extremely stress up in July due to the extra commitments, sudden motivation to study + the sudden lost of friends. I remembered at that particular period, I had insomnia and stress up till the extend of losing appetite for a few days. Well the good thing is after crying in school Infront of the class in the middle of recess my friend decided to you know be friends wit me again and all was good. My grades are improving and there isn't much friendship issues 

Well in Sec 3 it was like a disator. I had friendship issue with that particular friend again and after that we didnt talk to each other any more. And I had even more commitments, resulting in my having to stay back every single day rushing around the school, having to constantly try to catch up what I miss due to the clash of various events resulting to me being able to join only 1 event at a time. Apart from that, my results clearly improve and hence for all exam I will definitely be able to get top in the class for at least 1 subject or a paper and this actually ""attractied"" some people who just like to talk about other people behind their backs ... So I was like being ""mock"" by some people and people around me started to have highly expectations of me. And finally in the end of last year, I was too overwhelmed and hence release my stress in a not very pleasent manner. I did talk to my teacher about it but I really don't wanna disturb her anymore. (She needs her own time and needs to sleep too). 

And finally in Sec 4. After my parents know about my way of releasing stress, I stop. But on and off have the thought of doing it again . Well I step down from CCA and all the other commitments but I just have this weird feeling. I just felt like I didn't study enough and have this constant feeling that I will not do well in the next exam. Like no matter how good my results are, I just feel like I did badly . I know my parents and teachers didn't put any pressure on me but I just have this feeling that I have to do better. I am like honestly very lost right now and I don't know what to do. 

Well if you read through all this, thank you so much :) an sorry for all the broken English + Grammar mistakes",0.89,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nuf85a/rant_too_high_expectations_on_myself/,"[""hello I'm also a sec 4 and can relate to you!! during my lower years I had q a number of fs problems which resulted in me wanting to just slack every day. ended up not doing very well. only started to hardcore study during sec 3, which then lead to me scoring better than average. like you, people talked behind my back, saying I'm a tryhard/overachiever etc. I'm just trying to say that these kind of people are just jealous of your progress and you need to ignore them. these kind of people really have nothing to do lmao. and for the expectations part, I relate too. I think my teachers and friends have very high expectations of me (eg. when the teacher is abt to say who scored the highest, my friends start to say my name, or my teacher publicly saying that I could have gotten highest if I wasn't careless etc) which resulted in me being overly anxious since I don't want to let them down. this was last year. the main point is that you need to focus on yourself. don't care about disappointing others. as long as you achieve your own personal goal, it's already an achievement. don't depend on what others say/think to determine whether you did well on not. always think positively. regarding your own expectations this year, I think it's normal? since we're going through olvls and we need abit of stress. but don't set expectations too high because you might get demoralised/lose hope easily. also I think it's good to constantly want to improve. but don't stress yourself too much, you can set mini goals and take small steps. if you need anyone to talk to can just pm me 🙂"", 'Falling behind on grades, social issues… I faced them in upper sec too. I was in sec 4 last year and was often (more like too often) on the verge of or already breaking down.

Try your best not to think of anything but the present moment.\n\nAnother thing is to realise healthier coping mechanisms that work for you, like colouring or exercising or crying or napping (in moderation of course)\n\nAlso!!! Take note of your own progress! Despite what your conscience tricks u into worrying about! I was borderline passing subjects up till prelims, which is very scary. My principal gave my batch a post-prelim briefing abt how like if u’re at this band B, aim for A, at band C, aim for band B etc (she created the bands herself haha) and I wasn’t even in the lowest band she described LOL.

I've experienced this back in my high school albeit my falling out was with my entire CCA from sec 3 to 4 and it was a major cause of stress for me. Instead of studying, I would spend hours just trying to figure out what went wrong and how I could have acted better to prevent it. This resulted in my constant regression of grades and while my classmates were amping up their efforts for the last lap I was too caught up in my emotions to even start studying until it was too late. Coming from a prestigious SAP school, my O level grades were less than desirable and there isn't a day I wish that I had just sucked it up then and focused on my studying than on people who never really were or will be my friends. However, it was a period of significant emotional growth for me and while I never really got the closure I wanted, I got the closure I needed - it is what it is. There are circumstances that are always out of our control, what matters is how we react to it. I understand this is extremely difficult but what you really need to do right now is keep your head down and just focus on yourself. At the end of the day, if you how you perform at the O's is not going to affect the people who tried to bring you down, it affects you. Don't let your emotions/people who are fleeting be a hindrance to what you could have achieved.\n\nAll the best for O's!!"", ""yoo. i was a failing student throughout school and was supposed to retain this year. when i picked myself up and earned an award for improvement to an average of B3, my classmates found it as ego. the only reason i move forward is because my friends are all 23-26. about ten years older than me, the best advice is to focus on yourself. not just in studies, but improving your own train of thought is a start. if you find it difficult to find will of doing things, try doing a few exercises and not stopping after reaching a goal of for example 50 push ups. i'll pm you more"", ""A big exam a few months down the road can seem very daunting indeed. You can take control of the situation by working out a study plan from today till the exams. Break it down into daily steps, hourly accomplishments, take breaks when you've finished what you plan to do. It adds up and you can see yourself building up to the exams.

There's like a relatively big bunch of students in YIJC, why didn't they retake o-levels for one more year to enter a better JC? And instead opt for the YIJC route instead? The JC you enter is important yes, but at the end of the day, a L1R5 6 student in a good JC can end up scoring a poor RP. Statistically, YIJC still has 80+rp scorers.

Mon-fri 9-6 sat 9-1 
Weekends expect us 24/7
Weekdays too. 
I don't get it, there are some staff which are really available throughout the weekends. Makes me dumbfounded and just sad for a whole week. 

My salary is 2.3~2.6 there's a fix but I won't exactly say. 

I mean... I initially accepted as I thought it's a test to see if one is willing to help if really needed, I can assist for a couple of minutes. But damn... If boss leave 8 I can only leave after him, sometimes boss stay till 10pm or have events I also need to stay . 

Is this legal? That's what made me curious.
I'm just, sad. If I terminate need 3 month notice... The hell...
How should I retaliate. I'm so worn out. I've work less than a week and I'm having palpitations just waking up and always ""ready for his text and call""

How am I able to find a new job if it needs 3 month notice??

Update 1: gonna just talk to my boss regarding my unhappiness. Let's hope nothing bad comes out of it

Update 2: I really don't wanna work weekends, I burntout easily. What if my boss said I can't quit and have to serve 3 months, ask me to come back during weekends even if I really didn't want? And he said it's in the contract.

Update 3 : thanks for the overwhelming response ! It's 2.05 am now and still unable to sleep, sighs. I'm really thinking alot :( I hate this.

Update 4 : yup couldn't sleep at all and don't plan to do it at all.

Last update : I'll try to keep it short. Boss keeps talking about achievements, what I'll gain etc if I was with him, downplaying cleaners and sweepers also me. HR talked to me for more than an hour,followed by boss too.
If you asked me, just feel like the staff got brainwashed and the owner and HR is exceptionally persuasive to work in a toxic culture environment, becuz willing to hustle , makes a diff on and on.

46,dhduifcdkdid,mt88dz,Tale of a foodpanda rider,2021-04-18 15:24:36,singapore,378640,60,215,"Hi guys, I am a foodpanda rider and I am here to share about the experience as a rider in foodpanda. I previously got my torchlight stolen and a lot of you reached out and even offered to help purchased a torchlight for me! I was really overwhelmed with the response and strength of the community.

DISCLAIMER: This is only my experience, it does not represent the experience of all foodpanda riders.

&#x200B;

The foodpanda support is really bad, I know. And so is the foodpanda RIDER support. They almost never resolve any issues.

&#x200B;

In foodpanda, there is a batch system, you are ranked 1 to 4, 1 being the highest, for your performance the previous week. A higher batch of course gives a higher pay. A batch  1 rider will have a pay of at least $7 per order, while a batch 4 rider will receive in the range of low $4. You are ranked based on 3 criterias. Special hours, actual vs planned work time and acceptance rate. Special hours are just peak hours that you are working. Actual vs planned work time is the percentage of time you worked to the hours you booked. So let's say you book a 1 hour shift, if you work only 59 minutes, your percentage will be 0.98333. Lastly, acceptance rate, whether you accepted the order given. Means you can't decline any orders. Well, the fucked up part about this system is, in order to get to batch 1 and 2, you need to have at least 100% in both actual vs planned, and acceptance rate. Means for the hours you worked, you can't take a ""break"".

&#x200B;

Here is the main part of my experience. I got thrown off the week before by ""App issues"". I was all 100%, and projected to be in batch 2 - you can see the live scores on the app. I was cycling back to the mall, and when I reached the mall, I realised I was put on a ""system break"", a forced break by the system because you probably did something wrong. I contacted the support and was told in my 5 mins travel time, I missed 3 orders? For my entire week and hours of working I did not miss any orders, and now, the support tells me I missed 3 orders and was put on a forced break for 5 mins. Then I looked at my batch score, from 2, I was put in the last batch. It was already Saturday. There was no way I could even make it to batch 3. I submitted a ticket for my problem, and because apparently many other riders also faced this issue, it was just brushed off. But I needed to let this go as, maybe really I did miss the super noisy alarm when you receive an order. 3 times.

&#x200B;

Coming next week, as usual worked my ass off the entire week, Tuesday to Sunday. On Sunday, as usual, things happened. I received a subway order at 12pm, an order of 6 subway meals. If you did not know, Subway is the most painful order a rider could receive. Because the ordered sandwiches will not be prioritized. A long ass receipt will be printed with all the order information. Vegetables, onions, pickles, yada yada. Its too long for any person to want to take a look at it. Customers on the ground queueing will be served first. I waited for about 30 minutes at the Subway restaurant. I could see it was really busy and the staff had not started to prepare it yet. Suddenly, I received a message from the customer: ""I want to cancel the order, can you please help to cancel?"". As a rider, I cannot cancel any orders, the SOP would be to contact foodpanda support. So I contacted them, and they called the customer. I then told Subway to stop producing the orders. I mean, don't make sense to make 6 customized sandwiches just to be thrown right? The support usually takes awhile and the subway restaurant I was sent to, was in quite a ulu place, wasn't a mall. So I rode back to the mall. About 10 minutes later, I was told by the support that the customer did not want to cancel anymore?? In other words, I had to go back to Subway, tell them to make the order again and wait for another 30 minutes?? I had no choice but to redispatch the order - another rider will come and take the order. Yup, and redispatching the order put my on a 5 minute ""system break"" and my acceptance rate dropped. This time I was projected to be in batch 1, and when I checked again, batch 3. Booom, my pay for the next week decreased by 30 percent, just like this. I submitted a ticket, asking for help. Again, no avail. ""I am sorry to hear that. I will bring this up to the relevant department. In the meantime, this ticket will be marked as resolved"". But I guess I need to let this go. Maybe it was my fault for assuming the customer will not change his mind. Maybe I do not belong in batch 1 since I can't even wait for 1hour for a 5$ pay order - Grab reimburses for time waited.

&#x200B;

And fast forward next week, the same App Issue happened, I clearly missed out the annoying alarm, and my batch score was back to 4 again... Well this post has been long enough. You guys already know what will happen next.

&#x200B;

Yup I know! Recently, there have been a lot of memes about foodpanda support. It's not only foodpanda support, its also foodpanda RIDER support! I really think the problem underlies in having an offshore support team. If you don't already know, most of the live chat support that you contact that from overseas. And I guess because things are a little different there, there may be some miscommunications.

&#x200B;

Oh, and pandamart, expired food? I don't know. Oh, by the way, you can order alcoholic drinks after 10.30pm if you purchase from the pandamart! Please keep it a secret.

&#x200B;

tldr: foodpanda is really bad, does anyone have a night shift job :\\

UPDATE: THE APP THING HAPPENED AGAIN. wow jumped from batch 1 to batch 4. lol started to think its on purpose

The system issue occurs quite often to us and we\'re of course very upset by it. There is this belief they do it intentionally cos they wanna lower cost and dont want to pay as much. It happened so often on Sundays that a lot of us dont want to work on Sunday. Thats until they make Sunday as ""Special Hours"". Those who takes care of their batch will have to work then.\n\nSince we\'re bigger, we have distance issues. For example, I once dropped an order and received another from the other side of the hill. Maps showed about 10km distance. Imagine that, 10km pickup just to send it to less than 1km from vendor. I drove there and when I was about to arrive, the system put me on break because I was not close to the vendor. When the break ended, they gave me literally the same order that put me break.

Just assume you will forever be in batch 4 and during those times that you managed to get batch 1 - 3, treat it like a bonus.

I read 金庸 as a child (shoutout to Channel U for playing 天龙八部/ 射雕 back in 2003? 2005?), read 古龙 etc., also read 卫斯理, the 四大名著 etc (pretty basic stuff). (all when I was a kid, studying in Malaysia). Because I loved the language so much, I did also read more into how 文言文 etc was used (but never went too far). Also I regularly read a lot of 小说 lolol. \n\nThen when I moved to SG for sec school, I felt that the syllabus wasn’t enough to support the students to read the level that I was reading at. Friends around me were mostly concerned in getting A1s/A2s in higher chinese (in upper sec), and not necessarily to learn what went beyond it. Our essays in class were flat and boring, and we never really had the luxury of exploring how the Chinese language should really be. All those STUPID 新闻报道 nonsense. I’ve never ever had a fun essay to write. My most interesting essay topic (only came up like once in higher chinese) was “假如流水能回头”. hahaha\n\nI found this to be taught very differently from English! Since English is my second language, it was fascinating to me to see how in Sec 1/2, there was something called “Language Arts”, and we’d start learning how to read simple plays etc. (and learn analysis). Whereas for Chinese, the focus was always still on fundamental stuff like writing essays etc. It was also really formulaic - aiming for a certain number of 成语s to get a certain number of points - you don’t really see that in English learning, right? Hence, it’s difficult to make students interested in anything that’s beyond the syllabus. And BECAUSE the syllabus itself is so boring and dry, it’s very difficult to make students genuinely love the language —> vicious cycle\n\nI know people who took Chinese lit in O-levels, and their syllabus is a little bit more fun, for sure. But I’d say it’s definitely a niche subject to take! A lot of Chinese/Malaysian scholars took it, only 3 locals in my junior’s batch I believe haha.\n\nP.S. I think the H2 syllabus posted in the thread seems pretty manageable (so glad to see 郭宝昆’s work on it), but I think if compared to what my brother was learning back in Malaysia (he went to a private Chinese high school), he’d probably have done it when he was around 15/16, instead of 17/18 years old. \n\nUltimately I think the direction of Chinese learning comes down to what the SG government believes in — I’ve always scoffed at what they said about SG being a bilingual society — but is it really? It seems like MOE is more focused on learning Chinese because it’s practical and useful (don’t get me wrong, it is!), and not to promote the true appreciation of it. \n\nThat said, I could very well just be very biased because I think Chinese is a great language!

However, I wouldn’t call Mandarin (then) a foreign language for the reason that it was used in Chinese streamed schools and was already a local prestige language, just as Standard English is for Singaporeans at large currently. \n\nWhat has happened to Mandarin for a significant number (not all) of local Chinese kids is that they have so little meaningful contact with the language in their formative years that the teaching of the language may well be regarded as that of a language spoken primarily in a foreign country. They spend their lives socialising in Singaporean and studying and consuming pop culture in Standard English except for their five hours a week of MT lessons.

Often young people (like us?) bring in Western terms into our discourse that might not suit our cultural context. I’m not sure how well categories such as ‘conservative’, ‘liberal’, ‘boomer’, etc can be used to describe people and ideas here. One example would be on the issue of abortion, where we have an extremely pro-choice government that most here will regard as conservative. And then we have the frequent application of ‘boomer’ to our parents’ generation (and slightly older), a term which seems primarily to have been used to describe Western people who have little in common with our parents but that they were born around the same time. I certainly think that if we want to have useful discussions about generational and ideological gaps in Singapore we need to define clearly what those gaps are and the basis of these gaps, instead of wholesale importing Western terminology which can mean a thousand different things to different people, all of whom import the same term but without a common conception of what they mean', 'Do you know what the definition of the terms liberal and conservative?

They want real political parties and a government with an independent professional civil service limited by the rule of law. The belief is that social stability and long term economic growth are very dependent on these thing. The authoritarian side encompasses a coalition more or less  united by opposition to all of these things in the name of 'social stability' and the 'economic growth'.

That, however, in Western societies would be a value that is somewhat sui generis because what we do with regard to this is not practiced by people there in general to the same extent as us. So I’d agree with you that the spectrum can be applied to discussing our local context. \n\nThe issue I raised was that these terms might not be very helpful as they are already clouded by the connotations applied to them by Western politics, especially recent developments there. I don’t think, for example, that it is helpful to put the government in the same category as the Republicans or the r/sg community at large with the progressive wing of the Democrats because it obscures the actual situation here by imposing on it the baggage that comes with these terms.

Trust me, letting them know will be better than to let a project affect your relationships as i have had experiences with team mates whom don't contribute much so i had to work more just to cover them 😫 I would be more understanding if they explained their situation but they didn't...Whereas for the 2 projects, do them in advance throughout your 3 week hols! If u know that u won't be able to finish in time, start earlier! Working with friends can also help to track your work progress!

At this point I'm more stressed about my school environment than my academics, because my academics are fine. Not doing exactly well, but at my own pace. As a sec 5 kid going to a JC, I am definitely overwhelmed at the fast pace of teaching and the new environment. At first I was able to adapt to the new environment and the academic rigour of 

I had a group of friends in class for the past few months when JC starts. However, last week they just decided to ditch me completely and created a new group chat without me. I don't even know what did I do wrong. Was it because I have difficulties communicating with other people, making me essentially an outcast? Was it because I am being myself? at this point I'm so done. 

I started to get stressed over my project work, because the person who ditched me is in that group and I don't know what I should do about it. Other subjects have group work too, and I just am too anxious for that. 

I don't know whether I should consider transferring out next year to another JC in Year 2, or transferring out to another class, or just sucking things up as they are now. My mental health was never the best, and now it's just going downhill. I had trauma regarding friendship issues in the past, and all this is just igniting it up. but yeah. thanks for even listening :')

51,Otherwise-Fox7612,nm49el,[A Levels] Take Two - A passion project dedicated to those retaking A’s (and how you can help !),2021-05-27 18:16:50,SGExams,77662,13,174,"Hello! 

This is likely to be a lengthy post, but it’s for an important cause and a cause close to our hearts so do spare a few minutes if you’re able to :-) 

We are a group of students who have retaken the A-Level exams as private candidates and are now waiting for university to commence. We would like to do our little part to help others who might be considering retaking/are in the midst of retaking.

Introducing … Take Two! 

**About Take Two :** 

While Reddit is a useful source for many to find out more about retaking and gain insight from others, we realised that there is largely still a lot of confusion about retaking and little information regarding what retaking truly entails. The lack of a one-stop platform dedicated to providing resources and information about retaking & the retaking journey was a problem we wanted to solve. 

Hence, we decided to create Take Two - a website committed to being a one-stop platform students could go to, to find out all they need to know about retaking!

**The website will entail the following pages :** 

\- **Taking the First Step :** 

This page seeks to provide practical information regarding how to make the decision to retake and factors to consider 

\- **Taking Charge :** 

This page would provide students with resources (like study notes, guides etc.) and tips on how to plan & take charge of their learning (given most students have to study independently)

**- Taking Heart :** 

The retaking journey is emotionally challenging and mentally exhausting. Taking Heart seeks to provide insights on how students can manage their mental and emotional health & resources they could rely on.

**- Taking Inspiration :** 

Taking Inspiration serves to be a blog where ex-retakers can share their own stories about retaking and what they have learnt along their own journeys. The objective is to inspire others and provide various perspectives about retaking :-) 

The website is in its final stages of development and here is where we need your help! To make the website truly resourceful for retakers, we would love to have you contribute your stories/resources! 

**Here’s how you can help :** 

**Contribute to our blog !**

If you previously retook the A levels, do consider sharing your story! It could be about what you learnt from retaking/your success story/ what you wish someone would have told you while you were retaking. As long as you believe you have something meaningful to share, we’re more than happy to share it with others :-) 

(p.s your identity can be kept anonymous should you not want to disclose your name)

**Do email your stories to** [**reachtotaketwo@gmail.com**](mailto:reachtotaketwo@gmail.com) **by 10th June** 

**For everyone else :** 

**Sharing Resources**  

Under the taking charge section, we are planning to create a repository of notes for various subjects that retakers can refer to! We understand that some of you may not be willing to share notes for the fear that they might be circulated. To prevent this we have come up with the following measures 

**1) Only those retaking can access the notes :** Notes will be in a google drive folder with restricted access. We would require students to send in proof of them being private candidates/retaking A’s as a J3 student (eg: photos of their entry proof with their personal particulars blurred) before allowing them to access the notes. 

**2) Notes cannot be downloaded. Only viewed.**

**If you would like to share your personal notes/study guides do email them to** [**reachtotaketwo@gmail.com**](mailto:reachtotaketwo@gmail.com) **by 10th June**

If you are uncomfortable sharing your notes but have tips on how to do well for a certain subject, do still consider sharing your strategies! Also, if you have contacts of tutors who you would recommend to others/personally offer tuition services, do share the contacts with us so that we can feature them on our website :-) 

We’re looking to launch the website in the coming weeks (ideally in 4-5 weeks) so that it can still be useful to those currently retaking! Hence, if you would like to share something (your story/resources) do look to do so within the deadline stated, just so we can ensure there is a substantial amount of content on the website when it launches.

If you have any more questions, feel free to email us or send questions at Reachtotaketwo’s Tellonym and follow taketwo\_sg’s Instagram! we’ll be happy to respond to you :)

Thank you for your time ! We’re trying to do our little part to help make the retaking journey slightly less overwhelming & confusing for others and we hope we could get your support :-)",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nm49el/a_levels_take_two_a_passion_project_dedicated_to/,"['hi there !! this honestly sounds like a rly good project 💓 ty for taking the time to do this :) i’ll be sure to contribute what i can', ""hi, thanks for doing this omg! you'll definitely help many people because retaking A levels is such a scary and lonely phase in life  <3 To all the retakers dont give up!"", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nm4xhc/o\\_levels\\_retaking\\_oa\\_levels\\_in\\_2021/', 'this is so wholesome and definitely belongs on r/mademesmile.

I am a student working a part time job on the weekends but stopping when it's exam season (to study)
My tuition is 2hours a week,80 dollars for 2 hours. 1 hour for Sciences (physics or chemistry) and the other hour for math.
To get to the point,its financially very draining and tiring to cough out 80$,sometimes during exam season when I need more tuition I would have to borrow money from my sister or family members because I cant support myself. 
I have been working at a fast food restaurant since I was sec 1,and I also had tuition since I was sec 1.
My goal when working is to make money to support my own tuition and reduce the financial burden of my parents.
My tuition has always been 80 dollars for 4 years. The same tuition teachers has been teaching me for 4 years but just something bad about her is that she is always late by like 10 mins and she always uses her phone(idk if that's normal for private tuition)

So anyways,that is the background info.
Main thing is that currently I'm struggling,alot.
I'm a sec 4 NA student taking Geography, social studies,math,physics,chemistry,DNT and EXPRESS English (I'm a sbb student)
The mid years just ended and I'm preparing for my prelims in july/Aug.
I did very badly,my goal is to go PFP and idk if I can make it.
My current mid years results EMB3 roughly 18-20
English (express convert na) 2
Math (6)(I failed)
SS (6) (I failed)
Geography (I'm not so sure I haven't gotten back my results for this but I think is a meh pass or fail)
DNT(failed )
Chemistry and physics (I got a 3)
Even tho the results is bad (18-20),my weighted exams was even worse it was like, 20++.I worked really hard for my midyear and it did improve by quite abit but not enough.
My goal for prelims is to get 13-15 and by nlvls get 9.
It seems impossible,u can slap me for having that much of a 'dream'

*I took CLB so I won't mention that la*

Is there anyone or any seniors that can help me? Any tuition centres or any free help or anything.
I currently have tuition for Math and physics/chem
Mostly I need tuition for Geography but any other subjects is fine .

honestly, I’m very overwhelmed by the changes because as an incoming freshman who’s abt to pursue life sci + usp, I can foresee how taxing the workload will be. 
currently, I have some doubts in mind so would greatly appreciate if anyone could help me out in answering it! ty!! 

1. Based on past years, USP students usually read their own modules to replace the GE pillars. However, with these new changes, how do I know what are the specific pillars that will be replaced? Same goes for the CHS common curriculum. 

2. I read on the website that students are not allowed to exceed 60MCs for Level 1000 mods. However, based on the current requirements, I don’t understand how does one not exceed it...? I have level 1000 mods to fulfil in CHS common curriculum, USP, GEs and also my own major.

What that exceeding Level 1000 module statement means that you cannot take more than 15 Level 1000 modules. Also, many of the previous Life Sci modules that were at Level 1000 is now at Level 2000/3000. Don't have to worry too much about that requirement. \n\n3) GE are subsumed under CHS.

58,Infinite_Willow,nfkja1,Self-inflicted sleep deprivation,2021-05-19 03:58:09,nus,21212,9,51,"Hey guys, as said in the title.

I often find myself sleeping at the most nocturnal times possible (now it's looking to more of 5.00/6.00 in the morning) on days such as now as I enter the holidays. To be honest, I never found sleeping early to be pleasant, as I always ended up with vivid dreams that always were kinda to very nightmarish. I also found that the day lasts too short, and would try to extend it by burning into the wee hours, until I hide the fact that I am sleeping so late from my parents who get up around then. I also found that I would just black out after sleeping late, and wake up with no recollection of any dream.

Should I seek help or something? Recently I think I am getting hallucinations or something, like out of the corner of my eye I see small dots or something not there, and even experience microsleeps. For some reason I can force myself to sleep during exam periods, and during school terms I am so overwhelmed with studies that I just dream about the shit I am studying, but once that is over my sleep schedule is gone.

P.S. By the way, I delayed the start of my driving lessons because I think I might run over someone, even on the circuit. Or who knows, some crazy instructor might make me drive on the road from the start. I don't know why am I including this, but I guess I would like to talk to someone about this. Though, I have no idea how to tell my parents about me sleeping at 5.00 or needing to cancel driving lessons cos I am a walking mess.",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/nfkja1/selfinflicted_sleep_deprivation/,"['Going through the same sleep deprivation cycle.

My sleep schedule has been past midnight during uni as well, maybe like 3-4am, depending on how early my next day is. But since Covid (start of last year), it has gradually become worse. Last year I'd sleep around 6-7am if I didn't have anything early the next day. Earlier if I have a morning class. Since last Decemeber though, it's become up till 7-8am ish (hence the timing of this comment).\n\nAnyway, the schedule alone seems normal enough. It's very common for uni students to sleep past midnight or have a somewhat wonky sleep schedule, and I think Covid/e-learning does provide added changes. I don't think that alone is a cause for concern, given that you can change if you wanted to. Most of what you shared actually has similarities with my own lifestyle (e.g. sleeping at a time my parents would wake, or being able to sleep earlier near exams) - and I'm personally doing really fine. More of a stubborness and night-lover thing for me.\n\nWhere I think doesn't sound too normal is the hallucinations. Those images you're seeing might be due to some kind of deep-seated fatigue, and the mcirosleeps don't sound good too. You dreaming about studies often seems to be a result of stress or paranoia too, but is probably less serious than the hallucinations and microsleeps. I am no expert on this but it might be worth seeking some medical or professional help to look into this. A consultation with a professional wouldn't hurt, and could really improve things for you.\n\nI seldom comment on Reddit, but am saying all this because I am also quite a nocturnal myself but I don't personally face those problems you listed, in case it is of useful insight to you.

I'm using my other account so people who know me won't know it's me. I feel like a no one. i have no one to rant to so I'm ranting here. I have friends and all but no close friends. And all of my friends think I'm a happy and carefree person, they don't know im a emotional, anxious and easily depressed person. I always hid behind this happy, friendly, carefree facade with everyone. In sec 3 things were going bad and I had suicidal thoughts. I self harmed and I tried to commit suicide with a knive and I was holding it but I couldn't do it. I'm scared that if people see the real me they will leave me. I'm just really broken inside. I have been bullied/outcasted in kindergarten and primary school. In secondary school I started putting up this facade, I was still a loner sometimes and still had drama with classmates which I couldn't avoid. Because of all these I have incredibly low self-esteem. Fast forward to now, I'm in an new class where I don't know anyone. I see people in my class talking and hanging out and I feel lonely. I just wanna disappear. I feel very useless, worthless and inferior to everyone tbh I believe if I disappear no one would really care except for my parents. Everyday I go to school and come back feeling like shit.

Things were fine and I was doing really well a d great before school started. Now school has started and I have become a mess again. I have been thinking whether or not I should visit my school counselor but I'm also anxious about that with so many thoughts.

My summer plan was reading up others\' journey and gathering as much information as I could.\n\nI completed my part-time studies with first class honours, got promoted a year later. I saved up what I thought was enough for 9 months of travel and I quitted my job at 27. That was that scariest thing I ever did because I have been financially independent with a job since I was 19.\n\n9 months of travelling on scooter became 27 months. The people I met along the way have greatly challenged many perspective of things, money, relationship with people, expectations and my identity. I learn to let go of many expectations of myself and others. Expectations are often the root of anxiety which are often imposed by society and ourselves. \n\nI also realised I do not need many things to be happy. Living with just 50kg of essentials on me for two years, I was the happiest because I do not have to fit into any societal norm and just be who I am and go wherever the road takes me. I have met people who have the money and status but they are suspicious of people they meet and not truly free. True bliss is not what you have but having the freedom to live the life you want.\n\nI often share my experiences and reflection on social media. I left Singapore with a thousand followers on Facebook page and now 73,000 followers from all over the world. I was invited to speak in Dubai and London. In London, a woman recognised me and teared, because a post about mother letting their daughter travel touched her deeply.\n\nA Pakistani girl whose family hosted me is now studying in different countries. With her independence and global experience, she is actively involved in empowering women in her community. I commented how proud I am of her and she told me, ""You are the first woman I met who is truly a free bird. Juvena, you shaped my journey very much."" Unintentionally, my crazy solo journey has ignited women\'s belief in their capabilities and worth.\n\nI no longer tie success to a title or the things one owns. My definition of success is being at peace with myself at this present and how I can inspire people. Coming to career, what am I doing for a living now? I am self-employed, doing a variety of things. Ever since coming back, I have worked in restaurants, do food delivery, giving tuition, teaching yoga, creating travel contents, speaking at public and corporate events. Some jobs like tuition offer more stability while others like speaking engagements, I am working to make this more sustainable.\n\nYes, I had to forgo previous career stability for this but I find what I am doing now to be more fulfilling. No matter what decision you make, there is bound to be struggles, be it physical, emotional, financial. The question is ""Is that struggle worth it?""\n\nSo that was my many summer plans seeding a dream and which ended fruiting into a two years adventure that in some way earn me some money and more importantly inspire others. \n\nIt may be that when we no longer know what to do, we have come to our real work,and that when we no longer know which way to go, we have come to our real journey.The mind that is not baffled is not employed.

After being stuck in the army for the past 4 years, my outside life kinda eroded away over time.

62,samtantx,me5bcf,"[A Levels] Mistakes I made chasing ""success"" in JC and what you can do instead",2021-03-27 11:06:33,SGExams,77662,36,444,"In JC, I was adamant to be the **best** student I could possibly be. I reasoned with myself that since I was going to be spending two years in JC, I might as well make this my number one priority and see how well I could do.

Furthermore, there was the added incentive of being able to apply for medicine if I was outstanding enough - I would be able to *impact people on a grander scale than ever before* through healthcare which is a dream come true!

Unfortunately, I did not take much time to consider how I would want to approach this goal. I *plunged headfirst* to this commitment without any concrete plans, made many mistakes, and did not address them until A levels were over.

Today, I want to share **3 key mistakes** I made in JC and the lessons I learned from them. My hope is that you would not repeat what I did and, if you find yourself in a similar situation, to inspire you to start doing something about it today.

&#x200B;

# Mistake 1: Developing unhealthy habits/coping mechanisms

As a perfectionist, I wanted to have perfect clarity of what I was learning and *would often stay up till 1-2 AM* just trying to complete additional practice questions. Hence, it was common for me to get only around 4-5 hours of sleep a night. To compensate, I would usually nap for 1-2 hours the following afternoon. This poor sleep schedule inevitably resulted in low concentration levels and fruitless study sessions. Thus, I had to spend a longer period of time studying, resulting in even lesser sleep the next day.

As a result of putting an unreasonable amount of stress and workload on myself throughout the weekdays, I would typically crash during the weekends, spending the majority of my time either *napping (for 3 hours at a time) or watching movies on Netflix* to escape the reality of schoolwork and commitments I had in the week ahead.

While I did fit in schoolwork throughout the weekends, it was very haphazard work as I could only think of relaxing. I would then ""chiong"" the remaining work on Sunday nights and thereafter will *still insist* on squeezing a movie in (probably as a form of denial), only sleeping at around 3 AM, beginning the entire self-destructive vicious cycle again.

Lessons:

1. Consistency > Intensity

While my intentions were good, I was setting myself up for failure by working too hard on some days and then doing close to nothing on other days. It is **much more sustainable to do a little each day** instead. There will be future opportunities (tests, tutorials, consultations) to solidify what you have just learned.

2. Facing reality can be really painful and difficult.

However, running away from it only delays the inevitable. Instead of trying to figure out everything at once, **slowly implement systems that will make your lifestyle more ""livable""**. This can be done so by devising healthier habits to deal with stress and allocating time for work, play/relaxation, and sleep. Through experimentation, decide on the best study method for individual subjects and stick with it. Lastly, naps are great but it is no substitute for a good's night sleep!

&#x200B;

# Mistake 2: Sacrificing the more important things in life (relationships and health) way too often

I recognise that sacrifice is needed, perhaps even necessary, as we pursue goals - be they academic, physical, or aesthetic - that mean a lot to us. However, in my pursuit for straight A's, I sacrificed spending time with my family and friends way too often *without valid justification*.

Whenever my family went out, be it visiting our grandparents or going somewhere new, I always argued that I ""*did not have the time*"" as I had to study and I wanted to just recuperate at home. This response slowly morphed into a habit and my relationship with my family members stagnated and subsequently declined since I was *not willing* to put in the time and effort to maintain our ties. As we are all older now and are in vastly different life stages with unique responsibilities, there are even fewer opportunities for us than before to physically meet together and strengthen our bonds. Hence, this is definitely one of my prime regrets.

I *neglected many friendships*, both old and new, throughout the 2 years in JC. I got easily carried away by the hustle and bustle of daily life and so connecting with many of my old friends wasn't even on my list of priorities. As for new friends in JC, I failed to realise that the people around me were pillars of support and encouragement and instead tried too hard solely relying on myself to get through school. I guess a large part of me was too arrogant and close-minded in the sense that I thought I didn't need new friends to grow up together with.

I *also* *placed much strain on both my physical and mental health*. I was constantly stressed, thinking of how to make every moment productive and what next to improve on. Physically, I hardly exercised and drank monster energy drinks frequently to stay awake.

Lessons:

3. The longest study - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KkKuTCFvzI) \- on happiness concluded that **a good life is built with good relationships** (family, friends, and community). With this, **prioritise family time** and **make a deliberate effort to stay connected to the friends that matter**.

Even if you operate best alone, **build healthy and positive connections with the people that surround you daily** as it can make the journey a lot more constructive, sustainable and memorable.

Having time for something/someone is simply a matter of priorities. The next instance you think you have ""no time"" for someone, understand that you actually mean that they are ""not a priority"" at that particular moment and then decide if that is indeed the case or not.

4. Health is wealth. **Exercise regularly, get your required nutrition and water intake, and sleep sufficiently!** Without good health, we are far from our optimal state to maximise our day.

&#x200B;

# Mistake 3: Letting schooling interfere with education

Other than progressing in my studies, I *barely worked* on the other domains of my life during my JC days. While I did participate in numerous enrichment activities and organised a few others, the truth was that my heart was hardly involved in these projects as I was more concerned with how it would ""*beautify*"" my portfolio. I didn't train myself to become more resilient to failure - I forgo opportunities unless I was very certain of ""success"" - and there were close to 0 attempts at achieving balance in my life so I couldn't learn much about how I could handle stressful periods of time properly. I also slashed away the time spent on my hobbies and passions, failing to gain valuable experience and potential friendships.

Lesson:

5. To the vast majority of people, if chasing titles (""Top student award"") and excellence means you have to solely focus on academics and events that will boost your portfolio, I will say that it is **not worth it**. Whether it is learning sewing or trying out freestyle rapping, **make time to grow and learn in ways that are beyond the syllabus**. Do things that genuinely interest you and not just because it is a means to an end. Also, **don't give up** just because you think you might not succeed in the endeavour you're about to undertake. The great thing about being young is having the time to try out a variety of things, where failure is unlikely to be catastrophic!

\-

At this point, you may be wondering **how I eventually did for my A levels**. Without disclosing my actual score, I will say that I performed decently. I understand that this post could come across as *unnecessary and arrogant* because despite the mistakes I've made and the disappointment I feel, I did achieve a satisfactory RP (Rank point) and so there isn't much point lamenting about my shortcomings and should instead just be grateful of what I have accomplished. Additionally, some may also feel that I am being *inconsiderate of the feelings of others* who also walked a similar path but did not attain the results they desired.

I sincerely acknowledge your emotions and I believe that they are valid. Nevertheless, I believe that it is also important to recognise that unless you have perfect information about somebody else's situation, it is *futile* to dictate exactly how they should feel. Furthermore, there is little benefit of comparing RP because that isn't the main point of this post anyways. Instead, I hope that this post motivates you to **reflect** **on how you were throughout JC**. If you do so, I am almost 100% sure that there will be invaluable, unique and life-changing lessons from your journey that you can apply to your life to make your future experiences more fruitful.

I have to admit that many parts of this post are pretty cliche. However, I can guarantee that this is a genuine reflection of my JC days. I guess this only goes to show that the things people repeatedly tell you - Exams are just a milestone; results are not everything; your health and relationships should be your top priority - do contain **an element of truth** and it would be wise to keep these in mind.

Although some people will remark that ""A levels is *just* another pit stop in life"", I wouldn't say the same because I know exactly how vital it is to many JC kids out there, myself included. It is also extremely easy to feel overwhelmed throughout this journey, because even attaining some semblance of ""work-life harmony"" can seem like such an impossible task. Even so, approach JC the same way as you would with a math problem: **one step at a time**.

If anything, being in JC is a fantastic opportunity for you to not only realise that **progress is not linear**, but also to figure out **how you want to achieve balance in life** and what sacrifices you are willing to make to achieve your goals as this is a skill you are definitely going to use even after A levels.

Of course, what I wrote may not necessarily be 100% applicable to your situation so do only take what's useful and modify them if you have to.

Lastly, take care of your **relationships and health** as these remain essential, long after you forget what your rank points were!",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/me5bcf/a_levels_mistakes_i_made_chasing_success_in_jc/,"['As a person who is a year from his O-Levels, I am surprised and truthfully look like I really have to sacrifice some of my time and keep my work consistent.

Reward yourself sufficiently such that it encourages you to keep up this habit but not excessively such that you end up studying less than before.\n\nAs you build the habit of focussing on your studies, it will become easier! \n\nThe best advice for studying that I have ever followed was to do the most important thing(s) on your to-do list FIRST before doing other school work so this way you already clear the main work that gives you the most ""gains"" before proceeding on to other school work if you choose to do so.\n\nAll the best!', 'HAHA what you say is so true, we definitely have similar experiences 😅\n\nHope that things are better now though and that it will remain that way!', 'Thank you so much for your kind comments and for taking the time to read my post! :)', 'Thank you for your comment! I agree with you that it is indeed a fine line to thread when we say we do not want ""schooling to interfere with education"". \n\nFor many JC students, myself included, entering a desired uni and course of study is a key priority. As such, I am of a the view that focussing on A levels is vital, so that you can achieve the rank points you need to fulfill the prerequisites required for a particular course. However, I feel that the issue comes about when we focus so much on A levels that we do not even allocate time to do anything that can enrich us holistically. And I believe this is the case for many JC kids.\n\nHowever, the flip side may be true too, where we focus on so many things outside studying for A levels that in the end, we may not qualify for what we have been eyeing for 2 years. \n\nIn such cases, I think it is useful to see what such students are doing outside of studying for A levels. Perhaps for some, they may have an idea that is so extraordinary that everyone else can\'t seem to fathom and for others, it could just simply be the case of distracting themselves from what they need to do. For the former, who knows if these students could be future entrepreneurs with companies as successful as ""Razer"" and ""Secretlab""? And for the latter, perhaps they just need someone to help them refocus on what they want to achieve in JC. \n\nObviously, I\'m in no position to tell JC students that a particular path is the ""best"", I can only share what I think is the most ideal path for me. However, if I had children, I would probably share with them the two extreme balances that one can adopt and recommend a middle ground (with valid reasons) for them to follow. In the case that they still choose to not heed my advice, then I only hope that whatever ""success"" or ""failure"" that comes their way will be great lessons for them and that they apply it to their lives. \n\nI know parents want the best for their children and have good intentions for them, so thank you for keeping the interests of your children at heart!', 'Glad that these reminders were useful!\nAll the best with JC 💪', ""You're welcome! Thank you for reading as well! 😀"", 'Thank you so much for reading and sharing your experience with everyone!

It served as an extremely good reflection for me.\nAnd thank you! 😀👍', 'Glad that you changed for the better! Absolutely agree with you on developing self awareness and taking action as well. Hope you continue to take baby steps and improve daily!', ""Well, at least you've learned a valuable lesson! Although applying the lesson may be tough, I do hope that you will find ways to implement this into your life! 😀"", 'Thank you for reading as well! 😀', 'Hi, thank you for your kind comments! Actually spent quite a bit of time editing haha 😅\nGlad it was of value to you anyway! 😀', 'Hi, thank you for your kind comment! \nGlad it was of value 😀', 'Personally, I find that it helps to keep the content organised, making it easy to read. I would think that this makes absorbing information a lot better!', 'Hmm. Not sure about your case, but during my JC days, many around me were referencing to this ""impossibility trinity"" of sleep, social life and studies, where many of us would have to pick 2 and give up 1 if we want to ""survive"" JC. In fact, some of us jokingly mentioned that even focussing on 1 was tough enough. \n\nFrom such conversations and real life experiences, I think it is fairly common for most JC students, myself included, to experience this trade-off.\n\nWith that being said, there are students who are indeed able to establish a very healthy balance in their life, some even (seemingly) excelling in all domains of life. However, I am pretty sure that this is the exception rather than the norm.\n\nPerhaps you belong to the latter group, and I\'m genuinely happy for you! \n\nI guess this post is meant to target the majority of JC students, or even students from different education levels, to take a closer look at how they lead their lives as they go through Singapore\'s education system.', 'Thanks so much for the tips. Hope you succeed in the field/career that you like!', 'thank you🥰🥰', 'Yes, now self care is my priority!', '[deleted]', 'No problem at all. Thank you!', ""That's great 💪"", 'Ah I see what you mean. I have to agree with you about the part that ""JC students can afford to cut back their cramming"". I was also a ""victim"" of studying way too much and too detailedly where the returns:effort ratio was just too low but I just carried on doing what I was doing for fear of ""lack of preparation"".\n\nIt\'s worth nothing however that there will still be students who struggle with this balance even if they cram lesser because some of us just needs more time than most to learn and apply knowledge. Well, at least this is my view. \n\nEven if you still don\'t agree, thank you for your input! You brought up an excellent point that is worth considering/discussing.']"

Later A sent a chain of messages ranting about her feelings (how she felt horrible about her mother scolding her), then left the group chat and blocked me, my other best friend B, and my other friend C who was in the group chat with us, on Whatsapp. A blocking us is not really questionable behaviour, because I know from past experiences that its her way to cope with things and let herself get some space whenever shes overwhelmed by a situation, like her family or smth. Its sort of a coping mechanism for her to get a breather, then unblock us and rejoin the grp so i completely understand her blocking us. 
The thing that really got to me is that she posted on her instagram close friends list, ranting about how her mother is toxic and ruined mother's day. She posted it on her close friends list, but she wouldnt even talk about it with us, her best friends? Idk maybe im overthinking. Another thing that got to me is that us three (me, B, C), messaged her on Instagram the next morning to ask whether she was okay, and she just left us on read. I then asked her again at night whether she was feeling better, and she left me on read again. Usually, she'll come back after only a few hours, but its been like 2 days? and shes still ignoring us, and havent unblocked us. Another thing is that she seems completely fine on Instagram, posting stories about the neighbourhood cat and her pet birds. Idk but i feel like shes just plain ignoring me, my other best friend and my other friend even though we really didnt do anything wrong (or maybe we did but we didnt even criticise her for the dish she made or anyth, she wont even say anyth to us), while continuing to be active on social media and go on like normal.

Months later, one of the girl texted her and told her that maybe they shouldn't had treated her like that and should instead listen to my friend side to understand. But, she had stopped trusting others and didn't bother putting effort in making friends anymore, she had mental breakdown after knowing how disposable her those friends are treating her and how weak her friendship is.

some problems i have:

1. screen fatigue
2. hard to concentrate on what the teachers are saying
3. self-control issues(although it has gotten better since last year) when it comes to my phone
4. sleep schedule

For me, I would plan my time beforehand. For eg, I would look through my timetable for the day.

It is actually pretty normal to feel stressed/depressed/anxious during uncertain times. Accept that it is normal and take care of yourself.

65,starfuckeryy,mzbzpw,I'm so angry at myself. [Rant],2021-04-27 08:15:56,SGExams,77662,25,205,"I had an entire weekend to study for my math test tomorrow but instead I choose to avoid studying for it and procrastinate by using my phone instead??? I KNOW from experience that I'm too stupid to grasp concepts fast - I was revising completing the square yesterday for 3 HOURS and I still couldn't understand for some godforsaken reason - but nooooo I run away from the problem and do NOTHING to revise until the last minute. 

Is it really that difficult to get myself to just study? I'm not even diagnosed with ADHD or anything else, but yet I find it so difficult to start on homework of any kind. I'm sure that I don't have ADHD too because once I actually start on the task, I can focus quite easily. 

So now I'm stuck in a never-ending cycle of procrastinating because of my fear of failure, inevitably being disappointed in myself when my results come out and repeat. And due to my stupid decisions, I'm going to fail my test tomorrow because math is my worst subject and I still have 5 more topics to study (which I probably won't complete because it takes me hours to understand the simplest of concepts).

It's so pathetic considering the odds are stacked in my favour - I don't have family issues, financial issues or overbearing parents. There is no valid reason for me to avoid studying (my overwhelming fear of failure is just an excuse). I've already screwed up all of my tests so far - English, Elective History, 

 I'm so frustrated at myself because due to my stupid decisions I'm going to screw up my tests for this term and disappoint my family (again).",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/mzbzpw/im_so_angry_at_myself_rant/,"['ahhh op i totally understand this feeling !! procrastinating until the very last minute is also my bad habit (even after graduating .. i recently had an online interview to record and i did it two hours before the deadline)\n\ni feel like the avoidance comes from the fact that the task is difficult and thus ‘not fun’ + we all love that yummy instant gratification rip\n\ni used to do these things to help me focus well doing work, hopefully some of these can help!!\n\n- eat a small snack or have a couple of sweets to keep you going while studying \n\n- try focus apps! i like to use tide for the white noises, and there are plenty of pomodoro apps like donut dog (lol) that are pretty cute! i also used habitica which is like a gamified to-do list \n\n- when you study, be very clear what you want to accomplish and list it out! striking out the tasks so super satisfying; i used to make my tasks very small (q1 - 10 of my tys lmao) so that i could keep striking things out, which did help my motivation\n\nmany people go through this struggle, it’s understandable that you’re frustrated but don’t feel bad or embarrassed about it!! pace yourself, you’re going to be just fine :)', '[deleted]', 'What do you want to do with your life, career-wise?

And yes I do think that you should be angry at yourself, but not just feel angry about it: **make a change!** :)\n\nIf you find it hard to focus: I suggest **putting away all distractions** and keep yourself with only the things you need when you study, for my own personal experience, I liked listening to music and also putting a snack bag beside me for refreshment purposes. You could also ask friends to study together with you, if you don\'t like being alone.\n\nFor efficiency, it is better if you could set **targets and achieve them**. Revising bit by bit of the topics is not tough; if you simply depend on luck what are the chances to have Lucky Star on your side? Always open up and ask when you need help to understand concepts, don\'t feel upset if you are stuck someway through learning. Self-doubt and negativity easily crushes motivation.

66,Longjumping-Bed-9742,o1wn5l,CS Majors need help!,2021-06-17 20:59:02,nus,21212,2,7,"Hello, I am a CS student entering year 2 and I look forward to work in a software related field in future. I am a complete beginner when it comes to CS. I have a lot on my plate to learn like competitive coding, data structures and algorithms, web/app development, machine learning and the list goes on. I am overwhelmed to see the amount of work I have to do in the next 3 years to make myself capable to land with a decent job and good internships and to be at par with my fellow course-mates. The semesters are very intense for me and I am unable to devote time during the semester to learn all these skills that I mentioned above. 

Therefore I seek the advice of fellow CS majors on what I should learn first so that I am capable enough to apply for internships next year onwards. I also welcome any suggestions on how to increase the skillset and build a nice portfolio.",0.69,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/o1wn5l/cs_majors_need_help/,"[""First, you got to ask yourself what kind of job do you want to land at in the future. You answered software related field, but that is too broad. Specifically, do you want to be a software engineer (doing front-end, or back-end, or both), or do you want to do a focus area specific type of job (e.g. Machine Learning Engineer, Data Scientist, Security Engineer, Graphics Engineer etc). This is an important question as it tells you what kind of knowledge you would need.\n\nNext, the things on your plate that you have listed are too broad, and are often unrelated and unnecessary. For example, you certainly do not need competitive coding knowledge in most of the job (only a small handful of CS students actually take competitive programming). You also do not need web/app development if you are a Security Engineer or Machine Learning Engineer or Data Scientist. You do not need Machine Learning knowledge if you are a web/app developer. So the kind of knowledge you need depends on what you want to work on.\n\nMost of your peers will probably end up becoming Software Engineer, working on either front-end or backend. If you aspire to land in this route, then you can focus on picking up web/app stack. Specifically, for front-end web, pick up ReactJS or Angular, learn javascript html and css. For backend, pick up python / golang, sharpen your network theory, operating system theory, data structure theory. If you want to be an app developer, pick up React Native or Swift or Java/Kotlin in Android Studio.\n\nIn case you have not decide what you want to work in in the future, then just place your bucks at the common stuff that you need to know anyway. For example, learn data structures (those that are taught in 2040 and 3230 will suffice). Learn to solve leetcode question, because chances are you will need to do a technical interview to land an internship or job anyway. Don't learn Machine Learning unless you want to be a Data Scientist or ML Engineer. Otherwise it's probably useless because what you learn at your own will be too shallow to even be useful (even after you take 3 modules in AI focus area, the knowledge you gain are probably also too shallow to be able to use in a job). So don't waste your time learning ML. Don't learn competitive programming (spamming leetcode questions already sort of help you learn competitive programming at a very basic level).\n\nOn the part of what you should learn to apply for internship, learn git and github. You will probably have already picked them up in CS2103 anyway, so no worries. Other than that, just go in with an open mind and learn the tech stack during then. Some helpful stuff to know to have an easier time in internship are: git, github, SQL, npm, basic linux command (ls, cd), use an IDE/vim, then pick up the language that is required at work (for e.g react/java/python/javascript etc).\n\nOn advice to sharpen your portfolio, its quite simple. Just build something. Web/app, anything. Orbital is already your first step. Now do orbital another time on your own and then put it into your resume, done. Get more A's in your grade, that also sharpen your portfolio. Launch your app/website and put that link into your resume, so it's easy for them to see what you have done.\n\nFinally, you don't need to worry that you won't land in an internship. It's just how prestigious is that internship. It's probably hard to land a Google internship. But you will definitely land an internship (because internship is pre-requisite to graduation, I have not heard of anyone who could not graduate because they can't land an internship).\n\nBonus: Decide if you want 2x 3months or 1x 6months internship. Both have its pros and cons. Also, don't worry so much on what to learn at this point. Everything will pan out on its own once you start internship. You will automatically know what to learn sometime in Y3/Y4 once you have finished your internship. All this knowledge will come naturally."", 'Thank you so much for listing everything out so clearly for me. Thanks for clarifying my doubts and  listing the things that I should be learning depending on the field I want to work in! It’s really a great help for me. Thanks once again!']"

Tqsm!!!!",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nm2dkw/a_levels_advice_for_as/,"['heyy i’m a j3 rn & i hope my answers will be helpful for u!\n\n1. in jc1 my study routine was.... nonexistent tbh like i did my tutorials & listened in lectures + did notes consistently but i only rly sat down for like a few hours to study & revise closer to my exams because my CCAs are quite high commitment and i preferred to play in j1. start of j2 it was the same as j1 bc of CCAs and other commitments like OGL etc and lasted till aft CCA stand down? after that i spent more time to revise what i learnt on the day itself and do supplementary qns. closer to As ofc it was more rigorous and i did papers every single day :) \n\n2. you’re only in j1 so personally i don’t see the need to start hardcore mugging for As but its impt to be consistent! and to be aware of your limits/mental wellbeing because while starting this early may help you to do well in your school examinations, many of my classmates who started ‘hardcore mugging’ since j1 suffered from burnout closer to actual As and as a result didn’t do as well as they usually do in sch. for q many of my friends, we started ‘hardcore mugging’ aft CCA standdown in J2 bc we had more time to spare but ofc we were consistent in our revision since j1 (doing tutorials & listening ti lectures and went w the pace of tutorials and lectures). but it could just be my own experience, perhaps other redditors would have different opinions?  \n\n3. for a lot of us we failed our first exams in j1 (mye) but ofc there are those ppl who scores all As since their first exam. i think while its normal, you should also review whether your study methods are effective and see how else you can strengthen concepts. it’ll be too late if you only realise in j2 that your study methods have been unhelpful since the get-go aft failing multiple exams. \n\n4. to get into competitive courses i would say >87.5? even for some courses like pharm sci this yr had their cutoff as 88.75 (hearsay) so it’s rly q competitive! but rp isn’t all that matters because  for some of the courses (med,law,dent), you’ll need to sit thru an interview anyway! \n\n5. for UK unis under UCAS, yes, predicted grades are used to apply because their application closes before our A level results are released. your tutors will predict your grades using your school examination grades (not solely based on prelims) and they’ll send it straight to the unis thru the UCAS system. if you ask your school’s career guidance tutors or CTs, they shld be able to give you a clearer explanation on the UCAS process! i only applied to UK unis so i can’t say much abt the other countries! (also do feel free to correct me for this because things may have changed since i applied last yr!) \n\n6. you can apply for scholarships before you received ur A level results for some scholarships, and some only open after release of A level results. varies from year to year. you can look at the brightsparks portal for those scholarships. you’ll also be invited to apply for early admission & scholarships for some of our AUs at the end of jc2 based on your prelim results. scholarship holders usually have v high rp & have participated actively in their community or school. \n\n7. CCA Exco is something that will definitely be on your portfolio as part of CCA records. it’s not always about how many leadership positions or CCAs you have but what you have learnt that is valuable. this is a personal take because i know of some who only have perhaps 1 or 2 things on their portfolio, but are able to have enriching discussions on what they have learnt, or how the experiences have shaped them. so its not just about gg for more volunteering stints or participating in more CCAs, but the level of participation in these activities & your reflection from these experiences matter as well.\n\n8. internships are great for letting u explore what u rly want to do (esp since u don’t have a direction rn) but it’s tough for j1s to get internships because of the limited time we can offer (maybe about 1-2 months) and limited skills we have. but it’s worth a try to email various companies that you are interested in to see if they’ll accept you as an intern.  \n\n9. attend uni talks/career talks if your college does organise them. even if it sounds like sth you won’t like so that you can understand your various options. you can also go and do some courses on coursera during the hols to see where your interest lies and from there do research on possible paths that is related to that interest! \n\n10. recc letters are necessary for overseas apps iirc at least for the UK! applying for scholarships (both uni scholarships or organisational ones) requires recc letters as well. some competitive courses also do require these. i would say it’s something that most people will ask for in their applications. you can’t force your tutors to write them for you if they don’t want to because there’s always a reason why they don’t want to write it. i would rather find another tutor than have a tutor who doesn’t think they can write anything exceptional for me. tutors usually will recommend you if they agree to help you anyway, because if not, they would’ve just rejected your plea.\n\nthis is rly long and i would like to say it’s not reflective of everybody’s experiences, but just my own. feel free to pm me if u need anyth else :)', '1) I bet I will get down-voted if I share mine so yup.\n\n2) I started mugging 4 months before As. YMMV.\n\n3) You should at least pass most subjects (even if it is not A). I suggest going with the concept of ""aim unrealistically high and fail"", like aim for A and even if you get B/C, don\'t feel bad because you passed your original goal of not failing. Then refine your goals again and again.\n\n4)  During my time I thought >85RP was good, not sure how situation is like now\n\n5) Predicted grades work something along the lines of your using perhaps your J2 MYEs or Prelim results to apply to overseas unis (work with any JC Uni application departments if your JC has one). Sometimes you get a conditional offer to get certain results in A Levels to be accepted etc. etc. (again, times may have changed)\n\n6) Know the organization mission and vision, find opportunities to participate in their events, and ask yourself what you can potentially bring to the table.\n\n7) CCA Exco only helps on the pre-condition your grades are good.

or for some ppl they feel that consulting their teachers rly helps them too (this is the case for my humanities subj and gp!!) so it honestly really depends on how your learning style is and what fits you the best. \n4. for rly rly competitive course such as med/law/dentistry/pharm sci/etc etc i would say 88.75 is p safe to get shortlisted for these courses, it really depends on the course you are aiming for\n5. for this one im not really sure bcus i didnt apply for overseas uni but what i heard from my friends who did is that predicted grades are used since the application for overseas uni closes before actual results are released as well - so if you are applying exams in j2 really do play a huge part as well, but your teachers should be really familiar with the process as well:)\n6. i indicated interest for scholarship while submitting my ntu application and was invited for an interview and subsequently was offered nanyang scholarship:) for scholarships i think you can apply the same time as your uni course (can submit tgt for thouse in-house uni scholarships) but for external scholarships (eg healthcare scholarships) you\'ll need to take note of the deadline as well - but for these will still be around the period of uni application as well! ultimately for scholarships i think quite a few ones still shortlist by rp for interview and subsequently going through your portfolio during the interview itself. but it really depends on the nature of scholarship you are applying and how you do during the interview itself. but def some leadership positions/activities will distinguish you from other candidates as well:)\n7. cca exco will def be on your portfolio and is something that is quite notable for leadership exp as well! for me i volunteered quite a bit because it\'s something that i enjoy a lot and included that in my portfolio as well! and while courses/scholarships may be looking for very attractive portfolios (eg a lot of volunteering, outstanding leadership etc etc) i think it\'s more valuable to think about the takeaways from all these experiences that shape your portfolio because it\'s definitely something interviewers will ask (like your portfolio should be something that reflects who you are and what you are truly passionate about)\n8. i think jc hols are usually too short to undergo a full blown internship, but instead of an internship you can consider job shadowing as well!!  i didn\'t manage to do this in jc (only did in sec sch) but for me it managed to help me reinforce what i wanted to do in the future + will be a good eye opener to help you understand your possible career options in the future/open up your choices in uni as well:)\n9. for me my sch actually organized a lot of career/uni talks HAHAH and i was kinda forced to attend but it was really informative for me:) you can also try talking to some of your seniors in uni to understand what they are taking and maybe ask for some advice as well!!! i went on each uni\'s website to read up about the potential courses that i may be interested in as well (the diff modules etc) oh and i did a lot of reddit searching too HAHAHAH\n10. yepp some courses require referral letters from teachers as well so i wld say try to talk to a teacher as well (i\'m sure they will be more than happy to help as well!) or your sch career guidance teacher so they can better understand you and what you are aiming for. this way if you really decide to enter a course that require a ref letter, you know that you have a teacher there for you and knows you well enough to help you out with this favour:) for me i had 1 teacher who i went to for career/uni advice and another teacher who taught me who helped me write my ref letters:)\n11. just enjoy j1 life for now and understand your studying method as well! it\'s good to be well prepared for the future but rmb to take necessary breaks and don\'t burn yourself out while studying because self care is important for exam prep as well:) feel free to pm me if you have any questions/if you need any advice/listening ear!!

I am a 20 M living with depression and years of it has seriously taken a toll on my emotional state. I have lost all interest in every single thing that I used to do and it has been getting steadily worse since the outbreak in jan 2020. I just cant seem to find a purpose in everything and when I do start doing something I usually just give up after a short while. My social life is also very  small and I don't share this to my friends because I feel that they aren't rlly understanding so I keep this to myself. I would spend most of my days just mindlessly scrolling social media on my phone and laptop without any reason. Literally most times when I am using my laptop I would just stare blankly at the screen and not have a clue what to do on the screen and just switch between tabs and play with google interface. It really sucks to be in such a mental state and I really want to get out of this but I really have no energy or mood. I am literally living on autopilot and watching my whole life fall between my eyes. 

i also suffer from low self-esteem issues and extreme anxiety to the point that it is crippling me to start doing anything that I might actually like. Anytime I am contemplating to start doing something new, i would question my ability to do the task and visualize the amount of work and time to be able to get good at it and knowing the amount of work needed to start overwhelms me and I just give up. The ""I feel there's no point in doing anything since I am going to give up anyway"" attitude is fucking my life.

71,charlieokosong,m4pgtr,How do I cope with being 'behind' in our society?,2021-03-14 14:08:21,askSingapore,44614,52,176,"23 F, been in and out of IMH over the years due to several mental health issues like Borderline Personality Disorder, Psychosis, Depression, PTSD and Anxiety. I was doing okay in life till I had to drop out of Poly for a very bad mental health episode, and then took a diploma from LASALLE and then got stuck in a pretty traumatising work experience to the point where I just wanted to go back to studying to avoid working. 

I currently feel stuck worrying I can't get into a degree, and I realised I'd be graduating relatively late, with not much income earned throughout the years. With my mental health conditions I just find it really hard to get a full-time job I can feel safe and stable in, and I'm not sure what work I could do to support myself without getting quickly overwhelmed. I feel trapped knowing how much stigma there is against the conditions I have and not feeling like I can safely disclose them without losing an opportunity for work.

Right now I want to take time off to focus on therapy but I feel like I'm a waste of space to just be spending up to a year just in therapy to work on myself while I'm seeing my friends get employed and move on with their lives.

People can say I am a loser of someone with no ambition but that's their freedom of speech.

72,tryinbutdying,fgerrk,[Uni] How does one cope with overwhelming anxiety and panic attacks as well as depression all while managing academic stress?,2020-03-10 22:36:42,SGExams,77662,5,22,"Currently the semester has been going okay so far but now that most lectures and tutorials have moved online bcos of COVID 19, I have to be disciplined and watch the webcasted lectures and all.

I keep struggling daily with anxiety and panic attacks since sec sch and O's and I easily get them when I am stressed. Life in secondary and JC was quite stressful which triggered the onset of panic disorder and numerous panic attacks that lead me to hyperventilate and cry and think I am dying and all. And in the Uni setting,it is hard to struggle with a panic attack without scaring your peers and like freak people out or draw unwanted attention to yourself!!I am already on medication and even had increased both the dosage and types of medication taken but the anxiety is still there and the panic attacks happen without reason and sometimes out of the blue.

I cried on the MRT from panic attacks on several occasions, with people looking at me strangely. I was all teary and my face was red and sweating and I was shaking all over. I have mentioned this to the student support managers in my faculty and the faculty is well aware of my conditions. The Deanery and UHC counsellors and psychiatrists as well as the Pitstop counsellors are helping me with weekly counselling sessions and I am trying my best to manage:(

Throughout sec sch to JC, alot has happened with sec sch experiencing bullying issues that made the anxiety worse and JC was very academically stressful and repeating a year in JC1 meant that I had to face the label of being a JC1 retainee by the new J1s and also a lot of rumour spreading and mean comments about me,both online on my JC's confession page and offline (in person)

Is there anyone else going through all these panic attacks which are so bad that I can't get through them without crying?😭😭😭😭😭😥😥😥😥😥

Sometimes I feel like I will never recover from all these mental health issues and its like I'm gonna be stuck with all these struggles forever😥 And I am struggling to manage my mental health especially with all the module deadlines and groupwork and I have fallen behind and have been unable to catch up on my work in the sense I have not viewed many weeks of webcasts since the Uni introduced e-lectures bcos of COVID 19.

How does one cope with all these panic attacks? And any safe places that people can recommend within NUS which I can cry and rest during a panic attack episode?
I really don't want people to think that I am losing my mind when they see me crying!! It is so difficult to deal with all these in school,public and crowded areas and the anxiety is so so overwhelming!! 😥


P.S: The suggestion to take a break from school is not something I would find helpful.
Even if I take a break,I still feel the same way. During the holidays, I feel the anxiety attacks and panic attackd that come out of the blue.

Either way, I'll try to cut through the irrelevant facts to present you the meat of it. Also posting this from a throwaway because I don't really want people who know me to find this. 

I enlisted into PTP BMT at the start of February. Having a history of eczema since childhood, I had submitted a private specialist letter back in 2019 during my medical checkup only for it to be abruptly rejected due to it being from a private clinic. Either way, I went in being quite physically unfit but convinced myself that with hard work and determination I would improve. 

Unfortunately, I soon found myself overwhelmed by the PT sessions. I struggled physically (especially during runs, where I found difficulty sustaining a steady pace and not going out of breath), and constantly felt like I was the only one in my section who was hilariously failing at everything. Predictably, a month in, I failed my first IPPT terribly, which made me feel emotionally worse. 

However, it was 2 weeks after the first IPPT when things started to go haywire for me. After one night of Guard Duty where I spent the whole night in boots, I found an odd ""skin crack"" on one of my toes which soon caused difficulty while walking. I visited a GP over the weekend who claimed it was a fungal infection and gave me a 7 day excuse from RMJ and covered shoes. Booking back into Tekong, I visited PTMC and had the MO confirm that it was a fungal infection before arranging for a CGH appointment the week after. 

By the time I visited CGH I had already stopped training for 2 whole weeks. At CGH I was instead told that my toe injury could either be a fungal infection or an extension of my eczema, and skin samples were taken for testing. I was also given creams for eczema which had started flaring up on my body after wearing Long 4 for GD, as well as an additional 2 weeks excuse from covered shoes. 

As BMT began I found myself instructed to wear Long 4 with sandals for TH tests ans BTP practices, which was not only rather uncomfortable but also further triggered my eczema on my arms and neck. After a horrific case of miscommunication, I was told that at the last minute that I would be participating in an activity while wearing Long 4 (while I was still wearing admin), causing me to rush to try and change and grab the necessary items. In my fit of panic I forgot to take a mask, and when I realised I immediately ran back upstairs with my rifle, only for the worst case scenario to happen - I suffered a full blown anxiety attack upstairs and nearly collapsed from an inability to breathe. (This was not my first anxiety attack, I had previously suffered one in January for unrelated reasons.) 

The following day, I officially got OOT for missing more than a month of training as well as a pending IMH appointment for my anxiety issues. Yet during my next CGH appointment I was suddenly told that I had also developed warts on my foot, which I had to undergo cryotherapy (spraying -200°C liquid nitrogen to freeze off the warts) fortnightly. Needless to say it was exceedingly painful and left me with large blisters, making walking agony until the Tekong medics were able to drain some of the blood from the blister. 

As much as I dreaded BMT, I tried my damn best to go in with an open mind and push myself to improve and endure. But at this point I've suffered so much pain, exhaustion and stress that I feel that I'm reaching my breaking point soon. I don't want to recourse and repeat 4 months of PTP BMT where my skin is likely to act up again and my anxiety attacks may flare up again.

Of these, 222 were in government quarantine facilities, while 302 were serving quarantine at home.\n\n> ""Persons under quarantine are required to stay in their designated locations at all times during the quarantine period,"" he said. ""They cannot physically interact with others living in the same premises.""\n\n> Those under home quarantine will have to take video and phone calls to ensure they do not leave, and regular spot checks will be carried out. Those who breach quarantine orders may be fined or jailed.\n\n> In a ministerial statement, Mr Wong said being able to detect and isolate infected patients and their close contacts is Singapore\'s second line of defence - after border controls - against the virus that was first reported in Wuhan and has infected more than 17,000 people and killed more than 360.\n\n> While high-risk individuals are put under quarantine, lower-risk groups such as travellers returning from other parts of mainland China are asked to take a 14-day leave of absence from their return date. ""This is one way to reduce their exposure when they are back, and thus reduce the risk of community spread in Singapore,"" he said.\n\n> Those on leave of absence are expected to remain home as much as possible and keep records of those they come into close contact with. They should also minimise time in public places, avoid crowds and keep tabs on their health.\n\n> Ms Denise Phua (Jalan Besar GRC) said some residents living near government quarantine facilities have expressed concerns over this proximity, to which Mr Wong replied that there is no reason to fear having such a facility nearby.\n\n> ""We have to be mindful that anyone who is in quarantine is not an infected person,"" he said. ""They have been exposed, so they are of some risk... So, we want them quarantined, just to be safe.""\n\n> He reiterated that there are strict protocols in place to ensure that people stay within the quarantine facilities, and that places visited by those diagnosed with the virus are thoroughly disinfected in a process supervised by the National Environment Agency. ""With all these measures in place, we should continue to assure Singaporeans that there is no need to be fearful or overreact due to fear or panic,"" he said.\n\n> Ms Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon GRC) said news that about 30,000 work pass holders from China left Singapore over the Chinese New Year break and had not returned had caused some anxiety among residents, and asked if there was a way to ensure that they complied with the leave of absence strictly.\n\n> In reply, Mr Wong said the authorities were working with employers to identify them and where they live so that if they are living in dormitories, these could be fitted so the returnees can be in more isolated areas and not interact with others.\n\n> The Government is also looking at measures to help employers who are impacted by the outbreak.\n\n> Landlords who evict irresponsibly may face sanctions\n\n> Landlords found to have irresponsibly evicted their tenants could face restrictions and even be barred from renting out their flats to foreign work pass holders in future, the authorities said last night. In a joint statement, the Manpower, Education and National Development ministries said they had received feedback about landlords evicting tenants who are placed on home quarantine orders or leave of absence (LOA) due to the coronavirus, and based on their nationality. The ministries said such persons, who could be workers or students, are well, and these are simply precautionary measures to protect Singaporeans from the spread of the coronavirus. ""Guidelines are available for landlords to adopt should they have a tenant who is on home quarantine or LOA. There is no need for landlords to evict (such) persons,"" they said.\n\n> In his statement, Mr Wong said he could appreciate that many Singaporeans are concerned for themselves and their family members, but stressed that they have to do their part to cooperate.\n\n> ""Some residents, upon learning that there is a person under home quarantine or on leave of absence in the same apartment block, have asked that the person be moved elsewhere,"" he said.\n\n> He also cited reports of land-lords stigmatising tenants based on their nationality, or evicting mainland Chinese tenants who are on leave of absence.\n\n> ""If landlords start turning tenants away, then our overall containment efforts will be much harder, and we end up endangering ourselves and others,"" he said. ""The outcome will be completely counterproductive.""\n\n> ""We should not condone such irresponsible actions that will end up putting Singapore and Singaporeans at greater risk,"" he added, saying other examples of irresponsible behaviour include attempts to profiteer from the sale of masks and the spread of falsehoods online.\n\n> He stressed that Singaporeans have a responsibility not to spread unverified information or fake news which can cause needless panic and fear. The Government has used the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation Act to correct such statements, and will continue to do so, he said.\n\n> Related Story Coronavirus: Get latest updates\n\n> Related Story Multiple lines of defence in place to guard against local spread of coronavirus in Singapore: Gan Kim Yong\n\n> It has also stepped up its efforts to provide timely and accurate information, he added, urging people to turn to official or credible sources and be discerning about the information they share.\n\n> He also noted that anti-mainland Chinese sentiment has emerged among some groups, both online and in the real world.\n\n> ""Such actions are not helpful and they have no place in our society. We are bigger than this in Singapore,"" he said. ""I hope all of us in this House - regardless of political party - will stand together and do our part to confront and condemn such prejudice and discrimination wherever they exist.""\n\n---\n1.0.2 | [Source code](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek) | [Contribute](https://github.com/fterh/sneakpeek)', 'Yes Supreme Leader']"
75,OptionsSG,n8v7kx,Suitable Brokerages for Options trading in SG and which you should open with,2021-05-10 11:48:33,singaporefi,19145,14,28,"Hey SFI community due to the overwhelming positive responses I had received from the previous post, I’ve decided to put together what I hope would be another useful piece of information to anybody looking to get into options. Today I’ll be running through the availabilities of brokerages that support US options trading in Singapore and weigh the pros and cons of each of them. 

Before diving into the comparisons, I’ll briefly provide a background synopsis of the following brokerages that currently support options trading. Brokers that aren’t listed below either do not currently support them such as MooMoo or DBS Vickers or have an outstanding list of issues (TD Ameritrade Singapore)

**Tiger Brokers**

Tiger Brokers(TIGR) Tiger is a Chinese founded brokerage that is regulated by the Money Authority Singapore (MAS) and are currently listed on the NASDAQ exchange under ticker symbol TIGR. As of today, TIGR allows you to trade on the following global markets: SG, US, HK, AU and CN. 
Tiger Brokers currently provide clients access to: Stocks, ETFs, US Stock Options, Futures, HK Warrants and Singapore REITs

**Interactive Brokers**

Also listed on the NASDAQ, Interactive Brokers(IBKR) is a multinational brokerage firm that many are familiar with. IBKR is highly recognized and renowned for their long standing history, highly positive reviews and a massive global presence across 135 markets worldwide 
IBKR currently provides access to: Stocks, ETFs, Options, Futures, Currencies, Bonds and US and Canadian Warrants.

**Saxo Markets**

Unlike the 2 brokerages discussed above, Saxo is a privately traded company that nonetheless holds a strong presence in Singapore. Although Saxo grants access to various financial trading instruments, they have a strong reputation as a forex broker. 
Saxo Markets currently provides access to:  Stocks, ETFs, Forex Currencies, Bonds, Futures, Options, Forex Options

**Commission & Fees**

One area that IBKR and Tiger Brokers shine at are their highly competitive commission structures even on an international comparison spectrum. We compared their commission rates across the board and compared them side by side along with IBKR and Saxo markets and placed them on a chart [click here for the full chart](https://optionliteracy.com/?p=2952)

As from the chart, IBKR ranks the highest in terms of low and flexible option commissions at $0.65 USD per US option contract (base tier) while TIGR takes second place at $0.95 USD followed by Saxo Markets. From a competitive standpoint, with brokerage firms slashing trading commissions and fees in the last decade, Saxo’s option commission structure (base tier) of $3 USD per stock option and a whopping $6 USD per cash index option (e.g SPX) means that they stand substantially higher in the spectrum of commission charges (All numbers stated above are solely commission charges while extra regulatory fees still apply). Keep in mind that due to the fact that trading options generally require a higher frequency of management and the use of strategies that employ the use of multiple option contracts, investors and traders looking to trade options should pay even more attention to commission and fees. 

**Option strategy compatibility**

As most option strategies are simply a combination of opening multiple option contracts, as long as buying and shorting of options are permitted by a broker, almost any strategy can be executed by any option supporting brokerage. However clarity and strategy compatibility is important to keeping a trader’s portfolio organized should they choose to trade options. For that reason, certain brokerages may be better than others in terms of how they display a trader’s option positions. For example, the buying and selling of 2 call option contracts one of a later expiration cycle and one of an earlier expiration cycle of the same strike price is known a diagonal spread or a calendar spread. 

Some platforms may recognize this as a diagonal spread and allow you to manage the position as one while others will only recognize 2 different option contacts requiring you to individually manage both options. Net Greeks that show you your overall positional exposure to the Greeks such as net delta and net theta may also need to be manually computed together if that brokerage has poorer option strategy compatibility. 

One relevant example of the importance of strategy compatibility is the recent issue with Tiger Brokers not supporting covered calls, an option strategy that is used to frequently lower a stock positions cost basis and generate premium. Many traders found themselves in a situation where they had to either forgo using the strategy or find a different supporting platform. (A few of our [discord](https://discord.gg/mNet58BjaD ) members reached out to Tiger to raise the issue but there were no guarantees of an imminent fix). With that being said, as options trading continues to grow in popularity, greater option compatibility is likely to be added sooner or later. For now however, IBKR holds to be the better broker in this area of comparison.

**User interface and customer service support**

From The majority of responses that were gathered online, Tiger Brokers takes the cake for having the most user friendly interface due to their easy-to-navigate menus and a rather simplistic trade execution page. Saxo takes slot number 2 for this comparison while IBKR ranks at number 3 for their slightly more advanced platform interface.

In terms of customer service support all 3 brokerages have local telephone lines that can be reached. As we look to put service support on a scale of comparison, do note that customer service support may ultimately boil down to personal experience so do take this bit with a pinch of salt. From the emails that we sent, IBKR has been most spontaneous and prompt to our test email queries.

IBKR 2.7/5 rating on Trustpilot

Saxo 2.2/5 rating on Trustpilot

Actually, that’s an understatement. JC is fucking tough, especially if you’re not one of the few who actually don’t mind/ like sitting down and studying for hours, or if you’re a genius lol.

I’m tired too. I’m so tired, that literally the first thing I think of in the morning when my eyes open is going back to bed that night. I’ll tell myself that soon I’d be done with school/studying, soon the sun will set and I’ll finally be allowed to go back to bed, back to sleep, back to peace. Even if it’s only for a few hours, even if i’ll have to wake up again, even if this peace is very much short-lived. 

I feel so suffocated too. Not only because JC leaves little to no space in your life for enjoyment, but also because I feel like I don’t have the right to complain. I chose to walk this path, so I should tolerate the consequences, right? It seems only logical for it to be this way, right? 

I know how it feels. 
I know how it feels to want to give up, or to want everything to stop. 
I know what it feels like to not understand what in the actual hecking hell you’re reading, or to not want to try at all. 
I know what it feels like to be so fucking overwhelmed because your CCA ends at 8.30 pm and the rate at which your workload is increasing never slows down. 
I know what it feels like when you were on the verge of finally asking for help, but you realise that you aren’t the only one suffering so you start to feel guilty for even considering that option. 
I know what it feels like to stare out the windows of buses and trains on the way home, while wondering when all of this will end, and to wonder if you’ll even finish this stupid A-level race at all. 
I know what it feels like to cry in bed at night because you just don’t know what to do anymore. 
I know what it feels like to be an outsider in your own school, to feel like it has no vacancy for you because you’ve never done this badly academically before. 
I know what it feels like when you see people- your friends and your classmates- studying so hard, and feeling guilty for feeling too drained to do the same. 
I know what it feels like to consider sleeping, for the rest of time.
I know what it feels like to be in JC.

But I’m still here. I’m still trying even though what I’m doing is nothing compared to what I should be doing. But what matters is that I’m still trying. And I cannot stress this enough- progress is of secondary importance. What’s most important is that you TRY. 

And I know trying is scary. Why? Because you’re afraid that when you try and you still don’t see progress, you’d be directly confronted by the limit of your competency, the limit of your intelligence. But I’ve come to realise that this isn’t true at all. You of all people know how vigorous, how rigid, how unbending education here is. And you’re letting it decide how smart you are? How worthy you are?

You are so important. You are so strong. You’ve made it this far. I’m so proud of you. Please don’t give up. I know the choice of walking down this path was yours, and that it was purely voluntary, but you’re allowed to feel tired, you’re allowed to feel lonely, and you’re allowed to ask for help. But if you really feel that this path was a mistake and that it really isn’t meant for you, you can always turn around and take a different one. Just please, don’t aimlessly stray too far away from it, no matter how sick of it you are, for you’ll get lost. Take control of your own life. You can always talk to me, or to your friends, or to your parents, or to your siblings, or to your teachers, or to your school counsellor. Everyone is here for you.

I know, because I've been in your shoes before. There are even days you curse having gone into JC in the first place, cursing your subject combi, how others 'seemingly' have easier combis to score at. \nFor me, some days you get extremely stressed, feel like vomiting, or even too stressed to sleep\n\nBut there's more to that\nRemember that there are still your friends and family there to support you, try to talk to your family regularly, airing your worries with them because they may be able to advice you, or study with your schoolmates, since it makes you want to carry on all the way to see it through with everyone to the end, and lastly your teachers, they are always there to support and offer solace when you need help. ALWAYS ask questions when you feel yourself lost, they should know what to do and if your own teachers don't seem to be helpful, you can always ask other teachers in school\n\nBurnout is also a common but serious issue I faced while in JC, notice the signs, losing interest, tiredness that doesn't go away with sleep etc. During those days, may sound cheesy, but self care takes precedence, remember to do things to relax and stop overloading on the workload, doing the minimum basically\n\nLastly, have a goal in mind, a common reason why people lose steam along the way is because they don't have a goal to keep them going, an end in mind. You need to know what you want out of JC, whether it is an end in itself or a means to an end\n\nNo matter what, always always look after yourself, make sure you drink enough water(water parade) and get enough nutrition\n\n\nJiayouz!! can one legit\n\nPs I sound damn tone-death one"", ""Your CCA ends at 8.30pm?

Like when you feel so overwhelmed , anxious , socially drained , etc you get what I'm trying to say ? I hope you get it 🥺 Like you need a break from school for a 'legit reason' or else you can't focus during lesson , so you skip school even when you're not sick at all , but pon because of mental exhaustion .

Take note that cash management solution is not as liquid as insurance savings plan like Singtel Dash Pet though latter is not as liquid as a bank account. \n\nSaw that you are looking to invest in stocks and ETFs, I think you can look into having a core portfolio and a satellite portfolio of your own picks. You can look at the wiki of this subreddit where they recommend using ireland domiciled etf to invest in World ETF for example. \n\nIndex investing is good enough for people who do not really know how to stock pick so unless you want to enhance your returns then you need to learn fundamental analysis. There’s many resources online and you can look for Seedly articles, saw a recent article where this guy teaches people how to analyse growth/tech stocks and also The Good Investor has its own investment framework on how they pick stocks which is very informative and insightful. \n\nNext, also learn how to value stocks as it is apparent that valuation is very important in investing this year compared to last year and you do not want to overpay a company that will affect your returns.', 'There are many ways to get started and I believe there is no one correct way to start investing. Hence, I think it would be best for me to give advice from my own experience on how I first started investing.\n\nFirstly, there are many financial instruments you can invest in, and you need to be clear of the risks you would need to partake in and make your own judgement based on your level of risk -appetite. Personally, I would stay away from trading CFDs, options and futures as they are quite complicated and loss can be immeasurable especially if you are inexperienced.\n\nBefore I started investing, I have an interest in reading news to keep myself updated about the current affairs and the financial environment of the world, especially in the US. Soon I delve deeper into researching some high tech companies like Tesla, FAANG, Tencent, Alibaba, Square and companies of different sectors who are in energy, industrial, IT, healthcare and etc, simply by googling their Wikipedias and watching some infographic videos on youtube. Also, [Investopedia.com](https://Investopedia.com) is a good resource for learning stuff on doing TA and FA. Link: [https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-fundamental-and-technical-analysis/](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/difference-between-fundamental-and-technical-analysis/)\n\nWith some fundamental knowledge, you can start your brokerage account and choose to build your own portfolio via buying individual stocks and ETFs or use a Robo-advisor like Stashaway to manage your portfolio based on your risk-appetite. I first started with Stashaway to get into the feel of investing then I switch to a brokerage account and started buying ETFs and some individual stocks I like. The reason I switch away from StashAway because I do not have the full autonomy to build my own portfolio by picking stocks myself.\n\nAs you stated, your time horizon of investments is 2-3 years, hence it is important to plan your exit strategy and when to take profits. For ETFs, I used [Kristal.Ai](https://Kristal.Ai) and monthly I invest some money into the account, the ROI is not a lot but is decent and consistent. The reason I used [Kristal.Ai](https://Kristal.Ai) is not because of their Robo-advisor features but I used it because it charges 0% fees if you invest less than $10,000 USD and I leveraged on that. One good feature is it tells you the time horizon for each EFTs they curated for you. For individual stocks, I used Tiger Broker since the fees are quite reasonable and there is a promotion if you park $2000SGD into the account they will issue you a free Starbucks share which is around $100SGD, basically free money even if you are not intending to use the money to invest.\n\nLink: [https://kristal.ai/products/?tag=GLOBAL\\_ETF](https://kristal.ai/products/?tag=GLOBAL_ETF)\n\nWith some of the profits I took from my ETFs and mid-term stock tradings, I allocate them into my Crypto investments although I emphasise that the Crypto market is highly speculative, the rewards are high as well. Hence, if you are planning to play crypto, use your profits and remember to do research and NOT blindly bought into some moonshot crypto that would rekt you. Through trading cryptos, I learned to understand market cycles, read candlestick charts and some TA stuff/indicators such as moving averages (MA), EMA, RSI and patterns, which I think can be quite applicable and useful for stock trading as well.\n\nTbh, just get started and the earlier the better. Also, dm me if you need tiger broker referral link. Thanks', 'Visit stashaway', 'Just an observation - and I definitely had the same problem, is that a lot of beginner does not know what to ask (not know what they don’t know).

88,bloopbloop013,lmo6c2,[A Levels] Screwing up my A Levels,2021-02-18 22:38:04,SGExams,77662,70,406,"Hello! I've seen lots of posts about A Levels and theres a lot of fear here, which I can relate to so I just wanna share the crazy route I took for uni LOL. 

Ok being fully honest here, I am extremely privileged so I know my route isn't available to most but... if it helps even a single person, I'm happy!! 

Long story short, my life goal was to get into med (haha whats new for asians right lolol 🤓). I was lucky enough that my parents were open to overseas uni if my grades weren't good enough, but even then you still need AAA or whatever. I was in a certain top school so the expectation was that I won't have trouble getting those grades, but err i ended up without a single H2 A 🥲🥲🥲. 

So what did I do? I went home and cried LOL 🤩

After I was done crying, I signed up to be a private candidate cos I STILL WANNA DO MED. 😃🔫 Ok here's where i screwed up. The reason why I didn't do well in the first place was because I was in such a bad place mentally. I was burnt out, distressed, felt useless, and super anxious (all the aunties and uncles asking for my grades didnt help either 😡). So what happened when I retook my A Levels????? 

Haha I still didnt get any H2 As LOLOLOL 🤡

Ok at this point i rly was damn sad but someone told me to go take the UK A Levels so I hid this fact from literally everyone and did the british A Levels. Lemme tell you they have it so easy idek why our A Levels are so bloody hard. 😡😡😡 And essentially I did rly rly rly well and got into a certain university overseas to do med!! (Very privileged i know and fully acknowledge it)

People always talk about those who get 90rp and you might feel damn alone when you don't get the grades you want, but just wanna reassure you that YOU ARE NOT ALONE!!! many people are in the same boat and struggling, pls ask for help and support if you need it!!! 🥺🥺

AND ALL YOU 90RP PEOPLE 
💫Sweety i am so proud of you and your achievements 💫but pls dont rub it into people's face and dont go around asking people how they scored cos i was this close to tears whenever people asked me how i scored ok sorry im truly proud of u and your achievements but people are suffering here too!!

okay serious part here: 
1. The system screws a lot of us over. Just because you didn't do well in your A Levels doesn't mean you are stupid. I genuinely felt very stupid in JC. But you are not. Don't let this system pull you down because you are gonna go out there and do well in whatever field you enter. When i got my UK results, the first thing i told my mum was ""im not actually stupid"" AND BLOODY HELL NONE OF YOU ARE!! YOU ARE ALL CAPABLE HUMANS AND I WILL FIGHT ANYONE WHO DOESNT AGREE ❤❤💥💥💢💢
2. YOUR IGP DOESNT DEFINE YOU!!!!! IF YOU LIKE SOMETHING JUST TRY!!!! the 10% IGP for NUS/NTU or whatever is NOT the lower score they are taking so there is a chance that you can get in (speaking from experience here cos i applied to non-med courses in sg unis too and got in despite my IGP not hitting the 10%) 😛
3. It is ok to retake a levels.💓💓💓 Ok no one will give a fk that you retook years down the line. I prepared excuses that I used (and still use now) to avoid telling people i retook: 
- ""I took a gap year"" then they will ask ""oh cool what did you do"" standard answer tell them you worked, travel a bit (covid big sad no more excuse), spend time with family etc 
- ""i was frustrated by the rat race so i took time off to let my burn out get better"" this one i use more nowadays, cos no one questions mental health these days and it was true for me :) 
- ""i needed time to figure out what I was interested in"" perfectly valid lah tbh 
4. Pls pls pls take your mental health srsly T.T i cant stress this enough 🙏🙏🙏🙏

Ok if anyone read until here ya you gonna be ok! If anyone is in a similarly privileged situation and wanna study overseas too, I am happy to answer any specific qns!

Edit: thanks guys for the overwhelming response to my post 💓 

as a general note, please understand that i am not in a position to give you professional advice regarding mental health, so please do not ask me to counsel you because I am not trained to do so. Instead, do seek medical help if you are in significant distress. 

Additionally, please do not ask me to meet up, call or communicate with you on any other platform if not I create a throwaway for what LOLOL.

91,dak3ene,lnk4fo,"[Rant]: Accusations of ""Smurfing"" in JC",2021-02-20 00:35:45,SGExams,77662,29,107,"I'm extremely fed up with being accused of ""smurfing"" in JC, here's why:

During the weeks prior to and during O levels, I went through alot of mental stress and was very tense for most of the time, common for people with low-to-no self-esteem(much like how most students have it normally), but this overwhelmed me to such a great extent that I would just sit and cry, or just rage  over small issues. This period of time was so stressful and it was a breath of fresh air after O's, being able to calm down and de-stress properly.

Received O level results in January, was relatively surprised by how well I did (L1R5=7-4). After much consideration, I chose not to go for the ""Institutions"" and went for _________ Junior College. My reasoning was that I felt the environment would be more beneficial to me such that I could better cope academically and mentally, given how mentally-destroyed I was during O's, I wanted to be in a less stressful but still competitive learning environment. Now here's where the problem starts:

Nosy, irritating distant relatives/former schoolmates(NIDR/FS):
Hahaha LOL you didn't go to ___/__, what did you score? Confirm damn trash one.
Me:
Yeah I didn't go ___/__. But I did get 7-4.
(NIDR/FS): look at this guy so zai (good) yet choose to go to ________ JC, smurf sia.

To be honest, I don't fault their thinking. Growing up most of us were told to go to the best possible learning environments, in most cases, the prestigious schools. 

However, it's always good to remember that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" institute of higher learning. You could be more suited to JCs, Polytechnics, or ITE, depending on what kind of person you are. This brings me to my point, which is that not everyone who goes to a ""lesser"" school when they could have gone elsewhere is smurfing. 

Knowing the lack of mental health I was dealing with during O's, going to an 'elite' JC, where everyone is fighting to be the best is the worst possible destination for me. But those who parry these accusations don't see the struggle, the nights of pure agony, the last-minute dash to the toilet during papers (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). They just assume: Hey you're so smart stop depriving other people of the opportunity to go to ABCDEFG JC!

I personally feel that the point of going to school is for the passion of learning and improving myself, not just being a mindless body who memorizes content for the sake of a degree, diploma or A. I just can't stand it anymore when people just hurl such accusations at me and just spread it around, and I'm sure that some of your reading this post agree with how I feel and have similar experiences.

It would be absolutely phenomenal if everyone could just respect each other's decisions, and stopped jumping to conclusions based on their assumptions. But this is real life, so that's obviously not happening. But you, reading this post, can make a difference. Be more respectful and understanding of problems other people face and the decisions they make, and don't judge a book by it's cover.

Tldr: don't accuse someone of smurfing based on silly assumptions, be more respectful of other's decisions.

92,PhoenixAkaunBuang,ll39ql,[JC] [Rant] Please do not make the same mistakes that I did,2021-02-16 20:58:14,SGExams,77662,18,334,"When JC started, there were many threads expressing disappointment at being posted to a low-tier JC or fear of difficulty making friends in JC. Now seeing many threads about results day. Really brings back memories and regrets.

My advice to juniors feeling overwhelmed by such issues is to ask yourself two questions:

1. What do you want to spend your life doing (in terms of career)?
2. How much will this issue matter 5 or 10 years later (especially with regards to Q1)?

In JC, I worried too much about what other people think about me and looked down on myself for being from a mediocre JC. As a result, I tried too hard (and unsuccessfully) to be popular and got into lots of toxic social drama. That, combined with family and health problems that I handled poorly, affected my performance in the A Levels (as it had for the O Levels).

As a working young adult, I have five friends from secondary school, JC and NS combined whom I still keep in touch regularly. These are the people who truly matter. Not those whom I was trying to impress. Not the fake friends. Not the popular kids and certainly not the mean ones.

Another mistake I made was thoughtlessly choosing a pure arts subject combination. Turns out that my subject combination made me ineligible for the university course leading to my dream career. I also chose a CCA just because my ""friends"" (which turned out to be fake friends) were there but ended up achieving nothing in it.

In NS, I met guys with severe medical conditions who gave their best every day (one got accepted into NUS Medicine but could not defer because cannot be MO) and others who faked mental health problems to get PES E then took as many MCs as they could. My unit had ITE graduates who went to poly then got accepted into NUS and some from top JCs who completely screwed up their A Levels. There was a guy running a profitable small business outside and another who dropped out of school, mixed with bad company and went to DB for drugs.

Seeing them made me wake up my idea and after ORD, I got a very basic job in my dream industry, then self-studied for and earned some entry-level industry certifications. Now I am self-studying for private A-Levels (including H2 Physics, which I did not take back then), having realised that provided I manage my family and health problems well (which I currently am), I can do well.

All the best to those collecting their results on Friday. Success is not final, failure is not fatal. If you do very well, congrats! That gives you the flexibility to choose a course that you have the passion and aptitude for. Do not choose courses simply for the prestige, only to end up miserable in the resulting careers. If you do badly, you may need to take a different or longer path to get to your desired destination, but do learn from your mistakes and do not give up!

To those still in secondary or JC, focus on working towards your career goals (which should guide your choice of subjects and CCAs) and the people who truly matter (heck care those who do not). Not yet figured out what you want to do? Spend more time figuring it out. Feeling discouraged because you are from a neighbourhood secondary school or JC? Then study harder (of course, not until you drop) and smarter. When I was reading through the Ashlee saga, I was thinking: ""Ashlee, you should be more worried about your A Level grades and how you will survive NS (assuming you need to serve since still legally male).""

im not officially diagnosed, but i suspect that i may have adhd/add. i've been struggling for the longest time trying to focus on doing my work bc i get distracted super super easily (im supposed to be doing my chem tutorial but here i am typing this lol). my attention span is terrible thus i find it really hard to stay 100% focused dur sch (i can hyper focus at times though). i was able to control these in primary and secondary sch, altho it was only in sec sch when i realise i could not really handle all the weight anymore. now that im in jc, it's near impossible bc i can't always be distracted since there not much time to complete the never ending list of assignments (but i still do and i js can't stop it). i wish i could get checked, but i have rly stereotypical parents who think ""people with mental illnesses are crazy"" & strongly believes im perfectly fine. so i doubt ill receive professional help so soon.

anyways, back to my point of this post,, i find it hard to catch up, but i NEED to esp before it's too late. i wanna know what are some tips prev j1s did that allowed them to stay ""afloat"" in jc or how to better cope with the rigour. & no i do not regret going to jc, i really enjoy the environment there (not much toxicity or dramas) and i doubt i can survive poly haha. my friends are really encouraging & supportive too. i just feel that i would be a burden if i tell them abt how im coping since they're also trying their best... i don't open up easily either so im not yet comfortable with telling my tutors ://",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/myands/jc_tips_advices_on_how_to_survive_jc/,"[""sleep 8hrs a day! pay attention in lecture, memorise all the j1 content whenever you have free time, complete all your tutorials on time\n\n^ are the stuff i regret not doing in j1 :')"", ""If you can't understand anything in lectures, then the best way to remedy this is to pre-read all your lecture notes prior to the actual lectures.

My classmates seem to be so on top of everything, always finishing homework early and getting so much revision done while i struggle to even complete the homework on time. When im in school i make these grand plans about going home and finishing assignments and making notes and doing extra revision etc, but in reality when i get home and see the huge list of things to do, i feel overwhelmed and im already quite tired and i end up doing almost nothing. Even if i plan less tasks, i get complacent and go like ""oh i have plenty of time to do it"" and end up not starting anything until around 10.30pm. I know it sounds pathetic but i dont know how to stop this. Also, i am quite addicted to my phone but unfortunately i need my phone to do a lot of my homework because my teachers use things like google classroom and padlet etc, so hiding my phone is not an option. I do use the Forest app, but i end up just mindlessly waiting for the timer to end so that i can use my phone again. I tried deleting distracting apps, but sooner or later i cave and download them again. 
Many people in my school are doing really well in their studies, but i didnt score very well for my WA1 and its only a few topics compared to MYE/Prelims/Os which is 2 to 4 years of content. I feel like i should make a study plan, but then again im not good at following the plans i make 😅

Maybe try to make a completely new YT acc and just use that acc to watch study with me kind of videos. I feel like that method motivates me a lot during prelims. And if you use your phone to do hw, then why just not finish those first then go on social media after. Like make it a goal for finishing hw or something.

What helped me was doing well in the subjects i was best at (math and science) which helped me to do better. For subjects I didn’t really like, it helps for me to study with friends and to ask them to test me. Maybe try studying with friends? and testing each other because it really forces you to remember the answers (mainly for subjects like geog, lit, history, ss) As for your phone, if you’re using iphone, i feel like screentime also helped me quite a bit (even tho i really lack self discipline and keep extending the time but better than nothing:) ) As for exam results and WAs, don’t worry TOO much about it. I’m not sure about your school but my school’s WAs were mainly based on specific topics and not a mix of everything hence, if i’m weak in a certain topic, I end up failing everything.

95,aowchie,lzuhc8,[A Levels] how i studied for As,2021-03-08 00:50:46,SGExams,77662,9,193,"helloooo its me again this is my second post on reddit HAHAHAHA so heres a few general studying tips that i employed in my studying for As hope it helps!! 
i took BCMx (all H2) for some context! 
if this post has good reviews i may make another post for the separate subjects hehe

1. keep all distractions away when studying (duh). cant emphasise this enough tho its really impt to not put ur electronic devices anywhere in sight. personally i place my phone inside the drawer behind me so its not that easy to reach it, and when i study sometimes i forget where i put my phone LOL

2. BEFORE STUDY BREAK, there are 3 things i mainly do: one, clarify all misconceptions, or work on weak topics. two, review all past internal examinations that you sat for, compare your original ans to the actual answer, write it down in another colour and understand where you went wrong. redo the questions if you have to until you get it right. three, read up on subject content, cuz u wont have much time for that during study break. 

3. slowly start doing ur tys at around june. i wouldnt advise starting in the beginning of the year, because yall would still be learning content and tys is mainly for timed practice and simulating the actual As. before that, just do ur tutorials and whatever papers your teachers ask yall to do. 

4. STUDY BREAK: PLAN. if you fail to plan you plan to fail simple as that. for me i allocate a day to one subject. weekends are for weaker subjects / things i fail to complete within the week, and friday is usually my rest day. plan whatever u wanna do the night before the day u carry out ur tasks. i always place whatever i have to complete in a pile on my table before going to bed so when i wake up i feel motivated to clear up the pile. 

5. if you love love food, like me, you would tend to get food coma right? HAHAHA i have found a way to prevent myself from dozing off in the afternoon at around 3-4pm :) i make myself a cup of hot tea everyday and place it on a coaster in my room, and have it while i study. i mean yall could get coffee or like bbt or whatever drinks yall wish but for me tea works the best (and also cuz at that time the teabags were expiring soon) 

6. STUDY BREAK: im not sure if this works for everyone, but i always track how long i have spent productively studying per day. i just click on some 10 hour long music tracks on youtube and play the video while studying. i dont listen to the music though, because it can get really distracting for me, until i end up jamming to the songs instead of focusing. i set a personal aim for 8 hours per day, but my studying time during that period ranged from 3 hours to 10 hours. dont force yourself to study so much though, so aim what you think you can manage per day and dont forget to give yourself some brain break :)

7. which comes to the next tip, which is always give yourself a break when needed. study break is the worst time to get a panic attack or to experience a burn out, so stop studying if you feel overwhelmed. for me i study in blocks of 1.5 hours, with a 15 minute toilet + brain break in between. if you feel tired, sleep early (i highly advise against taking power naps in the afternoon unless you can wake up easily). even if you feel unmotivated to study, dont study lol. dont force yourself to do what you dont feel like doing, but since you’re tight for time, do something that will make you motivated (for me, its getting new stationery).

8. STUDY BREAK: note down the papers that you’ve fully completed (attempting the paper + reviewed) on a piece of paper or post it and paste it somewhere where you can see it. it really does give me a sense of fulfilment whenever i see how much i have done and i feel even more determined to study more to be better prepared. be true to yourself though, dont keh keh write down more than you actually did it defeats the purpose of this. 

9. by the time As end, you should be done with the tys, or at least half of it, and should have at least done 1-2 prelim papers for each subject. very important. as much as reading up on content is important, practice makes perfect as there are many answering methods to different types of questions. 

10. also not sure if this works for everyone but i wake up at 4.30am on the day of a morning paper to cram in the content, of course i sleep slightly earlier. this is to refresh my memory for the subject and restart the ebbinghaus forgetting curve lol. for afternoon papers i wake up at 9.

96,asdfghjklmood,m5munj,[JC] been seeing alot of j1 burnout/stressed posts so hopefully this helps,2021-03-15 23:13:58,SGExams,77662,8,120,"hi j1s, i know that jc is definitely tough, even from the start. while its important to acknowledge the tough battle that you are just started on, its also important to not be overwhelmed. ur feelings are def valid, and its quite a known fact that jc is a huge jump from sec sch, but dont give up! 

here's some tips on coping w school (im a sci student btw) and just surviving in general

1. find an optimal study method for urself. its rly rly crucial for one to study smart instead of study hard esp bc jc content load is insane (at least for the subj i take lol) so efficient studying is a must!! can try diff study methods to see which works for u, rather than doing that right before exams lol
2. take things one step at a time. jc is definitely overwhelming, esp bc theres like endless things to do. a sense of urgency is def good, but not to the extent that youre stressed out before u even begin doing anyth (from personal experience this is the worst feeling ever 0/10 recommend). so just make sure you achieve your tasks one at a time, and not breakdown bc everything is coming to u at once (if this happens, its ok too but just try to settle ur emotions or else u cant do work properly)
3. find a good balance. this is esp applicable for the ambitious ones out there, be it with sl proj, ccas, extra curriculars or whatever you have. remember that one can only have so much on their plate at all times, so its vvvv important to manage ur commitments and pls pls pls learn to say no if u rly cant commit. ive seen many of my friends overcommit and end up gg to sch everyday just to sleep in their lessons and walk ard like a zombie so ya uh its a no go
4. sleep. pls heed my advice ik u have one billion things to do but no sleep -> no energy at sch -> no learning -> extra backlog. also, a word of caution/advice: if u start drinking caffeinated drinks, dont drink them everyday (but rather only when u rly need it), bc from personal exp i ended up sleeping 5 min aft drinking coffee when i just drank coffee like every single day. so ya lol its not fun when coffee doesnt work anym then u need rly strong coffee
5. dont compare urself too much to others. context: im from an ""elite"" jc and ya uh its def vvvvvv easy to feel demoralised when u compare urself to the top achievers in ur cohort. just focus on ur own learning and dont be overly critical on urself. also, im not saying completely heck care abt the pace of the cohort/class (falling behind class is not fun or beneficial, so try ur best to be on task) but ya just avoid unhealthy comparison. its not helping u so avoid that.

thats all i can think of for now. jc is undeniably tough as shit but take care of urself, alongside ur acads/extra stuff. this journey is definitely not smooth sailing lol and sometimes sch sucks super bad, but keep going (i dont mean at the expense of ur mental health) and youll be okay!!! take heart and take care people! all the best",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/m5munj/jc_been_seeing_alot_of_j1_burnoutstressed_posts/,"['really needed this right now... thank u sm :"")', 'thank you very muchhhh', 'Hi!

After doing that consistently, you'll begin to pick up certain phrases / evaluative points from comparing with the answer scheme when you're done. Then after awhile, you realize that the answers to the essay questions tend to test the same old concepts and you become more adept at dissecting questions quickly and accurately. For CSQ, be strategic and don't waste time trying to secure full marks for those 4 /5 mark questions.

The HR says the contracts holds for 2 years. It's not a scholarship or anything, didn't receive any lump sum money or benefit before joining. have to pay up for breaking the contract for everything including all the legal expenses.

Don't have the money to pay more than $14k which is a huge amount for low paying job.

What the actual fuck. Modern slavery much? So I don't think they will sue you. Ignore them fuckers"", ""This is gonna be a long response as I've been through this nonsense before and feel strongly about employees knowing their rights and not getting bullied. Pro-tip: some of these so-called 'policies' companies like to quote you for flouting and seeking reimbursement from you for are actually part of the employee handbook and not your contract. There is a difference. Employee handbook items do not constitute a contract and hence are legally unenforceable, the most they can do it fire you for non-compliance and since you're already leaving/left it makes no difference.\n\nAlso, under the employment act, employers are only allowed to make deductions to you salary under very strict guidelines. MOM won't allow people to suka suka dock your salary. In your case I don't know how your contract looks like, but I'm guessing they're suggesting this falls under 'unearned employment benefits'. However, typically as long as you're an employee, even till the last day of your notice, you're entitled to all benefits including training, medical coverage and paid leave (pro-rated of course).\n\nIf it's not in your actual contract, just ignore or ask them to do one. Suggest you call the mom hotline to inform them of this shenanigan and check with them what your rights are.\n\nYou can check more from the MOM website at [https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/salary/salary-deductions](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/salary/salary-deductions) but for quick reading here are the points I copied over:\n\n **For absence from work.** For a monthly-rated employee, your salary may be deducted for absences. \n\n* **For damage or loss of money or goods** including work gear, tools, equipment, and vehicles. Your salary will be deducted if you damage or lose such goods or money that you are responsible for. Before deducting your salary, your employer should:\n   * Hold an inquiry to determine if you are directly at fault.\n   * Not make any deductions until you have had the opportunity to explain the cause of the damage or loss.\n   * Not deduct more than 25% of your 1 month’s salary. The deduction must be made as a one-time lump sum payment.\n* **For supplying accommodation** that you have accepted.\n* **For supplying amenities and services** that the Commissioner for Labour has authorised and you have accepted.  \n**Note:** The total deductions for supplying accommodation, and amenities and services must not exceed the value of the accommodation, amenities or services supplied. It should also not exceed 25% of your salary for the salary period.\n* **For recovering advances, loans, overpaid salary or unearned employment benefits.**\n   * For advances, your employer can deduct your salary in instalments spread over not more than 12 months. Each instalment should not exceed 25% of your salary for the salary period.\n   * For loans, your employer can deduct your salary in instalments. Each instalment should not exceed 25% of your salary for the salary period.\n   * For overpaid salary and unearned employment benefits, your employer can recover the full amount from you.\n* **For** **CPF** **contributions.**\n* **For payments to any registered co-operative society** with your written consent.\n* **For other purposes** for which you consent in writing and your employer allows you to withdraw your written consent at any time.\n   * This is meant for deductions that would benefit the employee, and which the employer is in a position to collect the payment.\n   * Other than the deductions mentioned above, employers must not deduct an employee’s salary for items which are not to the benefit of the employee, such as for liquidated damages.\n   * The deduction also cannot contravene any other law. For example, if you are a foreign worker, your employer is [**not allowed to deduct your salary**](https://www.mom.gov.sg/employment-practices/salary/salary-deductions#deducting-salaries-of-foreign-workers) to recover levy costs."", 'Bring up MoM and tell them to stop their bullshit before you make a complaint about them claiming non-existent laws.  \n\nWhat do they think Singapore is?

It’s really easy to get burnt out, so a bunch of us got together to create a platform to help :) If you need a listening ear or just a friend to talk to :,)

We’re called I’m Friendly Co (with NUS SIC), but really we’re just some friends trying to make a difference, maybe make life a little better for some. We’ve been working to get this platform up for quite some time (almost 2 years now), but it's finally ready! So if you feel overwhelmed with school, friends etc, or just looking for someone to talk about life, or perhaps you would like to help others, be a support / friend to other students, then do join us for our launch! :) We will be sharing for the first time about how the platform will work, and how you can be a part of this! We believe in making a difference one conversation at a time, and we hope that you will join us in creating a space where the Hurt are Heard! :)

Our Launch Event is on Saturday, 20 March, 10-11.30am (online), do drop by if you are available! We’re also inviting a couple of remarkable people down to share about their experiences and about mental health, it will definitely be a morning well spent!

You can also find out more about our work and our launch event [here](https://imfriendlyco.carrd.co/)

For some of us that answer is a big **\'YES!\'** Friends that we are super grateful for, who took the time to listen and be a shoulder to cry on, but for others, that might not be the case. People who are hurting in silence. People who show up every day with a smile on their face saying that ""everything is okay"", only to sink further into their brokenness. A part of you know what I\'m saying is true, but many will continue to scroll and move on with their lives.\n\nToday I\'m encouraging you to make choice, a decision to make a difference.

100,throwRA19282928,lxa7w7,[Rant] I can’t do this anymore,2021-03-04 10:13:00,SGExams,77662,16,56,"I’m taking A levels this year and honestly, life has been going very downhill 

It first started when I breezed through promos without much intense revision, since I had plenty of time in J1 (especially with the CB) to slowly understand concepts. Did pretty decently, now everyone expects me to score for every single test. I personally don’t bother about comparing marks, but it sucks when people flock to you to ask for your marks and get disappointed when I don’t get an A

Now, along with leadership positions and intense CCA due to competition, plus the fact that I live at the opposite end of the country, I feel completely overwhelmed with work. I can reach home really late at night to the point it’s almost midnight if i shower and have a snack. 

And recently, I lost my best friend who has helped keep me sane throughout my school life. She just decided to block me out of her life (yes, she blocked me on social media) suddenly without much explanation. I’m so worried about what could’ve led her to do this. Is is because of her personal issues? Or perhaps she just thinks i’m annoying? 

I can’t sleep at night because I’m constantly worrying about these, or most of the time I cry myself to sleep and it’s deprived me of so much nap hours. I don’t know who to turn to because she has been my pillar of support for years. To lose someone important to me at this crucial year of A levels where I’m already facing tons of stress from school feels like crap. I have already lost my motivation to study, and I’m truly losing my will to continue on

TLDR: stress from cca + work + exams + leadership + friendship loss is sucking up my will to live",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/lxa7w7/rant_i_cant_do_this_anymore/,"['For your best friend, I would suggest if it’s possible then you should try to go talk to her and ask what happened. It will help lift a burden from your mind and allow you to focus more on studying\n\nAs for exams and A levels, don’t take into account what others expect from you or what they say(I know it’s easier said than done but trust me when you stop taking into account what other people expect or think of you, it makes working towards your goal a lot easier)\n\nJust focus on yourself and your personal improvement. If you think you are weak at a certain topic then try to read up and understand the concepts and definitely consult your teacher. I am sure they will be more than willing to help you. \nAs for exams, focus on your personal improvement and ensure that you give your best effort. That’s all that matters. If you want to know how you are fairing, look at the range of the percentiles in your result slip and just try to stay in the same range(or go to a better range) every exam. \nJust don’t give up!!\n\nAs for leadership positions, all this will end by June? So till then you just have to press on and try your best manage. It’s ok if you can’t but just give your best imo and don’t give up:)', 'If you don’t mind me asking, is it possible to be excused from further competitions due to this huge workload that you have? I think your CCA Teacher-in-charge might be understanding and give you a break. Teachers are expected to intervene and prioritize how you’re coping over cca performance. Also since it’s A level year, you should tell your teacher as soon as possible.\n\nSince you live very far from school, how do you get home? Do you take public transport? Depending on traffic conditions, maybe you could consider taking Grab every once in a while. It really sucks that you have to travel such a long distance to get home :(\nAnd it also seems that the journey home has been eating up a ton of your time. If it really is unavoidable, I have a few suggestions that include: getting a clipboard so you can write notes on the way home, to my knowledge there is apparently a LOT of recorded lectures that need to be watched. Maybe you can bring a power bank with you and watch on the way home? If you have trouble paying attention in class, maybe u can ask your table partner to record for you (and upload the video into Google Photos to conserve storage space). If your school doesn’t allow, try to ask permission from ur teacher, since it’s for your own personal use there should be no problems with it.\n\nRegarding your best friend, these things do happen, people will cut ties spontaneously and it really really  sucks when it happens. It might not be her own decision, maybe her parents made her cut off ties with you, she could also be in a bad spot and did it impulsively. From the way you talk abt her, I assume you guys are really really close, and that you appreciate her a lot as a friend. Whatever happens next, give her the benefit of the doubt, and don’t think that it’s your fault if you’ve done nothing wrong! I hope that your parents, siblings or other school friends can understand what you are going through and give you support. My advice is to just have someone that you can immediately contact, who knows that you’re going to depend on them for support. This person doesn’t even have to be very close to you, they just need to be aware that you’re facing difficulties. Maybe you can ask one of the nice teachers in your JC/the school counselor/your parents? Just let this person know that you are a) facing difficulty with school, and b)might contact them spontaneously if everything gets too overwhelming. When you contact them, you can just say something as simple as ‘life is giving me lemons today, what do you think I should do with them?’ This might help to relieve some of your stress and give you some stability.\n\nAs for your sleeping situation, I’m really sorry to hear that all these stresses are keeping you awake. I imagine that it takes a long time to get to school so you must have to wake up hella early. Is it possible, to sleep as soon as you reach home (less time between reaching home and sleeping means less time for worry to build up, plus I think you’ll be really tired once you reach home so won’t be as productive), wake up earlier in the morning, shower, and do your homework then? Because of the traveling time and everything, you’ll probably get the same number of hours of sleep, but your sleep quality might improve and your work might be more productive. Not sure if the system I suggested will work tho, maybe u can try giving it a shot for 1-2 days?\n\nAll the stuff I suggested are just some random ideas you can try, but only you can determine what works and what doesn’t work\n\nI believe you can do it! A-levels year is intense, but keep working hard, keep doing what you need to do each and every day, and you WILL GET THERE! 😊', 'have you tried calling her? perhaps from a different phone if she doesn’t want to pick up? try to reach her if possible, and it’s more likely than not a misunderstanding has occurred considering it happened so suddenly without any prior warning.', ""reduce cca/leadership commitments. shouldn't be focusing on cca in J2 anyway"", 'just focus on your academics? quit your cca and leadership positions', 'In terms of A Levels, ignore what everyone thinks about your score. Your job is to make sure you can achieve to fulfil your dreams, not their dreams. \n\nFor the issue on best friends, talk to her I guess. It will lift some heaviness and maybe you can gauge your friend better.\n\nLeadership wise, I\'m in EXCO and I agree the pressure is insane because CCA maintenance, accountability, planning of sessions and possible VIAs and etc..  my suggestion is if you really cannot handle it, you could talk to your EXCO members and see if they can help you a little. Like hold a meeting and gauge it. Usually for us, theres 2 of us and we often check in on each other at random times and make sure we\'re okay. Esp cos he\'s in 4h2 and he\'s been having a depressive bout lately I\'ve mostly taken control of the CCA while he manages. Your EXCO is a more intimate support team! Utilise it. If legit cannot, talk to your chers, they will understand! You could temporarily step down and find your zen again. Teachers usually monitor the wellbeing so do stay in touch. They work on a feedback system:>\n\nFor schoolwork omg I can aGREE that we\'re piling up so fast!!

I keep telling myself it’s fine but I end up still worrying over it.

I intend on going to poly but i still want to do well for o's. im aiming for around l1r4 <10? 
for subjects like english and literature, i really have NO idea on how to improve especially with literature, i got a c6 which pulled my combined to a c5 overall. 

Should i just give up on the subjects im sure im not planning to use for o's ? I take pure double science, pure geog, amath and elect lit/ss. I intend to use english, emath, chinese, chem(?) and geog for my l1r4. 

1. should i drop amath? I have absolutely no interest in the subject but I've heard that the bell curve is quite good for amath. I scored a B4 for amath this time round which is not that bad....

2. How can i improve my chinese in 12 days ? I scored a2 for my school exam and im very worried i wont be able to get A1 for O levels

3. How to revise during the june holidays?

I recommend you listing down all the assignments and papers you plan to do during the June hols and refer to them, and cancel anything you have finished. Overtime, you will feel motivated since you realise that you are making progress. Moreover, my listing down all of your work you feel a sense of relief since you can see everything you need to do and you don’t need to worry if you are going to forget to complete something.

102,unicorn36000,lxc7i2,[Uni] Tips on retaking A levels,2021-03-04 12:05:21,SGExams,77662,20,211,"As a private candidate who retook As in 2020, I know how scary and uncertain the road ahead can be, but it's definitely possible to take this path and ace the As. This is just to share the things I did when I decided to retake As and revision tips during As exam season. I took BCME in JC and BCE/m when I retook As.

**Compile and Plan**

This is very important! In JC, I didn't organise my revision materials and plan my time and before I knew it, half a year had flew past.

Compile a list of study materials by topic(e.g. tutorials, topical revision worksheets) from your JC so that you know what you have and what you may need to buy to give yourself extra practice! Download all soft copy materials from your school portal, **especially if they include science practicals/practical notes** if you still have access to it, you never know if they might turn out to be useful. Ask friends from other school if they are willing to give you their notes and tutorials with answer keys as well so that you can have more practice.

Check the syllabus for your examination year against the previous year including all of the fine print, and I did this for all my subjects just to make sure that I don't learn content that won't be tested/missed out content that will be tested in the A levels.

I also did a week by week plan for every subject that I was taking, where I had to complete a topic for every subject each week(including summary notes, tutorials, marking of tutorials etc). This really helped with the uncertainty and anxiety I was feeling as this gave me a plan till June/July and I had somewhere to start. I listed down all the topics that was in each subject and started with the topic that I was weakest in in JC.  From June/July onwards, revision includes TYS, practice papers and I didn't really have a plan for that as by then I already had my momentum and my foundation was already there from all the tutorials that I had done and I just did a practice paper per week for each subject for revision. However, from July onwards, I counted down the number of weeks to my first A level paper so I roughly know how long I have before I have to be fully prepared for As.

**Study Techniques**

1. Pomodoro technique really helped me to focus, as well as youtube study with me videos!(didnt feel so lonely mugging after watching those)
2. It's not the quantity of hours studied, but rather the quality! I studied 6 days a week, giving myself one day off to do whatever I want which can range from shopping to Netflix. From Feb-July, I studied only about 4 hours per day, but I made sure that during the 4 hours, I completely understand the material and content taught and could do the tutorials without having to refer to the lecture notes for specific concepts. Took lots of naps between my study sessions!
3. **Summary notes!** I felt that my summary notes were the ones that helped me to really master the topics, rather than tutorials. Tutorials simply helped me to have greater exposure to higher order questions. Because of the fact that I had already taken a few exams in JC, I knew which parts of the topic were more important and frequently tested so I focused my attention on those concepts and made notes on those instead of simply copying out the entire set of notes without learning anything. My summary notes also included mistakes that I made in my tutorials/hard tutorial questions, so when I revised I could see where I went wrong.
4. Practicals. I was in science stream and as a private candidate, I didn't have access to labs and wasn't willing to pay exorbitant fees to practice at labs run by tuition centres, which was also a reason why I only started revising for my science practicals in August, and really made me panic. I was uncertain on how should I go about studying for my practicals. What I did was read through my school practical revision notes(thankfully I had a thick stack of those from my JC with extra practicals that was undone as those were given right before As when I was in JC and of course I didnt have time to look through them) as well as practicals that I had did in JC and try to visualise doing the practicals.
5. **Ask for help!** Just gotta remember that even though you are a private candidate studying at home, you are not alone in this fight! Don't be afraid to ask for help from juniors in JC, they would know the latest syllabus/have the latest notes if you are not sure! For e.g. in my year there was Common last topics removed, and I checked with juniors in JC just to make sure that I wasn't studying the wrong things!
6. Focus on the present, just do it! Don't let thoughts of uncertainty about the future overwhelm you, focus on completing your daily tasks. Learn to celebrate small successes everyday. An extreme measure, but I deleted my IG so that I wouldn't be comparing how my friends are all having fun and learning new things in uni while im retaking As.

**Timeline**

Feb-June/July: Completing my topical revision! I felt that this was a really important part for me as I had a solid foundation by the time I did revision and doing the TYS felt like a piece of cake, giving my the confidence to tackle the A levels. Don't cut corners, make sure you cover all the topics and completed the tutorials!(I probably did about 3-4 schools worth of tutorials for each topic for all of my H2 subjects, but I was able to complete those tutorials really quickly because I understood the concepts well, thanks to my summary notes)

July-September: Probably did one revision paper for each topic per week/topical revision and grinding practicals because by now I haven't touch practicals for about half a year so I really recommend starting earlier! I would study for about 6-8 hours per day by now as practicals take me a really long time, as I wanted to familiarise and understand the different techniques for both of my biology and chemistry practicals! And if you analyse enough practical papers, you will realise that for bio and Chem, the questions for practicals are pretty standard and it is possible to compile a list of standard questions and keywords used to answer those questions! For revision papers, quality over quantity and as I didnt have a benchmark(e.g. school exams), I was pretty strict with myself when marking those papers and I made sure to compile the keywords that I was missing out and the topics that I made mistakes in and to revise the topics again.

October onwards: start of A level season! By this time, my foundation was already pretty strong and im quite confident going into the exam hall, so I did papers if I have the time, on other days I revise using my summary notes to make sure that I go though my concepts once more.

So basically i was posted to unit and lets just say im no longer feeling like myself. Like idk i am having soo much stress and its overwhelming. Sometimes i just get anxious and worried for no reason and when i do i just stop whatever im doing and stone there for no reason (which honestly idk why). I also sometimes break down for no reason. I have family issues and financial issues and with NS, im honestly overwhelmed by the amount of stress. 

I get anxious easily so whenever I am stressed or shouted at my hands wills start shivering and shaking and my mind goes into a blank. In some instances i even feel sleepy and might toh. (One time during force prep). 

Honestly everyday im just a walking body, no soul. I didnt had a good past and I am doubtful that I will have a better future. Sometimes i just think that its better for me to end myself so that maybe some other useful person can just take over my place. I'm honestly mentally tired and if I feel like if im shouted at again i might lose it. Im on the brink of breaking and i really dont know where to go from here. Im so lost.

I really want to be a good soldier. I do. But sometimes my circumstances dont allow and sometimes I just blame myself for being so useless. (Like ""ehh wtf people can do why you cannot do"").

Now it’s end of April and I am trying to put my best foot forward but I’m unsure of what is “correct” and effective when studying. Like for bio, there’s content and application.

**#4 STUDY TIPS**     

During the workshop, our guest speakers - Alex and Justtin, shared some useful studying tips:   

1. **Listen during lessons and do your homework on time**! Though  simple it is  important because it ensures you keep up and avoid homework snowballing. Just Listening and understanding during lessons is a step up from trying to understand it by yourself in your own time.    
2. If you find your mind wandering/difficulty concentrating, **do something mindless** while studying, eg. walking around/listening to Lo-fi.     
3. **Set a time limit** and keep to it, so that you don’t end up procrastinating (eg. set a timer for 2h to finish an essay instead of giving yourself ‘as much time as needed’.  
4. Take **regular study breaks!** Especially if you are memorizing and it feels overwhelming, take a few minutes to refresh your mind!    
5. Find out the **best studying conditions** for yourself. What is the environment in which you can focus best? Who are the hard-working study buddies who will motivate you to study?    
6. **Ask questions beyond curriculum** \- This can broaden your understanding and fill in the little links you’re currently missing. Questioning what you’re studying rather than passively accepting it is also far better for memory retention and general understanding.     
7. Remember to **practice**! Practice makes perfect, building your proficiency in the subject.

* Be selective! You just need to take down the key points the teacher/lecturer is saying.  
* Ask other friends for notes    
* Practice! If you use handwritten notes, practice writing faster or use a lighter pen. If you’re in a school where you’re allowed to use a laptop, use it, and practice typing fast.      

1. ***How can I juggle between CCA and studies/How do I apply spaced repetition to my busy schedule?***    

* Props to you! It’s very difficult to juggle between these two heavy commitments, and many people have had difficulties doing so.  
* Try using digital flashcards. The biggest benefit that digital has over physical is accessibility: we can take it wherever we go and we can revise on the fly e.g. on the bus to school/meetings, during short breaks.    

1. ***How to procrastinate less?/How can I motivate myself to continuously be productive in studying?***    

* **Start slow.** Take note of how much time you currently spend studying, and gradually work your way up from there, peaking when you’re near major exams.    
* **Take breaks often.** Try not to overload yourself by regularly spending 8-9 hours studying non-stop. You should break up your time into blocks with breaks in between (using Pomodoro technique, or variants of it) to keep yourself focused.    
* Even then, try to be **consistent** in studying so that you won’t have to wind up in such scenarios in the first place. Instead of mugging in the few days before the exam, space out your revision such that you start earlier, but do fewer hours each day.    

**#6 Conclusion**

hello! im a j1 student who just had their first day at school today and honestly it could have went better than it did. people were really super friendly (some were so extroverted hahah) which was nice! but after a while, being an introvert like i am, i couldnt keep up with their energy, especially when my social battery started rapidly depleting. it got quite tough because i was overwhelmed by the sheer number of students (i also felt intimidated by the huge number of ip students), and was super anxious and awkward. the ip students were rly rly nice & they weren’t exclusive at all, but i couldnt help but feel a gap since they are already so bonded & close. despite their friendly efforts to engage with me, i still felt rly distant & disoriented & struggled to keep the conversation going. there were also times when i was so confused during ori & didnt rlly know what was going on; i really just wanted to curl up in a hole & die LOL. 

i keep telling myself that orientation will get better with time as i slowly integrate into the school, but right now it’s a little hard to think positively. tbh it was extremely draining & overwhelming for me :(( i know im likely not to be the only one who feels this way tho; first days are usually tough for a lot of people. so, if there’s anyone who feels the same as i do, could we just talk it out and encourage each other? im trying to muster the strength to face monday with more confidence. & anyone with advise would be welcome and much appreciated too :’)",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/l7or62/jc_rant_rough_first_day/,"[""i kind of feel this way even tho my jc doesn't have ip! because i usually tend to be the reciprocator and not the initiator haha. but i have hope that i can somehow muster up the courage and talk to at least 5 people on monday, and i hope you do too <3"", ""Bruh you and me are in a same boat. Interacting with people is painful, especially when you're actually putting in the effort to do it and doubly so when it's not working out."", '1 word for you. 忍。(Tolerate.)\n\nIt will all come to an end soon. Most people know JC is a really muggy environment. Those who want to mug need not fear of socialising that much. When you settle into your classes a few weeks from now, all the energy will die down, and it’s back to normal.', 'hey i know how you feel too. my jc has a huge campus and the moment i arrived i already felt overwhelmed with everything and the OGLs were already sending me on my way and i didnt even get a chance to breathe\n\nthe ip students and ogs were really welcoming and friendly but im not an extroverted person so my social battery drained really quickly and i though i tried to talk to my og group members, as the day progressed i lost the energy and motivation to talk. ended up keeping to myself after that. \n\ni wish i could have done better and at least got to form a stronger bond with my group mates but its not easy for people like us.', ""Omg samee I feel u\nI'm like a half extrovert but like lack of new social interaction for so long and like the overwhelming amount of new people drained me so much and I just cannot human interaction anymore to be honest.\nAlso it doesn't help that I'm super bad at names and faces so it's so awkward to continuously not know people's names during the ice breakers. I feel so embarrassed ;-; like I might remember that there is a certain name in my group but I won't remember what face it corresponds to and I was basically lost when I got separated even though they were nearby. Urghh life is hard ;-;"", 'Hello! I was also from a JC-IP school too and I totally understand what you are facing. My first day of school was slightly overwhelming because I was definitely still warming up to people and everyone was so nice which is great :D but yeah I guess 2 months of anti-socialness did something to me LOL. No worries it will get better soon as the days go, maybe you can find a common topic amongst your og mates I believe that helps to break the ice a little. One of my og mates ended up in the same class as me and we are close friends till today so I hope that you will find someone you can click with soon! Jiayou :)', ""I felt so awkward the whole day :/ like everyone already had stuff in common and I couldn't bring myself to butt into any of their conversations,  so I ended up sitting by myself and not talking. I wasn't being antisocial on purpose but extroverted people are so freaking intimidating and although they are nice,  I don't find them very approachable :( hoping I'll find people I can talk to soon but I really feel so awkward around my group :/"", 'I haven’t met my school’s IPs yet and our ori actually only officially start on MONDAY. I’m hoping it all goes well, keeping an open mind AHAHAHA', 'I remember feeling like you once upon a time! Would just like to offer some perspective which hopefully makes you feel better :) I know it’s hard to believe it right now, but orientation groups don’t matter at all. Know that what you are experiencing now will not form your overall time in JC, which is spent primarily with your classmates and CCA batchmates :) In those fixed settings, it’s much easier to form lasting friendships due to shared experience, so even if you have low energy/ are on the extreme end of the introversion scale, I’m sure you will find your own group of friends! Jiayous pushing through these few days of orientation, it’ll get better! :)', ""First day was kinda tough for me too :(( im an introvert like you, and the whole time i was telling myself to go up to someone and talk but i couldnt really muster up the courage. Mostly everyone in my orientation group made friends and formed pairs already, even though they were from different schools, and i guess they became friends really quickly. It left me even more scared, because i wanted to make friends too but i felt that it would be weird if i just asked to join a pair. I also didn't know how to socialise haizz. So im kinda really scared for the jc year, because im not sure if everyones gonna become good friends and i wont have anyone. Its also kinda scary to think that i might have to keep a mask up the whole time in school, since my personality is kinda weird?? or unique i guess and idk if i can meet people who will accept me for who i am. In my sec 3 and sec 4 class, i didnt meet those people so i felt really out of place in my class the whole two years :(. I hope jc wont be the same tho"", ""I've graduated alr but i was once in an IP school too,, and people may look extroverted and friendly but everybody is dying trying to keep up an energetic facade haha i rmb my friends were all complaining about social burnout what w OG orientation and then class orientation again! and tbh not all of us know each other, it's more of an i see u b4 and ure my friends friends friend kinda thing!"", 'Yea same dude, I try very hard to be outgoing and talk to people, but it’s rather tiring and I can’t wait for orientation to end haha...', ""Same. I feel the gap between jaes and ip student. But in my school. They were very welcoming. So my experience was quite okay. But I feel that I would really be friends with them in the long run. I think it will be hard to make friends for me since I'm introverted and kinda weird"", ""im from an ip school and im actl really excited to meet yall so bls bls bls hang in there i swear there will be at least one person who will reach out to u and genuinely want to strike a connection! i relate with being an introvert a LOT and yepp it's defintely really tough to socialise. but! u have my fullest support. hang in there! i believe time is the best medicine/determiner/helper for making social connections -- it might not work out immediately, but it might with more time. jiayou!"", ""You're from ej right"", 'Just curious, what school are you posted to?', 'thank u! uk what im going to make that my goal for monday ☺️ lets do it tgt', 'Happy cake day!', 'righttt omg. once u run out of things to say it just gets so awk & my brain stops functioning', 'omgg this was literally such a problem for me too. trying to rmb sm names when adjusting to this completely new environment is hard .. hopefully with time it’ll get easier & we’ll feel less awkward 😔😔', 'thank u! im looking forward to being more familiar w my sch mates :””', 'tbh i think if ure extroverted you will likely have a good time! ppl were more friendly than i expected its just that i had a rly hard time processing all the new things that were happening around me. just keep an open mind & do ur best. good luck!', ""RI right haha\nI mean on the first day I'm already dead just by sitting for hours"", 'Ay similar experience, felt overwhelmed by the amount of students coming in from schools like anderson and chung cheng at my jc lol. They stuck to each other mostly and they were friendly but hard to connect and approach with rip esp since they seemed to have formed their cliques alr', 'lowkey same, but im also hoping it’ll be more fun the next few days even tho its super tiring talking to ppl ..', ""Yea that's me too lmao. Honestly I'm kind of sure I'm going to get left behind once the group starts getting closer. \n\nOn the bright side orientation doesn't really matter because we get grouped into classes based on subejct combinations anyway."", 'Thank u OP !', 'IKR....', 'RIGHTTTT!!!

108,thrway4736251,nh1pvb,[rant] advice or opinions please? unpredictable situation :/,2021-05-20 22:29:49,SGExams,77662,1,17,"i'm not sure which tag this should go under, but i'll just put it in rant.

backstory, i'm currently in my first year of poly (turning 17). i'm a foreigner, have been studying in sg since i was 3. not pr, applied but didn't get. some personal things came up and long story short, there's no guarantee my parents will still be employed next year onwards (old age, covid, foreigners) and so they'll be forced to go back if that happens, and subsequently i will be forced to leave the country as well

i've done some research on the future possibilities, and i'm focusing on studying and working in canada. here's the problem... if we leave next year, the only qualifications i have are my o level grades and like.. one year of diploma. but most (if not all) universities in canada, or for that matter in the uk, australia, america, etc) require a few A level subjects... i'm planning to take psych (specifically bsc) but i just passed c in chem and failed d in bio LOL but the rest of my subjects are pretty good A1 A2 B3

what do i do? :/ i know there are foundation programs but i'm really struggling to find more information about it (i've found some, but can't see any admission requirements so i'm not sure if i'll be able to go there)

my thoughts are.. maybe i can take SATs while i'm in poly now? i really don't know what to do. i feel like i'm running out of time as well. i've been trying to contain my anxiety but it really seems like it's starting to get out of hand. i'm definitely going to try and at least complete the 3 years of poly here, maybe it will serve as a replacement for a levels/sat/act/etc... but i'm scared if the situation goes on to the worse side, where we're forced to leave next year and i genuinely will be stuck because i don't know what to do

i know it might be a little too early but i'm a normally anxious person when it comes to my future and the fact that all this is happening right now is quite overwhelming so i'd really appreciate as much views and thoughts on this as possible

i feel so guilty because i could've just left the country before enrolling into poly and now i've wasted my parents money all for it to go to waste if we end up leaving next year :/ i've been constantly looking at canadian universities (bc canada is my priority but i will look at the uk later on maybe) the past week almost? and i've just been having constant breakdowns every single night bc i feel so stressed over this. i feel like i have no time and time is just constantly going faster and faster.. i want to stop thinking about it and let my brain rest but if i stop researching about the possibilities then i get too anxious again...:/",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/nh1pvb/rant_advice_or_opinions_please_unpredictable/,"['my cousin who was homeschooled used the community college route. i think community colleges in the states or smaller colleges in canada are pretty easy to get into(they accept a variety qualifications). i think there was a redditor here that got into one with sg o levels. basically, you do 2 years in a community college and transfer over to a bigger public university(in my cousin’s case she transfered into U of Waterloo). she said that there a ton of international students pursuing this route. she’s doing a bsc in pysch rn also. of course your grades do matter when you are at a cc to apply for a transfer. i think you can consider this route. some community colleges are essentially feeder schools to those big public universites and can be cheaper in terms of fees iirc(?).']"
109,jichuchutram,lnog28,[A LEVELS] What should I do with my rank points?,2021-02-20 03:36:02,SGExams,77662,22,271,"Got back results today, 66.25rp.

Read online that universities take into account MTL grades so after factoring that in, my rank points are now 68.6 rp. I took H2 Physics, Chem and Math with H1 Econs. (CDD/C with gp B)

&#x200B;

I was thinking if I should **retake as a private candidate**?

However, my tutor told me that I need to think this course of action carefully as we somewhat benefitted from the CLTs last year, but because of the CLTs, we didn't learn those topics and all these topics are tested this year. Which means I need to master these topics completely on my own. Also cost wise, it'd add up to about $700 or more in total. (That's kinda pricey ngl.)

&#x200B;

Also considered **retaking in school as J2 repeat**.

My school is reviewing all applications on a case by case basis, and application closes on 2 March. My civics tutor was not very supportive of me choosing this option when I brought it up earlier as he saw me through the worst state of my mental health in J2 when I was leaving class and hiding in the toilet crying, absenting myself from school to hide from socialising and even just zoning out in class when my mind is fuzzy. (Will explain why this happened later.) He felt that repeating J2 wouldn't be beneficial for my mental wellbeing, and that I still have other options available, hence this should not be my first course of action.

However, I can't get anywhere near what I want with my kind of grades.

&#x200B;

Here are some courses I was looking at ***prior to A Levels back in 2020***:

1. NUS Medicine (via ABAS)
2. NUS Science (Physics) + NIE Postgraduate Diploma in Education (JC)

***As of now with my current grades***, some paths I am considering:

1. NTU Physics (68.75RP)
2. NUS Biomedical Engineering (75RP)
3. NTU Bioengineering (71.25RP)
4. NTU Engineering (63.75RP)
5. SMU Science in Economics (70RP)

Can someone give me an idea of whether I should try for this courses?

Would personally prefer NUS due to location and costs.

&#x200B;

**Just some personal backstory, skip it if you're not interested:** I was doing very well academically back in J1 and I was my tutors' prospective straight As student despite having oversleeping habits so I was often late for school like at least once a week? Yes I went on to do well for my promos and I did OGL for orientation as well (first bad choice I made). I was pulled into Openhouse committee head duties as a result of my past experience and with the team I had, I ended up tanking most of the work and my studies were compromised alongside the overwhelming house dance practices for Orientation. When orientation finally ended, I thought I could settle down and study but then COVID came and I missed my block tests because I was placed on LOA. I only had 2 days of school before circuit breaker kicked in and then I was at home all day. It was during this period of time where I thought I could finally study and catch up when my dad was retrenched and his inferiority complex worked up that he had to exert his dominance at home. He was taking it out on me everyday, blaming me for my existence, disrupting my HBL by barging into my room and yelling at me, locking me out of the house at 9pm during circuit breaker, banning me from cooking my meals etc. It was alot of yelling and alot of blaming that at some point, I didn't know who I was. It felt like everything's that went wrong in his life was really my fault and I wanted to disappear. I wanted to take my own life and end my misery. I was crying everyday because I want to study but I couldn't find the energy to get out of bed. Instead of focusing on studying, I was more focused on staying out of my dad's way at home so I don't get scolded again. I was tired of being constantly called a redundant kid, the one he didn't want, useless and all. When school resumed, the drama at home went on, and I found it even harder to wake up and go to school and see my peers doing just fine while I was struggling emotionally and mentally.

Maybe it was also some form of existential crisis, because suddenly, I just didn't know who I was and what I needed to do. I couldn't sit still in class, I was finding excuses to go out and just walk or sit at some place spacing out at the greenery. Was it depression? I don't know. But then one of my tutor finally noticed something was off about me being frequently absent from school and being late that he confronted me about it, which led to my civics tutor finally talking to me about it as he just thought I was late more often due to exam stress. I cried telling him what happened and I admitted that I wanted to die at that point in time because my parents didn't want me anymore and they're blaming me for my existence. Ever since then, he kind of became my adult who checks in on me on a weekly basis, talking to me about future goals, my current feelings etc. He tries to give me something to look forward to, and he was there to celebrate every single one of my small wins with me, e.g. coming to school on time, being present for a week, not missing any lessons; but he was also there to encourage me through the lows, e.g. going over my mycts and prelims papers to see what went wrong and how to improve, constant validation of my hardwork and changes.

When I was at the verge of giving up on A Levels, my civics tutor and my other subject tutor were there to support me to push through. They taught me to see the light at the end of the tunnel even when it all looks bleak. I guess because of them, I'm still alive today, and that I can now safely say that I made it through A Levels. Honestly felt like I wasted their time from back then today, because I still did badly and didn't meet their expectations but it was really my best at that point in time.

&#x200B;

While my results are quite disappointing nonetheless (I went from As and Bs to the kind of grades I have right now), I too want all of you fellow graduates out there to know **that** ***there are far greater battles to fight in life, and A Levels is just one small fight.*** ***There'll always be a way out of whatever situation we're in***, depending on our rank points. ***Don't give up, keep looking, keep asking, keep exploring. Someone, something, somewhere, will show you the path that you can take.***

113,mochifluffstacks,l9vcki,[A levels] Ambition Is Secondary To Merit,2021-02-01 13:02:55,SGExams,77662,36,167,"
This is pretty much a salty, bitter rant about how I feel post-JAE. 

I’m posting on a throwaway account as I don’t wish for my identity to be compromised. For context, I scored 15 raw 13 nett for Os, which seemed pretty fair given the amount of effort I put in. It was enough for me to meet the COP of my dream JC that offered a subject combination that would closely relate to my intended major in uni. 

Unfortunately, I got posted to xJC, which my parents forced me to put as my third choice. I had absolutely no motivation to go to xJC at all and I started spiralling really badly. I lean towards humanities heavily, scoring distinctions in English, Elit and combined Humanities. 

I know exactly what I want in life, where I want to end up, and I’ve always leaned towards arts even as a child. At first I was blaming myself, couldn’t I just score one point less to be safe? 

I appealed to my dream JC (as I met COP), and I appealed to zJC. zJC offered me a place right after the interview, whilst dream JC has not responded at all. 

I know I messed up my JAE when I decided to listen to my parents, I know how stuck I am and being lost in my own overwhelming emotions is far from ideal. Most of all, I feel bitter. I want to study English language and Literature in Oxford, and I had mapped out how I would end up there. Sure, this JC thing is just a little deviation from the main plan because it’s JC nonetheless, but I never expected it to be so hard-hitting. 

Additionally, I volunteer somewhere with people from high-profile backgrounds and elite JCs, with my dream JC perceived as being the lower tier JCs already, so a self-created inferiority complex comes into play.

Most of all, I am bitter that merit outweighs ambition by a long shot, especially since I excel in the areas I’m ambitious about. I have no other choice than to make do with what I have, of course, but I feel devastated. 

I’m going down to zJC today to stamp my form A, (sealing my fate haha) wherein I will be unable to accept dream JC’s offer should they choose to accept me. (I have a pretty strong portfolio, but I don’t want to take the gamble anymore.) 

I’m trying to keep my head up and let this setback fuel my desire to do even better for A’s, but for now it’s hard and I just want to wallow in misery and be pathetic. 

With all my points being said, I wonder if anyone has felt the same? Thanks for reading this long rant! :,)

I'm a new investor who does not have much knowledge of investing yet. Hoping to get some advice or opinion as I venture into financial independence and become a long-term stable investor. 

I am keen on purchasing etf(s), more specifically STI & S&P 500. Just these two for now as I'm just starting out and do not want to be overwhelmed by the research I have to do for individual stocks yet. I would like some opinions on which approach should I take, investing using tiger brokers or let it be managed by a RSP (currently looking into FSMOne as this seems to fit my criteria)?

**More backstory:** Currently a nsf (5 months into NS) and do not have that much time to constantly monitor or worry about stocks, hence I have been leaning onto a RSP which allows me to set up auto montly top ups for DCA. But, I've heard about tiger brokers, which has been offering low commission rates and more, and thought about using it instead as I wanted to be as efficient as possible. However, I was swayed by the skeptics of tiger brokers (i.e. how safe is the money with such a new broker compared to more established brokers that have been around in sg for longer). Hence, been on the fence and unsure on how I should proceed. 

My apologies if I sound ignorant at any point.

However, it may be slightly cheaper to purchase from Tiger Brokers if you do a quarterly DCA instead.\n\nAlso do note that with any ETF in the market, there may be a minimum initial sum to pay before you can enter a position with the ETF.

Im honestly still undecided on whether to stay in jc or to transfer. Posting here to ask for advice from seniors who are studying in biomed sci now. Here are some of my questions & concerns :)

1. How does the content taught in BMS compare to that in H2 bio ? I’ve taken a look at the modules but still not sure if there are similarities ? Does it also focuses more on the molecular side of biology?

2. I’ve heard that bms is quite a competitive course and workload is quite heavy also. Is this true ? Is it hard to maintain a high GPA ?

I didn't know how to write a proper essay until I attended GP tuition. My English isn't even that great as my foundation wasn't strong.

No lengthy explanations and he didn\'t bother to talk about theory or definition. The strange thing was I actually understood all of it. The format for the rest of the lesson was attempting to do 1 qn and going through and then 1 more qn and going through until tuition ended.\n\nThe classroom sizes were nearly the same as sch. Except for the 5 min lecture at the start of tuition, I am sure all of the students just talked random stuff to their friends through the entire duration of the class while doing the deliberate practice and only stopped when he was going through the questions. It was like 10% lecture then 70% trying to apply what we learn in the first 5 min and 20% going through.\n\nI was so happy I magically started scoring A1 for Math in sec 3. My friends knew it wasn\'t a fluke because I got 88% overall (they described it as me having a secret top martial arts sensei imparting forbidden techniques to me that made me what I am). A lot of my friends joined my tuition class (8 of them and the tuition class size blew up lol).

121,SaltyShellback,jkz2fx,"On staying sane and doing ""better""",2020-10-30 23:39:19,singapore,378641,57,728,"Hihi, uncle coming to nag again, if I sound deluded and this post is unhelpful to you, I apologize in advance. 

Been coming across plenty of posts exclaiming despair and sorrow at how fucked up the world is, or why xxx did xxx today and why xxx should go to hell and die. 

Yesterday, a young passenger took a ride from me (grab driver) and asked me with a touch of sadness. He asked, given the state things are today, isn't life meaningless and hopeless? Something must be terribly wrong, that our younger brothers and sisters are feeling hopeless despite the comfort and peace we enjoy in Singapore! 

The world isn't fucked up. The world have always been the way it is. In the short history of humanity, we have had countless wars and epidemics. Covid 19 is nothing compared to WW2 or the black death. It's just something that have happened during our short lifetime and that we are too young and too fortunate to have experienced anything truly ""fucked up"". 

Now R/SG community is largely wholesome and kind. That's why we are happy to see wholesome posts on random act of kindness and feel compassion for victims of crime and injustice. 

In order to help make the world ""better"", we must first find our own inner peace. While compassion is beautiful, we can't make meaningful contributions when we are consumed by rage and despair. We have to be the stable lighthouses for the people around us caught in the storm. 

It's easy to feel overwhelmed and helpless. What can I, a measly single person, do to make things better? 

ONE single act of kindness and compassion is enough to change EVERYTHING! When you do something to make someone's day a little better, you improve the odds of them behaving in a more positive way to others around them. And the others around them do the same again, you see where its going? Your single action improves the countless lives around you! A simple smile, a moment of active listening with the intent to understand, that's all it takes. Best of all, it's free! Free! 

Similarly when you are overwhelmed with rage and anger, you turn your beautiful compassion into this web of negativity that sticks on to people around you, people that you love. (just by being mindful of that, when someone is horrid to you, know that you can end this cycle right there) 

We don't need to see a damsel in distress before jumping in with our glistening white armor. We can start small, even on Reddit itself. After reading an article or comment and before hitting the reply button, take a mindful moment or two. Recognize that what you think, will translate to what you say and do, and how it will impact those who will be reading your comments. 

Hope this bout of nagging brings you a small moment of peace and joy, wishing you a great weekend ahead :)

We end up feeling like we have no right to speak up or be heard cuz we have food to eat, school to go to, a roof over our heads. You can still have unmet needs despite all these. \n\nI go into this cautiously though, cuz I’m sure this topic can be quite divisive. You can have a car, live in a condo, be married to a spouse that has XYZ great qualities, yet be struggling or feeling alone and depressed. You’ve no one to speak to, because everyone else would say you’re ungrateful and have first world problems. You can have (insert whatever society or people say are valuable), but still feel there’s no meaning to life. For someone else, having ABCD things in life would make them feel fulfilled. But you need EFGH, and these unmet needs will be a hole inside of you despite having ABCD outwardly. My point is, whoever you are, and whatever you’re going through, your feelings are valid and you shouldn’t be ashamed of the things people say you should be grateful for. For those of you who read that and felt “well shit, that’s true, I’m an ungrateful person who has a roof over my head and who won the country lottery by being born in Singapore yet I’m still whining and feeling miserable, I must be unappreciative”, and this leads to you feeling worse, don’t worry.

Every now and then, ask yourself "" where am I, what am I doing, what makes this moment possible"". For example I\'m at McDonald\'s, having dinner. The server had to take my order, cook my food. The farmer raised the cow for my beef, the cow ate the corn that was grown by another farmer. Logistics ppl flew everything to me. My mom and dad had to raise me so on and so forth.

 i also miraculously advanced last year with a grade of UUC/B and B for GP, not doing that well for my cca due to procrastinating and giving excuses the whole year and i am considering to retain this year especially due to my lazy ass wasting the holidays even though i promised myself to use it fruitfully. I know some of you will reprimand me for not using it wisely, but idk if its an internal conflict but the more i hope to do my work the more i will give excuses to not do it. (yeah im a lazy and last minute person i admit it )

anyway can anyone tell me how to curb phone addiction in general (like 17 hrs a day that kind) and achieve better sleep schedule, should i go for an addiction therapy or something? im feeling abit lost lol feels like im take drug  :( 

oh yeah i feel abit self conscious retaining too (like i feel abit uncomfortable with the special treatement for retainee) and considering the opportunity cost (if i were to earn 2000 a month in the future thats 24k at least ) its alot but then i could also retire one yr later so...idk

can anyone give advice to this lost soul (thank u so much)

Note: feel free to scold me to wake me up i think that help considering that in the past it aggravates me when people judged me and make me work hard lol idk if it will work now though

You can try adding bits of time hand writing notes(not reading cuz you'll prolly just forget when you go back to game) and condition yourself to only go back to gaming once you've done atleast part of the notes for a given chapter i.e Functions: part1) inverse functions part2) composite functions part3) piecewise functions. This worked pretty well for me, though I was still gaming like 6months before As I had converted about half my gaming time to writing notes/doing papers, Ik I prolly gonna sound like a huge nerd but completing papers was kinda satisfying(even if I didn't do well). The point is to start somewhere, once you build up some momentum it'll become  more natural, just like how you find gaming to be second nature hopefully you'll be able to convert some time into studies.

People assume it is due to physical reactions by the body but a healthy person does not easily get addicted to substances typically addiction problems, e.g. post-operation patients. So what does this mean? Addiction may be largely mental than physical. \n\nOP, I think it\'s good you\'re aware of your issues when it comes to gaming and phone addiction. But perhaps you\'re treating it as a surface level as just ""I like to play games"". I think, generally speaking, nobody simply just likes to play games for so many hours on end everyday even when they\'re probably not enjoying it (unless to pass time). \n\nI recommend you try and understand what you\'re escaping from first hand. Perhaps its anxiety, stress from school, or anything that might be uncomfortable and you using digital tools as an escape. Addiction therapy is also a good direction, they\'re trained to help you understand yourself better on what makes you compulsively seek these outlets. They can then help guide you to healthier coping mechanisms.', ""I think you shouldn't have such a big jump. Try reducing your gaming half an hour every day and time it.

( don’t cheat urself by using the computer instead ofc) u can also get some third party app to lock that game. I sincerely wish u all the best!', 'imo if you can manage your time wisely you dont need to retain, but you need to find something that keeps you on the grind. ill recount my own experience\n\ni used to be very addicted to gaming (like 6-7 hours a day of osu/fortnite/minecraft pvp LOOOOOOL i know dont judge plS aft school, sleep at abt 2-3am) and pon sch alot\nthen weekends if no cca or anyth i jus spam all the way\nthen go school toh in study room with my extremely comfortable wooly sweater\n\nuh honestly for me it wasnt really so much a specific moment that i decided to cut down or self manage better (no sudden epiphany here)\n\ni was decent at physics and math so i took h3 phy in j2, which really motivated me to work harder overall\n\nso i think i started my grind around june hols, where i started off studying 3-4 hrs a day (extremely focused k not that bullshit whr ppl keep playing brawl stars on their phone), and gradually increased to 5-6 hrs towards the end of june hols. notice actl even if u study 6 hrs a day u actl still have like 7 hrs to do random shit. (assuming u take 11 hrs for sleep and eat etc)\nso i would game or chill wit friends then\n\nduring sch time i would study in sch aft class wit mt friends until nighttime then we get dinner and complain abt our lives (first world problem)\n\ni kept this up until prelims, by then i was quite sien and i was pretty much done with everything other than econ so aft that i jus mug only econ. during a levels itself i didnt study too much becos i think its better to jus chill aft exam.\n\nat the end i got 90 + h3 dist so im quite grateful to myself for not starting too late and being very focused when studying\n\na part of me wonders if i dropped out of school and grinded fortnite would i be the world cup champion instead of bugha\n\nbut we make choices and we will never know the other path, so i jus carry on with life\n\nbut back to you, i think you should form a vision of where you want to be in 5-10 years. ultimately it makes no sense to put effort into anything unless there is an outcome you envisioned for yourself ( in my case it was that i wanted to be a physicist and thats not happening unless i get a scholarship because no money )\ni think you would feel much more compelled to work when you have something at stake\n\nalso you need to find a place where you define as your work space, and one where you define as your rest space. compartmentalise these different spaces so that your mind doesnt mix them up. for me i absolutely could not study at home because of the computer whispering sweet nothings into my ear. so i went to library or mcdonalds to mug. when i went home i gamed my heart out. \n\nset clear goals of what u want to accomplish in a day/week/month. set deadlines for yourself. it doesnt need to be on paper, i just had a mental timeline of when i needed to be at what stage of my revision.\n\ni took my a levels in 2018, and ive been an nsf tutoring a level students for the past 2 years. ive tutored the brightest gep rj kids to average kids and ive concluded that the A Levels is a very structured syllabus and its unlikely youll get below 75rp unless you are not putting in a solid effort consistently. the skill cap of a levels is honestly not that high and if you have done your due diligence you should get a minimum of a B.\n\nif you have any qns u can dm me', 'You sound like me when I was in Jc 2-3 years ago, I couldn’t have survived on such little sleep like you, I slept more but I was a chronic procrastinator too, and in an unhealthy, crippling and self-sabotaging way. But I’m really feeling :/// reading your posts and I’m very scared for you , i don’t want u to end up fucking up the big thing like me. \n\nI first started procrastinating at the start of j1 because I was a perfectionist ( unironically enough) and I was a “all or nothing” type of person, so i didn’t try at my homework at all because I was afraid and resistant to the feeling of failure and having to face inevitable obstacles along the way. So to avoid that feeling, I didn’t try at my homework at all throughout the year+. I procrastinated by playing games as a way of escapism from my anxiety from not doing my homework and knowingly fucking up my academic journey, which just builds up as the years went by in Jc for me. My procrastination was beyond the point of the average student claiming “oh I procrastinate coz I watch kdrama”, it was a whole other level, kinda like Hamlet in Shakespeare’s text ( my h2 lit text). When I was playing games, I knew I should stop and start studying but I just couldn’t help myself.  My procrastination stemmed more from issues dealing with FEELINGS and personal emotional landscape mismanagement , rather than with time. At that time I didn’t have the maturity to face up to this real reason of my procrastination and just kept escaping through games. It was my coping mechanism to deal with the snowballing work, anxiety and stress. At that time I already knew what I was doing was toxic, but I just couldn’t help it. I was living in a self imposed prison, in which the ceiling just kept getting lower, the walls kept getting narrower and when I tried to get out, life would try to kill me. \n\nEveryone just thought I was stupid, lazy, too stoned in classes( I daydream in class a lot and never do homework), but I’ve always felt very misunderstood by others. I knew I could have done  well if only I had applied myself and worked consistently like a normal student. And ya, it is very annoying to know that others are judging you ( inaccurately especially), back then I’d be Super annoyed when people were treating me as if as I have a 2 digit IQ. \n\nSo you need to ask yourself, what’s the real reason why you’re procrastinating? And yes, i personally think you should consider therapy. I was too egoistic and childish back then and stubbornly refused to go in the past, in hindsight, I really wish I had gone for it. \n\nBecause your rather severe procrastination could be a symptom of a much larger and deeply rooted problem.  And if you don’t properly address this and tackle it, repeating also won’t help much, even if you do pass and scrape through with bare minimum grades throughout , you wouldn’t be able to achieve your fullest potential. \n\nLast minute chiong/临时抱佛脚 worked for me for O levels but in A levels didnt( start rushing only less than a month before final exam) even if you get past A levels scraping through , mediocre A level grades will give you a very very very very very hard time applying for unis and not worth the heightened mental torture before As. And if you fail As( not to scare you it is a very big possibility if u don’t change, and you have to face up to this), I can tell you when u stare at your results slip in the school hall and see that you’ve failed, it will be the worst feeling ever. Your heart will sink and a painful wave of emptiness will engulf your mind, and you will wish so damn hard that you had studied harder and wonder what could have been if only you had retained in j1. You will feel even worse when u see your heartbroken parents and in contrast ... many other people rejoicing because they’ve gotten near 90 rank points. \n\nI’m not saying there is no path to walk after one fails A levels, you will eventually figure sth out, but on that day when u take back yr results, your internal world will come crashing down and your heart will feel like there’s a corpse rotting in it, so don’t put yourself through that.\n\nSo it is definitely better to give yourself another chance to start afresh and repeat J1 provided you address your procrastination issues and improve on it, instead of fucking up A levels if you move on to j2 ( high chances of this happening). Ofc theoretically, it is possible to Chiong and pull your grades up if you address the problems now and continue with j2, but it’ll be a mad rush and u may not achieve your fullest potential, because it’ll take a lot of self-discipline and realistically it is hard to change your gaming addiction thing within such a short time. So for now, repeating as a j1 is the seemingly harder but better choice in the long run tbh. Repeating as a j1 also gives you time to slowly adjust your gaming hours . \n\nOne extra year in the grand scheme of life doesn’t matter at all, so don’t worry about that. I’m in Uni now and really, no one gives a fuck abt your age. You think one year is a lot ? Nah, there are even people who will be 5-6 or more years older than u too, it really doesn’t matter. \n\nI got SUD/S and C for gp I think for j1 promos and got advanced to j2. I will pm you the rest of my story. \n\nBut please please please help yourself before it is too late !!! Learn to be in control of yourself.

The reason I believe this is because I had zero issues coping during BMT and had no withdrawal issues whatsoever since every day was packed with activities. After some reflection, I realised that I gamed every day primarily because I felt bored and couldn't be arsed to do my homework. I felt like I could understand concepts in lectures and tutorials but couldn't remember them or reapply them accurately for exams (and therefore scoring rather poorly while having a misguided belief that I should do well with a bit more effort).\n\nI started searching for a solution to this problem after feeling a mixture of panic (somewhat like your current feelings) and a sense of urgency as the As drew closer (sometime in May). My solution was rather simple --- set targets for yourself (which concepts to cover) and set a deadline for that, and to also minimise the temptation to game.\n\nThe first part of the solution is rather self explanatory. You can choose to start revising lecture notes and redoing tutorial questions, and then start to spam the TYS during the June holidays. The second part was to revise in school or in a public library. Even though I brought my laptop along, I found myself to be much more productive in an environment that was dedicated to and more conducive for studying. (I strongly advise against using your phone to aid you in your revision because the temptation to just pull out your phone and game in a library is much greater than switching on your laptop and playing DOTA or something in the same setting. If possible do not use your phone when revising if you mostly play mobile games. My solution may work for PC gamers but I'm not sure for phone gamers.)\n\nI continued to game to relieve some stress even during the exam period but only after I was sure I understood the concepts tested and finished my scheduled revision. Overall I didn't feel as if I cut down on gaming that much but there was an actual reduction once I started counting the hours. I don't really recommend doing this unless you are very confident in your understanding and are starting to do well for your mock papers. There is always a chance you might relapse or even give up on revising completely.\n\nOverall I think its good that you are starting to think about your situation and start planning. It is far from too late to start revising now if you plan your schedule properly and adhere to it. I was still able to get a decent result (though I was personally slightly disappointed and felt I could have done better if I started revision earlier). Do some deep reflection (BE HONEST WITH YOURSELF & DO NOT BE OVERLY OPTIMISTIC) and try to find the root cause of your studying woes.

You may try practicing delayed gratification. If you are using an iPhone, let a parent/sibling set screen time password on your device. You can also look for blocksite applications to lock certain apps and websites. Set aside time to study in a quiet room with minimum distractions. While doing that, leave all your devices outside; heck lock them up in a safe if you need to. After finishing up your tasks, feel free to indulge yourself a little.

During the time before I was slowly limiting myself to an hour 30mins of game instead of 4hours. (Not including my social media app time) this gradually forced me (not successfullly everyday) to stop the games and do some studying. Another thing that really helped is the wifi restriction that my parents put on me. And having little data per month I had to go around that restriction and plan my time wisely everyday. \n\nHowever all this is my personal experience and I don't know if u can even do what I did.

But I honestly feel trapped....

You see, I was raised in a lower income family (but it didn't used to be that way). Before I was born, my dad made $5-6k/month back in 1980s which was considered a lot and my mom was making decent as well. They both only have secondary school qualifications. I have 2 older brothers and I'm the youngest. My family lived in a maisonnette but shortly after I was born in 90s, my dad declared bankruptcy and had to mortgage the house and downgrade to a 5room flat (with outstanding housing loan to pay as well). My dad was gambling a lot and generating credit card debts. My mom would shop to de-stress and ended up with credit card debts as well. With financial problems comes frequent arguments in the house. 

Growing up, I never really saw my parents. My dad was always out and my mom was out working 3 jobs. Still, we had days where there were no electricity and water for days. It happened quite frequently when I was in primary school....

When I got to secondary level, I mixed with the wrong company. I was never at home cause I didn't want to (my house was a mess and I didn't wanna be around the constant drama). My first bro is 12 years older than me and he got diagnosed with schizophrenia and was hospitalised at IMH before. He has been paranoid and kept accusing us as spy from the govt. He would beat people up and he would say things that don't make sense but annoys you. As for my 2nd bro, he's into gambling online. He started since he was in sec school and he bet on soccer online. Obviously, he asked for money from my mom to gamble.... Both of my bros are drop outs from poly. They spent all my parents' CPF on their unfinished education. 

I was also working part time jobs earning from $5-8/hr on weekends and holidays when I was just sec 2. Eventually I got to a point in my life where I figured I needed to study hard so I could make money and get myself out of the situation.. so by sec 3, I turned around and concentrated on studies. I managed to do alright on my O levels and ended up in a science course at a polytechnic. I bought my first laptop with my own hard earned money. I studied hard while still working part time and was aiming to get myself accepted into a local university and I did. But the next thing was, how am I gonna pay for it? 

The best thing that happened was I applied for a scholarship and I actually got it. I never thought I would make the cut but I glad I got the chance to go for the interview and was actually offered. I traveled overseas for school and I couldn't be happier for the next 3.5years of my life. I was away from the drama and I had the freedom to do what I want to do.

Now that I'm back, I'm serving the bond. It just feel like I'm trapped all over again. I just finished paying a $1.3k/month housing loan for my parents 5rm HDB for 2 years. My dad passed away from bile duct cancer just a year after I got back. I had to arrange the entire funeral by myself , my 1st bro didn't even attend the funeral at all. My 2nd bro is arrested and jailed for online scams. Idk what to say.... I can't move out because my mom is old and she needs someone but at the same time it's toxic living with them. I don't wanna move out cause I wanna save money for my own future too. I am just not happy living. It's just a cycle I can't get out of. 

If you made it this far, hopefully I made you feel a bit better about your own situation....

Disclaimer: idk why so many people assume I'm a guy, but I'm actually a girl.

Update (09/10): Just want to say, I'm overwhelmed by the number of people who responded to my life story with so much encouragement and positivity. 

Trust me, there are days where I felt alone and that no one could ever understand how I feel and I never understood why it is happening to me. It's not like I could just tell my friends about it without knowing whether they'll be judgemental or not.. I did share with my closest friends but sometimes I just feel that I'm bringing my own negativity into their lives. So I just kept it to myself.. besides there's nothing much they could do to help me. 

But being on here, posting to a community of people who actually offered so much support through your kind words, I can't express how deeply grateful I am. 

From my heart, thank you <3",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/j61wvu/not_your_typical_singaporean_family/,"[""No, this is not for us to feel better.

I am the middle child.\n\nWhen my siblings and I were still studying (secondary sch), my dad was an avid gambler. One day, loan sharks came to my house and spoke to me and my little sister during broad daylight. They were very fierce and constantly banged on the door. Obviously we were frightened and quickly called our parents for help. At night when my parents got homed, they quarreled and my mom literally chased after my dad with a kitchen knife. I swear to God. She wanted to kill him because he is ruining our lives. My dad held her and later on went on his knees begging my mom to stop, promising us that he would change.   \n\nHowever, this change that he promised did not fully stop him from gambling. The only thing change that he did was reducing the amount of stake. And because of the debt, my siblings and I have to start working after school and during the public holiday to earn our own allowance. We have worked as a packer in NTUC, to frying fries at Macdonald's along with several other event jobs too. I almost dropped out from poly because I made so much money (or i thought was so much money) selling the first batch of iPad at expo, rofl.  \n\nFast forward to today, both my sisters have already graduated from local university and are both working in corporate while I am happily working in my career of 3 years. Sometimes when we talk about our lives as a student, we can't help but wonder how did we pull it through. My mom sometimes tears up when she felt that she failed as a mother because she could not afford education for us and have to see us juggle between work and study. However, we honestly don't feel that way. Life just happens. And all that experiences made us who we are today. As for my dad, he completely stopped gambling because the 3 of us are old enough to literally told him off and would not hesitate to stop giving him allowance (he's retired with no money. Yup.)  \n\nAt the end of the day, there are always people in the world having a much difficult situation than us. Some don't even have the privilege to attend tertiary education. Think about it: You have a fully-paid 5 room flat to live in and right now you can really focus on saving for your future. No matter how bad/stagnant/trapped you feel, your second phase of life is only just getting started. So embrace it! Earn and save lots of money but don't forget that life is not just about money! Sometimes it's good to just spend a little bit of $ buying that expensive ice cream, that short getaway with your bf/mom, or that pair of cool sneakers to bring you to more places. Life is full of discovery. I wish you happiness and best of luck."", 'Possible to ask ur mom downgrade the house so that it would be easier to maintain?\n\nU have to plan long term and be hard hearted when needed if u rly want things to go ur way.', ""Reading your story, the first thing that came to mind was that you've come so far despite the odds: You have a university degree, you have a job, and you've finished paying a home loan.

When I learned about this news yesterday, I was shocked and disgusted. Then, I felt bad. Because Dee Kosh had harassed me too a few years ago. And when I had the means and ability to act against him, I chose to walk away and not engage. Predators are emboldened when victims don't stand up to them. I felt bad because I couldn't help wonder that if I had stood up to this disgusting person then, would he have thought twice about victimising other people?

My brush with this disgusting person (who is so repugnant to me I can't bring myself to type his name again) first came in 2018. He harassed me and an author published by my company. TO BE CLEAR, what he did to us is NOT THE SAME as what he is accused of doing to those boys. Whether the accusations are true, only time will tell. All I can say now is that there is a clear pattern of his predatory behaviour towards young girls and boys.

I had actually never heard of him before (I'm old and don't follow social media influencers) and only came to know about him when he started harassing Nicole Choo, who was published by my company, Bubbly Books. The whole horrible saga started with him posting a YouTube video reading out her work and mocking her looks, her work, degrading her as a person. Nicole was only 19 then. He was 30. To this day, I don't know why he, together with another grown man called Hirzi, would dress up as women and mock a teenage girl, using sexual slurs, just for having the audacity to launch a book.

Their video was released shortly after Nicole announced that her book, Nineteen, had hit the Straits Times Bestselling List. I can only guess that they were triggered by the fact that Nicole had achieved some level of success which they felt was not deserved. I mean, how dare a pretty instagrammer be a writer too? (Actually, I later learned that he had been obsessively mocking her since she was 15.)

The verbal abuse and sexist nature of their comments - and they way they incited hatred towards her - was truly horrible and I felt so bad for Nicole. Because I was the one who had encouraged Nicole to publish her book of poems. It felt like I was the one who was responsible for getting her into this situation.

As a mother, I felt like I had failed her and failed my own daughter, Gabby. I got to know Nicole because she was Gabby’s classmate. When they were young, I used to take them to watch movies, to the beach, and because the two of them love to read, to bookstores and to events like the Harry Potter exhibition at the Art Science Museum. She was my daughter’s friend, and it was my fault she was being attacked.

At that time, that disgusting person who shall not be named, was a very influential celebrity and DJ for Power 98. So what he said, had weight. When he led the charge to cancel Nicole and dismiss her as unworthy of a book deal, everyone jumped on the bandwagon. It was my first foray into the horrors of cancel culture. I read with increasing dismay at all the verbal abuse and sexually-explicit attacks aimed at Nicole. 

Many of them amounted to violent threats - ""kill that slut"", many commented. All the while this was happening, this disgusting person cheered them on and gloated. Every attack that was aimed at Nicole, felt like they were aimed at me too. I was so distressed. Doubly distressed for Nicole who just endured the attacks. I don't think I would ever have the strength and mental resilience she has. She quietly left Singapore because it came to a point where she was physically afraid. The threats did not stop. So, she went overseas for a few months to stay with a friend. 

I am so sorry, Nicole. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that by encouraging you to write a book, that this would happen. For those wondering why I wanted to publish Nicole, it is because she is smart, strong, opinionated, articulate, hardworking and most importantly, has an interesting point of view. She is a good writer.

Unused to the ugliness of social media, I asked Nicole if she wanted me to file a police report. She said no. But the attacks were so horrible. I transcribed the video and picked out the defamatory parts. Apart from degrading Nicole in sexual terms, many parts of their video were extremely racist against Malays and Indians. Unused to this level of vitriol, I was outraged. I compiled an entire folder of evidence, ready to file a police report if Nicole gave the word. I consulted a few laywers too. One of them, a copyright lawyer, pointed out to me that they had infringed on our copyright by broadcasting her pages and reading them.

Okay, great. So there is something I could do! I reported the copyright infringement to YouTube and the video - thankfully - got removed. 

Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of the story. Disgusting person and Hirzi launched a new video. A fake apology that was not remorseful or apologetic, featuring the two of them again dressed as women and inciting hatred towards Nicole, and now, my company Bubbly Books. On Twitter, disgusting person posted my company profile and encouraged people to come get me. 

Later on that year, sore that I had gotten his YouTube video removed (he didn’t get to keep the profits from the video either), he posted a top 10 idiots of the year video, naming me directly and broadcasting my name, my personal bio, my company details and my personal email (only partially blocked out). He told viewers to ""Go Google her"" - encouraging them to find me and harass me.

Could I have filed a police report for harassment and doxxing then? Yes, I could have. Thinking back, I should have. But I didn't. And that - together with all the other times when victims didn't speak out – surely emboldened him to bully even more. 

My laywer friends told me that I should 1. make a police report 2. sue for defamation 3. sue for damages for losses 4. sue for statutory damages. 5. issue cease and desist to prevent him from further harassing us. By this time, because of the attacks he led, Nicole's book went from being a bestselling title, to not selling at all. I compiled my losses - amounting to $40,000 in lost sales - ready to pass on to the lawyers. 

Damages and statutory damages could have amounted to quite a large sum. But right at the last minute, I decided not to go ahead. Why? Because I did not want to ruin him, heinous as he was. Also because I hate confrontation. I hated the idea of engaging with someone like him. So I thought about it. I thought about it some more. Then I dragged the decision so long that my anger got tucked away, forgotten. I never did anything further.

I forgot all about him until I saw yesterday's news. Then my disgust for him came rushing back. Then, my sympathy for all the young men he allegedly propositioned, coerced and sexually victimised. And I couldn't help wonder - if I had stood up to him back then, would it have done anything? If I had filed a police report, would it have at least prevented him from being so brazen in approaching young men? I will never know. 

I feel angry that he (allegedly) victimised so many. When a person is a celebrity, he is in a position to coerce sexual favours and make disgusting demands. Because victims are overwhelmed by his fame, or attracted to the idea of working in this company, they give in. This is no better than what Harvey Weinstein did. Sexual predators all use the same tactics.

To any one who has been a victim: Don't blame yourself for what happened. It is not your fault. Tell yourself that over and over again. It is not your fault. You were manipulated. Do not be afraid. You are not powerless. File a police report. Tell your friends – they will support you.",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/ic2gn6/an_unsavoury_allegation_of_another_nature_against/,"['[deleted]', ""influencers like him and XX calling what they face cancel culture when they have used their platform & followers to cancel so many people is ridiculous to me. it's not cancel culture just because they're just facing the consequences of their own actions. what they did to others like this publisher is the real cancel culture that people are always talking about and trying to stop.\n\nstop defending influencers using cancel culture because truly what they face is just their own consequences. it's cases like this where truly cancel culture (by the influencers) is at work."", 'Honestly, Nicole Choo’s writing is total shit but that doesn’t excuse the way DK behaved at all.\n\nHis entire career has flourished purely on him putting people down and making it sound “funny”.\n\nMay Karma hit hard, and the Law hit harder (especially the rotan)', ""I've heard of DK in the past, but have never actually heard his content before (whether Youtube or radio).

Her controversial actions ( at that time) was the talk of “town” and the audacity to publish a pictorial + insta quotes and call that a book really pissed off many people, including me. \n\nMy opinion: it is ACCEPTABLE for the public to discuss/mock/praise any public figure and their actions (such as publishing a pictorial and call it a book) and personal life (already plastered all over internet at that time)\n\nHOWEVER It is NOT ACCEPTABLE to be racist, call for others to harass Nicole etc. \n\n2. That video, which was taken down, is not a video to merely discuss Nicole’s “book”.

And saw the errors of his ways? Are you naive?\n\nHe obviously saving his own skin now lmao. \n\nMy priorities not for you to judge. No thanks', 'You’re not a lawyer. You’re not a judge. You’re not legally trained. You’re some kid on reddit. You’re in no position to say if it’s illegal or not because this is a grey area. You’ll need to collate a lot of facts and figures and produce it to a judge in magistrate. Most of the time, the court won’t even take such petty matters Too seriously, let alone charge someone over some stupid online drama. If you consider that ‘slander’, then hundreds of thousands of videos can be considered that. So the late night show criticising  trump is slander? Comedy channels criticising other comedians is slander? You don’t know the law so stop making allegations unless you are law trained. Don’t speak on legal matters kid.', 'Bruh, there\'s no evidence or reason to think that it\'s the ""most or only issue"" that matter, just because someone doesn\'t copy/paste another line of ""btw DK SUX"" after making a comment on the book quality. Does not writing a line on it suddenly make them DK sympathizers? Maybe it\'s instead because we already all know he\'s trash? Honestly, I think at least one thought-out comment did address both issues but you were similarly aggressive anyway and acting like they supported DK.\n\nI believe you that you\'re not personally involved. I take that back. I know hot buttons can cloud a person\'s judgement and stuff but you probably should take a step back and not immediately villain-fy anyone who does not respond exactly as you think is appropriate. You accused a lot of people, whether they wrote paragraphs or one liners, as long as they mentioned the book wasn\'t good.', 'Somehow I suspect the subject matter (Dee Kosh) attracts the unsavoury segment of r/singapore .\n\nPersonally I have avoided reading anything with ""Dee Kosh"" in the title because it\'s just the same old bullsh\\*t of some famous idiot doing idiotic things.\n\nBut your post here seems interesting and of higher quality than the other mind-numbing ""Dee Kosh is bad"" posts.', ""Don't get so worked up over reddit dude"", 'Thank you for understanding my point.\n\nI see some faith in humanity.', ""Yes PR - but the agenda behind of the PR?\n\nTo entice more business isnt it?

Overseas Youtubers has this bit to do videos that is positive for society as a whole and to do a few videos for good causes. And having uploading this videos for a good cause use their influencing privilege to influence the public to do good for the society as a whole.\n\nThis is the whole point I am trying to get a cross. I don't care whether they did charity work or community service behind the scene, my point is - have they used their privilege and influencing capablity to make the young followers to do good? Yes or no?\n\nAnd if you are genuinely trying to do good, why the fuck are you worried about people saying it is milking for views? They are online personalities and they are used to mean comments please.\n\nI don't comment on their videos lacking of standards often, infact, I often avoid these comments because it is redundant.

Double standards huh...', '2021?', 'That’s because I don’t like it when people detract from the issue at hand. I created this threat to discuss harassment and hypocrisy, as evidenced by my initial comment in the thread. You certainly have the right to post your own opinion (I’m not asking the mods to ban you lol), but I also have the right to respond if I think it is irrelevant and downplays the issue I’m trying to discuss. How am I censoring anyone or anything? People are free to read and make up their minds if they agree with what I’m saying or what other commenters are saying. The very fact you are defending another commenter and I’m responding to you shows how much I am open to discourse, isn’t it?\n\nAs for your thinly veiled insinuations about me? Pretty ironic considering the context of this case and the video.', 'Funny how the person involved in said video is already backing down and yet so many people are still showing up debating what is slander and what is not. You don’t need to be a lawyer to see what is wrong here. Period.

And also because this is a serious matter. If the post was about another ordinary girl going through harassment and slander of the same manner (see the top comment of this post), posting only about the book just seems oddly misplaced, doesn’t it? I would be questioning that too.\n\nI don’t fault you for questioning my motives at all other than finding it ironic. It’s fair game to question my motives, just like how it’s also fair game for me to question the motives of anyone who comes on here to just talk about the book. Harassment of this nature should not be trivialised, whether intentional or not. There is of course a strong possibility that people here do not mean to trivialise matters, but I don’t want to take any chances, hence my stance. \n\nSorry if it offends you, or anyone else, but this issue strikes a personal chord in me so maybe that is why I’m more critical in my comments.', 'But they are not required to do any ""good"" by *law*.

As for the “facts” that you claim, the only facts I know are the ones from which I see from the video, which is as clear to anyone that they are obviously insults and defamation.\n\nIf people feel a need to talk SOLELY about things not related to the slander and harassment, I can only question their true motives. Just like how you question my motive, I can also question others, it’s fair game after all.', 'A quick check of my post and comment history will tell you the kind of person I am. \n\nI don’t take to deflections and detractions very kindly. This is just my personality, and if you want to fault me for that, go ahead.\n\nIt is my perception and opinion that talking solely about the book is equivalent to victim shaming. You’ll notice I didn’t exactly jump on people who gave a nuanced take about the whole matter, book or not.\n\nIt’s like if someone made a thread discussing a personal account of harassment and slander as a result of what she is wearing. And then the comments start mentioning “well it was certainly a poor choice of clothing” or “let’s not pretend she is that innocent”. How should we feel about these kinds of comments?\n\nAs someone with a personal experience of a family member being harassed, I absolutely abhor any comments that might suggest that a victim of such harassment is at fault in any manner, whether intention or not. \n\nI’ll leave what I have to say about the matter at that.', 'Well you need to refer to Hirzi’s post to get the context of what I’m saying in that it may be potentially incriminating legal wise.\n\nAfter being called out by the publisher (who hinted that further legal actions might be taken), Hirzi immediately dropped all the claims made in his video about Nicole and apologised, as well as asking all followers who had made similar remarks as he has to apologise and to bear responsibility of these claims as well. His only defence against what he said was that it was unscripted (a lack of premeditated intent), but not that it was true in any manner. \n\nOne can easily infer if this is just a matter of what is wrong or what is criminally breaking the law from his statements. Is what he said slander or untrue and will it be proven in court? I agree with you that we genuinely don’t know. But I think judging from how fast Hirzi is dropping the video and the claims made from it, is pretty damning as to the chance he would stand in court if indeed he was sued or had a police report made against him. This is enough info for me to believe that there is no basis for his comments, legally or otherwise, and why he may potentially be in trouble in the law should he choose to stick with his claims.', 'What are you even on about? I’ve already spent my whole morning arguing with other people who didn’t think what DK did in his video was wrong, legally or otherwise.

Don't take r/sg for brainless.\n\nWhat Dee Kosh did is deplorable and horrible - what you did however, also clearly ticked off some redditporeans.

The problem is they misrepresent and do not align with the comments here. You chose to craft clearly ill intented examples, when the context here is that a publisher is painting an (possibly) untrue picture of a talented writer, and some people are just pointing out ""hey I agree with everything they said, but she\'s not talented, thought you should know that."" but you get equally agitated.', 'I think you misunderstood because this is not a post from me or from my personal Facebook account.

What you're doing now is being highly polarising and forcing others to take your view that we should be ignoring everything else except that DK is trash (which everyone knows he is rn). You're trying to show another bad side of DK, but by further pushing the point that shes a wonderful girl/author/strong lady or w/e tf u wrote, basic social study lessons would already show you have a vested interest or at least,side very strongly with nicole. people will take what you say with apprehension."", '>“Hey I agree with what you said, but she’s not that talented, thought you should know that” is a whitewash of what some people are trying to say here.

I’m not asking anyone to take any sides, I’m just asking people not to talk about the irrelevant stuff when something serious is being discussed. Would you talk about something unrelated in a thread discussing sexual harassment, for example?', 'I think our different perception on intent is vastly different because of how we view the entire situation.

I hope you see where I am coming from.', 'And they shouldn’t get called out?

If we were to look at it objectively and ignore the “influencer label”, would people still be digressing about the book in a thread discussing harassment? I can only ponder.', ""Why should they get called out? Even if they should, that's an impossible endeavour. So why bother?\n\n>Digression is one thing.

129,W_2001,kjg6pm,[O levels] Before and during receiving O level slip advice,2020-12-24 22:21:00,SGExams,77662,17,347,"I know that O level result release is 11 Jan-13 Jan approx but I felt like wanting to say this because some people are so nervous about O level results. So hi. And disclaimer, I feel like this might not be complete, especially this was from what I know SO FAR.

* Before taking the O level results,

Look up on your desired courses. Find out more abiut them. Do considered the other choices too like JC, MI, Poly and other forms of institution, especially in the case of ""if you cannot get your desired course of study"". Do also try to look up on which UNI course for those planning on univserity studies as : 

1. Some uni courses allow all diplomas but it can be HARDER for certain diplomas depending on the ""eligibility""(I put in quotes). 

E.g.(DISCLAIMER: might not be a good e.g. because I am not from poly so for those poly students, PLS CORRECT ME) Let's say I take Nanotechnology and Material Sci from NYP NMS with reference to http://nus.edu.sg/oam/apply-to-nus/polytechnic-diploma-from-singapore/subject-pre-requisites/for-nanyang-polytechnic-diploma-holders and http://nus.edu.sg/oam/undergraduate-programmes/indicative-grade-profile-(igp) . 

Can he take NUS business administration or law? High chance (if he scores 3.73 for Business admin and 3.86 for Law and Business and Law is under ""All diplomas"" category, meaning all diplomas can enter.) 

Can he take Electrical Eng? High chance (if he scored 3.68 and according to the NMS category, electrical eng will most likely accept the diploma.)

Can he take NUS Medicine or Food Science as a degree? Low chances (even if he scored 4.0 for his gpa, it is not a diploma in either ""All diplomas"" or ""NMS"" category. Even till today I dont even know whether the Aptitude Based Admission will work cus I mostly heard it is for those who scored a little bit below the 10th percentile so far. Poly students pls correct me thanks.)

For diploma to NTU courses: https://wis.ntu.edu.sg/webexe/owa/adm_appl.relevant_diploma

2. This is the same for the JC students as well. Although yes, art combi can give you a myriad of options like Business, Real Estate Humanities, NTU Sport Science and Law, an art combi may not be possible for Science, Medicine or Engineering(well depends). (Disclaimer: I am not saying art combi is horrible. Pls dont kill me) But if plan on taking a humans subject at H2, do consider Hybrid combi as well. And for those interested in business,finance,economics and accountancy, MI is a possible option even though it takes 3 years for A level degree, they are the only ones offering H2 POA and H2 Management of Business. And for those who are not aware yet, Medicine accept students with H2 Chem and H2 Phy/H2 Bio aka PC×× or BC××.

Do also consider other options if you cannot meet the desired course. E.g. Let's say you want to go to NP's Film, Sound & Video diploma with ELR2B2-D which is 8 rank points. In the case you overshot, maybe you can look at other diplomas(e.g. Infocomm and Media Eng from NYP ELR2B2-C of 24 rank points, Media Production and Design diploma or Art and Theatre Management diploma from RP of ELR2B2-A of 20 rank points or even Broadcast and Media Technology from ITE Central of ELR2B2-C of 34(aka if legit your ELR2B2 exceeds 28 pts with reference to JAE booklet not ITE intake booklet)) or JC if possible e.g. YIJC-19/20 , TMJC-13 (P.S. TMJC has H2 Theatre Studies and Drama) and MI. Do consider art institutions like NAFA and LaSalle.

And for JC students, please for the love of god choose your subjects wisely. Some subjects cannot be put tgt in certain or all JCs. Trust me when I say this because they think just because YIJC does not offer something, means all JCs don't offer. E.g. Just because YIJC does not offer a subject combi H2 FM, Computing and H2 Math tgt does NOT mean ALL JCs dont offer.(Look at JPJC). So do look out for other JCs and esp they range of subjects. Even if the JC offers this subject, pls dont choose it because its popular or is more useful ""in general but not you"" E.g. People chose PCMe even though they would rather do business/arts and not the STEM sector (Not saying it is not possible but trust me when I say H2 Chem is hard, esp organic chem well unless you are hinting at NTU Eng and Business double major).

And lastly, if you legit don't know what to do till now but feel like JC sucks and should rot in hell, some poly offer ""Common XXXX programmes"" e.g. RP Common Science Programme, all Poly Common ICT/Engineering/Business Programme which allow you take common core subjects first and then in year 2, you can choose what diploma specialisation you want to take(though not all would offer all diploma specialisations.) 

Reason I say to plan is because you are given 12 options of school/course so choose wisely and find out what sparks your passion/career.

Oh and btw, you can still go to uni with a poly diploma and some degrees do allow all diplomas. Do take note of CCA options and distance to school too.

* When you take O level results,

1. Take note of Open houses in poly/JC. Plan out how to celebrate/destress after receiving results. Trust me, your friends are the best supporters and this is a once in a lifetime chance(maybe) to see them again. Go hang out w friends by going to lunch, playing sports, chilling out, etc.

2. Prepare a set of tissues. No really. Prepare them even at home or at school with Covid. I am not saying you should cry but tbh in all O level and A level experiences, there will always be joys and tears of sorrow. So do offer anyone a pat in the back, some tissues and encouragement to those who did not make it.

3. As nervous as you are, do listen out any ""before hand"" assemblies which talks about the JAE procedure. And do take note that yes, in your JAE booklet and you flip to the last few pages, you will see scholarships like ECDA, SG:D and HomeTeam scholarships for poly diploma. (This is for those complaining about poly school fees.) 

4. If need to, do find a career counsellor if you are still lost in finding a path you want to go to. Esp those who did not make it to the dream courses. And if still dont know, just go to open houses. 

5. If your grades are private to you, it is ok to not show them. Yes, even those which are damn good one. Trust me, if you are legit not comfortable to show them and they keep pestering you, give them a middle finger.

6. Before leaving the house, be mentally prepared and make a plan B of school choices. For those who did not make it, use plan B. If plan B fails, continue searching, especially ITE diplomas, private diplomas or retaking O levels. For those who suffer from stress or mental illnesses, go and see a psychiatrist and/or call any hotlines for mental health. For those whose parents will get mad and angry and do stuff, I cannot help you but do consider your friends. Go and sleepover with them if need to and seek for help. I cant advise on this one but figure out your next plan of action.

* After receiving O level results 

1. ""Idk what CCA to choose""

There are CCA fairs and school websites do talk about ccas. And also do talk to your seniors/OGLs(Orientation grp leaders) for cca/academic advice on some ccas for more info.

2. ""I feel like I cannot make friends.""

Well honestly, it depends but the chances of you having friends will be higher if you try talking to them and hanging out with them. Do try and make peers with positive peer influence and if your attitude needs to be changed(e.g. throwing insults or being too extrovertedly scary/overwhelming), do change it accordingly. And even if you cannot make friends, friends arent really a priority conpared to academics but do make friends for the right reasons such as having someone to talk to and make life easier.

3. ""I am from JC and I want to drop to poly and vice versa""

Ok this one I legit dont know but maybe moe hotline centre can help. Someone pls do advice about this in the comments.

4. ""I regret this course. So hard....:(""

There are two options. Adjust your study schedule accordingly or drop to another course. I would not recommend dropping out but rather adjusting your study methods and holding on to the stress. As much as mental health is important, pls dont give up, especially if you are interested in this sector. For poly students, do drop out of cca if need to and for jc students, try to limit yourself to 1 CCA unless you can handle more. Eat healthily and don't sleep late. And for my JC students, do start revising early, eventually it will take shape.

Anyways, I hope this is helpful and for any mistakes, pls comment down. And I wish you best of luck for O levels and your future.

132,chaotarroo,hmn6qy,PAP's greatest fear and why you should vote for opposition(even if the ones in your area are hopeless),2020-07-07 11:50:33,singapore,378641,466,2138,"I was planning to keep mum during this election period but the amount of shit show that transpired over the past 2 weeks had made it really difficult. I feel that the majority of Singaporeans don’t understand how the PAP thinks and operates. They are completely missing the big picture of why you should be voting against them if you want a better Singapore for Singaporeans.

Like a broken looping cassette, opposition parties have been using the soundbite of “checks and balances” as the primary reason for why should vote for them; to get them into parliament. They’re not wrong. Having opposition MPs ask hard questions in parliament is one of many ways to hold the PAP accountable for their decisions. But in my opinion, that isn’t very effective. After all, as long as the PAP has the supermajority in the parliament, they can still defer all opposition concerns and bulldoze any bills they want to or change the constitution as they wish. And let’s not kid ourselves, PAP will in all likelihood have an overwhelming majority in the parliament again. It is actually the side effect of voting for opposition that truly keeps the PAP in check, which is making them feel like they could lose support and power anytime.

Let me explain my rationale. 

The PAP has always been a center right pro capitalism party that frowns upon the notion of a welfare state. From early 2000s to 2011, Singapore was full on chasing for GDP growth. Property prices spiralling out of control, influx of foreign workforce was at its highest and PRs/Citizenships were being given out like freebies. But after Singaporeans expressed their unhappiness at the polls of GE2011, giving them only 60% of popular votes, things changed rapidly.

In the next 5 years, these policies were rolled out

- Property cooling measures were introduced less than half a year after GE 2011. This prevented investors from speculating the market, housing prices were immediately controlled at the expense of our GDP.
- Annual budget allocated for social transfers it's biggest jump from 2011 to 2015. For comparison, from 2008 to 2011, budget for social transfers to individuals increased about 45%(from 1.1 to 1.6billion). From 2011 to 2015, it increased by about 210%(1.6 to 3.3billion). In terms of progressive increment, that’s a 450% difference between these two periods.
- Pioneer generation package was launched in 2014, this eased up medical bills for the elderlies.
- Silver support scheme was announced in 2014 and eventually enacted in 2015. This is essentially a quarterly pension scheme for elderlies living in poverty, something which was frowned on by the PAP in the past.
- A sharp decline in foreign work force intake. It declined from 77k to 26k per annum between 2011-2015. Remember how we were constantly told to ‘bite the bullet’ for economic growth regarding foreigners in the late 2010s?
- Decline in total PRs granted. From 2008 to 2011 we granted an average of 50k PR year after year. From 2011 onwards, it's about 30k

During these 5 years, the PAP introduced more social policies aimed at helping Singaporeans than in any other period. I cannot help but to make a connection between PAP’s fear of losing power and the introduction of these policies to appease Singaporeans. 

Now, imagine a world where PAP had 80% of the mandate in GE2011. Meaning there're no feedbacks on the terrible job they're doing and no fear of losing power. Today, every other HDB resale transaction would be a million dollars, our population would be more than 6 million with 50% foreigners and even more elderlies would be on the streets scrapping for cardboards. These are all very real possibilities in that world.

It’s also interesting to see how GE2011 is the only time the government publicly admitted their mistakes and apologised for it. ""If we didn't get it right, I'm sorry. But we will try better the next time”, these words by LHL were printed in 4 languages across all forms of state media just 3 days before polling day in GE2011. Why did he say it? Because he genuinely felt so? Probably not. Those words were not said out of concern but out of fear. The fear of losing power. So if you want to see more instances of PAP eating their humble pie, vote for opposition. 

If you're keen on alleviating elderly poverty, improving social mobility, maintaining our current population size and having more policies aimed at helping average Singaporeans, voting for opposition parties is also a great way to do it. Opposition parties don’t even have to get into parliament for these things to happen. As long as the PAP is in constant fear of losing power, every decision they make in the next 5 years will be like walking on egg shells. That way, they'll automatically start caring more about the people. Conversely, if PAP is given too much power, they will start introducing policies that are hard to swallow and tell Singaporeans to ‘bite the bullet’ again.

Similarly, on the topic of power, ask yourself, why did the PAP call for an election during the COVID-19 pandemic when they know that campaigning will no doubt increase the likelihood of community spread? Is this the right thing to do for a government that cares about its people? Or was it a politically motivated move right after giving out 90 billion dollars in packages from our reserves and seeing it as an opportune moment to make use of the fear of COVID-19 to garner votes. Ask yourself, what made the government issue out 17 POFMA notices to political opponents in the past 5 days. Are all those notices truly in the interest of Singapore or was it just an election manoeuvre to discredit political opponents? Ask yourself, was the amendment of the constitution just before PE2017 a move to benefit Singapore, or was it just to elect someone within the party so they could entrench themselves with even more power? 

The PAP is a reasonably competent government and I dare say 70% of their members(definitely not all) wants the best for Singapore. Opposition is currently not ready to form the government and PAP should continue to be so. Having said that, after being in power for more than 50 years, it’s inevitable for them to lose focus and sway their interest from servicing Singaporeans to keeping their inner circle of friends and families(I don’t even want to go into how bad cronyism is in our GLCs and Stat boards) powerful in perpetuity. If you want them to keep their focus on the former and not the latter, it’s VERY important that we DO NOT give them the overwhelming mandate that they are looking for this coming Friday. If their popular vote exceeds 75% this GE, you’ll can surely expect more arrogance from them for the next 5 years.

Please vote wisely.

If you found this compelling, please considering sharing it with any of your friends and family that might be swing voters. The ground is very very very sweet for PAP now, I wouldn’t be surprised if they manage to secure all 93 seats with more than 75% of popular votes come Friday. Thank you for reading.

tl;dr: Want the government to be more accountable for their actions and decisions? Don’t give them the overwhelming mandate they are looking for. Make them fear that they could lose power anytime. That’s the only way to guarantee they will work harder and do better for Singapore and Singaporeans.

Edit 1. Please stop gilding me! Donate to your favourite opposition party instead if you want them to grow stronger the next GE!

I personally like WP. [Link to their donation page](https://www.wp.sg/donate/).

Edit 2. I may have been overly critical about PAP in my post. So here’s a more balanced view. I don’t think that the PAP did badly in the past 5 years. They did introduce some more left leaning policies during this period as well despite having 70% of the vote in 2015. On top of my mind

- Merdeka generation package
- Chas card
- Increase in compare assistance 
- Reform to education. No streaming, banded subjects(I love this!)

However these screw ups alone is enough to make me vote for opposition

- Failing to control COVID-19 and being completely unapologetic about it
- Calling for election when we're still in the midst of a pandemic before it's favours for them(this one super WTF)
- PE2017
- Abusing POFMA
- Gutter politics leading up to and during GE

On top of the screw up list, I also stand by my point about PAP having a slew of unpopular policies that they are just waiting to roll out whenever they feel ground sentiment is favourable. 

I think that as voters we should vote alone pragmatic lines and not idealistic ones. Overall, I actually like PAP as a party. If not for their obsession with power at all cost, I will probably vote for them every GE(unless WP contest at my area, I think they are the reasoned opposition voice that SG needs. I read their manifesto several times and liked many things in it. I will love to seem them form a coalition with PAP in the next 20~30yrs). 

But this trend of passing bills that essentially make ministers the arbiters of truth and changing of the constitution to entrench themselves with more power is just worrying to me. In the long term run, I feel this is detrimental for Singapore’s political and social growth. For these reasons alone, I cannot vote for them in good faith. I feel like I am just giving them more power that they absolutely do not need if I do so.

If PAP truly believes in the quality of their candidates they should considering levelling the playing field(no GRC, set election date and set voting district at least 1yr ahead of election), be more gracious with their brand of politics(less mudslinging) and be willing to stand up to fair competition. I strongly feel that they will be able to win more votes from the swing voters if they do so. It's only normal to like the underdog and hate the bully.

They would raise proper policy concerns that the PAP would have to clarify and address in their white paper, putting those commitments into the public record.

Today you say 6.9m, tomorrow you say 10m, then how, you tell me?"" or worse, bring up flawed arguments that the PAP can easily refute.

You can't run a country without having an idea of what tradeoffs mean, and then criticize the incumbent for planning to raise taxes. Singaporeans are starting to think that they can get more benefits out of thin air, and the opposition narrative is telling people that the only thing between them and those benefits is an uncaring elitist arrogant government. Yet, it is the bullet we swallowed that allowed us to have the money to be more socialist today.\n\nI'm not saying that we should continue to aim for economic growth regardless of any other goals, and I fully support Singapore becoming more socialist, but I really hate the dishonest and toxic narrative that Singapore's problems are all due to 'arrogance of PAP', and as long as we 'vote oppo', we can beat down that arrogance and our problems will be solved."", 'Asking people to vote even for substandard candidates is just a recipe for a sure downward spiral.

I do not want to vote for PAP but I am not sure if I want to vote for the WP. \n\nOn WP\nMainly because one question that’s been weighing on me is why should there be a minimum wage and handouts? Even if I am convinced that there should be a minimum wage and handouts, I just can’t fathom the idea of digging into the reserves or having every employees to set up a pool of fund to fund for these, because I really do not want to pay for others, directly or indirectly. And also, the WP are proposing a decrease or halt to GST hike so what if there are shortfall of govt revenue? Do we then dig into reserves, because I absolutely cannot fathom the idea of digging into a limited reserve that is only to be tapped into during a crisis such as COVID.

We cannot shut them out because we need them for growth.\n\nOn PAP\nI feel like if there weren’t any checks on them, they will be conceited and lost sight of the common people.

Showing compassion helps the society to become a better place right? \n\nI also feel that the greatest flaw the PAP have is their refusal to communicate with the common people.

The SDP has a really detailed manifesto but I don't think many people are going to read it. \n\n\n2nd is a lack of data.

A few years ago it was the same and now it is on par as you have said... Does that not mean that wages can increase without a need for minimum wage? Fine, let’s just agree that some wage earners deserves at least $1,300. For that I am with you.\n\nThe issue and goal of the minimum wage is to help the segment of workers that do not have the bargaining power to push for a fair living wage.\n\nPreschool teachers are still underpaid and they are facing their own issues now (for e.g local teachers having to compete with cheaper teachers overseas).\n\nBut the main catalyst for their wage increase came from govt intervention, it is not due to fair market forces. (You have to read it up yourself but in a nutshell, govt had to start a new govt agency for early childhood care, set up certifications, educational institutions etc. Nothing is free or magically happens without a concerted effort)\n\nGoing back to the motivation for minimum wage, it is about lending a hand to a neglected segment of community that are being taken advantage of due to their circumstances.  It is a\x0ebout having a healthy economy that is ethical and not at the expanse of our own people.\n\nWe want high GDP growth, but not if because we pay our elderly that are forced to work with peanuts. (Think about what drives a 70 ahma to go out to work at a food court; it is to fulfill the most basic needs)\n\nThat part resonates with me as a voter.\n\nAgain, this is not about using taxpayers' money to increase minimum wage.\n\nThis is about compelling companies to pay fair wages, that are necessary for workers to live a decent life. Not a life of luxury or extragavant. Just so that they can feed their families, themselves and put a roof over their heads.\n\n(Those that are better-skilled/abled and fortunate enough to be able to get a job that pays more than the proposed $1300 min wage, good for them. We are talking about the less-fortunate)\n\nSo where the money will be coming from? Not from you or me, but from companies that are hiring them. They have to institute a change in how they conduct their businesses and how they treat their employees. It's a policy to demand fair wage, we won't be giving low-income workers extra money from national budget.\n\nTell me how would you justify a company paying someone working full hours (we are not talking about part time or half day work) every day for a month, a wage of $1000 a month. To support a family.\n\nAs a business owner myself, if I can't pay my employees $1300 a month, that means that something is wrong with my business model.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Yes GST vouchers. I am fine if I do not receive GST vouchers honestly. My main concern is again, who would pay?\n\nThe GST vouchers are not impactful to us that are more fortunate, let's count our blessings and if you want, you could do your part and pay it forward to those that really need it.\n\nIt is meant to help those that are deeply impacted by GST increase.\n\nAs a policy, the govt had decided to give it to all citizens, and that's good on them to make it fair (the amount also is tied to your household income/property etc.) Some might argue that it's a ploy to win votes, I think any compassionate govt would do the same to look after its people; PAP is not the only party what would do that.\n\nWho would pay? Well, the govt decided that it would come from our national operating revenue (corp tax, personal income tax, GST etc). Nothing is pulled out of the thin air. (We earned $70bn in revenue, about $11bn from GST, $6bn was spent on GST vouchers). Nobody paid extra, nothing was taken from reserves. Budget planning is a thing.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Shouldn’t one plan and save for rainy days themselves?\n\nAgain, not everyone has the means and as fortunate as the majority of us.\n\nIt is about helping those in need and better their situation.\n\nThe good thing about all of our political parties, including PAP, WP etc, they are all fellow Singaporeans and want to do good for Singapore. Not just the well-off, but those that are not as fortunate. The choice to make here is which policies/ideas do you feel strongly about and want to back?\n\n&#x200B;\n\n>Because I can ask the same question to you, would you be willing to pay for others. If we are an ageing population, what would that mean on the young if it is financed through taxes?\n\nOh that's an easy question and yes, I would, that's what paying taxes are for. Regardless of the party that gets to run the govt (or whether there are more opposition in the parliament)that would never change, we still have to pay taxes. (Unless there is a party that wants to abolish all taxes and they  found a way to generate revenue without taxes lol)\n\nAnd yes, that's how society works. Our parents and grandparents paid taxes, contribute to CPF. We benefited from it, and now we are part of the workforce, we pay taxes/CPF, for our kids and future Singaporeans. And in turn, they will play their part.\n\nWe don't live in isolation, we are a nation.\n\nThe issue here is how are the money that we all contribute for being part of a functioning society, how are they being spent?

134,momochan14,hrorgl,[Trigger Warning] Singaporeans who fell through the cracks of society... How are you now?,2020-07-15 22:40:12,singapore,378641,337,2133,"**Economic downturn is here and more Singaporeans will fall through the cracks. I hope we can share our experiences with each other.**

**Here goes my story...**

Ever since early 2000s, my family struggled financially after my father was retrenched, due to the economic downturn. No companies wanted to hire him, despite his experience and capabilities, because he was deemed too old (in his 50s) and over-qualified for junior roles, couldn't even get past the recruiters.

After my father's start-up attempt failed, he took up any jobs possible that barely keep us afloat (Warehouse Executive in the day, Cook at fast food restaurant at night), because if he didn't, we would not be able to cover HDB loan, bills, debts and other expenses. He put up with the bullying from his boss (heavy workload, deducting his pay whenever something goes wrong) because he really needed the job. When he went to Social Services for financial help during the most desperate times, he recounted that the process was very demeaning and felt like a beggar. We got some financial aid, but it was far from enough.

Prior to that, I was blessed to have had resources (for enrichment classes, tuition etc..) for development, went to good schools and received good grades. As a result, my parents pinned high hopes on me that I would be the one to ""rescue"" the family, that kept them going during the difficult times. During the worst period, we nearly lost our home and had no money for our meals.

During my JC years, I was giving tuition to earn my pocket money. My parents didn't know I was struggling inside, I couldn't tell them, they had already crumbled under the immense pressure. They were miserable and started buying 4D, because they thought they could buy ""a hope"", they were happy only when they strike. I was crumbling under their heavy expectations, stress of going hungry, sense of shame from not having enough money to eat, maintaining my grades in a top JC. I was exhausted and had no one to confide in, even though I had people to hang out with.

I was falling into depression and couldn't absorb what I was studying. As expected, I didn't do well for the A levels, that sense of failure spiraled me further into depression. (I internalised the stigma of seeking therapy, because I thought the record would become an obstacle in my future, and if I hang in there, it would go away) My parents told me it was ok, but I know it's not from the way they behaved.

I refused to go down like that, I started working while my friends enter Uni. I thought I can save enough and pay for my own education (no one could be my guarantor for school loan), I was very clear about what my strengths are and what to study. I survived on less than $5 a day and enrolled in part-time degree after work. My mother would ask me for money for family expenses from time to time, I would give it to her to see her worry less. I was pushing myself very hard, lack of sleep and irregular meal times, my physical and mental health deteriorated. I went to Feiyue for free counselling service, the counsellor was kind but the only thing he could advice me, was to leave my family. It's impossible because I couldn't afford anymore financial burden to myself (rent. get my own household items etc..).

One day, my mother told me my father was going to get into big trouble, if I didn't help him pay off his debt. I didn't have the heart to let more misfortune befall him. I was totally crushed, that was my last straw. Even when I worked so hard to save, I couldn't study as I wanted, all my savings gone, just like that. I was very dejected and lived like a zombie, my parents said I should pull myself together and pressured me to do something productive.

>!I couldn't take it anymore, the pain was just too overwhelming. I was standing by the window, almost ready to take a dive. My sibling pulled me off the window, we hugged and cried. I know I need professional help immediately (because if I don't, there is no future to talk about).!<

I went to the polyclinic and got a referral to see a psychiatrist at KTP Hospital, diagnosed with depression and given medication. Experience with my doctor was poor, he was uncaring and insensitive, but I carried on, took my medication because it worked for me. I asked if there was any support group I could join, he said ""nope"" and that was it.

I returned to work after I felt ready again. I had a hard time looking for a job, the recruiters questioning about the gaps in my resume, the tone as though there I did something wrong. I was especially afraid of a section on the form that required me to declare whether I have any mental illness. (thankfully this section is no longer around) When I finally found one, I cherished it and did my best, got praises and then the bullying from co-workers started. I hanged on and stood my ground, but gradually it took a toll on me, and my depression relapsed. I told myself that I have to fight the right battles in life, and I quit my job.

This break is the turning point in my life, as I started going for psychotherapy and working out issues that I had. **I strongly recommend anyone who is suffering from any trauma to seek therapy ASAP, don't bottle it up until it becomes debilitating, because the body keeps score and it will always win.**

I'm in recovery and felt better than before I had depression, with a newfound understanding of myself. I convinced my parents to seek help for gambling addiction, and the financial situation improved. I am very proud of them for doing that.

However, I'm struggling with fears of being asked about the gaps in my resume when I apply for jobs, how people feel about working with someone with mental illness. Now in my early 30s, my struggle is far from over, I have problem finding a sustainable job without degree, and now I also have to worry about my parents' medical bills. I want to love and marry someone, have my own family, but I don't think I can afford to do so (My bf of many years broke up with me because he saw no hope in my situation).

A very big part of my life revolved around my personal battles that I cannot put onto my resume to add value, and too afraid to tell others because I don't want to be labelled as a failure by societal standards, or that I'm trying to get sympathy. Life is about spending time with your loved ones, having enough food to eat, a place to stay, doing meaningful work. I still want to work towards it.

I don't know how the future will turn out for me, I'm lost now. I was unemployed before Covid-19 hit, and did part-time job on and off, now my source of part-time jobs is gone too. I don't dare to sign up for jobs that has a lot human contact, because I'm afraid of passing the virus to my 2 elderly parents. I am trying to self-learn digital design (through free courses), and now I heard market is bad.

My story has come a full circle, from one economic downturn to this one. Thank you for reading all the way here. It's going to be tough but I hope by sharing my story, you know you are not alone.

My situation was not as bad as yours though I suspect it\'s only that way due to the efforts of my mom to hide most of the nastiest stuff from me. So instead, I\'ll share my story regarding the application of financial aid.\n\nI can attest to the fact that seeking financial aides from govnt is very demeaning and strips your of your dignity, so I can understand how your dad felt like. Certain things happened after my dad passed while I was in poly and we had to seek financial aid to deal with massive medical bill and living expenses. I will always remember the counter lady asking, ""Have you considered getting a loan from bank?"" It was as if I didn\'t know such a thing exist and she made me felt like I was a moron for troubling her with my issue cause *surely* I haven\'t thought to explore all other alternatives before coming to them for help. That moment—filled with sense of shame and indignity—was carved into my mind forever. So I told her we didn\'t qualify for bank loans because my mom\'s income wasn\'t even in the range of min income req because my dad has just recently passed and we needed help. Mind you, all of these happened in public ah. Not in a private setting. They didn\'t offered us that option. Anyone sitting beside us could hear us spill our guts to some stranger about the most trying time in our lives.\n\nIt was only later that I realized they expect you to perform your poverty. To them, unless you were picking cardboards off the streets or wearing dirty clothes with holes in them, you don\'t *look* like what they imagine poor people look like. As such, you\'re not poor enough for them to be understanding towards you and your situation.\n\nTbf, my memories of that day is tinged with resentment so maybe she didn\'t meant to have it come across in that condescending manner but it did.', '[deleted]', ""I screwed up my A levels (but not bad enough to retake).

Tried to get him to wear adult diapers and he will take them off in his bed then shit on the mattress. He would walk out of the house and go missing until some kind soul found him and brought him to the police. He even lost all his clothes once. We couldn't even apply for aid because they counted my sister's income into my family income, even though she was newlywed and still paying for her own bto at that point.\n\n\n  \nHonestly the best thing that happened to me was that my father passes away only after a couple of years with dementia. I felt no emotions when it happened. He wasn't a good father to begin with. Was physically abusive to my mother and did not had a stable income so my mom basically had to work and take care of me and my sister by herself.\n\n  \nRight now I'm almost 30 and working in a low paying job for 3 years, Missed out on increments due to covid.

I took on additional roles because the team was rapidly downsized due to people leaving. We were promised manpower but it never came. My boundaries and conditions for taking on the additional roles were not being respected. There are way too may last minute demands that ends up with ""someone with pay if it is not done and it is probably you"".\n\nThe pandemic brought lots of people in the country together...but it has also made a lot of people show their true and worse colours. People in the management overwork the bottom line to rush for a good show for *their* management. A lot of ideas and initiatives that came out to combat and manage the pandemic may seemed innovative. However, they were mostly born out of the desire to impress and score points. Nothing wrong with that, except that the top scored the points earned through the efforts performed by the bottom.\n\nI actually made up my mind to leave the company back in March...then the circuit breaker came. I stayed not for the fear of drifting around but i thought it is bad to leave and create a gap that might burden my colleagues. The top are the scum, my horizontals have nothing to do with the problems...mostly.\n\n...i couldn\'t count the number of Saturdays i returned to office since the circuit breaker started. I couldn\'t count the number of favours i did for others since i\'m ""in the office today anyways""...but when it is my turn to ask for help while i am working from home, i am told to consider how busy the other guy is in the office.

Another month of thinking ""just another month more""...what if it got delayed again?\n\nAnd the family is not exactly helpful during this period. In fact, if anything, it amplified my desire to get out of this house. Parents are making noises in the living room without giving a damn. The sister takes her 30 minutes shower at random odd timings and blocked out the common toilet. The nocturnal brother kept the lights on late at night, sometimes locking himself in the same toilet deep in the night watching videos. I don\'t even have a sanctuary at home. Slowly i found myself brushing my teeth earlier and earlier, only to close the door to my room and isolate myself from them.\n\nYou know how when you perform a good deed for someone and they thank you, you feel really good? I recently covered an old man in the rain, offering him a bigger share under the umbrella while getting half of myself wet and he thanked me really hard while holding my hand.

But at the same time, I can\'t and don\'t want to force myself to do something I\'m going to despise anyway.\n\nI can\'t study by reading or revising, I can only study by ear. I can\'t go for a job in the science, accountancy or engineering field because I don\'t work well with numbers or heavy concepts.\n\nI compare my condition to the previous generation and I would think I have it easier, but the mental pressure to be ""useful"" is just stuck in me. \n\nI\'m really glad you\'re still here, OP.

(TLDR: Bipolar, PTSD from near-death experience. Zero support network earlier in life because of various reasons. Pressures from everyone to be somebody, from Day 1. Anything less than 91/100 was deemed a failure.)  But here\'s the bit that may be relevant to you - the path I took to reinvent myself and build a new career.\n\nWas life science student in JC. Didn\'t get a scholarship, but that\'s ok, because I had a bunch of research internships under my belt. I\'d find something once I finish uni. But, I knew I had zero passion for the field, and would thus either flunk out at uni, or just be super mediocre and unhappy forever. (I only went into that field because it was what ""good students"" did.)\n\nThen, I watched a whole lab get fired at my research institute. Watched the phD students scramble to find new labs; some of them were young parents and the stipends they earned were hardly generous to begin with. That sobered me up and jolted me out of teenagerhood real fast. (Note: This was at a point in time where the govt was driving everyone to life sciences.)\n\nSo, I postponed going to uni. (Pretty much unheard of at a top JC. So, I\'m sure you can imagine how everyone responded.)\n\nI had a decent design portfolio by 18, so I found a job with that. Worked for 2 years, while studying part-time and doing multiple side gigs. Just so I could figure out what I wanted to do in life, and to finish uni with minimal debt.\n\nHad near zero personal life, it was 9 am to 10 pm of work/studying 7 days a week. There were days where I felt so burnt out I simply teared up silently at the back of the bus on the way home. (What helped: Knowing my goal, and spending so many hours out working away from judgemental parents.)\n\nKnowing what I know now, I\'m glad I did it.\n\nThe clue lies in what you do. What you\'ve always done.  \n**What do you do when you\'re sad? What is the one thing you do well?**  \n**All day, every day?**\n\nIn my case, it was writing. (I started with fanfiction writing almost 20 years ago.)  \nSo, basically, I found a way to **monetize that skillset.** (I\'m now literally a professional keyboard warrior.)\n\nRather than jump at the free courses out there, I suggest you look at what you have a real talent for and build from there. (Data analysts & coders are the new PMETs.)\n\nThen build a portfolio. (Since getting a degree is out of your reach.) It will get you either paid freelance work, or proper employment.\n\nIt won\'t feel like it while you walk through the tunnel, but the tunnel does end.  \nJust set a direction and keep going, u/momochan14.

Since I was a child my parents have been moving to and fro from Singapore to study, work etc. So this is my 2nd time coming back to Singapore. Unfortunately I was rejected for government school entry, because my scores for the AEIS exam were less than other people. My parents found me a small private school so that I could continue schooling. My dad found a job in 2018, and my mom found a job at the start of 2019. All was good for about 2 years, and then at the end of 2019, my father quit his job because of coworker harassment and pressure, among other issues. Now, my Dependent's Pass was tacked onto my dad's Employment Pass, so since he was out of a job, I was out of a Dependent's Pass. My dad and I have been passless since the start of 2020, and before Covid started, we were moving in and out of Malaysia to reset the visit pass duration (tourists are allowed to stay in Singapore for 30 consecutive days and 3 refreshes, so in total 90 consecutive days). After Covid started, we started to apply for visit pass extension, and surprisingly we got to extend until 150 consecutive days as of now, presumably because of Covid. Now, we're suck at home, but my education has been put on hold. I was already demoted to one grade lower than my actual grade when I went into the private school, and now I am 2 whole years behind my peers. My dad, disillusioned because no one has hired him yet, began to dabble into investment again with my mom being the sole breadwinner, so naturally my mom disliked that. He had lost copious amounts of money to investment scams before, and even got my grandma's money scammed by a fake trading company. But he's not stopping. He's already too deep into the rabbit hole, and he and my mom argue everyday about this issue. To add more bad news, we've been renting a flat (relatively old one with squatting toilet) to live in since we came to Singapore, and the owner just informed us that when our lease expires in 2021, she wants to sell the flat, so we need to move out and find another place to stay.\n\nIdk, I know tons of people have it worse than me, such as OP, but for my background and upbringing, I feel like Im in the worst situation in my whole life for now. I'm scared that I wont be able to graduate on time, I'm scared that I wont get a place in Uni/College, I'm scared that my parents will divorce, I'm scared that we'll be homeless, I'm scared other people will look down on me for my upbringing, I'm scared that I wont get married because I've always been rejected and I've never had a good first impression to anyone(I've asked), and most of all I dont know what to do. I've been trying to bury all that stuff by playing video games and learning languages and other stuff, but these questions always nag my mind. My mom asks me why I've looked so down recently and I just say I'm just tired coz I dont want her to worry about me.\n\nI've thought about suicide tbh, but I'm afraid of the pain and also of the suffering it will bring to my parents.

I’m not successful per se but I’m in a better place so I hope you guys can continue being resilient.\n\nI grew up in a upper middle class family. My father wasn’t born rich but worked hard to become an entrepreneur and had a thriving business. Up to the age of 14, I was living comfortably, had a helper in our house, always got what I wanted, and at one point of time was living in a condo too. Only issues I had were perhaps toxic communication issues with my parents. My mum is overbearing and my father is simply the stereotypical silent distant figure.\n\nThen my father’s business failed and everything went downhill. He was in debt, got my mum involved as a guarantor and before I could process what happened, my family was homeless and both my parents were bankrupt when I was 14. Our apartment literally got re-possessed and we had those officers coming in placing stickers on whatever was valuable so they could sell it. It was pretty traumatising & I remember my mum asking me to hide my laptop and tech stuff so they can’t take it.\n\nMy father then “semi-abandoned” the family with ‘business trips’ to China where he would fail and not send us any money at all. My mum was in a senior admin position earning about $3K which wasn’t really enough to single-handedly pay debts, rent, and raise 2 teenagers. But she also didn’t qualify for a lot of subsidies because they deem her salary as “too high”. This is where I think gov policies can be more flexible in helping families with different circumstances but, topic for another day.\n\nMy mum fell into depression and would threaten to commit suicide everyday. Both parents couldn’t make a decision about where to live and I literally went through the classifieds section to find rental apartments, dragged my mum to viewings, and we finally settled in a rented hdb flat. My mum also struggled to give us expenses and she would go hungry at times just to make sure me and my sister still had meals and tuition. By this time, I was already jaded about school. I was a decent student but with so much going on, I did poorly in sec 3, scored single digits for tests, and had to repeat another year. I didn’t really realise it then but I was depressed because I had insomnia and was constantly unhappy and angry. \n\nAll repeated students were made to attend compulsory counselling sessions in my school and this only made it worse. As a teenager, the last thing you really need is extra attention drawn to you when you have to skip classes for your counselling sessions. The counselling itself was horrible because I don’t remember much of it. I just remember feeling disconnected from everyone and distrusting everybody so much so that I don’t think I had a proper conversation with the counsellor. The last 3 years of my sec school education are a blur because I think my brain is trying to protect me from trauma by blocking things out and I’m still working on processing them till today.\n\nEventually me and my sister motivated each other and I did well for O’levels to get into a decent JC. But it was tough focusing cause my mum lost her job, had a new one which paid lesser, then Singapore’s property market entered a crazy boom and the rented hdb wanted to increase rent by 2x & we couldn’t afford it. Throughout this period, my dad was just absent. I honestly didn’t really cared much about him but it fucked my Mum real bad and she was emotionally abusive and manipulative to me and my sister. We were almost going to be homeless again until an aunt(dad’s side) decided to let us use a spare room in her hdb.\n\nWorst aunt ever. She charged us high rent for that space, was stingy, turned off the main aircon switch in the night to get us to use less electricity. This made JC stressful and I did badly for A’levels, couldn’t enter any local uni courses based on my grades (B,C,D) Luckily I got a B for literature and my JC teacher helped me with a recommendation letter to NTU where I managed to major in literature! I worked as a teacher to support my expenses for Uni, had some help from grandparents for Uni fees, helped my mum with her divorce, and eventually she managed to apply for a BTO so we are no longer homeless.\n\nCurrently, I’ve been working for 5 years in the digital marketing space. It hasn’t always been easy but I’ve found my niche and have had to forced myself to adapt (I’m bad at math but I work with data and analytics now). I also managed to land myself a job overseas and was based there until...COVID-19 happened and I was taking a holiday in singapore and am now stuck here while working remotely for my employer based overseas. I’m living out of a suitcase, and have uncertainty about my employment. For years, my goal has always been to migrate out of Singapore with my partner as it’s not LGBTQ-friendly so I was working really hard towards that (making calculated career choices and saving hard to migrate). With COVID-19, my overseas residency application is in jeopardy so it’s been a shitty time but I still have my job and I think I’m in a privileged position compared to many others.\n\nI’m just taking each day as it comes, and still looking to upskill because I want to stay relevant & competitive. It’s not always easy cause sometimes your circumstances don’t permit you to just take a course on the side but I definitely would encourage everyone to at least try. Digital marketing, coding, and data analyst skills are very employable skills with Low barriers to entry! \n\nI haven’t seen a therapist but the Internet is amazing and I’ve found support in other positive ways (Parks and rec, the office) and have learnt to be honest with myself about my feelings and thoughts in order to process things better. I definitely think that a proper therapist during my growing years would have helped but oh well, still not too late! \n\nAs Captain holt from Brooklyn 99 once said, “Life is unpredictable.

Maybe your mother, since she is caring enough to notice the difference in you, she would still worry even if you don\'t tell her. It\'ll be helpful to seek professional help on how to deal with your situation, especially it\'s been overwhelming for you. Both of your parents are going through a lot too, they may also benefit from any insight they can provide.\n\nRegarding financial matters, it\'ll be important to clarify the situation with the family, how much debt, expenses, make a spreadsheet to sort it out. Your mom would probably need your support to talk to your dad about his financial issues. If it is too difficult to handle, see if you can try approaching Family Service centres for help. Report the scammers to authorities if possible.\n\nAbout your fears, I think we internalised the societal standards about ""how we should be"", the truth is, everyone\'s life and situation is different and many have hidden issues that people don\'t know about.

Not all of them include a professional too! But it depends on your situation and, in short, how long you've been suppressing your feelings etc.\n\nFirst, I recommend you either verbalize your feelings, or write them down. That too in coherent sentences. When you put your feelings into words, you realise how your situation may not be as bad as you initially thought. We humans normally magnify our problems and think the worst situation possible through everything. Once you put it into words, often times you'll see how skewed your thoughts would have been before.\n\nNext, I'd suggest you could try to talk to someone about your situation. It doesn't need to be someone that'll give you solutions to every problem, we often just need someone to listen to us. This could be one of those online helplines where you don't know the people you're talking to so it's more anonymous and you won't feel pressured to put on a front for them. But I should tell you first that this isn't a long term solution. Once you feel comfortable talking about your situation and you reach a situation where you just need help, it might be time to see a psychologist or professional. \n\nThe simplest solution I have is for you to talk to your parents or close family in general. Family, above all, will look to act for your betterment. Therefore however your situation might be, if you're able to put it into words and tell your family and ask them for help, it can only get better from there. This does not discount the fact that they might not see eye to eye with your choices and decisions, they might be angry initially. But they will help. \n\nA word of caution though. If at any point you feel like you might end your life, or something along those lines, please do seek professional help. Once it gets to that point, getting help from a professional will make the process easier for you, because they will guide you through your recovery. \n\nThese are just some ways that you can reach out.

**UPDATE AND FOLLOW-UP PORTION**

Firstly, would like to thank all who commented. It gave me some much needed perspective which did help myself calm down. I haven’t made any concrete decisions but I have recollected my thoughts and started to evaluate my options. Some updates on things I brought up.

Anxiety - Some commenters got it spot on that my anxiety stems from the deployment role. It was scary as I’ve never had anxiety to that extent. Sure, after going through 3 years of weekly presentations in poly, I’ve certainly experienced nervousness before, but this was different. I almost felt like I was paralysed. Since then, I took some of your advice and found a way to decline the role. That certainly eased some of my worries

Long work hours - While the anxiety is a huge factor in my wanting to quit, it certainly isn’t the only one. I’ve felt it for a while but the 12-hour shifts is taking its toll on my mind and body. Insufficient sleep and time to exercise saw an increase in weight, which has never been an issue growing up, and recently, increase in blood pressure too. And due to the nature of the work, the long hours is also starting to affect my neck and back, which is worrying considering my age.

Bond - Ok I guess I failed to clarify that the bond is apparently just a year (I’m a little over two years now). They split the bond money into one big amount upon joining + smaller payouts that spread over three years. I would only need to pay anything back if I resigned before one year. The downside to quitting now is just missing out on the remaining smaller payouts. So I guess that’s another worry gone, not requiring to pay off the bond.

Uncertainty after quitting - I think at this point it’s a matter of when not if, whether I’m quitting or not. However, I want to plan ahead so as to not stagnate in unemployment, which has happened before. But I’m not really sure what I want to do or pursue, so it’s kinda overwhelming.

**UNEMPLOYMENT AND JOB HUNTING PORTION**

I guess to the main point of this post. For the first time, I’m (about to be) unemployed with no real clue or confidence in where I’m going. I know it’s not uncommon to be job hunting but I’ve always followed people around since entering the workforce. After NS, I followed a cousin into the government sector. When I resigned from that, I followed a friend into the security sector. This time, I want to go into something on my own. But I don’t feel well-informed or well-equipped. I know there are resources but I’d just like to get some opinions from here. I have entertained some ideas but I’d love to get some advice or feedback.

Data Entry/Admin - This is honestly most likely a short-term thing. I just want a job with minimal interaction. I know this could be a pretty broad jobscope, some may involve a lot of interactions but I’m only looking for entry-level for this one. Just to get myself accustomed to office hours and office life. And also to still keep earning income.

Taking up courses/classes for design - I was made aware of MySkillsFuture and found some classes on softwares such as Photoshop, Illustrator etc. I am considering taking these and possibly try for a graphic design job. I have a diploma from a design course but am way out of touch with the industry. I certainly understand I’d have to start from zero but if there’s anyone who’s familiar with the job, what are some classes I could take to pursue this line ?

Model-making ? - Again, if anyone reading this is in the design industry or familiar with it, are there jobs specifically to make models, as in for buildings or interiors. Model-making was something I enjoyed and was generally good at in Poly but I never even thought if there was an actual job for it. I was also a social hermit back then so I never really keep in contact with anyone who could possibly be in the industry now to help.

IT/Programming - This is actually something that came up when talking with my friends. With the world now so reliant on gadgets, computers, internet etc., it would be good to be proficient in IT. But I’m totally clueless about this tbh and I’d probably need to go back to school to get a good grip on it. Which I’m not against if I was financially comfortable. So maybe in the future.

CareerTrial - I’ve also been made aware of this but have not much info about it. Anyone know how exactly is the process or how effective it is ? I even saw some graphic designer positions, but do they really take in totally untrained and inexperienced people ?

Enjoy/Relax ? - Or maybe take a month or two just enjoying not having to go to work or having commitments. This would clear up so much time for me to start getting active again. Also, I would like to watch my shows/ playing games without the dread of going to work the next day. But I am aware that I’m prone to prolonging this period of unemployment. Not to mention, with no income, I probably have to dip into my personal savings, which does slightly irk me.

If you’ve read this far, thanks for listening (or reading). This month has been so exhausting and stressful to me, which is worrying cos nothing particularly life-changing or terrible happened. The previous post that I mentioned, helped a lot in that the comments gave me perspective and a degree of assurance in my anxious times.

I truly appreciate any feedback or advice but like before, I am fully aware in the end, I need to make my own decisions.

CGPA 3.1 was up til 3rd sem but it's going to drop even further when results come out next Monday. I found out that I had failed a module and needed to retake it. It's really very discouraging as that was the module I really put in my all to understand. IT is my passion and I really hope I would take com sci as my degree.

Since my A level friends were applying to uni I decided to take a look as well. Most of them has received offers from NTU and even NUS. I really feel so worthless when I look at them, we're the same age and their futures seem so much better than mine. I can only blame myself for not working enough to get a good GPA. 

At this point I'm left with fyp and intern to try pull my grades up, since I'm remodding my fyp group is changed so it would be quite hard to work with people I just met. At best I score 4.0 for my next two sems, my CGPA would not go above 3.3. Should I still try and aim for a com sci course in uni? Or should I just start working after I graduate?

as the beginning of a levels draws nearer, and the anxiousness is setting in, ive decided to write this post to comfort myself, and to comfort those who need it. 

(insert your name), you have worked hard the past two years. the knowledge you have acquired through the sleepless nights, the early mornings, the consultations. the struggles you’ve had, getting extremely frustrated when you repeatedly just can’t seem to solve a question of a certain type, but was able to solve it after wrestling it and not caving in to the anger. you have indeed journeyed so far. 

(insert your name), you may feel like you have yet to cover all the content of the subject, yet may feel like you know nothing about the exam you are getting ready to take. but i wish to tell you that that is not true. everything you need is already inside of you. i repeat, everything you need is already inside of you! you just have to search a little in your brain which is overly cluttered with emotions now. a little digging, a little comforting, and the you will start to recall the information. but even if you do not/ can’t find it, don’t fret, move on buddy. 

(insert your name), for the next month to come, you will be engulfed with a tumultuous wave of emotions, feelings, unexplainable crying. but i want to tell you that it is ok. let it come, cry if you have to, be angry if you want to. release those emotions in you to relax your body. it is not healthy keeping it in. studied for 6 hrs straight but still feeling uncertain/ have yet to accomplish what you want to? brain clogged? GET UP! go for a walk. go for a run. go watch a funny video. go eat your favourite hawker dish. GET UP! stop worrying about your unfinished work. GET UP/ taking a break is not seen as being lazy, but an extremely important way to recalibrate your brain. you may be overwhelmed with guilt “oh i havent finish item 2,5,7,9 on my to-do list, i cant take a break yet!!!” but remember, our brain is a well-oiled machine, it needs to take regular breaks from overheating/ overwork. maintenance through self-care would allow this extremely beautiful machine to be sustained for a longer duration in the future. we are aiming for sustainability & consistency, not quantity. 

(insert your name), so my friend, you are ready. as much as you feel that you are not, trick yourself into thinking you are. the 50% of content you think you have, supplement it with 50% of confidence/ reassurance/ trust in your self. if you were to supplement the other 50% of fear/ lack of content/ have yet to finish studied all these topics/ self-doubt, you are going for war without your armour but only with the skills you have learnt during your training. so, arm your alter ego with confidence AND the skills you’ve acquired at your training. go in confident. do not show your enemy (the exam paper/ the examiner) your weakness, but the other 50% of strength you possess. 

all the best my brave warriors fighting this month long battle. you have worked hard, and you will be fine.✊🏻",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jl930i/a_levels_the_time_has_come/,"['only the title is relevant in the sense that i feel like my time has really come.\n\nthe energy in this post... can’t relate.', 'all the best everybody we got this <3', 'The only I need now is Felix Felicis so that an easy S&T question would come out for GP Paper 1', 'Anyone knows what to do if hypothetically I get 50rp?

I’m not even confident if I can do that much better if I were to retake A’s. 
On the other hand poly’s gonna take three more years and I’m interested in early childhood education (ece) but my parents are not very supportive of it + from what I’ve heard, poly has many presentations and projects to be done too and everything counts so I cannot screw up anything either.. and there’s still stigma about falling behind your peers no matter how much we deny it zzzZz and then after poly, the only ece related course is in SUSS isn’t it? 
in the meantime, I’ll still try to apply for SUSS and apply to retake A’s as a school candidate.

It's a career that definitely needs more ppl. The challenges u think u will face such as presentations & stuff, look it in a positive way. It improves ur soft skills as well as comms with ppl, an essential trait in ece careers. You will get thru poly or uni, all it requires is consistency. To attain consistency, you will have to establish core motivation factors of why u took up the course ( eg passionate in educating children)\n\nAs i said, its your life.

We have to just make improvisations along the way.\n\nDont feel too bad for getting that A lvl score. Its our attitude and actions taken during these tough times that shape our resilience.\n\nWould suggest you take the poly option as your chances of succeeding here is higher than retaking As .

U need to reward yourself w an end goal. If u intend to continue to Suss or Sim after poly (i took this route minus jc part), u can consider to work n take part time Suss degree.

141,jojoyo1999,jugpfb,"College is hard, and these are my struggles in NUS",2020-11-15 13:22:07,nus,21212,14,213,"I am going to say it. College sucks. The reason? My deteriorating mental health. In my freshmen year, I was consistently stressed out and overwhelmed by the academic pressure. My anxiety and distress were perpetuated by a highly competitive school environment. My only haven on campus was my dorm room, where I could cry freely away from prying eyes. I would experience multiple mental breakdowns within a week and my only source of comfort was advice from online threads. I did share my struggles with family and friends. However, they could not empathize with me because they were in different phases of life. Having almost no friends in college made it difficult to share my struggles openly as well.

&#x200B;

(I originally posted this article on my website, but I thought I would share it here. I want to reach out to fellow students who may feel the same way as I do, but do not have people that empathize with them.)

&#x200B;

Over the year, I realized that my emotions are valid. I cannot discount them just because the people around me do not understand how I feel. It was the lack of support in my freshmen year that empowered me to start my website. I wanted to create a space for struggling students like myself and reassure them that they are not alone.  We all doubt ourselves privately but believe that we are alone in thinking this way. It is because no one else really voiced their doubts. This article is meant to detail my struggles and how these struggles defined my college life.

## Suffering from Imposter Syndrome (Believing I Did Not Deserve A Place in College)

Do you feel that you are not smart enough to be in college? Do you consistently compare yourself with the people around you? Do you feel like the only person who does not have their shit together? I admit that I am very guilty of all the above. Enrolling into NUS was a game-changer as I grew up attending neighborhood schools. Here, I am competing with students from better ranking schools and are from the cream of the crop. They were better prepared at managing the academic rigor of higher education. They too were more resourceful and adjusted faster to university. Despite coming from the same education system as them, I felt intimidated and under-equipped to manage this tricky situation.

&#x200B;

My self-esteem plummeted throughout my freshman year. I was consistently comparing myself to my peers. Many students were on gifted or scholarship programs, excelling in professional networking, participating in academic competitions, or holding a high committee position. Meanwhile, I had no other achievements that could supplement my portfolio. The demanding curriculum made it difficult to take on extra commitments because I needed time to study. My lack of time caused me to question my intelligence. Was it because I am not smart enough to comprehend concepts quickly? Was it because I am not good enough to in NUS? Maybe I should just accept the fact that I am a failure compared to my classmates. With each passing day, my mind would continue to spiral with these negative thoughts.

&#x200B;

Upon enrollment, I realized I was younger than most of my peers. Many people within the cohort were older due to various reasons. To add to my anxiety, my frantic mind assumed that my young age was a disadvantage. I started to nitpick on my mistakes. After all, experience in life comes with age. If I made a wrong decision, was it because of my lack of maturity? If I said or did the wrong things, was it because I am ignorant? This mindset affected my ability to perform in school. It was difficult to voice my ideas and opinions in group projects because I believed that I lacked wisdom and judgment. I had concluded that perhaps I should not even be in college.

&#x200B;

Every day, I felt that I did not deserve my place in NUS. It seemed like there are way more qualified individuals than myself, and I was accepted because I was lucky. Even if I performed well on a task in school, I would attribute it to hard work instead of my intelligence. There was a nagging doubt that I did not earn my accomplishments using my intellect. Self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy would continue to plague me for the majority of my freshmen year.

&#x200B;

In hindsight, I was likely suffering from imposter syndrome. It is said to occur among high achievers who are unable to internalize and accept their success. This experience is common among individuals who are starting a new and challenging position. Imposter phenomenon is not a mental disorder. Instead, it is a reaction to external stimuli or events. Imposter syndrome is having the feeling of phoniness and believing that you will be found as a fraud. Instead of acknowledging my abilities, I often attributed my successes to external forces. When I am around schoolmates, I often fear that they would uncover my lack of abilities and expose my incompetence. Despite obtaining decent grades in school, I continued to doubt my capabilities. It seemed as though no threshold would put these feelings to rest.

&#x200B;

## How Did I Manage Imposter Syndrome?

Now, I believe that the first step to solving any problem is recognizing that there is a problem. It was in semester 2 of my freshman year when I started to recognize my unhealthy thought patterns. I had placed a large emphasis on success and achievements and was constantly under tremendous pressure to perform. After all, I wanted to make up for the perceived lack of capability between me and my peers. Constant comparison between myself and them, me nitpicking my failures and my feelings of inadequacy perpetuated the problem. How did I recognize that I was suffering from imposter syndrome? My father reminded me that the pressure I was under was created by only myself. It then dawned on me that perhaps, I was being too hard on myself. Then, I still could not name what I was feeling. The term imposter syndrome was introduced when I was in Year 2.

&#x200B;

Acknowledging the limitations of my competence and capabilities improved my mental health significantly. Previously, I was caught up in chasing the goals and expectations others had set for themselves. Whenever I fell short of those expectations, I was reminded of my ineptness. Coming to terms with the fact that I am just not as intelligent, talented, or capable as others have relieved the pressure to perform on the same level. Why was I stuck in the cycle of chasing expectations that were determined by other people? Should not I be comparing my achievements to my expectations? This realization broke the chains of despair that had been holding me back for the entire academic year. My academic progress was on track with the goals I had set, and I did not fall short of my expectations. I had been so caught up in the rat race that I forgot to ask myself why I was in it.

Do gauge where you stand in the cohort within the first few weeks of school. From there, decide whether you want to join the crazy study grind or take things easy. Reaching this decision early can help you to deal with the overwhelming stress and competition in college better. In NUS, there are also counseling services at the university counseling center. If you are feeling overwhelmed by the academic pressure, talking to a counselor or therapist may help you to cope better. Do note that there is a long wait time (about one month) for services at the counseling center.

&#x200B;

Remember that you are not to be defined by any assignment, exam, or GPA. You are bigger than that. We want the effort we put into studying to be validated, but this validation does not have to come from grades. It hurts when we do not get what we work hard for, but it does not mean that we will not be successful in the future.

&#x200B;

## Feeling Lonely in University

If asked to describe college, the word lonely is an unlikely adjective. After all, college is meant to be fun and exhilarating and the media reinforces this concept continuously. Like everyone else, I was excited to enroll in college and have the best time of my life. I was ready to drink, party, and make lifelong friends. I am young, in my prime, and ready to have fun. What could go wrong?

&#x200B;

I joined several freshmen orientation camps and met numerous people. My contact list grew longer and my followers on Instagram increased significantly. As the academic year started, I was kept busy for the first few weeks as I attended school fairs and welcome events. Eager to partake in the robust co-curricular activities my school had to offer, I joined several clubs. Yet, the enthusiasm and keenness started faded away fairly quickly before recess week.

Although I enjoyed myself during orientation, I never saw some of my orientation mates again. I also stopped talking to the friends I made because they already had friend groups from high school. I did not move away from home to attend college and many students in my college were the same. Yet, none of my friends were in the same college as me so I was alone.

&#x200B;

Moreover, I felt that the friends I made in college did not put in the same effort as I did to maintain the friendship. I presume that it is because they already have friends from high school. Friends in college seem to just hang out to have fun and they have no interest to get to know one another better. Friendships formed from project groups feel transactional as well. It feels like the friendship purely serves to facilitate good teamwork.

&#x200B;

It is depressing and demoralizing to witness so many people having their closest friends with them. Together, they can create memories while they experience the ups and downs of college. I cannot help but feel alienated from the very community I am in. It is the feeling that nobody is there for me when I want to socialize or hang out with someone. I have friends outside of school but the situation I am in perpetuates the feeling of loneliness. Moreover, freshmen year can be a breeding ground for Instagram posts. I would open my app and see uploads of people having fun and enjoying themselves. Although the posts may not reflect the emotions others feel all the time, it is still difficult to dissociate the feeling that others are having fun, but I am not.

&#x200B;

## How do I Cope with Loneliness?

I am learning to be comfortable alone and it is difficult. However, I do realize the slew of benefits that comes with being alone and I am trying my best to focus on the good. FOMO is real but I do not have to let it control my life. Being alone has nothing to do with my personality, my ability to make friends, or loving myself.

&#x200B;

I used to consume mindless entertainment or spend my time with fair-weathered friends whenever I felt lonely. These temporary comforts brought nothing but emotional unfulfillment. In hindsight, I deprived myself of precious self-reflection time. Clear answers and true internal reflection can only happen during a period of solitude with no distractions. Being alone gives me the time to better understand my thought process, understand myself, and regulate my emotions. Meanwhile, I now have the opportunity to create meaningful work and it has injected purpose into my life. I can see my loneliness for what it is instead; that I simply have time for myself to do or create what I want.

&#x200B;

There may be an expectation to meet your best friends at orientation and start school with a large group of friends. It is highly unrealistic, and it is perfectly okay if you did not find people you would vibe with. Real friends are hard to come by. That is why when we meet people we click with; we recognize that it is special and will sincerely work on the relationship.

&#x200B;

## Conclusion:

Although I cannot banish these feelings completely, I believe that we can have open conversations about the challenges students face in college. With increasing awareness of how common these experiences are, perhaps we can feel freer to be frank about our feelings and build confidence in simple truths. I am capable, I deserve to be in college, and it is okay to be alone.

143,SctGabriel,holxdv,Offering free swim classes for adult beginners,2020-07-10 17:28:59,singapore,378641,80,1788,"Today there was a post in the r/Singapore group on adults who can’t swim. I am fortunate to have a long holiday until mid August with limited plans due to the travel ban. 

Therefore I am offering my service as an experienced swimming coach for free for 8 adults (two teams of 4 to meet the COVID 19 requirements), who never learned to swim and now keen on learning. 

If you insist on paying, then I will donate the amount to a organisation of my choice. In my home country of Denmark, we are raised to contribute and volunteer in local community sports clubs; this is my little part in giving back to Singapore, my home for the past 6 years and counting. 


Only requirements:
-adult
-can’t swim, but want to learn 
-bringing own goggles, kick board and float “noddle”. 
-keen and dedicated 
-training twice per week for 30 min to one hour per session and willing to train at home if needed 
-sessions are evening and located in Novena (days to be determined)
-focus points: safety, water adjustment, floating to basic movement and balance 

About me:
Teacher at an international school in PE, mother tongue literature and social studies. 
Experienced coach - from baby swimmers to competition teams 
Currently head coach of school swim team 
Key philosophy; patience and trust

Update:
I am overwhelmed by the number of people reaching out. Learning to swim as an adult can be hard and I can not promise miracles, but I will do my very best.

Here are the days I suggest starting next week:
Tuesdays 
Team 1: 5 pm - 6 pm 
Team 2: 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm

Thursdays 
Team 1: 5 pm - 6 pm
Team 2: 6:30 pm - 7:30 pm

Since we are not allowed to post personal information, please contact me directly and state which day you want to join and briefly describe your confidence and experience with swimming. If you are among the first to sign up, you will be notified by me with more information. I am sorry if you do not hear from me - we are only allowed a small number and for safety reasons, I can only handle a small group at the time.

Update no 2
I am literally speechless. So many kind words and awards. I will reach out to all the ones who wrote me directly and try to accommodate. There seems to be a need for teams where adults can learn to swim without feeling stigmatised or being ashamed. I hope this can encourage more to seek out other coaches with adult classes.

Hi reddit,

Thank you for the amazing support this community has shown to me and my family. Since our last post, this story has gone on to Mothership, MustShareNews, Lianhe Wanbao, Shin Min, Channel 8 Digital News etc. and has reached more people than I even expected.

Although I have not managed to locate my aunt, I'd like to perhaps update you all on some information I've gained.

1. A member of the public has told me that during their stay in Tan Tock Seng Hospital in Oct 12 2019, they met an older Chinese lady who was in a bed next to theirs. They began chatting and this member of the public learnt that this older lady was also abandoned at the CHIJMES convent, and had a similar story with a possible age match. The older lady speaks very fluent English and from their guess, she might have been English educated (may not even know how to speak Chinese). Although the memories are a bit hazy, the older lady mentioned that she works in a church in Toa Payoh. Could I check with everyone here if anyone happens to also work in any church in Toa Payoh who might know someone that fits such a description? An auntie that was born in 1957, was in Tan Tock Seng Hospital on Oct 12 2019 for some heart issues? Unfortunately we do not know which church she is from.

2. I have tried to contact the Infant Jesus Home & Children's Centre, as well as a Sister Maria Lau (whom I was told to contact by a member of the public on Facebook). However, despite multiple emails, none have gotten back to me. Does anyone happen to have any contacts that they can provide? Thank you.

Thank you so much, the kindness and helpfulness I've received has been overwhelming.

I'm sure many of you at this point are drowning in fear—overwhelmed by anxiety & uncertainty in whether or not you can perform as well as you'd intend.

I'm not here to provide any last-minute study tips (a*nyways, I'm sure many of you've already scoured through the internet to discover your secret formula for the ultimate study session/schedule)* I'm just here to remind you to **believe in yourself.** 

As you take your first steps into this month-long venture, please hold on to all the strength and determination that you possess. You've come so far from where you once were. You've fought through so much and pushed through mountains of anguish to be where you are today. Don't let your hard work go to waste by **underestimating your ability to perform**. 

The A-Levels drag on for quite a while, so you're going to need quite a fair bit of mental stamina to get through it all. If you do end up making mistakes along the way, please don't harp on it and try your best to work on the next paper. You can't rewind time, but the future is in your hands. 

I don't know if this post will reach anyone, but I do hope that anyone who reads this knows that they'll make it through the coming month just fine.

We started off as friends then we upgraded our status to boyfriend and girlfriend. We were happy at first, we hangout once a week, holidays probably twice a week, texted everyday(Though i was dam tired to text everyday rather write letters lol kidding) We were happy honestly. The problems started to surface when we were dating for about 2 months. We were 'discovered' by our church members. And once we were 'discovered' rumours started to spread that we were together(yes we were). Both of us wanted to hide our status(including parents) and we agreed on lying to them(church members) when they asked about it. We were stressed and overwhelmed by it. Our agreement to lie about status fell. H decided to tell the truth and I decided to tell the lie. Yes, it was mess. Everything just fell apart from there. Whether it was lie or truth, rumours spins up like a crazy tornado into the sky in church. Everyone now knew something about it. Everytime, when i went to church i would always felt very jittery, scared for being judge and scared of people gossiping. I was just freaking out and nervous. No one cared about how i felt. I thought church is a safe place. I thought they would journey with me. H and I started to quarrel more often and often. I felt betrayed too because she always tell everything i say to her like my thoughts and stuff to her Best Friend(D). Why do u need tell D? Why?Why cant you keep to yourself? I was also stressed out by her too. She would example why u always sleep so early, why cannot sleep late and chat with me? ranting to me about her family members and friends example, you know that xxx so annoying sia even that ggg also dont like her. I need space to tell you about my life too! Unexpectedly O lvl was the least concern. Then we went for a 'break' then i thought it was a break up leh I thought break is like a easier way to say break up, D told me break and break up different, break is still together but not talking and break up means not together and not talking. idk ape ini honestly. Then, after a few days we began talking again and what we were back? But then, we started quarreling haiyo and going out and have fun yay again. The turning point was when i went to church just like any other day and suddenly like a few leaders decided to invite me for dinner. During the dinner, one of them was threatening me to remove (H) from leadership because of the rumours about (H) and I, he was basically telling us to break up. I was angry and confused. How could they do this to her? What am i going to do? I dont want (H) to lose like this leadership thingy in church and i still want the relationship. How? I couldnt turn to anyone for help. I discussed it with (H) about what we should do about it. She just replied IDK. I cant believe it man! And i told her my suggestion that we break up for a while and date next year? I mean love is more than just the status. Love is through actions. She said Okay. A few days later, oh wow I got this revelation from God that this relationship couldnt go on anymore and dont wait for me. I am like what?!! I was mad! I got blamed for breaking up by her friends and my close friends in church didnt support me too. My school friends dont know about it because i didnt tell them. But i still put on that freaking mask to school and church everytime, always happy go lucky, I didnt want anyone to know about it. I asked myself why me? why did such things happen to me? I come from a broken family too, only my mother and I, i just cant bring myself to telling her about it. I was all alone.

Current situation
- working as 2yr project coordinator in sunset industry, long hours in pre-covid times. Hating the job because i am a dumb but hard worker. Prefer tasks where i am the one delegated work not the delegator, and minimal stakeholder management and project management
- get depressed and anxious during work because of poor external stakeholder management. I rather do the work myself - but impossible due to industry needs. 
- current role in firm only promotes those with high sales/ big account management. 
- zero chance to learn hard skills on the job because actual job doesn’t require them unlike initial JD

What i want to do is to find the time and space to pivot into a new role, so i can avoid repeating above-mentioned problems. 

Coming from a humanities background and high workload/zero mind-share, signing up for courses seems impossible at the moment.

I am also working on managing myself and work expectations because such problems will follow me in the next job. But at the same time, i am looking to find a chance to get out of this skills-job gridlock. 

I have enough savings and minimal financial commitments to go income-less for 1 year. But i worry about a blank period on resume. If i do quit, i plan to busy myself with training courses. For last few months, i feel overwhelmed with the information and courses on job portals, skillsfuture and sgtraineeship. 

Would appreciate if anyone has faced similar challenges like quarter life crisis that i am facing.",0.8,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/krq6d5/career_advice_for_late_twenties_early_jobber/,"['From what I see this job might be your 1st full time job. \n\nTo be upfront first, it is literally almost impossible to find a job that is all rosy. Many a times there will be a expectation vs reality gap and if you are able to, you might want to try to close the gap in ways you feel fit.\n\nIts not possible to do everything on your own. Especially when you take up management role next time. You can oversee and ensure everything is fine but can never do everything on your own. \n\nCompanies all require revenue to keep them afloat and in turn these revenue will also become salary for you and everyone else in the company. So it is not wrong to reward those that are able to bring in the revenue for company. \n\nIf you still feel what I said is untrue, you may still change your job but likely you will still find yourself in similar situation in the next job.', ""let me try to be frank with you. up to you to take it or leave it. \n\nyour expectations currently have big gaps with your described abilities/capabilities. \n\n1. you want to be left alone to do your job. the one that left alone jobs are hard to come by, unless you're an auditor. being a PC doesn't really give you a springboard nor adequate skillset to move onto an auditor role.\n2. depressed due to poor external stakeholder management. again, you gotta understand that you need to work with other people and there will always management layers that you don't see eye to eye (or can't comprehend because they don't have time/bother to declare all reasons why they make certain decisions or demanding certain actions). unless you're the management and that's mean you own the business and you're your own boss/staff. being own boss have different league of challenges itself. \n3. you condemn your firm that promotes people with stellar performance/bring in huge revenues. whatelse the firm should promote then, if not the ones that keep the vessel float to pay all sort of bills in this current economy situation, for a sunset industry like you mentioned? They definitely won't promote introvert/sit at the corner type, nor have less contribution towards firm's survival/growth. \n\nsince you mentioned you have some humanitarian working background, probably that should be the industry you should get back to. \n\nas for gap on cv, so long you get the right next companies/hiring manager, the handicap can be overcome. in any case, you won't be the only one with gaps on cv during this point of time.\n\nall the best."", 'What about tutoring?', ""Don't call yourself dumb! You're definitely not. It seems like you're struggling because you find it hard to manage stakeholders? That's a skill that can be picked up.\n\nIt might be uncomfortable for you but if the situation permits and you wanna give it a go, chat with colleagues who are doing well and ask for tips. Normally people like to share about their strengths and what they do well. \n\nWhen I first started working I found it difficult to manage stakeholders too - it didn't come naturally to me and I struggled a lot. But then I realised it's a skill I can learn so rather than saying I can't do it I got advice and gave it a try, i.e I took it as a challenge! \n\nYou can try taking small steps, for example, communicate and set expectations with stakeholders, keep clear notes to track project etc.\n\nThese skills are super important and valuable which will help a lot in the future. In the meantime, look around at courses etc (there's plenty free online like Coursera) to explore your interests. Hope you find something that works out for you.

You may not know what jobs are right, mainly because there are no perfect jobs, but you'd know the kinds that you don't qualify for, or is a complete clash with your interests.

See the world and recognize that your situation is only so minute compared to what the world is. Be afraid. Take risks. Get out of your comfort zone and broaden your horizon.

Just wondering, what did you decide to do in the end?', 'Thank you for your kind reply!\n\nI am having troubles with letting go and delegating work.

We want to know what we're getting ourselves into and be prepared to take care of it the best we can. If anyone has any experience, can you share?

Background: we've already passed background checks for the adoption, and we were asked to choose from a few cats from the cattery. We are choosing between a healthy fat cat, and a skinny cat with potential skin/fur or other health problems.

We need more cat owners like you. \n\nYouth would be a factor to consider. A younger cat, even if there are superficial issues like skin / fur sensitivity, would have a better chance to heal and recover if they are given the right care from here on. Without the burden of past trauma, they’d also be more receptive to human handling since their behaviours are still quite malleable. \n\nTypically, getting them started on vet-prescribed hypoallergenic food and scheduling regular checkups will go a long way in re-setting their internal systems so they can have a near-normal quality of life. \n\nMore concerning would be the type of condition — especially if it’s chronic like kidney disease. Specialist care-related costs add up easily and the rigours of having to be responsible for maintaining their health would be the biggest mental mindblocks to overcome and would be emotionally draining. \n\nOne of my cats had irritable bowel syndrome. For a while he was throwing up two, three times a day. It took a month to figure out the problem and get the right diet in place. Cleaning up wasn’t the hard part, it was seeing how tough a time he had and the weight he lost because he couldn’t control how his body was reacting. But once we figured out the solution, he’s back to being fat. Of course he was banned from treats forever (ha) but like humans, occasional cheat days :) \n\nAnother of my cats require long-term fluids. Having to set up the IV and inserting the needle was traumatic at first, but we quickly got used to the routine. She’s thriving now, and I’ve learnt that cats pick up on our emotions and good intentions very well :)\n\nGood luck! You can do it.', ""Thanks!

151,sgtransitevolution,kcti0x,[Poly] [JC] Poly to JC AMA + Survival Guide,2020-12-14 16:02:30,SGExams,77662,9,154,"TLDR: If you miss mugging and hate projects, go JC.

[Each year, 400 to 500 students make the switch from JC to poly, while merely 50 to 60 students do the reverse.](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/education/switching-from-jc-to-polytechnic) Hence, those who may want to transfer from poly to JC may lack information on how to do so given how rare it is. Therefore, I'm starting an AMA for poly students who want to find out more about transferring to JC through the JAE. I will be replying to this thread until it eventually gets archived, and you can DM me your queries as well. But first, a few FAQs that I often received in my DMs, based on my experience. Do note that your transferring experience may differ from mine.

**How do you transfer from poly to JC?**

To start, let's split this process into two parts. Firstly, gaining admission to JC via JAE. Secondly, withdrawing from poly. Ideally, I recommend you to do it in order so that you won't be stuck in a place where you have no school to go to. You can also choose to forgo the second part and stay in JC and poly at the same time, but beyond a few weeks, attendance will tank, and you won't do well, of course.

Firstly, gaining admission to JC via JAE. Read page (iv) of the 2021 [JAE booklet](https://beta.moe.gov.sg/uploads/2021-JAE-Information-Booklet.pdf) for details on what exactly you should do, since your circumstances may be different from mine. For me, I took a few O-Level subjects as a private candidate, so I used my JAE PIN to log in. If you didn't take any subjects as a private candidate, you can still log in to the JAE system through SingPass, and apply using your previous year's O-Level subjects. If you are not applying through SingPass or didn't take O-Levels, the process is more tricky and beyond my scope of knowledge, so refer to the flowchart in the booklet above for more information. As for the JAE portal where you apply for your 12 choices, [this is likely how the portal will look.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lAUla41WVfcxOrNl1HTNMPCYoM7tDIfA/view?usp=sharing) Choose your schools pragmatically and realistically based on past-year JC cutoff points. I have been posted to poly in some previous year, so I cannot select any poly courses and can only choose between JC and ITE options.

Secondly, withdrawing from poly. Consult your poly mentor about it, as I believe the withdrawal process may be different depending on the school you are in. There will likely be a withdrawal form which you should fill in advance, and it probably requires your parents' signature. I recommend arranging your withdrawal meetup with your course mentor a few days after the start of orientation, once you are comfortable with your new environment. For me, the withdrawal process was quick and finished in only 20 minutes, where my mentor helped to complete some course counselling form to ensure that I am dropping out for the right reasons. I just had to submit the withdrawal form, a printed screenshot of the JAE posting SMS, and my poly access card and was gone for good. However, the process may be different depending on whichever faculty or polytechnic you are in, and your parents may need to come down, though my parents did not come to the school for my case.

**Is it worth it to transfer from poly to JC?**

Well, that depends on your situation. For me, I had no regrets, and it was worth it. There are a few reasons why you should, and the same goes to why you shouldn't.

**Projects**

Sure, H1 Project Work is still a compulsory subject in JC. However, there are way fewer projects to handle than in poly. The project hell season can get debilitating to cope with at times as you rush stuff before the deadlines. Much of the grade is not only determined by how hard you work but the groupmates you choose or are assigned to. If you are drained out about trying to carry groupmates, and prefer to get assessed the more meritocratic way, where your work and yours alone determine your grades, JC is undoubtedly a better way to go.

**Academics**

By transferring to JC, you will likely be widening the possible options for your university education. Your grades are decided once and for all by a high stakes examination, rather than your cumulative regular performances. If you are aiming for a competitive university course, this could be a less stressful way of handling things, as you know that typical screw-ups during your time in JC do not count in your final grade like in poly. You have that room for improvement and screwing up. Subject contents are taught in a more rigorous manner, which means that while you have to apply what you learn to a higher level in JC, you also get to be more familiar with such concepts. Since there is a strictly defined syllabus that is publicly available of [SEAB website](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-a-level/a-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2021) for you to look at, there may be fewer things to learn; you don't have to worry about learning beyond the syllabus since it will not be tested. From my experience in poly, some higher-level contents are often taught without understanding the fundamentals, making things overwhelming. This may mean that when you go to JC, some content may feel familiar, and some parts of a subject may, surprisingly, be easy for you.

**Money**

For me, the transfer was worth it because it saved my parents money, and it saved me time. Unless you as a poly student are aiming for RI, HCI, ACSI, or SJI, in which case school fees would be more expensive, the transfer from poly to JC would mean a much lower school fee, from [$250 a month](https://www.np.edu.sg/admissions/Pages/coursefees.aspx) to [$33 a month](https://www.moe.gov.sg/education/pre-university). That's a lot of money saved, and during this pandemic-induced financial crisis, it could lift a huge burden off your parent's shoulders if you are not on a bursary. If you are on a bursary, well, you likely wouldn't have to pay it back, fortunately.

**Time**

As for time saved, going to JC means that you will graduate from this education level about 4 months before your poly friends do. For boys, your NS deferment ends 4 months earlier (from April to December the previous year). Of course, they have a certificate that makes them employable, while you only have one for university, but if the goal is to get to university, it can be worth it. Naysayers will nag over the wasted $3000 you spent in poly, and that you took 1 additional year to finish JC education, but compared to your current situation, you might still be better off. If you have traditional Asian parents, well that may potentially be that one thing that they could brag about at the next reunion dinner.

**Environment**

It is worth acknowledging that, given the lower school fees, the JC environment will not be as excellent as what poly has to offer. There should be air-conditioning in your classrooms, so that is going to be a step up from secondary school, but your canteens will not have air-conditioning, which may be a factor which you should take note of since polytechnic food courts have such air-conditioning. For my JC, the library is much smaller than the one from my poly. It is probably unable to handle the large populations of students, and worse still, is currently closed off as a makeshift staff room for teachers, so there isn't a conducive, air-conditioned space to study.

**Commitment**

Of course, do not go into JC with the thinking that it is easier than in poly and you can slack off. I mean, teachers do chase after students for homework in JC, unlike in poly where you get worse grades. However, much of the non-tutorial work comes in optional revision sets. It is in your best interest to do them if you want to maintain a consistent, exemplary performance so that you will not struggle later on in your JC life, or risk being in the 5% of the cohort who retains, since you would've already ""retained"" once. Assuming you make full use of the JC experience, the mix of CCAs and other non-academic stuff like internships will keep you occupied during the much-shorter school holidays. Hence, there's a lot less time for you to pursue leisure during the holidays as compared to in poly, where you can easily find time to work and let your brain rot. 

**Readiness**

Finally, it would be best if you read through the syllabi of the subject combination you intend to take beforehand, to make sure you will enjoy what you will be studying so that you will not suffer in JC. Maybe leverage off the content you learn in poly, and take some subjects that have the content overlap, so that you have a more comfortable life coping with the JC curriculum. You should also ask yourself if you enjoy the JC kind of mugging and writing, and have the motivation to do consistently throughout these two years so that you will be better off than staying in poly. Otherwise, this transfer from poly to JC will probably not be worth it.

**I've spent one year in poly and forgot all my O-Levels stuff already. Can I still do well in JC?**

Yes, you can still do well in JC. For me, I've done pretty well in all my subjects for promotional examinations, with around half my subjects scoring As, and half my subjects scoring Bs – good enough for me to qualify for an H3 subject. Of course, I wouldn't know for sure until I get my A-Levels results, so I got to stay consistent with my studies. Anyways, even if you haven't touched your O-Levels fundamentals for a year, with enough effort, a consistent motivation to study, and a thoughtful selection of subject combinations, you can do well in JC. Just make sure you understand whatever that is taught by the time your tutorials finished so that you will not suffer later on as the content builds upon what was taught previously.

So, that's about it. If you have any further queries or want to seek any clarifications, make a comment below!",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/kcti0x/poly_jc_poly_to_jc_ama_survival_guide/,"[""Thanks for the post. Just want to clarify on the following snippet:\n\n>It is worth acknowledging that, given the lower school fees, the poly environment will not be as excellent as what JC has to offer.\n\nDid you mean something else?\n\nAdditionally, just wanted to ask, for you personally, other than money, what were the main factors that pushed you to consider JC instead? Was it because you didn't like the modules in poly?"", ""Thanks for creating this guide. I just want to offer an alternative perspective so that others may have a more balanced view. \n\n1. Money\n\nPoly school fees are more expensive than JC. However, after you factor in the cost of JC tuition for multiple A Level subjects, it's around the same price. Of course, there are individuals who do well in A-Levels without tuition but when the vast majority of your peers have tuition, you'll also want to get tuition so that you won't lose out. Also, if you do badly in your school's internal examinations or tests, your parents may force you to go for tuition. \n\n2. Academics\n\nWith syllabus changes, the A-Levels have become much more application based. From what I've heard, there's also a lot to mug/study/memorise. It's not unheard of for students to burn the midnight oil studying late, going to school and sleeping in class. Also, certain schools set their exam papers to be much higher than A-Level standard such that only a small percentage of the cohort will pass. When your parents see your report card, would they be shocked and be inclined to send you for tuition?\n\n3. Environment\n\nYeah, the variety of food available in the polys cannot be compared to a JC. This is even more so if you have dietary restrictions. \n\n4. Misc\n\nFor students in poly that want to transfer to JC, let me ask you a few questions. \n\n>Do you want to go back to wearing a school uniform for 2 years?  \n>  \n>Do you want to go back to waking up at 6am or earlier everyday to get to school on time?  \n>  \n>Do you want to get disciplined by the discipline master for things like not cutting your nails, not cutting your hair, not reaching school on time, modifying your uniform skirt/pants, etc.  \n>  \n>Will you get burnt out if you mug everyday?\n\nWhatever choice you make, don't go from poly to JC then back to poly again. Think through your decision carefully, weigh the pros and cons, talk to your school's Education and Career Guidance (ECG) counsellor, talk to current students in the school. \n\nThe grass is always greener on the other side."", 'Am I still eligible for Jae if I don’t drop out of poly cuz my lecturer says I have to drop out b4 applying for Jae . However when I called nyp they say I can wait till I have confirmed a place in jc then withdraw..', 'Hi, yeah I think I mistyped that, please switch the position of the texts “poly” and “JC” haha. Edited the main text.\n\nFor me personally money and time isn’t the main issue of course. The main issue is that I prefer the JC kind of rigour and examinations as compared with the poly kind of projects, and that’s very unlike the preferences of the people I know in poly.\n\nAlso, I realised that I am spending more time trying to understand JC content by reading the syllabus, than actually doing the work there is in poly. My favourite module in poly is a math module which isn’t even graded. Since my interest seemed out of place, may as well make it a reality and enrol into a JC and learn those stuff.\n\nAnd finally, in poly, you have to make things work, not just theoretically, but practically for your projects. This technical aspect of things kinda driven me insane during the second semester because of my university expectations, and I realise I cannot maximise my potential to go to my dream course if my grades are dependent on me fretting about such stuff. In JC, you just make sure your workings, reasoning and answer makes theoretical sense. That’s about it.', ""Hi, thanks for the reply! I do agree with the concerns of parents forcing people to go tuition at the sight of bad results, personally I suppose I'm quite fortunate to be able to perform well without tuition haha. In fact, I remember having tuition back in Sec 4 and due to conflicting information my results worsened from prelims to O-Levels. As for academics, would be wise to take subjects which have overlapping content knowledge with whatever you have in poly so as to reduce your workload. I do want to however add that no matter how application-based A-Levels is, the predictability of exam formats and tested content is definitely still way higher than whatever obscure projects or exams there is in poly.\n\nAs for the miscellaneous concerns, there'll indeed be a loss of freedom from poly to JC, though I believe if one is still thinking about going from poly to JC so many months in, the pros would largely outweigh the cons. Still, it will be wise to check on the various JCs as some are more strict on discipline than others.\n\nFor my school, there's been a relaxation of attire from full uniform to t-shirt attire due to the mandatory wearing of masks. Without mass assembly, school starts between 8-8:40 am, and being not far from home, I can comfortably wake up at 7 am and reach in time. The longest curricular school days in JC (8-5) are shorter than the longest curricular school days in poly (8-6) since lessons come in 1 hour chunks rather than 2-3 hours. When it comes to attire, discipline is laxer in most JCs than secondary schools so don't worry too much about such issues, though tardiness probably punished with detention. However, mugging everyday is definitely a legitimate concern, which any student who transfers from poly to JC must expect, since that's what they signed up for, of course.\n\nAnd yes, once you switch, there's no turning back. From what I heard from my poly mentor, if one transfers back from JC to poly, he'll/she'll have to pay the full non-subsidized international students course fee, which is $11,000 a month, even if he/she is a Singaporean. That won't be cheap."", 'Hi, you can still apply for JAE without dropping out of poly.

152,heartbrokenh95,gabwp0,Abortion in Singapore - 2020,2020-04-29 23:47:23,singapore,378641,381,3098,"Hi everyone, title says it all. I recently went through an abortion and I thought I'd write this down to pen down my thoughts and what I went through, and also to share this with women (and men even) who might be terrified and going through the same situation. **I'd like to clarify though, that I do not encourage abortion.** I'm just here to share the details on the whole procedure, should you have no other choice but to go for one. 

When I first found out I was pregnant, I was scared and confused. I immediately turned to online to seek for advice and to read up on stories and experiences of women who have went through abortion in Singapore. However abortion remains a taboo subject in Singapore and I couldn't find much information about the details of the procedure. I found some old stories on Reddit however, but most of these abortion posts are from years ago, and it made me wonder if the procedure is still the same now. I went ahead to the clinic not knowing what to expect. I was terrified. So here is my attempt at sharing my experience since this just happened today, and hopefully it'll benefit someone who has to go through this. 

I 99% confirmed my pregnancy on 18th April through a pregnancy test kit. My period has always been regular so when it was late for 4 days, I knew something was not right. I went down to the nearest 7-11 and bought a pregnancy kit (Predictor brand) and the result was a very very faint second line. It was so faint that I couldnt decide if it was just my imagination, or if it was really there. I prayed that it was just my imagination and went to sleep, hoping that I would wake up to my period. That did not happen, and I went down the next day to buy the Clearblue Digital Kit, which would tell me straight up if I was pregnant or not pregnant (so get this kit even tho it's slightlyyy more costly) No doubt, I was pregnant.

A long discussion happened between me and my partner. It was a very very painful and heartbreaking decision and for many nights I cried myself to sleep. 

During my first appointment, my gynae did an ultrasound and confirmed my pregnancy. Seeing that tiny dot on the screen broke my heart. I couldn't bear to look at the screen for more than a few seconds :( This circuit breaker also made everything tougher than it already was. My partner was not allowed into the clinic with me. I had to go through all of this alone but I guess in a way, it spared him some pain / heartbreak since he didn't get to see the ultrasound. The first appointment was a breeze. I was in the clinic for around 20 mins only. See the doctor, get an ultrasound, ask him any questions you have about the procedure, make payment and schedule my procedure. There was also some paperwork involved, I had to write down 3 lines: ""I wish to terminate this pregnancy. I do not want this pregnancy. I am aware of the risks involved."" Yikes.. :'( 

After payment, the nurse prescribed Misoprostol, a medication used to soften your cervix. I was told to take this 2 hours before my procedure so that my cervix would be ready for the surgery. (Side note: yes there are 2 types of abortion in Singapore, namely medical and surgical abortion. Medical abortion is where you rely on just pills to ""induce"" a miscarriage, but I've heard that it might be extremely painful, you will bleed alot, you might vomit and get chills, and since I stay with my family I didnt want to take this risk. There is also a risk that your uterus doesnt completely empty itself and you may then have to go back for surgical abortion again to vacumn everything out. Surgical abortion is done under sedation, and a vacumn is used to suck out the pregnancy sac. This would be way faster, and painless as well.) My procedure was scheduled for 2 days later at 930am. I was told to start fasting by 530am, and take misoprostol at 730am.

2 days later, (i.e this morning), I woke up at 7am and got ready. The pills were to be taken orally, placed under the tongue, and then i was to wait for it to be dissolved. It was tasteless, just very powdery and chalky. 30 mins after, I started developing a fever. I could feel my body burning up and I started trembling like maaaad. There were however no cramps and I was not bleeding as well. I got to the clinic at 9am and got my temperature taken. True enough I had a fever of 38.1 but they told me it was one of the side effects so it was ok. We made payment first before I was led to a room to put on a gown. This room had 3 beds in it and I believe it is for patients to rest in after the procedure. After changing into the gown, that was only when i felt the first gush of blood. 

I was then instructed to lie down on a bed while the nurse took my blood pressure and also monitored my heart rate through this clip on my finger. I could hear the machine beeping very fast because I was panicking so so bad, haha. I was also struggling to not cry and she must have sensed it because she was so reassuring. She then proceeded to prepare to inject the medicine into me through a butterfly needle to put me to sleep. Afterwards, I had zero recollection of what happened. It was around 940am when she injected the sedation meds into me, and when i woke up at 10am, i was already back in the resting room, lying on the bed with my belongings. No idea how i got back to the room, because while i was resting, i saw another girl being helped over by a nurse. I dont even remember walking back. Did they carry me?! No clue, but only 20 minutes had passed. I was a little groggy so i closed my eyes for another 5 mins before i got up to change and leave.

Reached the clinic at 9, left the clinic at 1015am, got home by 11am. Cramps were very very mild (I hope I dont jinx this), but I started bleeding. The bleeding however is very similar to period bleeding. I was also told to go back for a post-review 10 days later to make sure that my uterus is completely cleaned and there is no more pregnancy.

I paid $2,210 for everything and used $900 from medisave. 

I am still feeling very heartbroken and empty and I cant stand looking at myself in the mirror because i feel horrible. Sometimes I feel fine and try to understand why I made this decision, but sometimes I can't help to wonder about the what could have beens.

I hope this post helps anyone who has to go through an abortion. This has been the most traumatic experience in my life (emotionally) and I will remember it forever.

TL;DR - sharing my surgical abortion experience in Singapore.


EDIT: to clarify, we used contraception but there is no contraception that is 100% effective. my gynae has spoken to me more on the different types of contraceptives and their effectiveness, and I may consider an alternative method which is way more effective, but that will have to wait until I am fully recovered from the surgery. the most common contraceptive option used is still the male condom, but if you ever use it incorrectly, chances of the woman getting pregnant increases drastically. my gynae has recommended longer term options, such as a contraceptive implant, which is inserted under the arm to prevent ovulation. this lasts for 3 years. another alternative would be the IUD which is inserted into the uterus, this can last up till 5 years. 

**thank you everyone for reading and for your kind comments, and for standing up for me. I shared this in fear of attracting negative feedback but the support I've been receiving through both the comments & DMs have been overwhelming. thank you to all who have chosen to be kind in this trying period. i do not consider myself to be a heroine, just to clarify. going through an abortion is nothing to be proud of. the emotional torture that one has to go through - i wouldnt even wish this upon my worst enemy. this post is again, to give details on my abortion experience for anyone who may be online looking for help, advice or support, and to also remind all of us that there is no method of contraception that is 100% effective. low chance doesn't mean no chance, and especially if it's for a risk you're not prepared for, it's not worth taking.**

some people have also dm-ed me personally to share their stories and support and i appreciate that very much. please feel free to dm me if you need to talk, I'm all ears.


stay healthy always everyone. Just to reiterate - I do not encourage abortion. I just hope that if you're reading this and you are considering an abortion, please make sure you've given proper thought over it. At the end of the day, i just hope that you make a decision that you can live with. 

UPDATE - one month post procedure, even though there were feelings of relief, I've also been feeling a lot of self blame and guilt. And I wished I could have done things differently. This really explains why I said what I said in the paragraph directly above this.",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/gabwp0/abortion_in_singapore_2020/,"['Just wanted to provide more extra info I gained from personal experience. Hope you find it helpful.\n\nTo start, let\'s say you\'ve just tested positive and you\'re looking for a clinic. Be it private or public, some of them can be very very crowded. You may come in and tell them all your concerns and based on the information you give them, they may turn you down. From my experience, all they did was ask when my last period was and tell you to come back another day if the timeline doesn\'t seem too long.\n\n**DON\'T ACCEPT THIS. I REPEAT DONT ACCEPT THIS.**\n\nYou may experience implantation bleeding. And for those of you who frequently experience very light periods, you might think that this your normal period. But it\'s not. If they tell you to come back later, it might be too late for an abortion by then. Either that or the cost of the procedure will be much more expensive.\n\n**Always insist on an ultrasound**. And if they\'re too busy, try to find another clinic. Do not believe that everything is OK unless you get an ultrasound. I nearly suffered from this during my abortion. It is always better to be safe than sorry.\n\nAs additional info, not all gynaecologists provide abortion services. Make sure the one you\'re going to does this. If they have a website, check it out or give them a call before you head down.\n\n1. There are **hotlines available for emotional support**. However do take note that although some of them mention they provide 24-hour support, you are likely not gonna get any replies in the middle of the night\n2. Referring back to my previous point, **be aware of the hotlines stance on abortion** before you give them a call. Most of them offer ""teen pregnancy"" support rather than ""abortion"" support. Some of them may try to sway you to reconsider, and at a state when you are already so emotionally vulnerable, it can be very hard to be firm with your beliefs and choices.\n3. As much as you can, try to ensure you **have someone accompanying you** for the night, or at least someone to send you home. Most clinics will require someone to pick you up before you can leave. If you have no one to look for, try asking a hotline, or even a forum or just anyone else to accompany you. This may come off as bad advice to some, and I agree. But you\'re in a very vulnerable state. For some, the cramps make it difficult for you to even walk properly. At the very least, arrange for a cab to send you home.\n4. **Wear a pad. The heaviest duty one you can find.** Likely, the clinic will give you medication to dilate your cervix before the procedure and this can cause a lot of vaginal secretions. Before the procedure, change into a new pad. You\'re gonna bleed a lot so bring as many spare ones as you can.\n5. **Bring hot packs.** You\'re gonna have the worst cramps in your entire life after the procedure, trust me. Lay them on your stomach, to soothe the pain. Don\'t take any additional painkillers. Your surgeon is already likely to give you enough painkillers for the rest of the day. Any more than that can result in an overdose. It\'ll be very difficult, but you have to bear with the pain for your health\n6. After the procedure, regardless of your stance on abortion, **you will be an emotional wreck** for a long while. For most people, it lasts up to a month or even longer. **Inform the ones who love you,** if you know you can trust them. That way, they will know what to expect and will be more prepared to deal with you and support you. You can have mood swings, constant crying and be very easily irritable. This is normal, due to pregnancy hormones. Don\'t blame yourself for this.\n7. **Know who among your social circle to trust and who not to**. Please don\'t second guess. If you reveal your abortion to the wrong people, it can backfire. Even among your closest friends. I know it\'s so difficult because all you want is support and love. But being rejected or having insensitive remarks mentioned can feel a lot worse. It did for me. You\'re in such a vulnerable state, please take care of yourself and love yourself even though it\'s hard.\n8. If you are only using condoms, and especially if you have irregular periods, the doctor will probably recommend **birth control pills**. Although it will be pricey, it\'s more effective than condoms. Also, it will help to regulate your periods, making it easier for you to track. After the procedure, another missed period is equivalent to a heart attack due to the trauma. Save yourself the pain, if you can. The regulatory effects are very helpful.\n\nAs an additional note, I recommend you **install a period tracker** on your phone. Clue is a really good one ([https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clue.android&hl=en](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.clue.android&hl=en)).\n\n9. If you need any **information regarding the usage of the pills**, or what to do when you miss them, call the gynaecologist again. Don\'t bother going to a GP. Sadly, many GPs in Singapore are very traditional. They have less knowledge of the pill compared to the average nurse at a gynaecologist, from my experience. My GP did not even know what Yasmin (my birth control pill) was. Don\'t worry, the gynaecologist won\'t charge you for calling them to ask for advice. They will only tell you to come down if they are unable to assist you through your phone. If you need a recommendation on a good gynaecologist, you can dm me.\n\nFor those accompanying someone through their abortion.\n\n1. If there are a few of you, it might be better that **only one person accompanies** the one going through the abortion. Some clinics only allow for one person to be there at the end of the procedure. Don\'t take this the hard way, it\'s due to privacy reasons for the others in the clinic as well.\n2. **Get food and drinks**. I\'m not sure if it\'s common amongst people who get abortions, but I ate an entire regular pizza on my own (I usually have a small appetite). To add on, you have to fast 12 hours before the procedure (no food or water). Be prepared for big cravings.\n3. After the procedure, **please be there for them**. They\'ll be lying in a bed, in a world of pain. Hold their hand, stroke their hair. Offer tissues (and water/food). Let them know that they\'re loved. They\'re gonna need it.\n\nIf you have any more concerns, please **send me a dm**. If you prefer telegram, I\'ll give you my account as well. I have accompanied people on this sub through abortions when they had no one before. It\'s a very scary experience, and if you need someone who you can trust. I will do my best to help you as a bigger/younger sister.\n\nI won\'t tell you that everything will be fine. **It\'s gonna be rough**. Your partner could abandon you, or even worse insist on keeping the child. Your friends could turn on you. Your family could disown you. But know that you are not the only one experiencing this, and you don\'t have to experience this alone. There are support groups, or people willing to provide support online. And if you don\'t trust strangers, you can always see a counsellor you can trust.', ""Thank you for such an intimate sharing.

Her period came slightly later like 2 weeks later than usual, as the pill is known to mess up your hormone cycles. Thankfully there were no side effects e.g. mood swings/cramps. \n\nSingapore requires appointment to get the pills as they are to be used a maximum of twice a month. But apparently in Johor you can purchase them over the counter in bulk.

You can use medisave too. \n\nI'm just putting out here for people who may not have enough savings for a abortion as it's costly at private or maybe don't want to go the public hospital due to privacy or time sensitivity issue.\n\nDr Ben and his staff are really kind and just going to shsre my experience below:\n\n First consultation was really straight forward. He just ask - if this was planned or unplanned, he will go through how the abortion is going to be like and will pass you paper work to sign that you are aware that you terminating. \n\n(The OP clinic is a bit cruel to make her write the sentence down that you are aware of the abortion)   \n\nThe procedure day,  they bring you to a room to put your bag down and bring you to the procedure room. There is no need to change into gown as what i know the nurse would help you remove your pants or lift your skirt after inducing anaesthesia. By the time you woke up, it's done. I was just only a bit dizzy, but just rest for 10 mins in the resting room and i went to meet a friend who help me back home. \n\nI was suppose to go back after 2 weeks for the post check up but wasn't able to make it as i was doing contract work and not able get a leave. \n\nI hope this help for anyone who needs a 2nd option🤗"", ""I hope that all will be well for you.

It's really important to have at least someone you trust to know of the process so there's one person at least for you to fall back on when you need the emotional support. \n\nIf anyone is interested, my first abortion was through the private route and I went to one of the clinic in Mount E. Everything was really fast and smooth but the anesthesia they provided were very strong and I was in a delirious state for most of the day. \n\nSecond time I did it in KK but there was a waiting time of 3 weeks before my surgery, so do take note and not to drag it out too long if you're going for this route. I felt very comfortable and assured throughout as well and the drug eased off before I left the hospital. \n\nPsychologically because my second abortion was done on my birthday I cannot and probably will not be able I celebrate it without a hint of grieve and emptiness. \n\nPhysically it's definitely fucked my body up a lot and it took me almost two years before my period was back. Mentally I've developed Bulimia turned Binge Eating around the time of the second pregnancy and am still in recovery and although I don't think it was because of the abortion, it definitely led me into a downward spiral. \n\nPoint is, it's not just an abortion.

I remember I was made to sit in a room and watch a video of a woman looking at children playing at a playground feeling sad because she aborted her child, who could've been x years by now. That... Was the most painful part of the whole abortion process.\n\nI married my boyfriend at 21. Had a baby at 22. Moved in to our own home at 24.

Although it's tempting to get your regular dose of the pill from cheaper countries like Malaysia and Bangkok, I strongly advise AGAINST it. It's very important to have a professional follow up on your body changes, and advice accordingly. You'll have to hunt around for a doctor you are comfortable with, at a clinic that is convenient for you to go to, at a price point that you're OK with and you might have to go through 5 or even more gynaes before you find your one, suitable for you and you only. Someone else who doesn't judge your life choices, and knows your requirements and can follow up on your history, so do not give up if the first few you go to are sucky or make you feel shitty with certain things that they say, and because of that, you make bad or ill-advised choices that are going to affect your body. I repeat, DO NOT TRY TO SELF MEDICATE AND BUY CHEAPER MORNING AFTER OR BIRTH CONTROL PILLS FROM OUR NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES, OR ONLINE. Sometimes your body changes and with no professional doctor to help you keep track and monitor, you could cause yourself more harm in the long run. And DO NOT GIVE UP if the first few doctors are not suitable. \n\nHaving said that, I haven't found my good gynae either, although I had my share of enough cold, insensitive or judgemental doctors that make me feel bad about myself and not want to see another doctor again.

154,send-helo,gob6yn,[poly] should I transfer poly to jc,2020-05-22 10:55:22,SGExams,77662,21,9,I’m currently a year one student in poly and I’m feeling a lot of stress and end up breaking down when I’m think about it. I feel that maybe the course in poly wasn’t to my interest and also I personally feel that I the Teachers in poly wasn’t giving me enough support compared to my secondary school. I also find that I prefer an more disciplined structure. But I don’t think I can enter a jc as my l1r5 was 22 and I just missed the registration for o level private candidate this year so I’m really lost and not sure what to do now. Really appreciate if anyone could give me some advice.,0.91,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gob6yn/poly_should_i_transfer_poly_to_jc/,"['Honestly if you’re stressed with poly, its not advisable to go to JC. JC isn’t simply a higher level of secondary school. In jc, you’ll feel stress like no other, the pressure is immense with little to no time to study as its a 3 year syllabus squashed into 2 years. I’d recommend going to other polytechnics to see their teaching style.\n\nAnd not even trying to be elitist here but when I was in jc, many were craving to go to poly due to many of our friends there having a much more enjoyable time. It was commonly understood that jc was much more stressful that poly among us. (Based on my experiences lah, don’t know if others are different)', 'Hi, I did both A’levels and Diploma and this is my take on both curriculum. I can only speak for my own experience that could help you with your decision \n\nHonestly, I think you feel very overwhelmed due to the lack of hand holding and guidance in Poly compared to secondary school. They tend to give the student more space to solve their projects/problems themselves. Especially during this Covid-19 where you barely meet your lecturer or your peers so there isn’t much communication to go about doing projects and all. Quite tough. This is not really the case in JC though because classes are still structured and we still do basic normal studying rather than projects. So there is more pen and paper work and it’s more direct? I guess? That’s how I felt ah.\n\nHowever, A’levels was stressful compared to poly I’m not gonna lie. Especially A’levels period ard August? Because you wouldn’t know how good you are compared to other schools, it’s very similar to O’levels but the bell curve and the way they would manipulate the questions goodness.... and everyday was 7am-5pm which is similar to secondary school and due to the lack of time, they tend to cram something new into your brain everyday. Very hard to digest and absorb unless you straight away study when you get home. But I enjoyed my time there because it was like a familiarity kind of thing, it has the same culture as secondary school. Just academic wise was taxing. \n\nIn Poly, it’s more relaxed regarding school and study schedule. The final gpa is also an accumulated type so if you did badly for one sem you can work hard for another sem etc etc and for projects and tutorials, try to ask your seniors or peers from other class for help to clear your doubts. It’ll really help. I know it’s quite tough since you haven’t met anyone at all but if it’s possible, that’ll really help a lot.\n\nUltimately, I feel you should do which ever you feel is more appropriate for your working style.', 'I am a student who transferred from poly to JC this year. For me, the way JC works is easier than poly because instead of projects and all the bells and whistles associated with having one, it’s purely academic. I mean, besides H1 Project Work. I wasn’t doing terribly in my Os anyway (even before private candidate) so I cope well.\n\nBut I wouldn’t recommend you to transfer at this point because you won’t be able to qualify, given that the private candidate registration season is over. JC is like O levels on steroids so if you are already struggling with Os, As will really be the end of you. You can’t graduate into a uni, you will end up in the poly, once again. Just do your best and make poly work, embrace the project culture and all the best.', 'u could try changing poly? different poly has diff teaching styles. im in rp and im kinda enjoying the way the plan out lessons like lessons are not too long and there are sufficient breaks given. it might vary for diff courses tho.', ""You can appeal for registration even if you have missed the deadline.

My typical routine would be finish school, go library, clear homework, have dinner, go back home and sleep, rinse and repeat. Even on days we don’t have much homework, we would just do ahead knowing that in the near future there would be so much work we won’t be able to cope, so might as well do more during less busy periods.\n\nAnd as said before, comparing to those in poly during my batch (basically last year), those in jc are much more busy and stressed out (due to the sheer amount of Us and Ss) to the point where my poly friends would constantly rub it in our faces telling us we should have went to poly instead of jc. And I was fairing much better than them during Os (sec school is nothing compared to jc)\n\nDo yourself a favour, don’t go to jc. Find another poly thats more suitable.', ""Perhaps you can book an appointment with your poly's counsellor? Here's [NYP's counselling](https://www.nyp.edu.sg/about-nyp/nyp-support-centre-and-services/student-support/counselling.html). Like what many others have said, JC is much more stressful than poly. It's quite common to fail the internal exams in JC so that might cause you more stress. I feel that the fact that poly makes everything count prepares you for university where the system is similar to poly. Also, the many projects that you will do in poly improves your communication and interpersonal skills that will be valuable for your career."", 'Was from the A’levels path. Finished A’levels didn’t get into a local Uni so took a gap year and went to take Diploma. \n\nFor poly, I would advice that try to get help from your peers and seniors. Especially seniors because they’ve done the assignments and all. They would know what the lecturer are expecting and all and peers of different lecturer also would help because some lecturer give out extra information and extra stuff for the students. That’s how I usually do the project, it was soooo much easier this way. I only started socialising in Y2 so my Y1 was a struggle. Another advice is that if you feel very overwhelmed with assignments, focus on one and once it’s done, then focus on the next one. You can take a break in between the first task and second task also. My friends tend to look at everything and say they dk where to start and start abit at each assignment then they would say they get overwhelmed bcos it looks a lot. But if you focus on one and finish one first, your mind would be more at peace I feel because you don’t have to think of the other thing for that moment. This works for me but you can try it also! \n\nAs for JC, my advice would be when studying its much better when you understand deeply what about the questions/topic like really deeply like how much they change the qns you’d still be able to do. They will manipulate the question until you will think you never learn this before but actually you’ve learned it before hahaha if that makes sense. And best to absorb and digest everyday after school because if it’s any later sometimes it gets confusing and overwhelming. A lot of information to take in daily. If you don’t understand then maybe you can ask your peers for help. If you need consultation or what, then just book your Teachers. My Teachers like to have a group consultation instead where we already ask each other and all of us dk. Similar to secondary school, just don’t be late, don’t skip class and hand up your assignments on time. My school was very particular on these things and there were students who were put on suspension bcos of it lmao.\n\nHope this helps!', 'Thank you so muchhhh for sharing :)']"

I used to have a job in Marketing but I left it for freelancing. Now I’m actually tired of this monotonous job and I really want to be a Barista as I am quite interested in coffee making. I look at it as an ART *(I watch videos regularly on coffee and barista skills!)*

I know some might say I am too old for it, but I don't really mind.

I would like to know how to get started with being a Barista. I have looked at some Barista courses but they all seem too expensive.

Is there a way to start an apprenticeship in a cafe? **I don't even care if they don't pay me** at the start but I would really really appreciate some pointers!

I really want to pursue coffee-making and excel in it, with the hopes of opening a cafe one day, but that is, of course, after I have become a coffee connoisseur. *(will take years)*

I am aware that being a barista is a tough job that requires people’s skills, multi-tasking, and have to work under pressure but I am sure I can tackle this.

Any advice, please! Have any of the Redditors here left their 9-5 job to be a barista or something else?

If the place you've ended up in isn't able to give you a good explanation on those stuffs, it will be up to you to google and explore those on you own.\nThings like coming in a little earlier to calibrate the coffee helps a lot as you'll get to think a lot longer on how the grinder and espresso machine works.

SINGAPORE: Unhappy at his son-in-law for cheating on his daughter and forcing him out of the company, a man took a knife to meet the younger man and stabbed him in broad daylight at a coffee shop, later telling passers-by not to help him but let him die.

Tan Nam Seng, now 72, pleaded guilty on Thursday (Aug 20) to one count of culpable homicide not amounting to murder by stabbing 38-year-old Spencer Tuppani at 121 Telok Ayer Street in July 2017.

Tan was suffering from major depressive disorder at the time, ruminating overwhelmingly about the well-being of his daughter and having his mental responsibility for the killing significantly impaired, the prosecution said.

The court heard that Tan was semi-retired at the time of the offence. He had founded a port management services company TNS Shipping in 1974 and expanded it over the years in a family-run business that saw his three daughters working for him.

After Mr Tuppani married Tan's eldest daughter in 2005, he began working for Tan as well in one of the companies. 

The company did not perform well for four years from 2012, and when business improved in 2016, Mr Tuppani suggested selling it to a bigger corporation. Tan left the sale to his son-in-law as he was contemplating retirement.

Leading up to the sale, Mr Tuppani persuaded some of the shareholders including his wife and the accused to assign their shares to him to boost his stake in the company, so the buyer of the company would not have control of it.

They agreed and the sale went through, with Mr Tuppani appointed CEO of the firm in December 2016. However, Tan was unhappy as he received only about S$450,000 from the sale of his shares.

**VICTIM HAD AFFAIR WITH ANOTHER WOMAN, HAD TWO KIDS WITH HER**

In early 2017, his daughter found out that Mr Tuppani had been having an affair with another woman and had two children from the affair. Mr Tuppani had three other kids with Tan's daughter.

They agreed to get a divorce, but still lived together in the same household as Tan, frequently quarrelling over issues linked to the split.

Subsequent events led Tan to believe that Mr Tuppani was planning to cheat him of his business, by divorcing his daughter after taking control of all the shares.

He began feeling miserable, ruminating excessively about his son-in-law's actions and was unable to sleep at night, said Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Jian Yi.

At around lunchtime on Jul 10, 2017, Tan went to the company's office at Cecil Court, and saw Mr Tuppani having a meal at a coffee shop at 121 Telok Ayer Street as he was driving past.

Angry that his son-in-law had been ignoring and avoiding his attempts to discuss business matters, which he considered disrespectful, Tan decided to confront the younger man.

He was shown in closed-circuit television footage, played in court on Thursday, entering the office and rummaging around in the pantry before retrieving a knife which he kept in his sling bag.

**THE STABBING**

He went to the coffee shop, where his son-in-law was having lunch with three friends. After Mr Tuppani greeted him, Tan confronted the younger man and said in Hokkien: ""You are too much.""

Tan swiftly took out the 22cm-long knife from his bag and stabbed Mr Tuppani three times in quick succession, as seen in clips played in court. His daughter was in the public gallery, dressed in black.

Mr Tuppani ran towards Boon Tat Street while pursued by his father-in-law. He was shown stumbling and getting up along a shop before collapsing.   


Tan appeared soon after and stood over him. He stopped employees of the restaurant where his son-in-law had collapsed in front of, from helping the victim.

He pushed them away, saying: ""This is my son-in-law, don't help him, let him die.""

The passers-by were shown walking away, and when other passers-by tried to help, Tan told them to ""stay away"", saying: ""He has come here to die"" and ""I wish to kill him"".

Tan was shown kicking his son-in-law's face twice as Mr Tuppani lay on the floor, before waiting for the police to arrive.

While waiting, he called his daughter and told her he had stabbed the younger man thrice.

He said: ""I can't sleep at night. I have done it. I have killed him. Don't cry. I am old already. I am not scared (of) going to jail.""

His daughter cried over the phone and told her father not to do anything, but Tan replied: ""What's done cannot be undone.""

**ACCUSED WAS SUFFERING FROM MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER** 

The police arrived shortly after the stabbing and found Tan sitting calmly on a chair outside the restaurant with a blood-stained knife on a tray nearby and the victim lying motionless on the floor.

Tan told the police where the knife was and pointed to the victim, and said he had used the weapon on his son-in-law.

The victim was taken to hospital and pronounced dead soon after. Tan told the police in the car that he was unhappy with how the victim had mistreated his daughter, and added that he had tried approaching the victim a few times to sort things out, but things had not changed.

An autopsy found three stab wounds on the victim's shoulder and chest, with the cause of death certified as a perforating stab wound.

Tan was examined at the Institute of Mental Health and found to be suffering from major depressive disorder. At the time of the offence, he was experiencing a major depressive episode.

""The accused’s pervasive dysphoric state, diminished ability to concentrate, negative cognition of helplessness, as well as overwhelming ruminations and worries about the well-being of his daughters would have adversely affected his impulse control and judgment at the time of the alleged offence, and significantly impaired his mental responsibility for the alleged murder,"" said the IMH report.

Tan, who had lost a lot of weight since his charge for the original offence of murder three years ago, is represented by lawyer Wee Pan Lee.

The prosecution asked for an adjournment to prepare more submissions for sentencing, and was granted one.

Both sides will return at a later date for sentencing.

For culpable homicide not amounting to murder, Tan could be jailed for life. He cannot be caned as he is above 50.

They were watching a comedy at the time, and laughed out loud. At the time, they heard a laughter that they didn't recognize. The guys kinda acknowledged each other and turned up the volume. My colleague said he got the feeling that they offended whatever was there with them, because a piece of paper that was behind them flew right up into the air.\n\n* In the corner is a fairly big room for resting. Multiple people have said that they woke up to see that either the table and/or chair has been placed to face them. They seem quite convinced that it wasn't the other firefighters messing with them.\n\n* There is a training/server room, and some of the guys have a habit of switching off the lights to save electricity.

Since then, I've told my guys to leave the light on at night. The worst part of the layout is there is another dormitory, and depending on which bed you slept in and the direction you faced, you could be looking straight at the server room door. \n\n___\n\nFP2:\n\nThere is a corridor located right behind FP2's front desk, separated by a wall.

161,bloopwhatisthis,kars3h,[Jobs] Giving of Examples During Job Interviews,2020-12-11 08:42:11,SGExams,77662,4,233,"Update: Thank you everyone for the overwhelming support. I did not expect this to get so popular but this only makes me more certain that there is a need for more discussion knowledge with regards to jobs related topics! I'll be penning down more random thoughts of mine jobs wise in near future! 

Hello my fellow redditors (again!) I've noticed that there has been many posts on career advices, career paths, career interests, specialisations so far but there has not been as many discussion/posts with regards to job interviews.

***Imagine this.*** You've studied hard, studied smart, burnt all that midnight oil, squeezed every bit of brain juice out of you to achieve your final grades and graduate. And then what? You start looking for jobs and you realise that it is not straight forward as you imagine it to be. That there are no model answers for you to refer to when it comes to your job interview.

The question then is how do you sell yourself to a potential employer and make them really see what you are worth? Imagine that you are a good plate of Nasi Lemak. You know you are really delicious and yummy and people would love you. BUT people are not flocking to eat you not because you taste awful, but because you've not packaged yourself to the best of your true potential. With the right packaging, you could be a $15 restaurant quality Nasi Lemak and stand out from the rest of your Nasi Lemak peers who are averaging $3-$5.

That is what I'm trying to raise awareness about with my series of random jobs related post. And today I'm sharing something basic that most of you would have heard/know of but often forget to apply in job interviews.

When applying for jobs, you **NEED** to give examples if you can; it's one thing saying ""I would do ..."" but it's much more impactful to say ""I did ..."". (**think about it: would you prefer to board the plane being helmed by someone who would fly it vs someone who did fly it before?**)

Using this simple technique, your job interview hit rates have just been given a boost (Hooray?)

I'm not saying this is a magical one-stop-solution, but it may help if you've been finding that you haven't been having much success so far.

A simple template to use could be **C.A.R (CONTEXT-  ACTION - RESULT)** or **S.T.A.R (SITUATION - TASK - ACTION - RESULT)**

Now let's see an example.

>Question: ""What is your approach to dealing with conflict resolution?""  
>  
>Answer:  
>  
>**Context**: ""Working as a  student receptionist at my school's office after classes, I recall a time where a student came in really aggressive and angry because his school fees was not processed on time.""  
>  
>**Action**: ""I looked into the situation, and found that he needed to provide xyz, and explained how to do so.""  
>  
>**Result**: ""The student left happy, came back with the right documents and was happy knowing his payment would be processed correctly this time."".

This works just as well in applications, as the interview itself.

Follow the advice above - figure out what skills and life experiences you have that would make you an excellent engineer/analyst/graphics designer/writer/doctor/teacher/any role you are applying for really.

Also, do a search on the common interview questions for said position - after looking at a few lists, you should get a pretty general sense of what you might be asked. They might also ask you to tell them about yourself, or what are your greatest strengths / weaknesses or other universal questions.

Write out the answers

***Memorize, memorize, memorize and/or practice, practice, practice***

With maybe 10-15 good ""answers"" ingrained in you, you should be in pretty good shape to answer most things that get thrown at you. If the question doesn't quite match your answer, then rephrase it and answer your question accordingly. Adaptation is the key here.

Figure out several good questions to ask the interviewer and memorize those too, and you should be good to go. (This is another post for another day!)

Don't forget to know at least a little bit about what the company does, and what sorts of things you might be expected to do and who would you be interacting with on a daily basis.

Also, treat it like a first date - you are clean, well groomed, wearing appropriate clothing (dress up a notch if in doubt), be polite and on your best behavior. Relate, if possible, to the interviewer.

Otherwise, it is usually just a conversation - they ask questions, you answer, then you will get a chance to ask a few questions too.

Disclaimer: I am not a professional career coach nor do I make money from this. A lot of this is from my personal experience/observations so far in my career that I have found incredibly helpful for me. Coming as an average student (barely average admittedly), I had to find ways to market myself better than the others and get the attention of employers.

162,p0lymerasechainrxn,j7uyz0,[Rant] Withdrawing from JC might be my biggest regret,2020-10-09 15:59:59,SGExams,77662,20,282,"
This is going to be all over the place because, well, I am all over the place as well ha so I apologise for any brain cells that you may lose after reading my rant. 

Basically, I withdrew from jc just weeks in, without giving myself time to adjust and let fear drive me away. I’m in poly now, just floating in a sea inferiority. 

Poly life for me is like drinking lukewarm water. The difficult and stressful times are then like eating something so spicy you don’t taste anything anymore. All you feel is your tongue burning, no flavor, nothing, just a one dimensional feeling. That’s it. That’s all I’ve been feeling for the past three semesters and there’s no in between.

I’ve come to realise that in poly I haven’t gotten the chance to actually fully spread my wings and take that leap of faith to try and fly, and to be very honest, I don’t think I ever will. Sure, if I can’t try to fly then I probably won’t ever fall and land on my face but is that really what I want? Do I really just want to stay stagnant and not grow from failure? (Sounds ironic because I guess you could say this whole rant describes my one big failure.) My journey in poly is half over and yet I still feel unfulfilled academically and holistically. I can’t seem to find any opportunities to grow and develop myself into a better me or push me to be the best version of myself which was readily available in the jc I was in. In addition, despite paying 1.5k a semester, I also feel like the resources we get are lacking more often than not. I feel so insecure even when poly is supposed to be more specialised in the sense that you learn stuff about the field you’ve chosen a lot more in depth than you could’ve in jc. But nope. I feel like everything single thing I learn is so haphazard and incomplete. It’s like yeah we may know a lot but it’s all surface knowledge and definitely not enough to fully grasp or internalise the concepts. 

I always tell myself that hey you left jc to pursue something you wanted.(In hindsight, something I thought I wanted.) But, as explained above, yeah that’s just to make myself feel better. I honestly do not know if what I’ve learnt and will be learning in poly is worth missing out on all the other stuff I would’ve learnt if I stayed in jc. I also know deep down that the real reason I left was because I was terrified. I was a wuss who ran away the first chance I got. 

Also, no, I am in no way looking down on my fellow poly kids. Y’all are like amazing having to go through tons of submissions every semester no matter which school and course you’re in and especially last semester given HBL. Not to mention that whole cumulative gpa shit. One mishap and were basically dead. Screw anyone who tries to belittle you when you talk about how stressed you are and some elitist jc imbecile goes oh you haven’t experienced real stress because you aren’t taking A levels. 

I’m feeling all this just because I happened to see all my jc friends celebrating their grad day today. It’s like a reminder: hey this is what you could’ve experienced, what you would’ve experienced if you stood your ground, bit the bullet and stayed in jc. This was the community you could’ve been part of. This was the experience you deprived yourself of by running away. I wouldn’t say it’s fomo but fomo amplified exponentially. Every story I see of my jc friends is a constant reminder of everything I’ve missed out on just because I was scared in the beginning. All these experiences I’ve witnessed, both the good and the bad, I’ve never and probably will never experience where I am now and that sucks. Sure I have friends and I am so grateful for them. But they’re neither the kind of friends I had back in secondary school nor the type of friends I made in jc or those my friends have made. Seeing them sticking it out through thick and thin together makes me so glad that my friends are lucky enough to have such a strong support system that A levels have nothing on but also it makes me feel so regretful that that was the kind of community I gave up when I left my jc because no such system exists where I am now. The journey I’m going through in poly feels like a very lonely battle that I have to fight on my own without anyone to back me up or anyone to rely on. It gets kinda lonely. With all that, sometimes I just go: damn I really missed out on a lot huh. Of course, the grass is always greener on the other side but I really can’t help but feel this way. 

It probably sounds like I’m being a little bitch and complaining like a child. I can see that yes I understand so I’m not usually like this. It’s been months which is why I’d like to think I’ve gotten over everything and am only looking forward. It rarely rains I guess. I really kinda do feel dead inside. However, when it does rain, it pours. 

I know there’s no one else to blame but myself. I know that it’s no one else’s fault but my own. And I also know no one is harder on me about all this than myself which sucks. It really does suck that I beat myself up over and over again about the same thing even when it’s been months. I, more than anyone else, would like to just put everything that’s happened in the past but I can’t seem to. I try my very best to shove all these feelings down my throat and swallow it but ever so often I just throw it all back up, making a huge mess that I have to clean up. It’s one endless vicious cycle that I can’t escape. 

One good thing that came out from all of this is that when I realised I may have made a mistake, I tried to rectify it. Although that mistake wasn’t actually rectified, I take comfort in the fact that I already did try my best so no regrets about that. When I tell myself that however, it eventually leads to my brain saying well if you think about it you wouldn’t have had to rectify your mistake if you didn’t make the mistake in the first place. And we’re back to square one. 

As of now, I’d say withdrawing from jc might be my biggest regret. It has created such an overwhelming sense of inferiority in me that will probably follow me for the rest of my life. Praying and hoping that one day I get over it. 

So yeah that’s about it.

Nonetheless, to all J2s, happy grad! 🥳 All the best for As! Y’all got this💪🏼",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j7uyz0/rant_withdrawing_from_jc_might_be_my_biggest/,"['Just my input but jc life isn’t as pleasant? Or tight knit as it seems.

You have to learn to grow up and be independent in your learning. No one's going to give you reminders. \n\nYour mistake is not that you went to an institute that is seemingly less cognitively demanding than JC. Your mistake is your refusal to take ownership of your owm learning and blaming it on the learning institute itself.

In that, you're not really missing out. Instead, people go to JC to go to University. A JC degree isn't as useful as a poly one for work.\n\nSo, think about it this way. As long as you're not taking a course in a field you don't want to work in(taking engineering when you want food science or medicine), and you get to university, you're pretty much starting ahead of other JCians(except for studying 1 more year i think). That said it's harder to get to University, but I heard the gov. is opening it up to more poly ppl. While you may be learning substandard stuff there, i'm learning practically non-useful stuff(bordering on useless for what i want to do in the future) here. Uni is where it's at, is my view. So get there.\n\nAnd you have the time to self-study, unlike me which is 11 days to A level practical, so go study something on your own time like game design if you wanna be a game designer. You got some options. \n\nI went to JC because i wanted to go Uni(and didn't know what i wanted to do). But you can too, just get to the top of the class.\n\nAnd about friends, while we may go through tough exams together, we only have 2 years together.

Long story short, I have about 40k to invest (all other emergency funds and savings settled aside). I want to quickly put this lump sum into investments since I feel that I have missed out on doing this earlier having worked for 3 years already.

I have no intention in picking out individual stocks (no time or interest) and want to focus primarily on ETFs. Right now after reading up a lot, my intention is to spread this 40k into various ETF, and then continue to invest regularly (DCA) with my income. Still a lot of research to be done on which ETFs...

166,tofucatmeow,i2u9n3,Help with mum's hoarding problem,2020-08-03 17:54:07,singapore,378641,56,92,"Hi, my first time posting in this reddit so please delete if this isn't allowed. I did a search, and 4 years ago someone posted about [her mum's hoarding problem](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/3oqafn/daughter_of_a_hoarder/) and it sounds vaguely similar to my situation now. To give some background, my father and brother both passed away one after another within a span of a few years some years back. Since then, it's only left with my mother and I. Suddenly I was forced to become the breadwinner of the family and I was still barely a teen. After graduating from uni, I left to work overseas for a couple of years. But due to this pandemic, I decided to quit my job and now I'm finally back in Singapore. I had only came back to visit my mum once for a short period of time during those couple of years working abroad.

It has been 3 years since I last visited. Now that I am back, I am in shock of how much junk has piled up in the house. Before my father's and brother's death, she already had the tendency to cling onto stuff (e.g. keeping ""nice-looking"" boxes or bottles). But I think bereavement has triggered her hoarding tendencies to go into full force... She has kept a portion of my brother's belongings (e.g. bike, toys, cpu chassis), tables that my father used to use... and also stuff from my childhood (collections of all sorts like erasers, lettersets, notepads that I no longer want or need)... She also has a tons of clothes and other junk like empty boxes just piling up in the bedroom. She barely cooks and eats poorly, and doesn't do basic cleaning of the house (you can see dust on surfaces, hair on the floor etc)...

I am desperate to get rid of all these things and other furniture lying around that we no longer need/use (e.g. old piano). I don't mind just throwing them away but that isn't feasible since they are bulky items. I looked online and it costs quite a bit of money to get bulky items disposed of. I also can't do it alone and have no other friends or anyone to help me with the disposal and moving of heavy items. The house also isn't in good shape (e.g. she has to put plastic tape over the electrical switch so you won't get electrocuted when you touch it, the bedroom wall where the air con is supposed to be fitted is falling apart so rain seeps in, the kitchen cabinets are all yellowed and falling apart too..).

We are in a pretty bad shape financially since she has been unemployed and doesn't seem fit to work as she has underlying health conditions (diabetes, high blood pressure - taking medication for both)... Since I just returned to Singapore, I have not started looking for a job either. Part of why I worked abroad was I couldn't find a suitable job in Singapore. Before I left I had only worked for short periods of time, mostly as a part-timer.

I feel so overwhelmed right now. I am overwhelmed with guilt mostly because I neglected my mum for so long.. but I simply couldn't deal with living here after 2 close family members' deaths. I was close to her, but something in me snapped and I could not bring myself to communicate with my mum much anymore ever since. I just got back home yesterday and today I started cleaning this room but I cannot do it alone. I want to give us both a chance to start afresh but it is hard if our living condition is so horrible.

I guess my question is, are there any organisations or places I can reach to for help with my mum's hoarding problem? Do you know of any junk disposal service for hoarders or any cheap bulk item disposal service? Also, does anyone know who should I contact to repair that leaking wall in the bedroom? :( Please I need some support, tips, advice, etc!

At that point I\'ll probably call the bangla lorry to take and toss everything in the house.\n\nYou\'ll read advice (again might work in westerner dynamics but not ours in SEA) that it\'s a big no-no to help the hoarder clean, especially secretly. **Don\'t worry about them finding out because they won\'t ever find out**. I sent at least 10 car loads FULL of rubbish (Camry sized car, trunk filled to the max, backseat filled to roof and footwell area) to the recycling and rubbish pickup points - so he won\'t notice and it\'s impossible to get rid of that much junk at one shot if left to residential rubbish pickup.\n\nMy mom was scared to shit that he would find out, get angry and get violent because I threw away SO.

As you were out of her life for a while, start building up rapport with her. Help her open up, and let her know you’ll be there for her.\n\n3) Sorting this out can be tough, so go easy on yourself. There are volunteer groups who can help. Some tips to get going:\n\n-\tI suggest you start with immediate living areas, i.e the bedroom. Helps with a good night’s rest, and hopefully she can be motivated to continue after the improvement in living conditions.\n\n-\tYou can google for packing techniques. One suggestion as follows: 1) do a cursory sort by type (books, clothes, etc), and sort into piles, 2) place these piles in the right place (ie pots should be in the kitchen), 3) discard damaged items with low emotional value (see below caveat). If possible, clear out bulky items. It’ll be an iterative process, so go easy on yourself. Marie Kondo’s techniques are helpful but only works if the individual is willing/able to participate.\n\n-\tDo not discard your dad/brother’s personal possessions, leave it aside. First help your mom process through her grief. One suggestion is for the both of you to process it together. Work through these items, honour their memories, and throw them when she finds closure. This will be emotionally exhausting, so do it on a good day and take it slow.\n\n-\tThere will be times where you’ll face resistance from mom. Don’t get worked up. Protect your own emotional well being and fight the battle another day. Pace with her, and be aggressive on days when she’s motivated. Go easy on days where she’s feeling challenged.\n\n-\tWhere possible, do a bit of “stealth throwing”, especially on items of low significance. You’ll need to exercise discretion on what is insignificance (to her). Leave the “stealth pile” aside for a few days, and gradually throw bit by bit.\n\nHope this helps, and good luck!

167,Bedok_Viewian,jucy1e,[n level] [o level] how we approach elective geog,2020-11-15 08:53:37,SGExams,77662,10,16,"What if I said, ""ei yo, screw making notes for geog, it's not an effective studying technique""

No, I am not insane/drunk/a psychopath. Hear me out

Disclaimer, the statement I claim is my view. With that said... 

Let me first ask, do you make notes by copy pasting the textbook content? Or do you make notes based on your understanding of the textbook?

If you're those who merely copy the textbook, then what is the difference between note and textbook? You might as well say that you copied the textbook, leaving out those pictures and questions in the textbook

Elective geog isn't simply memory work. Once you understand your content, all you need to do is to write out your answer based on what you understand, not memorised(except examples)

You're probably correct if your answer addresses the question. You might have heard of the term ""smoking"" and you can smoke for geog! As long your answer makes sense and addresses the question, there is nothing wrong with it 

Now, with that said, notes are useful **when** you're going to recap some topics that you might have forgotten

But hey, let's not forgot that geog isn't all about content, there's data analysis. Knowing what to write when describing/comparing data is important

Oh before I end off, don't be scared to include examples or points not in the textbook in your essay. Geography isn't like maths or science where you get penalised because ""it ain't in syllabus"", in fact the paper explicitly stated in the cover page that candidates should use relevant examples. 
No, you're not going to be penalised if you write about Copenhagen conference or Paris accord instead of the usual kyoto protocol. No you're not going to be penalised if you used Split, Croatia as an example for how local communities feeling overwhelmed due to surge of tourism(game of thrones was filmed at Split). No you're not going to be penalised for using an old ass example like the year without a summer in 1816 where Mount tambora erupted and caused a volcanic winter(A decrease in global temperature by 0.5 to 0.7°C)",0.9,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jucy1e/n_level_o_level_how_we_approach_elective_geog/,"['Actually to me, I found note taking a bit useful because I can shorten points down for me to understand the textbook clearer and it forces me to read the textbook while doing notes. I can use these notes as a ""simplified guide"" whenever I try to test myself while refering to my notes.(I can even put in stuff that I wrote as corrections to allow me to take note and caution myself)Plus, it can act as my ""other textbook"" in case I lose my own one during Prelims and Os/As. \n\nHowever, I do agree though, it is not an effective study method and it should not be done ALONE as you need to apply the subject and you need to reinforce what you have learnt from the textbook. Really it is more about practicing rather than regurgitating.', 'Notes are useful as it allows me to organise my points and write it in my own words which makes it easier for me to understand. Notes are oso helpful as textbk might contain irrelevant stuff which are not required for u to write in exam. \n\nHowever, if u realised that u tend to spend alot of time doing notes or u simply just copy and paste from tb then i dun think u should make notes.', ""I think you might be doing notes wrong. But however like I told you a few hours ago, reading the syllabus document that is posted on the seab website. Always use acronyms to rmb your stuff. It's not say faster but you will be able to rmb it in the long term like mine for instruments.

You might have to read up by googling it up. Making notes is mostly for the night before the exam or the hour before the exam where you try to cram in everything you rmb"", 'Short and concise notes are my best friend. My geography teacher placed a huge emphasis on making notes. Yes, like what u said, we should not blindly copy word for word from the textbook. What I do is pick up keywords, understand and memorise. Lets take plate tectonic for example, we have to understand the process but it takes memory work as well. If I ask you tell me what is formed with O-C boundary and u forgotten, r u going to flip through the textbook and read through a whole paragraph of words or are u going to flip through ur notes to find the key points. Writing notes is a way of understanding,you can change the words and sentences to how u understand the concept. Hence,I am a strong believer that notes are important if it is *done correctly and effectively*. however, the truth is, many blindly copy their notes from textbooks which is saddening. \n\nThis is from an elective geog student who rely on good notes and getting almost full mark for my exams. \n\nBut it really boils down to how you study. Some people learn better in other ways. I agree with what @bedok_Viewian said about how geography is about understanding and the part about using relevant examples. Normally I use examples that I understand and well informed on. For example, 2019 hongkong riot instead of Haitai food crisis blah blah when it comes to political instability in tourism', 'I find that a lot of people I know merely copy the textbook, hence the creation of this thread', ""No, contrary to your belief, I DON'T make notes for geog AT ALL. Why? Because I find understanding and appreciating the content more important and meaningful than making notes\n\nMemorising is good but, imo, not the best way to approach geog. And heck I didn't memorise anything(but what I did was to appreciate geog) except examples for geography since sec 4 and geog really seem much more easier\n\nAlso how does reading the syllabus doc help you??? Lmao"", 'Also this thread is meant for those who make notes, aimlessly or those who are over dependant on their notes', ""Also oh god oh no no no no no no. Why would you burn the midnight oil.... That's arguably the most counter productive shit ever....\n\nAlso reading abt an example thoroughly isn't good enough. Examples ARE NOT your extra magic marks! Just because you know your example in depth doesn't make your geog essay a good geog essay lol. Elaboration is as important as your example"", ""You can study the night before you go to sleep. I didn't say to stay up all night. I just said that flipping through examples the hour before the exam may help somewhat."", ""Don't know about you but I wouldn't want to do my last and final geog recap the day before exam unless it is an afternoon paper""]"
168,BunnanasS,k9n4zo,[Poly] Which diploma is best suited for anatomical sciences?,2020-12-09 15:01:30,SGExams,77662,8,6,"Hi everyone! I really want to pursue a career in forensics or anatomy in the future and I’ve been quite overwhelmed with all the different applied science courses in poly.

To pursue a career in anatomical pathology in sg, I’m pretty sure we need to do a medical degree or a life sciences degree and then a vocational course by the various hospitals. But I was wondering if biomedical science is best suited for that path?

I understand that from biomed it is possible to study medicine in sg although I’m not really keen on studying medicine. If I wanted to pursue a career in pathology, would applied chemistry or pharmaceutical science be better since it is more specific in terms of immunology for pharm sci or would biomed be better since it’s more general? 

I’m already planning to put SP Biomed as my first choice but idk what to put for the others. I’m a bit unsure about NP Biomed since it’s more about bioinformatics and genetics while TP is Med Biotech. 

Seniors who are in Biomed/Pharm Sci/Applied Chem diplomas, could you share the job prospects and different paths for university education?

We do have a Forensic Biology elective doh but its a v minor module and it likely wont satisfy ur interest for forensics.\n\nBut for pathology, Biomedical pathology btw, not medical pathology, is something you will learn and touch on in SP\'s biomed. I believe NP does too. We go very in depth for immunology as well. \n\nIn terms of anatomy, we dont really study it much. That would be studied more by health and nutrition students i believe. \n\nFor job prospects, sadly speaking for Biomedical science diploma holders, u can only become ""test tube washer"", (its a joke la dont get offended) but we can only get to become lab assistants. Most likely if uw to pursue research and science you will need a PhD, if not at least a master\'s degree. Btw if u end up wanting to pursue medicine, lemme tell u it is so much harder to get into local and oversea med schools with diploma, best to do Alevels if ur pursuing medicine.\n\nBut with all these being said, SP recently changed Biomed\'s curriculum and from the looks of it, it doesnt seem to be focusing on immunology/pathology etc as much anymore because they want to train their students to be more practical (good with lab stuff), so you\'ll hardly touch on interesting research/theory stuff anymore.

169,snowtrumpet,jzjodv,[Junior College] Temasek JC and my experience,2020-11-23 23:29:38,SGExams,77662,8,77,"so I am quite new to this sub, but I was scrolling thru and saw [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jypcbo/junior_college_tjc_temasek_jc/) by u/cheapfoolscap on TJC so I thought maybe I can also share my experience in TJC, both the bad and the good. Feel free to ask anything by replying, or u can dm me.

this post is quite long but i did some signposting so hopefully its better

I'm a J1 (2020) student in TJC, taking PCME. I came from IP so this is from 5 yrs of experience haha

**My personal thoughts (differs for everyone but heres mine):**

The best part about TJC is probably the people. Everyone is in general nice and approachable. Absolutely no bullying or discrimination/xenophobia. Most of the teachers are also helpful and try their best to help. You'll usually do well or ok in TJC as long as u put in enough work. But the students call it TJail for a reason. you'll hear a lot of complaining from the people here. In short the school and some departments makes terrible decisions that no one likes, and stresses us out. some parts of tjc look so worn down like it has not been fixed since 1977. a lot of good teachers are also leaving the school. for legal reasons i cant list specifics but yeah.

**Here's a more unbiased overview of everything:**

**TJC facilities**, also adding on to the post from cheapfoolscap:

1. **In general**, tjc hasnt rlly changed facility wise for 5 years, save for that one basketball court they built, ^(sometimes i wonder where the school budget is going). some of the rooms, esp the classrooms, container classes and theaterette will look a bit... worn down. you'll see a bit of vandalism here n there, broken chair broken table, dirty floor. you can see cockroaches, lizards, millipedes here but it's not a common occurence. can't rlly blame them for not fixing all the stuff cuz tj is rebuilding in 2022, but it might be surprising to u because frm outside the school rlly doesn't look that bad.
2. **Canteen:** canteen food is... depends on ur preference lah, but u can get tired of it. we have a western stall, fruit juice stall, drinks + snack stall, japanese stall, korean stall, malay stall, cai fan stall. the korean stall sells very nice mushrooms
3. **Cafe:** the cafe is probably one of the nicer looking locations in tjc.  the food in my honest opinion is meh, and their food quality went down slightly over the years. also the food costs more
4. **Aircon:** air con is... not a guarantee. originally, the rule was that the air con will only be turned on at 9.30am/10.30am for regular classes. but recently with covid and everything we are technically not supposed to turn it on for a full class.
5. **Physical activities:** if u like physical activities then tj has quite a bit of facilities. we have very big rock wall, adventure tower, zipline, bball court, tennis court, volleyball court. sadly u may not get to touch the rock wall n adventure tower n zipline in j1.
6. **Printing shop:** the school has a printing shop called ZAP. it can print a3, color, b&w, photocopy n pretty much anything. it used to be run by a very nice elderly couple (^(which the school sadly replaced :()), but is now run by a few aunties. however the printing service is not very reliable, smtimes the printers break down n the queues are smtimes vv long (esp when 1 whole cohort is printing the same assignment last minute).
7. **Bookshop:** the school has like a mini popular. they accept popular card. sells stationery, school uni and stuff.
8. **Counselling:** the school also has some counselling service, like career guidance (ECG), normal counselling. never visited either, but i heard mixed reviews about both.

**TJC culture**

1. **Fitting in:** In TJC, as long as youre nice, youre good. generally no bullying happens here, the people are all very nice (really) n chill, so as long as youre helpful, do ur part in grp work, nice, u shld find ur place here. dw about making friends also, its honestly quite easy here.
2. **IP vs JAE, elitism and favoritism:** Among students, no one really cares if ur from IP or JAE, or care abt ur L1R5. IP kids wont go n make distinctions between jae and ip, after all we're all from the same school now. while the IP kids will usually already have their set friend groups and people they hang out with, alot of us are still very open to making new friends, knowing new people etc. A very small number of teachers will show favoritism to IP kids though, some are more blatant abt it than others. Academically, there will not be much disparity between JAE and IP. In general both cohorts have the same ability to do extremely well or fail everything, it really depends on how hard u work. so dont stress that youll be ""dumber"" than ur ip counterparts.
3. **Competitiveness:** Not competitive except for a small portion. 90% of the school focus on doing well themselves, rather than comparing too much to other people n trying to be ""the best"". there are competitive people who are aiming for top scorer n stuff, but in general tjc is one of the less competitive jcs out there. we are less competitive than vjc if that matters
4. **Mass dance and cheering:** Mass dance n cheering are a major part of TJ culture. some people find it annoying, some don't, but basically for every school event you'll have to do them.
5. **Social Hierachy:** Doesn't exist here.
6. **Rules:** School has rules ofc. The normal ones like neat uniform, no piercing other than ear, neat hair n stuff. TJC has a system of demerit points, u start at 100 every year, and they cut away at ur points as u break sch rules (latecoming etc), and u will have to go for detention. Since there's covid and theres no morning assembly, theres no more uniform check n so enforcement of rules is a bit less strict now. however, some teachers are more anal abt the rules and will give u demerit points for everything.
7. **Relationships/Sexual Orientation:** TJC people r generally vry open minded,  so if u r scared that u will get judged or discriminated against for being lgbtq+, dw abt it cuz u won't. relationships are not uncommon, though try not to flaunt it too much bc some people from school administration (Principal) strongly discourage BGR n might intervene.
8. **TJC teachers:** They are generally very helpful and genuinely want to help u do well. Some are more likeable than others. Some have different teaching styles that may or may not work for u. Some are however, really not good and very unlikeable, and will make your experience very unpleasant. You may want to check with ur seniors or ip friends on which ones to avoid.
9. **TJC administrative body:** Honestly, they are very out of touch with the student body. sometimes makes dumb decisions that no one asked for.

**Studying @ TJC:**

1. **Workload:** Differs per subject, but if youre taking 4H2 expect quite a bit. Usually u r given 2 day deadlines (chemistry tutorial, math tutorial), or a week (econs essays, csq). it can get overwhelming, cuz some subjects will introduce new concepts and be more confusing (esp physics and chem). u will definitely need to take special care of ur mental health and work very hard.
2. **Facilities:** There's the library n cafe, or under lecture theatre. Plenty of spots to sit and study.
3. **Opportunities:** TJC does have programs that you can sign up for, as well as H3 subject options in JC 2. however, unless ur doing reasonably well in school, u wont get in. the school quite frankly doesnt offer u any external learning opportunities if u do badly academically.
4. **Promotion criteria and retaining**: In general, it is quite hard to get retained in TJC. you'll have to do very, very badly, like straight Us and Ss. to promote ull need 2H2 and 1H1 subject passes (E grade).

In conclusion, i wouldnt go as far as to say ""avoid tj"", but youll have to weigh the pros and cons if ur planning to come here. i personally made a lot of good friends and learnt new stuff, even though my experience at tjc isnt perfect. if u want a less competitive environment with nice people that can still help u get good results, then tjc might be the school for you.

I don't want this post to be too long so i'll stop here, but if u wanna ask any specific questions then feel free

Also you should check the requirements for any university courses you might want to go to, as H2 math might be needed for some courses.', '[deleted]', ""yeah it's very common. it's compulsory to get a laptop actually haha""]"
170,PhoenixAkaunBuang,ls877m,[Rant] Vital skills that our education system fails to teach properly,2021-02-25 22:50:36,SGExams,77662,2,2,"This is in response to recent Rant posts about our education system. I agree with some criticisms but feel others are barking up the wrong tree, so I would like to offer mine.

Disclaimer: This is based on my experiences in primary, secondary and JC, so it may be outdated (I am in my twenties) and if things have improved, I would love to know!

1. Emotional resilience: Our education system is obviously very stressful, but the real problem is that it fails to teach youths how to handle the stress. If well managed, stress can be good and motivate one to be the very best, like no one ever was. Studying and social interaction may feel overwhelming, but consider how our grandparents struggled to put food on the table and had to endure the Japanese Occupation.
2. Digital literacy: The numerous questions here about buying laptops for polytechnic or university illustrate my point. Few schools offer Computing as a subject when it should be compulsory in this digital age.
3. Financial planning: Before entering JC, I thought Economics would teach some of this, but it does not. Many young adults enter the working world with little understanding of CPF and insurance (much less financial investments).
4. Cultural understanding: There are repeated reminders about the importance of racial harmony and globalisation, but little imparting of fundamental knowledge about the various cultures in Singapore or relevant skills.

Feel free to offer advice on how students can learn the above skills.",0.57,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ls877m/rant_vital_skills_that_our_education_system_fails/,"[""1. Response to stress is very much a function of expectations and individual personality traits. I agree that students should be made more aware of what stress is, why and how different people react differently to stress (e.g. high neuroticism people). There's not enough self-awareness taught to students.\n2. Digital literacy =/= computing. Frankly speaking, if they can use Word, Powerpoint, and Excel (especially Excel) in JC, they're already ahead of the game. Project Work in JC is good for forcing them to finally learn some of these ubiquitous tools.\n3. Perhaps not the school's place to teach, but at home. Of course, many adults are just as lacking in knowledge.\n4. I suspect they consciously avoid details because the blemishes are more noticeable, e.g. the Prophet, polygamy, and underage wives, which just leads to more trouble. So just a blanket official religions are cool and great, without going into details, is the safest option.\n\nThe biggest issue: they crammed in so much stuff to study there is hardly any time left for the above after you factor in CCA!"", '1. Agreed. I do wonder how our grandparents coped better with far worse circumstances despite never being taught this.\n2. Not everyone needs to know coding, but there are interns at my workplace who need help connecting their laptop to the projector, troubleshooting simple problems or finding frequently-used features. \n3. That many parents lack such knowledge is precisely why schools need to impart at least the basics. Otherwise young adults will be ""taught"" by agents pressuring them to buy insurance and make investments.\n4. To me, examples of fundamental knowledge could include naming conventions (surname comes first for Chinese while ""bin/bte"" means ""son/daughter of""); what food is halal and vegetarian; the significance of the tudung, pottu and Sikh turban; taboos (like dogs); and customs at cultural festivals, Chinese funerals and Malay weddings.

171,ihopethisisrational,jk9l3t,Petition : Cheat or Be Cheated -- Gradeless Option for NUS,2020-10-29 21:01:25,nus,21212,19,71,"Hi everyone!

We're trying to get a petition for SUs this semester (or the academic year if online exams keep up) here  ([http://chng.it/dvv8dxbXxn](http://chng.it/dvv8dxbXxn)) because cheating is a real thing with e-exams.

We've copied-pasted the petition text below, please help support!

&#x200B;

COVID-19 has imposed extreme difficulties on learning and assessments for virtually every single course at all universities.

Internationals take exams at 3 in the morning. Labs and facilities are barred to cross-zone students. Cheating and ""in-class"" discussion are rampant in every exam. Both professors and students feel little to no learning is taking place.

The disease has eliminated almost every link between grades and actual effort or merit this semester. Scoring in exams has become a contest of who has the best cheating network rather than who has best learned the material. Students who try to play by the rules face ridiculous odds and disadvantages: Last year's top scores under proper exam conditions are below average today. If you don't cheat, the others will.

For any student who cares about their grades, the incentive to cheat is almost overwhelming. It follows insisting on strict letter grades this semester is an insult to learning and meritocratic principles.

Other universities know this. From Stanford University to Hong Kong University, colleges in both the East and West have concluded it's necessary to allow non-letter grading this semester and even for the full academic year. The incentives and disadvantages with strict online exams are just too strong to overcome.

Because of this, it's only fair to the students trying to be honest, and the professors trying to grade by effort and learning, to remove or provide the option to remove letter grades this semester or academic year. The alternative is we encourage students to cheat and professors to be indifferent to such dishonesty.

\[EDIT (to petition text)\]: To clarify, we mean no disrespect to the institution. We appreciate its efforts to convert courses to online and hybrid formats, and we recognise the university could not have anticipated all the problems in the current semester (we certainly didn't). We're open to alternatives should the university suggest them.",0.84,https://www.reddit.com/r/nus/comments/jk9l3t/petition_cheat_or_be_cheated_gradeless_option_for/,"['It is not just about cheating.

Another professor teaching a 4k module already has a personal rapport with most people in our small class.

172,icyii,ip9j4d,Hunting for HDB resale - any tips?,2020-09-09 12:42:45,singapore,378641,93,35,"My bf (30) and I (29) started our HDB resale house hunt. I've been doing a lot of research but the information is overwhelming, so thought I would reach out to redditors here and see if y'all had any tips for us.

**What about BTO?**

My bf keeps pushing for BTO but I really don't want to wait 6-7 years to move out of my family home. My parents are really loud and argue a lot so it's not the best for my mental health. My bf doesn't understand because he likes living with his family. I don't want to move in with him either, I don't like the home, location, and living with the in-laws.

**What we've been looking for**

My bf wants to live in Serangoon because it's close to his workplace (Clarke Quay) and his family (so we get grants). The flats are larger because they're older, however the downside is the hdb flats are considerably older.

I prefer the east side because I've lived here all my life and I like the beach vibes. I also work from home so it doesn't matter where I live, though of course I would prefer a place near the MRT. I fell in love with a newly MOP Tampines DBSS 5-room for 700k but he didn't even want to consider it because it was in Tampines. 

I'm mostly fine with Serangoon hdb flats except their windows are really small, the remaining lease is shorter, and lots of renovation work will have to be done.

Do you have any advice or tips for us? What were your experiences buying resale? Did you end up waiting a few years for BTO?

Generally just browsing through 99.co and get a rough idea of comparable pricing.

Living together is totally a different life than Boyfriend girlfriend life.', 'Location is definitely important for your hubby, and I can only suggest to find one with the layout you like. Remember some walls can be broken down. Renovation is a big part, it’s like customising a home to your fit. \n\nThat means fixtures, tables, etc are all customised to your height. Storage is thoughtful and purposeful as well. \n\nTampines is a mature estate and the DBSS you highlighted has a balcony. Some people like balconies and not many HDBs have that. It’s in a good location and there’s an abundance of amenities. Punggol is up an coming, and Changi is near. Both near to that DBSS which I assume is The Premiere. \n\nIf the DBSS is Centrale 8 by the way, stay away. Far away. It’s too small and crowded. It’s a project to squeeze profit psf that The Premiere didn’t do as well. If you compare Premiere and Centrale 8, they are far apart in terms of the planning and thinking behind it.', 'Grew up in Serangoon all my life, houses near the MRT and NEX are a premium. The window sizes are fine, IMO. I’m not used to the floor to ceiling windows of BTOs nowadays. \n\nIf budget is a concern, you can look at Serangoon North and just take a bus to Serangoon MRT. Most of the “newer” (built in late 90s) HDBs can be found in Serangoon North. You won’t find any late 90s HDB flats near NEX other than the Blocks 256 to 258 in Serangoon Central Drive going for almost $700k and the executive apartments (232A, 234A, 236A) in S’goon Ave 2 going for an eye watering 1 million dollars. \n\nIf you still want near NEX, you can look at Lorong Ah Soo and Hougang St 11. \n\nI’m not a property agent, I’m just someone who has been in Serangoon forever lol until I recently got married and moved to AMK. \n\nIf you’re buying resale, you can DIY purchase, it’s fairly easy and the instructions on the HDB resale portal are straightforward. You don’t need an agent, I bought my resale HDB by myself.\n\nIf you want North-South facing, quite a number of flats in nearby AMK are built in that direction. You can look around the estates near S’goon.', 'Honestly the size of the older flats (and the ability to move in pretty quickly) makes it a big draw, but make sure you don’t pay too high a premium for it. Some of these flat prices are close to the price of a freehold condo man. \n\nFor Reno, unless you have very clear and strong views on what you want your home to look like, just get the basics and don’t go crazy so you can pay up the mortgage quicker. These days the job market is so unstable and things change so fast - it’s better to get something classic and durable that you can live with for a long time than feel like you have to renovate or refurnish every few years. It’s easy to update a classic white and wood/black decor with a few new cushion covers and some new curtains, but if you’ve gone eclectic and painted the place orange with built in cabinets etc you’ll need to redo the whole space if you start hating it. Some people know exactly what they want though, nothing wrong with that. \n\nLook at your life and what it will be for the next 5 years and plan for that (especially if you plan to have kids or more than one kid). You don’t want to have to carve out a second bedroom in your living room because you had two kids and only one tiny bedroom, because you chose to break down a wall for an extra large living/ dining /bar area or master bedroom. (True story, happened to a couple of friends, kids take up waaaaay more space than anyone expects)\n\nAnd get a very comfortable sofa and bed. ^_^', ""My profile: Late-30s and single AF. I had been wanting to get a place of my own for a really long time so did a ton of research between 2RM BTOs vs resale. The 2RM BTOs were usually in very ulu locations and those near an MRT were always super oversubscribed. Hell, I already waited 35 years and even though I could save a lot getting a BTO you'd have to survive the balloting and then wait 4 - 5 years for it to build before you finally get the keys. That would mean that I could only move in when I'm in my 40s. So I gave up on waiting for a BTO and decided to get a resale. In the end, I decided on a 40+ year old 3RM flat near town which was a 5min walk to an MRT for about $300K.  \n\nOne warning about buying a 30 - 40+ year old flat is that you are buying a DEPRECIATING asset. You are most probably going to lose money if you try to sell it after the MOP so if you do buy one, make sure that it's gonna be your 'forever home.' The reason why nobody wants a 40+ year old flat is because there are restrictions on CPF usage (Google to find out more) and under some circumstances you might not be able to get a housing loan for it.  \n \nAnyhow, shortly after I bought the place I switched jobs and now my parent's place is much nearer to my workplace so it makes more sense for me to stay with them most of the time.

I bought my flat (40yrs 3rm HDB) at the start of the year, and my reno costed ard 44k. Extensive work had to be done for the kitchen since the previous owner had not updated it since the 80s, i also hacked half a wall off my kitchen for a semi-open concept. I did very little to the rest of the house (didn't even hack the floor tiles), and no carpentry work in the rooms.

There are tutorials on the HDB portal or you could join their hdb resale seminar for a small fee ($20? but worth it as it was super detailed and they'll provide you with a stack of useful PowerPoint slides)\n\n3) To avoid paying additional COV cash for the flat, lookup the historical resale prices in the area or even the same block and use that as reference. If your offering price is the same or below that amount chances are that you might not need to pay any cash overlay\n\n4) Once you've decided on a place and made an offer, you'll need to pay a cash amount known as the OTP (option to purchase - between $1-$1000 to be negotiated between seller and buyer) to the owner and submit a request for valuation by hdb. HDB will appoint a valuer to derive a valuation. The cash you need to overlay will be your offer price minus the valuation. In my case the valuation and my offer came back to be the same so no cash top up from me.\nHowever you'll need to pay a pre-agreeed OTP exercise fee (between $1-$4000 to be negotiated between buyer and seller).\nIn my case I negotiated to pay only $1000 across both OTP and Exercise fee.\n\n5) More specifically for Serangoon, the prices are higher the closer the block is to NEX/Serangoon MRT ($500++k for 4rms, $700+k).

176,Proper_1869,gk3pzm,[Uni] Rejected by all universities. And this is how I felt. what about you?,2020-05-15 14:15:09,SGExams,77662,91,412,"I will never forget this stage of my life. A period of constant paranoia that was fueled by the immense helplessness. For a prolonged period, I would click on my Gmail icon every morning, hoping to receive a response to my university applications. To no avail, my inbox was always empty though there were times when junk mails or Zalora would get my hopes up until I saw the sender. At this stage, there were moments when I felt angry at the admissions for giving me such a torturous suspension. The waiting period was unbearable, it was like an unreachable itch at the back of my mind and it would creep up on me whenever I was isolated or not doing anything. At that time, I just wanted everything to have a result, I just wish they would end my misery by cutting me loss. Thoughts like “just reject me already please” ran through my mind all the time,  I felt like a war warrior who just wanted to quickly get shot at the battlefield to ease the suspension.

Little did I know that suspension was way better than the reality, there was hope, at least. On the 14th of May 2020, 10 days before the first acceptance window deadline, I learnt that many of my friends had gotten their offers at the top three universities. And that skyrocketed my hope because I thought I might have a chance since I scored similar rank points as them. That night, I turned on my laptop and went on to the official student portal excitedly, hoping that I could share a similar fate as my friends. However, the results were not in my favour. I was bluntly rejected by NUS, SIT and SUTD, all the universities that I had applied to basically. That was when I started to appreciate the torturous suspension I had a few seconds ago and I realised my preparation for this undesirable outcome was merely a paper-thin bulletproof vest that could not defend the nuclear-like reality. The reality was much harsher than I expected. Looking at the glowing “Rejected” my mind went blank, my vision blurred, darkened and I spaced out.

Shock, sadness, disappointment, helplessness and shame, all of them colluded, turned into an iron fist and punched me hard right at my windpipe. To be honest, never have I ever imagined that was how breathtaking feels like. Not only was I unable to inhale at the point, but I was also overwhelmed by the immense sensation of pain. It was not a quick stab kind of a pain but rather a slow burn. It felt like a skilled butcher with a blunt blade, aimed at my chest, penetrated through my skin, my flesh, my bones and added a twist when it reached my heart.

A friend of mine asked if I was ok, I replied yes. “Yes”, just seemed to be the best candidate to describe this emotional turmoil. God knows how long had I spent looking at my ceiling before falling asleep but what else could I have done? Crying? Screaming? Leaping off a bridge? Nah. It was a moment of chaotic nothingness, I did not know what to do or where to go. My mind was just blank, blank, blank.

How now brown cow?

How now?",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gk3pzm/uni_rejected_by_all_universities_and_this_is_how/,"[""Well written. You should probably save some energy and spent it on your personal statement for an appeal. If your appeal has such caliber, maybe you might stand a chance. That feeling of suspense doesn't end here. You will feel it when you receive your uni results every sem, applying for hundreds of internship and get rejected by all, confessing your true love to a friend, applying for full time jobs, etc. Better start embracing it.."", 'I can kinda relate to this, i was rejected from my dream course to NTU, NUS and SMU back in 2017. \n\nI was working part time at an ice cream shop while waiting for my enlistment and I still remember when I whipped out my phone just to refresh my email one more time. It was already May and I still haven’t received even an interview from any university so I was pretty desperate. \n\nWhen I saw the email “admission outcome could be found here” I too felt the thrill, the adrenaline rush that comes with opening a document that decides the fate of the rest of my life. But the moment I saw the beginning of the email “thank you for applying to...” I knew I was rejected. I still remember slumping onto the cashier station, customers were still coming in but I was so shocked I couldn’t react to them. My supervisor asked if I was okay and I also said “yes”, I didn’t know what else to say. \n\nFrom then on I went into a short stint of depression as I saw all my other friends get into the uni courses of their choices. It became worse when I was in the army, I was rejected by SUSS during BMT which totally tore me apart. Not to disparage SUSS but it was my last ditch effort in getting into a local U. I felt totally helpless too, stuck in the army with no foreseeable future after ORD. \n\nBut i think the end of the story doesn’t have to be bad. Maybe private uni allows you to take a step towards your dream career? Or if possible overseas uni can do the same! Maybe taking the private A levels and reapplying would help! \n\nThere are still many other paths to what you want to do in the future. Yes they may be unorthodox or more convoluted but I think if they still help you reach your goal then no shame no regret. \n\nAll the best OP! I really can relate to what you’re feeling!', 'off-topic, but you write well.', ""OH my! Your writing was impressive!! Don't worry I know its the adrenaline that gives us the negative burst of energy when we encounter bad stuff happen to us :( \n\nNow, its important to consider few things!! I believe since you have just applied to NUS, SIT & SUTD you do have a course in mind you want to aim for, that I believe is not available/not good enough for you at NTU/SUSS/SMU? \n\nIf your rank points are low, then you might want to take the poly route? 2 years of poly get the diploma and considering you may do well at poly, you can even go on to get a degree from one of the local universities at a discounted number of years too!! **(2 yrs of poly + 2.5/3 years of uni = diploma+degree is better than 4 years = degree if you compare with your friends that are already matriculating)** :) cheer up man!! There are multiple routes to success!!\n\nIf your rank points are high/decent enough, then maybe take a gap year? Perform an internship? Re-evaluate your choices of courses at uni? You could do so much more that way and I believe you could still excel that way!!  \n\n\n**IN THE END, TO SUMMARIZE NEVER EVER GIVE UP ALREADY!! I WAS REJECTED BY MY PASSIONATE FACULTY FOR 2 YEARS, THIRD TRY I GOT IN!! :) SO HAVE HIGH HOPES ON YOURSELF AND DONT UNDERESTIMATE YOUR ABILITY!!!**"", 'Wow u write very well! i think u can try to appeal and stand a great chance. also can consider other routes like private uni/polytechnic!\ni hope u feel better soon and all the best! everything will work out one way or another :)', 'hey OP, I can understand how you feel because that was me in 2019. Did my appeals and was still rejected so I had to take a gap year. In the beginning, I was upset and my confidence had taken a hit. Each time you see your cohort mates start their uni life and all the y1 orientation story updates, it\'s like someone is stabbing a knife onto an already open wound. After some time, I didn\'t even bother with social media anymore because it sucks and hurts every time I see people post about uni life. It\'s like a physical reminder of ""you are not as good as they are. you can\'t be as accomplished as them."", which is complete bullshit by the way, if you have thoughts like that. People who haven\'t been rejected don\'t understand how it feels like and back then, all my friends either went to uni or are still studying, so only a handful could relate.\n\nThe only thing then that we can do is to mope, be sad, force ourselves to accept it and make use of the gap year wisely to supplement our working experiences and resume so that we are better equipped to face the uni application competition next year.\n\nIt\'s a bitter reality but over time (like idk after ?? how long; my self-confidence rn has only barely recovered so hey its ok to take ur time), you accept the harsh truth and you learn to embrace what you have now. In this one year, I did a marketing job for 2 months before I called it quits cause I realised marketing and sales ain\'t my cuppa tea. I also took up a python course in tandem. Then I went on to do accounts after a short break and I\'m here now. Y\'know what\'s the good thing about that? You get an extra year of working experience which = an extra year of having to act like you\'re Somebody and damn right son you better give me that job because I am qualified and you know it. An extra year of work politics and understanding the nuances of the working populace. You learn about yourself and how to sell YOU. That\'s the advantage you have on like 90% of the cohort when you get into university, which I believe you can. C\'mon, you write so well!\n\nAnyway, I figured out the industry I wanted to go into, which helped me out in knowing the right courses I want to apply for. So now that I think back on it, yes I\'m still bitter about being rejected (there was a whole drama) from the Big 3 last year, but I don\'t hate what I\'ve learnt in this gap year.  There was a lot of personal growth cause I had to battle a lot of things with me - self-confidence, laziness, friendships, etc. So, I\'m telling you that it\'s alright to be rejected and I\'m not saying it on a superficial level. Been there and done that. I still haven\'t received my application results from SMU or the other 2 (SMU is the one I really wanted) but I got an offer from SUSS and SIT, which is fine too.\n\nIt\'s okay to be lost cause everyone is at some point. Just because others have entered university doesn\'t mean they have their life planned out perfectly. You\'re right that crying and screaming won\'t work. Give yourself some time to accept this (idk how it takes it depends), move on and make use of what you have Now and what you can do. I wish you all the very best.', ""You should use this for your personal statement to some arts course, like English or Literature HAHAH it was surprisingly interesting and really captured my attention.\n\nAnyways, jiayou! Try again next year — my advice would be try applying to all 6 AUs + possibly spend your gap year building your portoflio for the courses you're aiming for. Hoping for the best for you!

Its not the end.\n\nIf u still really wanna go uni, You should consider writing an appeal essay for all the unis.\n\nIf it doesnt work, you can finally try the poly route ( 2 years for JC students programme that they recently introduced) corresponding to the course you wanted to take in Uni.

What can i do now? Delayed my uni studies for 2 years after graduation, figuring out what i want to do, and now that i know what i want to do, i can’t get in. I know there’s still appeal. I know i’m still young. But i have been pinning my hopes on entering uni these year because i have no idea what i can do now, after my internship ends. It all seems too far away and too scary to think about. Just wishing i had a community of people who also got rejected, and that we can all wallow is sadness together because sometimes, that’s what helps to make you feel better - that you are not alone. That’s my message to you, OP. You are not alone. I’m so so sorry for the devastation you feel, the hopelessness, the loss.\n\n- From a brown cow to another\n\n(Maybe i will make that group...but it’s probably not allowed in this sub)', ""Hello OP! Your writing is fantastic. Years ago, I was in the same place as you -- rejected by every university I applied to using my A Levels without even receiving any interview letters. It was financially impossible to study in a private uni/ go overseas to pursue a degree, so I decided to take a gap year and go to a local polytechnic the year after. Just graduated last week (supposedly, hello covid) with a diploma with merit when all my other same-aged peers are graduating this year with a degree, but I've never been happier! Now I'm currently accepted into every university I applied to, even NUS Medicine :) \n\nIt was a hard pill to swallow initially as I felt inferior to my peers. Was fearful of looking like a failure to those accepted into local universities, and hated that tongues wagged behind my back. But in this extended journey that I took, I worked on and for myself and learnt a crazy lot in terms of knowledge and education. It also revealed to me the actual colours of people and filtered out the true friends who supported me. Even if I'm slower by others by four years today, I am thankful for the journey of growth :) \n\nDon't be disheartened by your circumstance because you already coming this far through the rigours of the tertiary education system is worth celebrating. Don't let anyone dull your worth, value or tell you you're a failure bc you're absolutely not. There's so much more ahead of you! All the best, OP! Feel free to drop me a message if you'd like :)"", 'Hi OP,\n\nI hope you will open your mind to other possibilities over the “standard jc to Uni” route that many others are taking. I understand your dejection but there are many other options you can consider, depending on your interests, financial status etc. If you are going to NS, you can consider re applying, or taking your As again as a private candidate during your service. If you are a female, there are other private universities (SIMGE is a very common option) that is still relatively affordable, compared to going overseas, and can provide you with a good education and enriching student life as well. \n\nIt is understandable to feel dejected but I hope you can also see that this is just one of the many obstacles you are going to face in your life, I hope you will be able to fight your circumstances bravely and search for another path, even if it is an off-beaten one. Jiayou!', 'Ohh OP, I wish I could hug you right now :(( I can’t say I relate to your struggle now, but maybe give this some time? Sleep on it for now and discuss other possibilities with your parents? You could think about retaking A levels as a private candidate or you could enrol at a private uni, or you could take a gap year and develop your skills and work experience in that time!

A skill that I envy hehe', 'Just curious, how come you didn’t apply to SMU/NTU?', 'I can totally empathise with you. That was exactly me for a good two years back-to-back. \n\nI graduated poly back in 2018 May and enlisted in July of that same year. Only ORD-ed early this month. \n\nBack in 2018’s and 2019’s application periods, I was constantly rejected by all of the universities I applied to. Namely, NTU, NUS, SMU and SUSS. (I can vividly remember getting my unfavourable NUS application outcome on my first day of enlistment — on the damn boat to Tekong) \n\nI applied to business and computing courses in said universities even though I score poorly (GPA: low 3s). Mainly because I already knew what I wanted to do in the future and was prepared to go to SIMGE to study something that I want if things turned south. \n\nThankfully, this year, I managed to secure a spot at SUSS business analytics after being shortlisted for an interview. And I will forever be grateful for it. \n\nHence, I just wanna share this short anecdote to perhaps provide you (and maybe others too) with some hope. So hang in there OP, you got this! 🤗', ""Hey there! thank you very much for sharing. I believe there are many out there who share the same sentiments as you and they needed to this to feel sane. \n\nI for one went through the same phase. It took me around 4 years to eventually get out of it but I guess it was just another phase of life. Since then i have worked for two companies, dabbled in freelance and completed my national service.\n\nI applied for uni 4 times to 2 different institutions and all were unsuccessful. When it came to this year, I was rejected just again. (\\*side note my gpa in poly was nowhere near average and I only had my portfolio to fall back on) I was devastated but i didn't wanna let it go to waste.  I wrote something similar to your post in my Appeal Letter and redid my portfolio that very moment. I made clear of my interest, vision and goals. Everything good or bad that happened to me along the way that made me who I am today.  I sent it all in a few days after i got the unsuccessful outcome and had to wait for almost to 3 months for their reply. During that waiting time everything seemed horrible to me. All the unimaginable thoughts and 'whatifs' because I didnt know what to do especially in this pandemic and plus all the job offers were looking for full-timers?? I was stuck because what if i get an offer later yknow? I stayed away from social media, avoided replying texts and just made sure I was just comfortable.\n\nIts okay to cry. Cry the hardest because after this you are going to pick yourself up. Push yourself harder and keep your head high. I always believe that things happen for a reason and I find solace in that. Its okay to react badly to this. You are allowed to do that but promise yourself, you will soar even higher and work even harder after this. You can do it!\n\nI believe that good things happen to people who wait. I did it, for 4 years.

I get to talk to people from all walks of life. But the greatest takeaway I had was that nobody really cares where your degree is from. As long as you’re learning what you want to learn, any degree is as valuable. Honestly most companies don’t even take into account where your degree is from as long as you’re capable enough to add value to them. Go take up courses or self-learn skills that interest you. I have friends who only possess O level certs but they are still as successful as any degree holder. Just keep moving and don’t stop, you’ll eventually get there. \n\nI went ahead and applied for part time at SUSS and managed to get in. Taking my first semester now. So don’t be too disheartened.

This pain and feeling of worry for what I'm going to do about my future is really really torturous for me and for the last 2 times applying and getting rejected was horrendous because of the added torment of National Service. I find myself looking out the window or staring blankly at walls just trying to figure out what do I actually do since I've already applied 3 times and so far getting negative outcomes. I feel very disappointed and sad truthfully at my lack of accomplishments and also the fact the people around me who have similar RP/GPA scores as me getting offered places for courses I too have applied for. \n\nI really don't know what to do or whom to talk to to express this feeling of utter despair. Though, I hope those of us on the same boat will get through this oje way or another.

I was immune to rejection letters at that point.\n\nAfter ORD i decided to get a job in the related field I studied during polytechnic for a year. \nJob was insanely underpaid and no OT pay with endless of OT amounting to about 46-48hours a week(slight rant: could have had earn more working part time, but it is okay as it made me more ‘hungry’ in a sense).

Who cares if you have to enrol into college at 23/24/25/26 years old, as long as you are sure of what you want that is all that matters.\n\nMy poly lecturer once told me that generally people will take a couple of years to realise what they are actually passionate about and will leave their jobs to pursue them.', ""What's your rank point?"", '[deleted]', 'Thank you and I will learn to embrace things like this', 'The 3rd item on that list tho', 'Hi OP, I would respectfully disagree with this.

I ticked the boxes as they came in life (blindly) - primary school, secondary school, high school (I went overseas), and the college. But I realize now when I look back that I should have taken a year to figure out what I liked and what I wanted to do. I mean this as in - if you want to go into banking, find an internship. If you want to do law in Uni, find an internship. It doesn’t necessarily have to be a paid one either - you can email companies and ask for unpaid internships but it is the EXPERIENCE that matters. \n\nAn appeal letter may help, but proper experience would go a lot farther when you reapply to the universities. Along with that, you’ll be more secure in your decision of what you want to study in university, and you’d have gained skills in the real world that puts you ahead of your peers.\n\nGap years are something I don’t hear about much in Singapore, but I think it’s something worth looking into.

177,ain20,jitejs,[rant] o level as a private candidate,2020-10-27 11:01:30,SGExams,77662,14,84,"i’m not sure how this works as this is my first time doing this and i’m still new to this. before anyone come at me trying to say “i’m attention seeking” or “i deserved it” please please please try to understand my position. i have nowhere else to rant except here. 

so i am halfway thru Os but i still have pure hist, elect geog, elect bio and sci mcq to go thru. i just did chem but i know for sure i completely failed. i blanked out, left blanks which i never do before and couldnt do most questions. i feel like i’ve lost it all and hit the rock bottom. the worse thing is that i know the paper is easy but i could do it, bcs i didn’t had the ans to the questions. all my efforts went into the drain just like that. i feel like giving up in life bcs i screwed up my 2nd chance at Os. 

i was depending on chem to pull up my sci (my bio is weak), but now it’s fked and so my l1r5 is meaningless. 

i was an express student but failed Os in 2019 and am studying in ite rn. at the same time i am doing o levels once again as a private candidate retaking 5 subjects this year. my fam was totally against the idea, saying i won’t be able to cope. in the end i had to use my money (which is a lot to me and luckily i had my salary that i saved up) to retake Os once again. 

my ultimate goal is JC ever since the beginning. i know some people will say “why don’t u just continue with ite and go to a good course in poly since it’s obvious that ure incapable of going there in the first place” i thought that was starting to be true at first, but coming to ite has made me realised that i’m not a computer person but am more to books side. so i’m thankful that i retook Os in the first place so that if i do well, i can leave ite and go to a jc. 

the reason why i chose to go ite and retake is bcs in the beginning, i wasn’t sure if pure hist is offered (they won’t offer a subject if there’s less than 20 candidates sitting) i needed it if i want to go jc to help my l1r5 (i cant retake art again and i have mt w me) but i would only know in june once the entry proof is out, which means by then if i were in ite i would b halfway thru sch. but if im not, then it’ll be a year wasted for me. 

throughout my years in secondary school, i did not study at all. my results were average and i only went with the flow. it was only when i failed my Os in 2019 suddenly hits me to do better and work harder. i didn’t prioritise my education, and allow rs to get in the way which affected my studies. there were no restrictions set or anybody to push me or scold me to do better. all the decisions in my life are up to me to decide. i’m free to do whatever i want ever since my dad passed on. 

i wish i had somebody to push me for my future sake u know? i realised its important now and its starting to kill me deep down. i regret taking things for granted and going with the flow. 

going to ite has made me realised an effective studying method that works for me which i have been using since august till now to study for Os.

only until the recent weeks where i started to feel more stressed and blanked out more easily. there were so many things to cope, idk where i stood, and i was all alone. it’s so scary retaking Os as a private candidate. and at the same time it sucks big time seeing ur friends happy with their choices in poly ite or jc. 

on top of that, i have financial expenses to worry about. i’m sick of my fam always bringing up about financial issues like topping up ez link card or buying food to eat (if i were to ask for $$) if i were to go ite and then to poly, i would have to spend so much which i really don’t want to. the only money i’m left with is my father’s wealth that he left behind. and as u know time goes, it’s only decreasing. yes, whenever i go out to school or purchase anything, i only depend on that and have stopped asking my mother for $$ majority of the times. it has been 4 years and i’m rly stressed thinking abt it once it runs out. 

i really don’t know what to do now. i’m really lost at this point and the fact that my geog paper is in about 2hrs+ really scares me. i feel alone and like a complete failure and a loser. i thought i could actually turn things around and prove people wrong by going to a jc next year, but regardless of whatever i do i feel like it’s never enough. 

i missed 1 week (to study n focus on Os) and applied 2 weeks of leave from ite bcs of Os which means i missed out so much. my attendance and studies r gg to b affected, and it’ll affect my gpa if i’m still in the sch next year. it’s really embarrassing if i were to stay in school next year aft everything. 

shld i leave ite next year and retake Os once again? i’m really desperate to get straight As on the slip. idk why. i just want to achieve that. 

besides dealing with the label of being a failure bcs i failed Os, i have to deal with worries like $$ and my future. i have to make decisions on my own. my father isn’t here to support me just like how he provided for my siblings. it’s different for me. i’m all alone. i have to decide and do things alone and honestly it’s been so tough. it’s been so hard ever since he left bcs there’s nobody to provide for me like how he did for my siblings when they were my age. it rly sucks having to live a diff life from ur siblings when they were ur age. 

i apologise if it’s confusing, if it sounds like i’m seeking pity. but i’m not the type to share my burdens to my friends or family (ik in this case it’s ironic) bcs i’m the type to keep my shit to myself. but this time round, it’s a different kind of pain. i have never felt this way before. it’s so overwhelming, it hurts, i’m desperate for success, i feel alone, and everything sucks. 

i really don’t know what to do at this point. i’m so confused and lost and i don’t know what is happening. i’ve never thought of sui**** but honestly it seems like a good option too. my fam would have one less mouth to feed anyways. 

i’ve tried so hard to get to where i want to, but even after everything that i’ve been through, it looks like it was all just useless.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/jitejs/rant_o_level_as_a_private_candidate/,"[""dear stranger.\n\nite is not the end, poly is not mid tier, and jc is not royal. at the end of the day, this stage of education only sets out to determine the time period for you to eventually achieve a bachelor's degree, which is the next step. \n\nyou sound like you are out to prove to others your abilities, but i would caution you to take a step back, and instead assess your capabilities, and prove to yourself you are able to achieve a more realistic goal. as you said, you failed the 2019 olevels, i think to gun for straight As (selfstudy i assume?) while juggling your ite modules must be tough.

For this purpose, I compared Germany with Singapore and compared the two recovery strategies compensation and showing remorse in both nations. Not surprisingly, both strategies are successful in both nations when it comes to restoring satisfaction. The results between the two nations do not differ very much, so I concluded that in the end there is no need for major differences in the recovery strategy between different nations. I could only measure a smaller preference of the Singaporeans over the Germans, that the Singaporeans put a little more emphasis on showing remorse than on compensation.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nThat was it in a nutshell.

180,xkristenn,i9cu1q,[A Levels] Note to J2s,2020-08-14 09:34:26,SGExams,77662,15,218,"Have been a silent reader for quite a while now (even during my own A’s journey) but I can safely say that this subreddit was honestly a whole ‘escape’ & community that I was super grateful for during my J2 year. As cliche as it sounds scrolling through this page and refreshing every day after school just reading everyone’s questions, rants, thoughts & little interactions made me feel that I’m not in this alone, and this is just one of the things I’ve learnt from A levels.

tldr; seeing a few negative posts here and thought I’d pay it forward and offer you some of my personal take from the A Levels journey (hopefully it helps you feel a lil’ better)

Things I’ve learnt from A levels:

*1) You’re not in this alone* 
The A levels journey is not one you have to venture on alone. Yes, going into the exam hall where you can’t bring anyone or even those trusty notes you’ve made in will be daunting, but always remember the times you’ve revised with friends, had consults with teachers, late nights in school studying, Zoom study sessions, random texts in the group chat to seek help for a question or even that post you wrote on this reddit, a comment you left or even being a part of and reading this message now. YOU ARE NOT ALONE! Many seniors have walked this path, many seniors are here to help, support and respond to queries you may have, your teachers all are rooting for you deep down and your peers, friends and this entire cohort will be going into this TOGETHER. So if you ever feel alone in this journey please do reach out we’re here as a community and as fellow students we understand that this may not be easy but I hope you find some comfort in knowing that we’re all in this together and you’re not alone on this journey

*2) One step at a time*
It’s a simple mantra that I stood by during revision. Often times, I felt that I was lagging behind, always chapters behind, many gaps in my revision, so lost in classes I couldn’t even finish a practise paper. This made me question ‘Why was I even revising?’ ‘How was I going to practice questions if I can’t even do a single question?’ ‘I don’t even know what I don’t know?’ Sounds familiar yet? Well, once you encounter an unknown concept it’s easy to be trapped in a cycle of self-doubt and you’ll quickly become overwhelmed - these are all normal feelings and everyone would’ve felt it before! (Myself included) One day, feeling all dejected and panicking about A’s on a walk home a friend told me “Just take it one step at a time, if it means doing part A of a test paper then just do that, heck if it means just doing 1 page then just do that, better still if it means doing 1 or 2 questions today then just do that! As long as you’re doing something it’s better than nothing!” In hindsight, that was probably the best advice I’ve gotten for A’s. Whenever I felt overwhelmed with the sheer amount of content I had to go through or even begin to organise I’d tell myself ok today I’ll finish 1 page of this paper, focus on JUST THAT and try to break out of the negative thought cycle loop. REMEMBER: going one step at a time is personal and varies from person to person as long as you did something, it’s an improvement from where you were before doing that - so give yourself that small win and just continue taking small steps every day!

*3) Negative thoughts are OK*
Negative emotions and thoughts are all part and parcel of being human. We all have good days and bad days, there will be periods we feel down, sad, dejected, hopeless, lose faith in ourselves but all these are necessary for you to understand what happiness, hope, relief, calmness and faith even feel like. Sometimes we find ourselves at rock bottom, then falling even lower (like whatt hasn’t the world already thrown enough at me?!) but this too is part and parcel of growth. I used to constantly crave happiness and a stress free life, but I believe as you mature and have a look at real life, you’d begin to understand that the negatives are just as important in this pursuit for happiness, acknowledging that these negative emotions are necessary and NORMAL is important. Don’t beat yourself up over feeling sad because you can’t understand an easy concept, don’t tell yourself you shouldn’t feel stressed out, don’t tell yourself you can’t be dejected - these are all part of the journey, accept these emotions, feel them, and acknowledge them as part of your personal growth journey. Months later you’ll look back and realise ah yes THAT made me a stronger person today. A’s definitely till this day remains one of the lowest points in my life, I dreaded walking into school everyday, endlessly wished it all be gone and admittedly before this post have completely buried this part in a deep corner of my memory hoping to not relive it. BUT, time and time again I always find myself comparing my workload and stresses back to the days where I was sitting in your position and I tell myself ‘I’ve been through the rigour of A’s this is really nothing compared to those days’ These negative emotions you feel today are part and parcel of your growth, so embrace it, own it and chart the way forward! Recall 1)You’re not in this alone & 2)Take things one step at a time

*4) Every day is a fresh start*
Treat every day like a mini reset button. Get a good nights rest every night, wake up fresh and conquer the day on a clean slate. If you previously had a terrible study session, leave it behind. TODAY is a new day and it’s a new start for you, a clean slate for you to begin whatever you have planned for yourself. In the midst of all the rigour, intensity and stress that fuels this journey always always remember to take care of your health! Find a way to unwind and click that reset button so you can begin the next day FRESH. If you’re an early bird, set a schedule so you sleep early and wake up early to maximise your productive hours. If you’re a night owl, set a schedule so you can study into the night and still get enough rest to reset for the next day again. It’s personal, everyone has their own optimal methods and you know yourself best! Personally, I’m not a great runner but I picked up running during the intensive study period right before A’s where we didn’t have to go to school. Every morning (give or take the days days I need that extra snooze), I’d wake up go for a quick run (15min, 20min whatever suits you) and come back to start my revision - could be the endorphins but it personally helped me feel better about the day and start it on a nicer note (OH yea, nikerunclub has some awesome guided runs that really picked me up during this period too - if this might work for you then check it out!) Regardless, find a hobby, find an avenue for yourself to unwind at the end of the day or between revisions, give yourself that break and NEVER feel guilty for taking a break. Make your health and well-being a priority. 

*5) This too shall pass*
Like many things in life, A’s will be another milestone you pass in life. As someone who has been in your shoes, I can confidently tell you that a few months down the road, no matter the results, completing the last paper will usher in a sense of well-deserved satisfaction. You’ve made it through this journey, no matter the outcome, the strength and tenacity will train you up for far greater feats in life. During my A’s I picked up running (which I mentioned previously), I’ve grown as a student and more importantly as a person. I think it has allowed me to mature and regardless how you do - it’s not the end of the world. I’ve had peers who did really well, others who didn’t fare as well as they expected, some who even transferred to poly because A’s wasn’t the route for them but a few years later when you look at where we all are now, A’s was really just another step in this long journey of life, each of us have found our own successes and are still continuing the journey to adulthood. Maybe some of us might not end up taking a conventional route but who knows THAT may just be the opportunity for you to reevaluate your goals and find something you may end up enjoying even more. In the grand scheme of things, adding a few more years to take a detour ain’t gonna matter, we still have many years ahead of us and there’s so much more to say about the life after A’s but I’ll keep it brief for now - this too shall pass!",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/i9cu1q/a_levels_note_to_j2s/,"['Comprehensive advice, well written!', 'Thank you so much, this is really encouraging :,) ❤️', 'Really needed this ❤️', 'Such a nice post that is relatable despite not taking the As.

Did u have tuition? Did your grades improve from MYE to prelim?', 'Sure! Understand that you’re a secondary school student taking O’s now - I’ll try to share my experience preparing for A’s and what worked for me but do take it with a pinch of salt because it might not be the same and everyone tends to have different study preferences, try out various methods and find out what works best for you! What works for me may not work for everyone! (p.s. if anyone else has tips/advice to share feel free to add on - I think exploring different study styles is the best way to find out what works best for yourself) That being said, there are a few general principles I hope you find useful 😁\n\n**General tips:**\n\n1. *Health* So so important, before you start planning any study schedule my number 1 rule is always to take care of yourself. If at any point you feel you need a rest day, give yourself that. Don’t push your limits and burn the midnight oil - scoring good grades is great yea but its not worth sacrificing your health and mental wellbeing for it. I think personally, I try to be realistic with myself and recognise that if I’m tired, the work I’m putting in won’t be productive nor efficient and I’ll end up having to repeat it anyway. That is not to say you use it as an excuse to not put in your best effort, breaks are good only if you promise yourself you’ll come back to whatever it is you’re working on again. It kinda fits pretty nicely with my second point, finding balance.\n2. *Balance* Balance isn’t something I’m great at, its more of a lesson I’ve learnt through my personal experience. To give you a bit of context, I was part of 2 CCAs in both secondary school and JC and it inadvertently led to me being thinly stretched across all my commitments. I learnt pretty late on that overcommitting and saying yes to every event, every request takes a toll on your energy. It hit pretty hard when I felt myself having a lack of awareness of what’s going on around me, in fact my friends even highlighted how often I’d just zone out of conversations because of exhaustion or I’d just find myself dozing off in lectures. Consider it a sort of epiphany when I realised that too much of anything can’t be good for you. It’s important to try to strike that fine balance, know your limitations and stand firm in turning down requests. This really transcends studying and can even be applied to life in general.\n3. *Targeted revision* When planning my study schedule, the very first step I always take is to print out a syllabus document & exam schedule. BE SPECIFIC. Write out what chapters and tested, what topics are inside and big concepts that are critical - Headers, sub-headers, bolded titles in your notes/tb should be a good starting point. I like to have a big picture view of what I need to know and by when I need to know this (i.e. the big day) and this will help you a lot in the next step.\n4. *Dedicate ‘blocks’ for revision* Personally, having a schedule timed down to the minute doesn’t work for me. I’ve tried it many times and I always just end up spending longer on an item only to delay everything that follows and eventually I’ll replan the entire schedule only to find myself spending more time planning what to study than doing any actual studying. For me, I’ve found study blocking to be very useful in helping me stay on track and not get too stressed over the nitty gritty minutes, hours in each day. Simply put I split my day into 3 blocks (Morning, afternoon, night) which usually just correspond to after my meal times. Remember that syllabus document we got? Yeap this is where it comes in. I usually assign each block to a subject - there’s no hard and fast rule. You can have 2 blocks to the same subject a day, all different subjects or even all 3 blocks to a single subject. Point is you space out which days are dedicated to which subjects based on your exam schedule and work backwards from there. Personally the night before any exam will be dedicated to a final pass through of that specific subject(s), everything else is flexible and based largely on the amount of content/topics you have to cover. Once you’re done, fill it up with the specific topics/subtopics you wish to cover during that block. Last step is easier said than done, but follow through on this plan.\n5. *Studying alone vs. Study dates* I think a lot of people wonder if they should study alone/with friends - its quite subjective but my take on this is quite simple. Generally, if its close to the exams (<2weeks) I’d much rather study alone as I can focus better. Its good to meet friends way earlier to get into that momentum of studying and clarify any doubts you have/help one another review important concepts - one thing that really helped was doing practice papers together with friends under a ‘mock exam’ timed scenario, you don’t have to be working on the same paper/subject but just sitting down in a quiet place, setting the timer and simulating a test environment can really help. Additionally, for content heavy subjects (eg. Biology, History) I prefer studying alone as I tend to read out things to myself and don’t wanna disturb my friends.\n\nI struggled with Math and Chemistry the most so a bulk of my revision was spent reviewing these subjects. I’ll delve a bit more into these two for subject based advice.\n\n**Math:**\n\nHonestly, I felt my foundation wasn’t even firm to begin with so trying full practise papers were truly a struggle and only served to trample on my morale. There were 2 things I found useful tho: Doing topical revision & Identifying question types. I split the syllabus by topics (topical TYS really useful for this) & sat down trying to ‘master’ the questions. It’s important to recognise question types for Math, after doing many questions form a particular topic, you’ll realise many of them resemble each other in terms of question phrasing and/or solution strategy. From there, I grouped the questions together and tried to identify how I came to the solution (Or really… how the answer key worked out the solution cause I struggled way too long for each question) In a way its like taking a step back and recognising solution patterns, understanding it, internalising it and practice, practice, practice. I spent a few solid hours everyday working through every question in the TYS in the lead up to A’s and even if I couldn’t solve all the questions in the exams, some method marks really helped here and there.\n\n**Chemistry:**\n\nFunny enough, what I did was in the name itself: Chem-is-try. Yea, I just kept trying papers, doing questions and then from there recognising where I went wrong - doing corrections was a huge part of my Chemistry revision. I’d mark out where I went wrong, any conceptual errors I had and then remind myself over and over to try correcting myself the next time I saw a similar question. Above that, I was quite lucky in that my friends were happy to reteach me topics I didn’t understand or simply missed the classes for because of CCA commitments. Lastly, consultations. I only started booking consultations when my teacher literally forced all the S/U students to book a consult to review our papers. I stayed away simply because I never knew what I didn’t know and so who was I to ask for a consultation when I don’t even know what to ask the teacher? Boy could I not have been more wrong…consultations really taught me to actively seek out what I didn’t know instead of broadly saying ‘I don’t understand anything’, I booked permanent consultations every week so I can review whatever paper I’ve done with my teacher and ask about the corrections or clarify any doubts. In a way, it helped me take ownership of my learning so I have to commit to finishing practise papers each week and do the relevant corrections so I could have something, anything to bring for consults. If at this point anyone is hesitating…I’d say just go book that consult - your teachers want to help you but you’ve got to let them know how they can help you.\n\nSorry its a bit long but if you’ve read till this point thanks for staying haha! Umm..as I mentioned earlier do take my experience with maybe a scoop of salt cause everyone is different, our situations are different and more so COVID has really really thrown a huge curveball our way. Trial & error with what you find useful and I hope you’ll eventually be able to understand your own study style jiayous!!💪🏼💪🏼', 'Hey! I mainly did a lot of practise (both tys & past papers) as mentioned above. But to break it down\n\n**inorganic chem**\n\nConceptual understanding was quite important so I reviewed my school notes to brush up on content knowledge (which was where I felt I lacked after the first few exam papers) before trying them again and just applying the knowledge. It’s really the act of just getting down to doing and applying the knowledge constantly that helped me understand better + retain info\n\n**organic chem**\n\nPretty sure most schools teach by the organic groups (alkanes, alkenes etc.) For me a mega mindmap linking all the reactions didn’t help as much, but my friends highly swear by this so if having everything on one huge mindmap is your style that might be helpful. What I did was make notes for each topic, focusing on understanding the reactions & mechanisms for each group to really get that solid foundation. just keep drawing the mechanisms and when I got to practice questions it was Super useful cause I’d be able to identify ‘ah yes this is an alkanes qn’ and I immediately know which reactions are relevant/possible. That’s really the part on building foundation but trying to tie everything into the full paper is important especially for longer qns where u have to propose mechanisms to get a desired end product - that really just comes with practice papers, the more you do and are exposed it’ll be easier to recognise☺️\n\nYes, my grades improved from mid years to prelims (albeit not as much as I hoped but it was progress nonetheless) I improved two grades from an U -> E so yes it is possible, don’t give up and continue pressing on. Eventually, your foundation will become better and you’ll be able to perform at A’s💪🏼💪🏼', 'Man thanks so much ! Appreciate your very personal insight :D', 'More than welcome👍🏻']"
181,mitochondria_phd,jp2jsc,[RANT] hell week and a levels,2020-11-06 18:03:24,SGExams,77662,3,79,"Hell week has finished yayyy 

In my opinion it was definitely a shitshow, will not recommend again, want to go to JC1 when PW was all I had to worry about, where promos diD not determIne my university and life was more certain. Funtimes, enjoy ur time jc1s.

I don't even want to talk about what happened this week, with waking up at 6:00 am everyday, staring into the abyss that my life has become and packing my entry proof to go to school and sit for 2-3 hours.  

During the 2-3 hours, I spend my time wisely- planning, then replanning, and then telling myself I don't know for a million times, realising noones gonna save me, rereading the question out loud like my teacher does, imitating my teachers style of teaching and eventually write the answer (works when I am less tired) and when they say pens down, regret every decision I made.

Then, I immediately come out of the exam hall, walk away from every SINGLE person, open reddit to comfort myself a bit until I don't, and take the train away from my house in an active attempt to runway from home because of how much of a disappointment I am to my family.

Eventually, I come back home to study for the next paper and sleep for 10 min which becomes the next day and the cycle continued. I am throughly exhausted and on top of this I screwed up my exams, disappointed everyone around me, and of course cambRiDge. 

But at the end of this week, I didn't cry at all, I did horrendously for my papers, but after ever exam, I came out I felt so empty inside and just wanted to study for the next one rather then dwelling on whatever happened in that paper. 

Now, I know everyone must be thinking, this is long, imma go back to studying bio/econs, but oh well ur still here, hi, the significance of not crying is the fact that I feel complete apathy, I want to feel the pain after the exam, it means that I care enough to do well, but I think I became so overwhelmed with the pressure of A levels to the point of apathy and I can't feel it anymore. I feel I'm on autopilot and honestly I'm avoiding this situation: I'm avoiding ppl, my family, lashing out at everyone, running away from my house and just avoiding everything as much as possible. I have become a monster. And  the thing is everyone is NICE TO ME, like my parents, my TeAchers, thE scHoOl. I feel so guilty and awful but oh well, I can't feel it cause I AVOID IT and idk how to face it. I feel so numb, and delusional, and honestly running away from my problems. It's not like I'm doing it deliberately, its just a habit.

Oh well, idk guys, I don't know anymore, found out the world is a evil place and life is pain and suffering, and bad ppl get away with things (thanks gp politics for teaching me AND CAMBRIDGE does not care about the environment) so yea, heres the end of my rant.

Fun seeing my life falling apart and burning into pieces and at the end who caused this: me.

183,ZeroPauper,jgmvr9,Do lecture recordings impede or facilitate learning?,2020-10-23 21:14:25,NTU,13632,24,15,"Edit: The question is not whether you prefer online or physical classes, but whether you think lecture recordings (that are supplementary to physical lectures) will impede or facilitate your learning.

A [comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/jgipqz/profs_english/g9qy23o?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from a HASS student got me thinking about how students from the various faculties view lecture recordings. In that comment, the student who has been in HASS for 3 years has never had a lecture recorded.

I split the poll into the groups due to reddit poll limitations, but feel free to elaborate what course you are from and your thoughts.

**My opinion**

I am from SBS (COS) and all of our lectures are recorded. Although I had posted about the [lacking quality of some of our lecturers](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/adfygy/ntu_doesnt_provide_quality_education_and_heres_why/) in the past, I have to admit that we are lucky in the sense that our lectures are recorded. One of our associate-chair was shocked to hear that other faculties do not record their lectures, given that NTU has had the recording capability and capacity for years now.

Lecture recordings can benefit students by:

* Giving them the autonomy to decide on how to spend their time. They can either choose to travel for hours to attend a live lecture, or use that valuable time to do other things.
* Students can review lectures that sport unintelligible professors as many times as they want to aid their learning
* Professors who can't make it to lecture at the last minute can upload a recording of the previous year's lecture (If the content is still the same) instead of postponing or cancelling the topic

Negative points of lecture recordings **(If you voted for impede, please share your thoughts! I am very interested to understand)**:

* Professors don't get a fully filled lecture hall
* Privacy issues? When discussions happen during lectures, students may feel uncomfortable if they get recorded? Professors are shy to be on camera?
* Makes students lazy - But I would argue that this is a matter of individual discipline and motivation. Lazy students will also be lazy in physical lectures, there's no stopping them from being lazy. This isn't kindergarten where the school should instill discipline and coddle students to achieve a certain trait, we are adults and we should be left to our own devices.

**Predicting the poll results**

I believe that most students would see the benefits of lecture recordings, especially in this and the coming semesters where COVID is around. It gives us the autonomy to take charge of our learning and not miss out if we fall sick, and would deter sick students from attending physical lectures.

My question to the students of faculties who do not record lectures (NBS/HASS): Has anyone feedback to your schools about the issue of not recording lectures?

If my guess is right, an overwhelming proportion of students should be in favor of lecture recordings.

My friends around me all share the same sentiment and absolutely hated it when classes had to be shifted online because there are some things that can only be brought out by the dynamics of a physical discussion (I mean, it’s called HUMANities for a reason).\n\nAlso, adding on to the previous comment about sensitive topics being discussed in HASS mods, Humanities mods often advocate being a safe and comfortable space for discussion. If someone shares something personal, it’s acknowledged that it will not go beyond the confines of the classroom and having lectures recorded defeats that purpose. Unlike STEM majors, the humanities are always grey and never black and white. There is never one correct answer and because of that, we know that our words can be manipulated and used against us, especially when it comes to controversial/socially frowned upon topics.', 'What are the issues with recording lectures when discussions are carried out? Do students feel uncomfortable if they are recorded? Or are the ""lectures"" purely discussion based without slide presentation by the lecturer?', 'Tbh if anything, lecture recordings should be supplementary to physical lectures and not used to replace lectures. If you are skipping physical lectures (like I do), then we have to deal with the shitty video quality and not being able to see laser pointers etc.', 'Are the classes all full of discussion and interaction? \n\nI ask this because I’m taking a LMS module that is also a seminar. And the prof said this to us in the first lesson “I don’t have a choice but to include participation grades, so can everyone speak up at least once in the semester so I can give you your marks”. \n\nAnd she allocates like 30 mins every lecture for a “discussion” and flashes a question on the screen for us to discuss in groups. She then takes a name list and marks the people that speaks. \n\nSome classes are so theoretical based and discussions don’t really add much value to the class, but professors are forced to make it a seminar anyway because of blanket requirements for participation grades.', 'I too prefer physical lectures because they have that human touch. But... the question is not whether you prefer online or physical classes, but whether you think lecture recordings (that are supplementary to physical lectures) will impede or facilitate your learning.', 'There are some mods in HASS where sensitive topics or comments are discussed by both profs and students. The thing about recorded lecture is that someone may purposely edit the video to mislead outsiders.\n\nAnd of course, like what others mentioned, I feel HASS mods need to be attended in person to facilitate discussions. I guess that is whole point of HASS itself.', ""i'd say that yes,some people can get stressed out by recorded lectures, so most of us use the chat function instead of the voice function. our lectures are mostly slide presentation but we get to ask questions also, tutorials and seminars focus more on discussions"", ""Edited to answer your main question \n\nCovid sem = one whole sem of not being able to follow \nwhat the prof is saying because he keeps using laser pointer/visualiser to draw things which is not reflected in the recording. This sem, skipping physical lects is no longer a choice :(\n\nAlso about the shitty buffering, I can speed up the video to 1.5x or 2x to save time but the time it takes to buffer every few minutes just completely cancels out the effect of speeding up. Sometimes I end up wasting more time. The buffering is so annoying\n\nBut to answer your question, recorded lectures definitely facilitate learning, for engineering at least. Because for us some technical concepts are hard to grasp and going back and replaying the vid is definitely useful. I even replay some lectures when studying for finals. There is hardly open-to-the-floor QnA so students don't need to worry about being recorded, unlike in Arts. We can organise our time with more freedom knowing we don't need to be physically present in the pulau NTU, too especially with bad timetables. In my opinion this saves us A LOT of precious time and we can maximise efficiency.\n\nI think physical lectures are more suited for Arts but Engine and Math etc can do fine without physical lects (just that recorded quality should be improved). So whether it's useful or not depends on the major, really. I don't really see the harm in having it as an option for Arts tho. If you still make attendance mandatory then you don't need to worry about half the cohort disappearing. The recorded ones can then be served as backup and for  review before exams (if that's a thing for Arts, cos idk)"", ""for the fluff mods yes... but honestly you don't really learn much because the fluff mods r common sense... class part is really people slutting out n fighting to get the low hanging fruits and giving obvious inputs. very rarely will you get very insightful points from students (there r rare occasion where very good points were raised, but they are far n few)... I'd very much prefer lec-tut style since i really do learn more\n\nfor more technical classes, nope the class is usually dead quiet, and then the tutor keeps trying to encourage people to participate because she needs to give CP... but honestly i think from the tutor's pov they r probably a bit sad since the students aren't really responding so....\n\nEdit: there r some modules like law, which has a high CP component, but honestly i'd rather hear the prof teach"", ""Good point. \n\nHowever, are there some HASS mods that are purely lecture based?

Cons would be that students can't interrupt the professor during the lecture if they are unclear."", 'Maybe try emailing the prof to see if he can consider using the mouse pointer instead. \n\nI agree with you that Arts modules in general benefit more from physical lessons as there is some form of discussion.

184,HardPieceofRock,jxuf8o,"[Rant] Dreams, nightmares, and migraines: my mental/psychological state against As",2020-11-21 02:21:39,SGExams,77662,9,16,"Background: J2, middle of As, but while most of my kakis are like done with As/only have MCQ or H3 left, I still have a good number of written papers left.


I'd not been getting migraines for a while. I'd stopped getting those dreams with all those vivid and nightmarish/phantasmagoric scenarios. I'd not had a non-existent sleep schedule for months.


But then A Level season kicked in and all hell broke loose.


Is it just me, or is there a general correlation between exam seasons and the need for painkillers? Because all of a sudden, I needed paracetamol like everyday just to bear with my migraines and not have them overwhelm me while doing papers or revision. After more than 2 years since my last extended migraine period, and more than 4 months since my previous headache, suddenly, my migraines are kicking in just about every single day. It's so messed up, the pain simply immobilises me cause it hits not just my head, but my eyes also. I've more or less controlled them so it doesn't affect me as much as they used to initially, but it still gets quite bad on worse days.


That being said, I've also been getting really... interesting dreams. I've dreamed of being on crazy long train-themed escape rooms which ended in me unintentionally kicking the back of a random boy's head and yeeting him off a playground resulting in his parents contemplating suing me. I've dreamt of chasing down ambulances into shopping malls which ended in me entering some random food court. I've even dreamt of getting back together with my cheating and manipulative ex. Yesterday, I even dreamt that I was giving a whole stand-up routine to my old secondary school class, of course, I don't recall a single joke I said. Funny enough, I actually didn't have such descriptive and imagerous dreams across this many days in a row for a very long time now, more than 5 years at least, and it's kinda scary how they all pop up like this now.


It's not just about what happens during sleep too, what happens before seems to be affected as well. I actually haven't had a sleep schedule (not that my original sleep schedule was that good either) in a while, especially due to really nasty timetabling for my papers. I wind up sleeping between 2 to 4 for most days, waking up between 10 and 12 as a result (especially for days without papers). Even so, it's been taking a lot longer to fall asleep as well, from my usual 10-15 mins or so to a good rolling in bed for 20-30 mins. It's almost as though my body doesn't want to fall asleep.


Maybe it's stress? I suspect that this (mainly) psychological situation seems to be a manifestation of my underlying mental state of stress as a result of my high expectations towards As and worry over results/upcoming papers in general. But then again, this doesn't help in alleviating my stress much; like when I get migraines, it just makes? me? more? stressed out? since I can't spend the time I'm forced to lie down? studying more?


At this point, I'm just hoping that things can pass smoothly and that the rest of my papers can go without a hitch. A lot of my subjects have been wild rides without much of a good end forseeable, and I hope that this onset of strange sleeping and migraine occurences won't afffect me any more than it should.

Please do not be alarmed by what I am about to say. I am just considering possibilities. Including the 0.1% ones.\n\nGiven what you said, I highly recommend that, when you have some time, even in between papers, go to the doctor's and tell him/her your entire condition. Or at least get some relief meds.\n\nIf you cannot do that, or do not wish to do that until your papers are all over, then that's fine too. But please remember to go and see a doctor, even after the papers, even after you feel better.\n\nIf you can, write a little diary of your experiences down, so that during the doctor's consultation, you can more accurately describe and re-tell your situation to the doctor.\n\nVery likely, it is nothing, just stress.

I relate to the sleeping problems  which i had only this year and can only assume it is due to stress? i started to take a lot longer to fall asleep/waking up in the middle fo the night then cannot fall back asleep. Whats worse was that the week before the main papers there were a few nights i didnt sleep at all. So my advice is if this problem persists during this period of time then you can take some sleep supplements like melatonin or valerian root extract pills. Theyre both ok to take in the short term so as long as u only take during As period to help tide u through the next week or so then there shld be no negative health effects (pls read up first tho HAHAHA).

Amrin Amin. (Now former) MP for PAP in Sembawang. Part of PAP's team of Sengkang candidates. Fairly new to politics and came in after his win in 2015. Also senior parlimentary secretary.

When WP won Sengkang last night the sentiment on the sub was overwhelmingly positive, and many celebrated the ousting of the PAP candidates contesting the GRC. However, there was also a surprisingly large number of people expressing regret over the loss of Amrin, which goes to show that he was pretty clearly well-liked, moreso than his fellow candidates.

187,Carrotkakez,i0kj9m,What is your general advice for teenagers. Both financial and educational wise,2020-07-30 19:38:41,singapore,378641,78,45,"So Im still very young like 16. I have been starting to think about my future. I feel like adults give the best advice but sometimes we as children don't listen or take them seriously. So I just want to know what is some advice which you can give to me. Can be about anything :). I hope this doesn't break the guidelines

Edit: Thank you for the overwhelming response. I am grateful that you took the time and tried helping a teen who is a lost and is seeking help. I read every advice with an open mind and have a changed mindset",0.85,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/i0kj9m/what_is_your_general_advice_for_teenagers_both/,"['People are mostly advising you what to do so here’s some advise on what NOT to do.....\n\nDon’t fall for pyramid schemes or anything that sounds too good to be true. This is especially so when the person pitching to you is your friend/relative. \n\nDon’t splurge on your girlfriend. You will very likely want to do so to “show your love” but it’s a terrible idea. A Gucci bag here, a holiday there and soon you’re left with an empty bank account and no girlfriend. \n\nDon’t try to keep up with the Joneses. Following the latest trends and fads is a trap and you will end up wondering why you wasted so much money on useless things years later. \n\nDon’t lend money unless you’re willing to give it away. Friends will ask you for help but don’t expect that you will get your money back – If you really have to lend money, keep it to an amount that won’t hurt you if you never see it again.', '[deleted]', ""Invest in yourself. Invest in skills and experiences. \nGrades doesn't define you but how you earn your grades does."", 'OP, I’m sure everyone here is sharing their experiences and interests here in good faith. Be reminded that everyone’s opinions, mine included, are tainted by our own beliefs and experiences. Also, more upvotes means the opinion is more popular. It doesn’t mean it is the right opinion. Exercise your own judgment, or hopefully, talk to someone about it. \n\nAs an example, a pragmatic person might ask you to work hard at all costs while a happy go lucky person says follow your passion. As with many things the truth in this case lies somewhere in the region of “it depends on your circumstances”.\n\nI’ll take a stab at a few can’t-go-wrong pieces, probably condensing too much into too few words:\n\n1. If you have people you respect around you, take them into your counsel, while acknowledging that they, and their viewpoints are flawed. Different people have different strengths, and your job is to learn and piece together all these strengths into something that is uniquely “you”. Find more of these people you respect, associate with them, and learn and grow together. Some may be friends, some may be elders or family members, and some may be what you’d consider mentors.\n\n2. Take up different experiences, find your different passions. The benefit of a passion is not that you “do what you like”. In terms of success, you are simply more likely to stick with something you feel passionate about. If you stick with it, you get good at it, and now you and your skill are valuable to society. More than that, it has been proven scientifically, many times over, that people are happiest when they feel both valued and passionate about what they do. What is passion really? It is when you feel engaged in what you do, because you’re good at it, and recognized by other people (and yourself) for it. It’s that simple. Get good at many things, then get really good at one thing (which will become your career). You will feel happy and fulfilled.\n\n3. Build a support network around you of people that you can trust, and whom trust you in return. This group doesn’t have to be big, especially at the start. It may even just be one person. But look to expand it. These are the people you will find yourself turning to in times of stress and difficulty, for help, and for emotional support. It will help you carry on strong through life.\n\n4. Consider your finances. Money is necessary if you want a happy life. How much do you need at each stage for your goals? Most importantly, consider where you plan to get income. For most of us, that comes from being really good at a technical skill or capability that pays well. See my point on passion. That is the most important thing. Otherwise, control your spending within your means. Spend wisely. There isn’t a magic number you have to save or spend. It depends on what you’re saving for and what you are spending on. As for investment and financial advice, there are plenty of books you can look up and read. Take your time with that. CPF and all that is not what you should focus on at this stage.\n\n5. Consider in totality what’s important to you. Does family come first? What’s next? What are the wildly important things to you? Work on the things that will take you there. Also accept that you (and your priorities and character and strengths and weaknesses) are not perfect and will grow and shift over time. Don’t assign yourself labels like being bad at this or that. Embrace hard work, focus on your current values, and learn and grow as you go.\n\n6. Enjoy your life. This doesn’t mean going wild, partying, playing games and all that. In moderation, everything is fine. I enjoy a good drink or a party myself. But too much is destructive of your life and relationships. What I mean is to treat life with a positive, cautiously optimistic attitude, while enjoying and being grateful for each moment. No one owes any of us a living. Not even your parents. So if they do something to your benefit, be grateful. If something great happens to you, celebrate it. If something is tough to handle, enjoy the experience and the chance to learn.\n\nWhen I was 16, I never asked these questions. I think you should be proud of yourself for these questions OP, and take things step by step forward.', 'start gathering experiences\n\nwork during holidays, go on that random camp, sign up for random classes, volunteer if you have the time, help your family members with random shit, talk to people you find interesting, tweet, tag, post on the topics you are interested in, travel if you can afford it, develop that thick skin to ask for things you want\n\nits all gonna make sense one day. but you are not gonna get any insights from staying at home and playing dota 2 or just studying the sch text book', 'Lots of people can give you good advice that works for them. But you have to do your due diligence so see if it’s going to work for you. Don’t jump on some investment plan just because they say it works etc. \n\nAlso, don’t save to an extreme extent where it negatively affects your health and quality of life. If you need a good chair, spend on it. If you need a better pillow, get it. Don’t eat too much junk just because it’s convenient and cheap. Health is very hard to maintain once you get older. It’s easy to feel invincible when you’re young, but a pain in the ass to undo years of bad habits.', ""If you go poly or uni, you will only use 5% of what you learnt in school once you go to work. But that 5% is enough to give you a leg up during your learning and job hunt phases, too. Unless you academia, then you'll probably have more us of your degree.\n\nFor finance, plan your budget monthly. It'll give you the kick in the ass that's necessary to make you work harder in life if you don't have rich parents."", 'For educational and work, just follow your passion. Be emotionally happy, not materialistic happy.\n\nFor financial, put your savings in cpf sa, etf, platform like stashaway etc. Can go read up more. 30 years later high chance can have 1m.

Knowing that time is on my side, here's what I thought I would do. \n\nTake a piece of paper and write down all I know about myself. Make it comprehensive. Be brutally honest:\n\n* I am 16\n* I am great at math\n* I am socially awkward\n* I love fast cars\n* I suck at Chinese\n* I am a little overweight\n* I am good with money\n* etc etc\n\nFrom there I will probably know what jobs suits me in future. In this example, maybe an F1 mechanic. This will guide me to what course I should pursue. Pick one job possibility. It doesn't have to be the top or even the correct choice eventually. The idea is to practice pursuing a goal. Every day do one thing toward that goal. Seek help. Read up. Join online discussions. Visit a track. Life changes, I may not end up being a mechanic eventually, but the experience will help me learn working towards a goal that matters eventually.\n\nAs I am living in a capitalist society, I need capital to make it financially. I'll have a budget and make sure I spend within my means. Since I'm still staying with my parents I'll save as much as I can. I may not know what to do with the savings yet, but having a sizable savings will put me in a good place.

Turns out maybe even this isn't that much of an unpopular opinion now, compared to just a week before when people were still defending the pre-CB queues at IKEA, Toys""R""Us, Popular and supermarkets. But then again, we have [comments](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/fycxhb/unpopular_opinion_the_longer_we_as_a_nation_take/fmzeyce?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x) agreeing on how it's okay to still head out because jogging is still legal and also lurkers who don't agree with the outspoken individuals in this sub. 4.9k people online now, but most are lurkers who don't post, this thread is dedicated to them. Unpopular or not? Depends on how you see it.

Yes I get it, cooping ourselves up at home is depressing, suffocating and boring. A small minority of us face legitimate issues such as domestic abuse & mental issues, but for the overwhelming majority the choice between death and boredom should be a simple one (For those who want to argue that it's an exaggeration, please educate yourself with how other badly hit countries are faring). I would say that a majority of us are doing our part by staying at home but it's not enough, everyone has to play a part.

We have to face the facts, COVID-19 isn't going to magically disappear unless we take drastic measures. The only effective way to combat COVID-19 in its accelerating phase is to isolate everyone from each other, it has been proven in Italy and China where their curve is slowly flattening.

This is a extremely unpopular opinion in this sub, but I will still say it: The only reasons you should leave your house are: You're working an essential job, you need groceries/food, you need medical help. The crowding at wet markets and supermarkets is understandable, given that we all need food to sustain ourselves. Some measures that we can take to reduce congestion at markets:

* Boosting grocery delivering services (or making it free altogether)
* Mindset shift of people who cook to shift towards simple foods that can last long (E.g. frozen meat & veg, pasta, canned food, pasteurized eggs)
* Doing an Italy and limiting grocery runs per household
* Helping wet markets set up delivery orders

&#x200B;

If it's still not clear after reading the above, maybe we should take a look at some case studies.

Many took the opportunity to go out ""one last time"" to meet their friends. The effects of such actions will be clearer in the coming weeks.

I wish I could give everyone the benefit of doubt and say they're just trying to find workarounds to make their lives more ""normal"" (but there's nothing normal about a pandemic right?) and they're not actively looking for loopholes. But the evidence against that is overwhelming. People are finding every single excuse to leave their houses.

Allowing people to exercise has resulted in the opposite effect from preventing people from gathering. Suddenly everyone is a marathon runner and heading to parks to run. Regular joggers have mentioned that they've seen a sharp increase in unfamiliar faces in parks, also families with kids and elderly strolling around.

The official reason was to ""protect the elderly"", but I'm sure it's pretty obvious what caused the crackdown on this. Non-essential workers who can't handle their own kids (i'm not saying it's easy to handle kids while working but there are parents who can handle it well) that abused the system, now essential workers with kids have to suffer at the hands of irresponsible non-essential workers.

While not the original reason I made the post, it's important to realise why others may not feel the same way as you. There is only one word to sum it up. **Expectations**. Everybody will have different expectations on what kind of grades they will get. Some people can get a L1R5 of 20+ and still be overjoyed because it was an improvement, some will be utterly disappointed.

Thus, it's all relative to the actual person. **Are you happy with your prelim results?** Will it get you into your choice school/ course? If you are still unsure, look at your JAE booklet for the cut off points for the courses or schools you are interested in.

If you are happy, then maintain your score! Don't be complacent, continue to do your TYS and practice papers.

If you aren't happy with your results, then you need to work harder! You can ask this sub, the Discord or Telegram group chats (you can find the links in the sidebar) about how to improve for a certain subject.

Which brings me to my main point, **search the sub first for previous posts that others may have made**. Many times, these posts are still relevant and can help you! Duplicate posts simply make the job of the mods more difficult and clogs up the sub.

We can all work together to keep the posts on this sub of a decent quality.

They like to say Singapore has nothing to do, there are no interesting people and there are no interesting places to go to. 

Not being overly sentimental, but I think Singapore is fine the way it is. In fact, I love it. There are beautiful sights to catch - sunsets, skylines, nature parks etc. Have you ever tried taking a stroll in the CBD at night? It’s a very surreal experience to wander on empty streets surrounded by towering frames of glass and steel that are gently illuminated by the orange neon. I don’t think anyone can get that experience in other countries without being overwhelmed by crowded tourist traps or bright piercing lights that are a real cacophony.

And who says there aren’t interesting places to go? If one is adventurous enough to explore the more rural roads, you can find those small nuggets that are the SAF’s bases, like school of ammo in Rifle Range or ST Kinetics building in the middle of the jungle right outside the central catchment area. Gombak used to have a trekking path that cuts into MINDEF’s small hill (but sadly it closed cuz of erosion).

Also, the geography of the island. Ohhh the geography. The diamond shape is such beautiful geography. One moment you are in bukit batok, the next you are in Clementi after walking about 45 minutes. Walk further and you reach the sea. Walk along the coast and you reach Downtown. It’s homely with all the neighbourhoods nicely and conveniently situated next to each other. In any other country, there would be no limits to the urban area and sometimes, there is just a town sitting in the middle of vast hinterlands. Singapore is just like a video game map, something out of GTA.

In most cases, the best way to appreciate Singapore more is to leave her shores for a while and travel overseas on a free and easy basis. **NO TOURS!** Tours give you a distorted and sanitised experience.

Many cities, larger and smaller than Singapore, are much more vibrant - there are community initiatives sprouting up, grassroots action, local pop-up markets where locals sell their own crafts or homegrown food, mini festivals. In Singapore, event of any sort tends to have a 'government stamp' across it. These tend to be highly budgeted and organised - printed banners, stallholders with considerable budget etc. So they tend to be more economic and commercial in nature - after all, they have to appeal to the broader segment in order to make their rent.   \n\n\nBy contrast, other cities that are not so strictly controlled tend to:\n\n* Feature more creative work\n* Feature causes close to the community's heart (e.g. adopt a dog)\n* Be by the community for the community (e.g. organic homegrown produce, homemade pastries, small artisan work)\n* Affordable or free (Karaoke for old folks at void decks charge $2 per pop.

The best thing expats will say about Singapore is that you can travel easily i.e. get the hell out of there on the weekend. Here is my, what will be perceived to be very negative, list of why Singapore is ""boring"" not ""bad"". Again these things aren\'t exclusive to Singapore but when taken as a whole... things add up:\n\n* One season\n* Lack of nature. MacRitchie doesn\'t count, sorry folks, even HK has much more nature, hiking trails, etc. than Singapore. In fact, HK might be one of the best urban areas in the world for this.\n* Cuisine and cuisine experience still doesn\'t stack up with other big cities. Not even close.\n* Too sterile and clean. You can be clean without being sterile, look at Japan, Korea, etc.\n* Lack of world events. No big sporting events. I am a huge F1 fan, and the GP is organized quite well, but that\'s about it... and as far as races go it\'s one of the most boring on the calendar (it\'s essentially a parade from a racing perspective). There\'s also a general lack of infrastructure to support great events. Kallang Stadium is subpar on the world stage.\n* The city lacks an ""edge"" or a ""soul"" as some westerners would call it. This probably brings Singapore a lot of tangible benefits as well. But we are discussing fun vs. boring. It\'s boring.\n\nSo this doesn\'t mean Singapore is bad, but if I were a 20-25 year old looking for my first experience abroad, Singapore would be at the very bottom of my list. Probably the same between 25-30. Now, over 30 is different because your priorities change. Seeking new experiences dies down a bit, and you focus more on close friends/relationships, family, career, etc and Singapore is a great place for these things.', 'Yeah, until the novelty wears off.

I can\'t do that in Singapore.\n\nThe hobbies I want to do, like woodworking, building things, experimenting on stuff like on TKOR are very difficult to do. The laws are very prohibitive, and I don\'t have the space to do them.\n\nSingapore also doesn\'t have seasons. I would like to experience things like Winter and Autumn. \n\nAlso, maybe it\'s just me, and I hope not to offend anyone, but the people are quite boring as well. Everyone thinks the same way, and want to do the same things (travelling, shopping, looking for ""bargains"", etc).\n\nI don\'t hate Singapore, but I do find that it\'s very restrictive.', 'Well for me, I’m intrigued by gothic western architectures and natural landscapes that SG lacks.

Even then it\'s not completely void, as OP has given some excellent examples. Our small size definitely hampers the amount of activities and the variety of them.\n\nHowever, to say it\'s completely boring is also not true. Last weekend I spent time at the National Museum on two different exhibitions, and the week before had a great time at GameStart\'s board games section. It was no Origin but I still had fun. Last year I attended a living room concert, and let me tell you, listening to a talented singer without amplification is a very moving experience, one that everyone should try to experience if possible.\n\nThe thing is that, I had to have exposure for all of the above and grow interest in them  over the course of my life time. The two exhibitions I saw were related to photography and history, and gaming in all forms has been a huge part of my life growing up. Finding out about the local music scene was through a couple of people as acquaintances I met over the course of work.\n\nI think the main issue is that Singaporeans can be very boring themselves. If you have no interests or hobbies beyond watching TV and going shopping, then the above things I mentioned would\'ve sounded boring to you. ""National Museum interesting meh?"", I can hear the complaints already. ""GameStart so small, can compare meh?""\n\nThe other thing is that many Singaporeans like their experiences ready-made and packaged for them. Sorry to say, but many of the big events you hear about in other countries grew from small grassroots affairs. If you want something to happen, you have to do your part as well.\n\nThe final thing is that I think, like I mentioned in the daily thread, is that we generally like a sense of curiosity and discovery. If we just expect to sit and wait for things to happen, nothing is going to happen. Go out and discover new things, both within and without. Without growth life will be very boring.', ""It's fine... But you are still trapped in the small city. You cant compare urban exploring to being able to drive to the countryside, being able to go camping next to beautiful streams without dying of sweat and mosquitos."", 'Singaporean here. Lived in NYC for 17 years (but visited Singapore every year since 2002) and have travelled to over 30 countries....\n\nIMHO (and echoing the most upvoted responses), Singapore “feels” boring because it lacks a lot of soul-nourishing intangibles that make life “fun”, like:\n\n- Vistas of nature, e.g. mountains, flowing rivers, wildlife. Humans are programmed by evolution to love nature because it’s the wellspring for life. Different people from big cities to small African tribes react differently to man-made objects but everyone (regardless of religion, wealth, ethnicity, etc) reacts positively to beautiful vistas of nature, and we simply don’t have a lot of this in Singapore. \n\n- Seasons, e.g. snow, spring flowers, fall foliage. It’s almost a metaphor for life itself. Singapore’s hot and humid climate near the equator is considered “oppressive” to human comfort. In fact, the vast majority of humans live in sub-tropical and temperate zones, and virtually all major cities (with more than 5m pop) are outside the equatorial zone. So, Singapore’s climate is unusual for a big city, and despite the abundance of parks and green space in Singapore, the climate deters the enjoyment of the outdoors.\n\n- Static culture and social milieu. Singapore has a very strong culture for work and economic success because of the government’s social engineering. This is good for building wealth but the culture of play is neglected (or suppressed). There is a very strong sense that play should serve a bigger purpose other than enjoyment itself, and most Singaporeans I know prioritize work over play - this is actually the opposite of “fun” cultures (eg US, Southern Europe, South America) where people work to play. Singaporeans also frequently feel judged (by peers, family and society) so there is a lot of self-restraint and self-consciousness. Orderly behavior is encouraged...\n\n- Limited diversity. Yes, Singapore is multi-ethnic but our way of life is oddly homogeneous across ethnicities. Also, success in Singapore is narrowly defined and synonymous with economic success. In NYC (for contrast, but also true in other big cities), everyone celebrates many forms of success, eg sports, performing artists, fashion design, cookery, music, etc. The tacit agreement is everyone will pursue what they like and we can all enjoy the fruits of the diverse pursuits in museums, Broadway, film, fashion, restaurants, sports, etc. It feels “fun” to experience other people’s dreams and ambitions because they are so different from your own!\n\nTL;DR Singapore feels “boring” because the climate (socioeconomic, equatorial, cultural) is highly homogenized. While we enjoy a very high standard of physical comforts, we’re short of the intangibles that make humans feel alive.', 'My two cents as foreigner who lived in Russia, Poland, Germany and US and also visited a decent amount of countries:\n\ntl/dr: it’s even more boring in most other cities, you just don’t realize it.\n\n- Even the most exciting city in the world will feel boring if you live there your whole life.\n\n- Singapore, based on my experience, has plenty of things to do compared to most cities out there, big or small. And it seems like there’s always something new happening or getting built.\n\n- I miss nature getaways but flights are cheap and quick, so nothing prevents you from going to the nearby countries. People see European mountains and for whatever reason assume that they’re easily accessible to anyone within minutes. You still have to find transportation, gather some people to save on gas and/or hotels, find time, etc. It’s not like every European lives next to a mountain, quite the opposite actually. Nature “within your country borders” means absolute shit if your country is thousands of kilometers wide.\n\n- Sterile? Lmao, have you stayed in literally any European city for more than a few days? Because that goes stale REALLY quick.\n\n- Some people mention movies? It’s all the same screenings everywhere wtf? At least Singapore has a decent selection of asian films to offer, while everywhere else it is mostly Hollywood and maybe a couple of local flicks.\n\n- the only major thing that is missing here is concert and festival culture. That is huge and can’t be replaced by anything.', ""Singapore is interesting for the first few days or weeks. After the novelty wears off, you would realise it's claustrophobic and very man-made.

I love astronomy, and initially the easy access to dark skies was amazing, but now I\'d very much rather be in Singapore. I\'d still have easy access to Bintan or Kota Tinggi anyway. Even Chicago seemed a little boring after a while (ie. not worth the \\~3 hour drive). The touristy attractions (navy pier, Shedd, etc.) feel like a poor man\'s version of comparable attractions in Singapore, and while the food culture is similarly diverse, it feels overly anglo-centric. Getting good Chinese, Korean, or Japanese food is not impossible but you definitely have to go out of your way. Even the pizza gets boring. The only thing I really love about Chicago is the Art Institute.\n\nOn top of that, in Singapore, you can hop on a plane and go to a completely different culture on a whim. You don\'t even have to be rich, a weekend in Thailand costs a few hundred; something any middle-class individual could splurge on once in a while. This sounds silly; after all, how is ease of travel a benefit of Singapore? The thing is, though, if you live in a larger country (US, China, India), are surrounded by larger countries (Korea, Japan), or just live far from all but a couple countries (Aus, NZ, or even worse, Hawaii), travel tends to be prohibitively expensive. If I wanted to get out of the US and go to a place that actually feels like a different culture, and I have a budget of under a thousand SGD, I have one choice: Mexico. Sure, the US is more diverse, but the difference between California and Indiana isn\'t even as big as Singapore and Thailand.\n\nI can see how Singapore would be considered boring for people who just really fucking love mountains and snow, or who have lived in another country for less than a year and haven\'t gotten over the honeymoon phase yet.

To them SG is this jammed packed island of attractions (even though they only went to MBS/Sentosa area lol).

Like others have mentioned, try walking for more than 30 mins outdoors and you'll probably end up desiring to rush to the nearest aircon shopping centre. The heat and humidity just kills whatever outdoor enthusiasm you have. And most of the time, you'd just wish you stayed at home. Which brings up the next problem. Every shopping centre now seems to be just copy and pasted. Same shops everywhere. The old, unique ones like Sim Lim Square are dying off.

Maybe because everything is said so matter-of-factly or because all we do is complain, it seems very sterile on a superficial level. But I like the repression and the passive aggressiveness because there are always underlying tensions or dynamics beneath daily communication (or miscomm). These tensions depend on the social configuration or on the context or space that the conversation is happening in. Then it’s up to my imagination to fill in the blanks and to observe people’s behaviour to see if they really do what they say, or say what they do.

And probably also to save your sanity because Singapore is really way too small. What definitely makes it seem sterile is the convenience and size. Seems to me most people’s experiences fall into a very limited band, and so there’s no way of knowing what’s very fun or amazing or creative because we conversely don’t know the meaning of very lacking or very poor or suffering.

Compare this to our other neighbours like Bangkok or even Jakarta.

Every shopping mall is basically the same as every other, just skinned a little differently (Thanks CapitaMall), every bar feels the same, with similar music or similar offerings.

I think Singapore controls its busking laws so only buskers of a 'certain presentation' are permitted? (Pls correct me if I'm wrong) Anyhow, even if it's not street life, the permitted presentations of a Singaporean culture in Singapore are also archaic, tokenistic and driven top-down; they don't bear any meaning for us, and we become disengaged with our very own culture.\n\nIn South Korea, I've seen bold interpretations of their traditions and culture, and the place feels throbbing with life. Some examples:\n\n\\- The language-less performances mixing comedy and Korean cooking/taekwando/Korean modern and traditional music/breakdancing/drawing.\n\n\\- The modern interpretation of the hanbok, resulting in both tourists and locals running around Korean cities in hanbok, simulating scenes from Goryeo and beyond --- This is a very new innovation that has only emerged less than 10 years ago. When you wear a hanbok, you get free entry to the palace -- what a wonderful way for the hanbok makers to make a comeback, for local economy to thrive, and to differentiate Korea from other countries.\n\n\\- Local takewando groups doing performances just to share the art and to invite participants\n\nNote these are just the completely apolitical places/activities. From these, you can see how the locals live, what they thrive on, the new occupations they can take up, the local economic activities, their history and culture.\n\nOn the other hand - take Kampong Glam for example - besides the rehashed narrative about it being the place for Malay, Bugis and Arab communities (and mind you, that narrative would neccessarily mean giving thanks to our coloniser Raffles) - so what about it? It's been the same substantially for the 40 years I've been alive. Eateries, clothing boutiques, some museum, a mosque. If you've been there once, there's really no reason to go back. (I did attend a small festival and haven't been there for a long time, so pls correct me if I'm wrong). Same for many places in Singapore. It's really hard for a person to spend 10 yrs, let alone their entire lives, in a place that remains stagnant in essence. I can visit London 10 times a year for 10 years - this is the kind of place that wouldn't be classified by their residents as 'boring' or 'sterile'.\n\nIn many countries I've been to, while there are pockets of expensive dining/shopping areas, there are streets that mix both fine dining/shopping with cheaper ones. I find the segregation much more acute in Singapore (e.g. Dempsey, Clarke Quay versus Kampong Glam, Chinatown ). The mix of crowds then becomes very homogeneous, and the experience is flat, dead.\n\nThe sense of what life can be, what Singapore can be, who Singaporeans can be is severely absent. Add to that, the people are constantly getting undermined (Singaporeans are ugly, they don't deserve nice things, their English is bad, their Chinese is bad, they are complainers) and that the boldest of our dreams is to have Jewel shopping mall, it really feels like Singapore is nothing but a hollow shell lacking meaning for its meaningless people. \n\nMaybe the issue is not that Singapore feels boring -- but that it feels empty."", 'I feel this.

Gets annoyed if you treat the house like a place to sleep. I mean it’s not like the stuff you want to do is illegal or cause harm, but still some parents are like that.

University-provided accommodation is S$400-500ish a month, which is a good price as I\'m charged $375 a month for staying in a non-air conditioned single room in NTU. Food prices were S$50-100 a week. Granted, I have to cook everyday, but that becomes a healthier and tastier option anyways. Other costs that I had was transport - I had to pay I think a S$450-ish for a year of public transport half-fare, some administration fees, and travel fare whenever I travel on the weekends. \n\nSo in other words, for living in a Swiss town, based on my own experience, I survived on about S$500-600 a month, which is similar to that in Singapore. Of course, these costs leave the price of education unfactored, and if you consider the cheaper prices of education at certain European countries, you are actually living on less. And of course, if you factor the fact that Switzerland is one of the most expensive countries in Europe, and the world, you can actually do it significantly cheaper in countries like Germany, Czech Republic, Hungary, Ukraine, etc.\n\nAlso, not to mention, Switzerland at least, and perhaps other countries, can have students working ""50% - 80%"" while studying. I was attached to a research facility of an university, and my supervisor had his masters student working 50% of a full time contract, with 50% of full time pay, which is obviously livable.\n\nSo yeah, in conclusion, I disagree with your sentiment that studying overseas is for people who are from more well to do families, because I studied in Singapore and still am left with a sizable debt as I took CPF Education Loan.

I am a foreigner soon to move in Singapore and I found this reasoning pretty lame. I expect Singapore to be a city and to enjoy it for what it is . Not for what  I expected it to be for my own satisfaction ...', 'Walk around on the park connectors perhaps?', 'So true', 'Howtf u find this comment even 😂', 'That is still wrong. Take ETH, an international Bachelor student pays CHF 650 which is about SGD 1,000 a semester. NTU charges SGD 4,000 a semester for your reference. Like I’ve said, most European countries have cheaper education than Singapore. I took ETH as reference because it is a top 10 university according to the famous ranking (but the ranking itself is quite flawed IMO if we are talking quality of education), Switzerland is one of the most expensive places, and is similar to Singapore in some sense. \n\nThe only expensive universities in Europe for international students are mainly in UK, Ireland and some Scandinavian countries. Norway, Germany, Czech Republic offers free bachelor’s (first bachelor’s if I’m not wrong). Italy charges €1,500 per YEAR regardless of EU citizenship. That’s just off the top of my head some notable countries with good universities. \n\nLike I’ve said, I included living expenses for studying/doing an internship in Switzerland. It is comparable to Singapore. The only cost difference would be tuition fees, and as I’ve already mentioned, is higher in Singapore. The only drawback is like you mentioned, you might have to pay a certain amount first, but that is the same case with all universities, even in Singapore. Only difference is that you can use CPF Loan for most middle to lower class families (this is what I did as well). You can always take a loan from the bank, and from my understanding, most European countries value education highly and some even want to attract students to study there, so there are many help available (see Hungary’s monthly allowance stipend).\n\nBack to your concern of language, which might be the only valid concern here. Yes, it’s true that language might be a problem, but there are actually quite a lot of programs and courses taught in English. You might be surprised at how well Europeans speak English despite it being their second or even third languages. I have met many Swiss, Germans, Romanians, etc who speak way better English as their second or third language compared to Singaporeans who arguably has English as their first. Also, studying within other EU nations as EU citizens is a big thing and obviously the common and popular programs are taught in the common languages, which is to say English, German or French. So suffice to say, you won’t be spoilt for choice, courses language-wise like in Singapore, but you won’t be struggling to learn everything in a foreign language either.\n\nAlso, your last paragraph. As I’ve already demonstrated, nobody is asking you to fork out 40K euros upfront lol. What makes you think the university fee paying overseas works any differently than in Singapore? Essentially at least 30k of that supposed 40k is from daily expenses. You don’t pay 30k sgd upfront in Singapore and then live for free for 4 years right? The reason why Singaporeans don’t do this is another sociological topic worth a separate discussion, but from observations, basically:\n\n1. Singapore is a safe bubble and many people think Singapore is the best (arguable, but still one of the best in the world), so they do not dare or care to venture outside - fair enough\n2. Misinformation - a lot of them think that overseas universities are crazy expensive - that is true to a certain extent - US colleges and UK universities are the crazy expensive ones that people are terrified of. They also think that non English speaking countries have courses in different languages. That isn’t really true... the world is getting increasingly globalized, there are many MNCs that employ natives from different countries - Germany, China, Russia, EMEA, etc, and all of them communicate well enough in their respective functions and technical expertise, sometimes in *gasp* English. \n3. Rankings - Singaporeans culturally and conventionally look at rankings and numbers and figures. Especially because NTU and NUS are ranked quite high globally, they set it as a baseline, and as such, the only few universities that are around this level are the Ivy League schools in US, Cambridge, Oxford, etc in UK, ETH in Switzerland, Peking and Tsinghua in Asia, etc., thus they do not look further beyond these universities, of which many are super duper expensive. However the caveat is that they do not understand the metrics used in determining the ranking. In my limited experience, I am of the sentiment that despite possibly being ranked lower than Singapore, most European students I feel are “better” than Singaporean students in quite a few aspects, especially soft skills, only losing to us perhaps in examinations. Of course this is just an observation, and I might be dead wrong, but if you haven’t had such an experience, I urge you to reach out and judge for yourself if you have the chance! It’s always great to experience the other parts of the world and learn from a counterpart elsewhere. \n4. Some of these families are not as well to do due to certain financial circumstances that render an aspiring student unable to leave their family for a prolonged period of time.', 'Hello, the toilet bowl would like a word with him too.', 'And I assume the idea/theory/topic you are referring is ""That everybody has their own opinions and preferences"". If you really want to make it an argument, which side are you taking, since I am apparently on every side.\n\nI don\'t think its considered ""chill"", when your first thought is that I am trying to get in an argument with people who considers Singapore exciting...\n\nThen you would have to compare city-states with city-states, by your logic, and not cities. Just FYI, I\'m perfectly alright with comparing Singapore and any-sized habitant.\n\nI already stated, my interest is mostly in grand nature. Lets use my original example, Switzerland Alps. Wait, there isn\'t a single mountain in Singapore. Many people also have stated good reasons such as having four seasons. If you really need me to explain the nature difference between Singapore and seasonal/nature countries like Switzerland, please use Google instead.\n\nI\'m perfectly fine with a discussion, if anything that would be ideal. Though I would point out its your choice of words that stated it is an argument.', 'I\'m Singaporean so I\'m afraid you\'ll find that not everyone has the luxury of choosing Singapore for ""lame"" reasons.', 'Later kena buang by PMD', 'Was googling “reddit sg why sg so boring” 😂', 'Okay. Your points are very valid and I appreciate the extensive write up. Maybe Im just oversimplifying and generalizing the old trope of only scholars or the well\noff are able to study overseas. I’m of the older millennial generation and it was that way when I was in my late teens/early 20s.', 'No worries, I enjoyed the exchange and hearing from a different perspective. I was of a similar mindset until I went over and I realized how entitled and sheltered most Singaporeans are (anecdotal experience of course). It broadened my perspective and made me appreciate what I have more.\n\nHow old are you, if I may ask?']"

* Study smart and not hard: I belong to the group that struggle with O level but excel for A levels. How to study smart (easiest way) - prepare for topics ahead of class, listen in class, do your homework, revise and recap.
* On handling stress and emotions: If you are feeling overwhelmed, find someone suitable to talk to or do a rant here. The community is really good here. Important emotions to manage: self-doubt, imposter syndrome, anxiety. 

In Junior college

* Learn how to be confident of myself and succeed in scholarship interview. I did well for A level but that’s because I invested so much time in my studies. The funny part about 2 years of hardcore mugging? It is not about the struggle with exam stress and syllabus. It’s the struggle with choosing my major and being calm for my scholarship interview (prepared super hard but failed)

In university

* Learn how to manage my finances: It’s really cool to start working after O levels and earned some pocket money. This is the moment where I splurged and didn’t save much. As a student, we don’t really spend much time managing our expenses because we are so occupied with studies. So I only learn how to be more savvy with my money AFTER university. Read some personal finance blogs during your free time, learn some basic finance101 (where to put your savings, be wary when it comes to parting with $, do your research)

195,chemisdie,j5q6x9,[A levels] JC...,2020-10-06 03:35:00,SGExams,77662,9,90,"Where do I even start...

It’s 3am right now. I had my H2 bio and math promo papers yesterday (idk who the hell thought it was a good idea to put those together, i was SO tired). I came home, ate and passed out on the floor and foung myself panicking when I woke up at 2.13am. I completely messed up my math paper. I didnt do most of the questions. For bio, I studied for it throughout the weekend because I was doing better in bio anyways so I thought it was more worth the last-minute mugging. In 6 hours, I will be doing my H2 chem paper and I’m so ineffably unprepared.

This year in 2 words- shit. show.

I came into JC feeling anticipation. Little did I know that JC was just the beginning of the downfall of my entire life. I never was a consistent worker, but my results all throughout secondary school were excellent. Last minute cramming was sufficient to get by back then. That was the studying method I used all through sec school and for my O levels. I did well and got into the JC I was aiming for. Now, the overwhelming content and the depth of the concepts taught in JC has made it IMPOSSIBLE for me to keep up with, especially since I don’t have the habit of studying consistently. I’ve been failing most of my tests and I’m now at a point where failing doesn’t bother me anymore. (I take BCMe btw)

I know I had an entire year to adapt to the JC lifestyle. But why couldn’t I? Well, alongside the fact that I absolutely cannot cope with change, I fell deep into depression. It was hard- to accept that I’m no longer the ‘perfect’ student I used to be. JC has made me question my intelligence, my grit, and even my self-worth. 

Depression stole a large fraction of time from me. For months on end I couldn’t bring myself to do anything, my sleep and eating schedules were bizarre. Furthermore, while living with such erratic habits, going to school and seeing people study all the damn time made me feel so fucking guilty. But even with that guilt, albeit intense, I wasn’t motivated to do anything. Slowly my mom realised that my life was literally falling apart, and she forced me to see a doctor to get help.

So for a while, my life was dozing off in school, therapy, seeing the counsellor, crying, and feeling numb and worthless. Until a week before promos when my friends started to push me more, because they didn’t want me to retain. I tried. 10 minutes of studying per day... 20 minutes... an hour... 2 hours. I was making progress. But time wasn’t on my side. Now I’m hours away from taking a paper I’m likely to fail. 

I feel demoralised. I can’t believe that merely promoting is a struggle for me. I still remember when I started JC aiming for all As and Bs. What a bloody joke.

So yeah. Basically, I felt like shit and needed to let it out.

A levels on the other hand, well you know...', ""But in uni getting below average grades (B- or below) is as good as failing in a sense. Yes, it's pretty difficult to fail but it's also difficult to score well when there is no specific benchmarks for grades i.e getting 70% out of 100% doesn't necessarily guarantee an A because not everyone can get an A. \n\nThe competition is endless tbh, and to say uni will be a breeze after jc is like saying poly is the 'stress-free' option compared to jc.

I guess you could be unhappy with SG's education system, but I've lived in London and Sydney for a period of time, and there's a whole lot about Singapore to appreciate beyond the education system (just looking at the bigger picture here). And these are just small things, but they make a lot of difference in your day to day life that maybe you don't appreciate because you've never lived without them:\n\n\\- Singapore's public transport is actually cheap and reliable. Seriously, you think SMRT is bad, try living in London.\n\n\\- The London Underground mostly has zero coverage. Same goes for most shopping district buildings indoors.\n\n\\- It's really hard to find toilets or dustbins in London. No joke. The easiest public toilet to find is the one in a McDonalds.\n\n\\- Almost everything is closed after 5pm. Either you go and get drunk at a pub or you go home.\n\n\\- Everything is super duper expensive. A meal in Sydney costs AUD10 at least (approx S$9 or so)\n\n\\- It's hard to eat healthy overseas. Lots of sugary stuff and very little greens, unless you cook for yourself.\n\n\\- Their internet is slowwww. Like really slow compared to what we have. Ever heard of data caps on your home broadband? It's a thing in Australia. Try living on 200GB a month on your computer.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOf course, none of this is to say that your critique of the education system isn't valid. Everyone has their individual needs, and I would suggest that you explore SOTA/Lasalle/NAFA to see if those suit your fancy. But being born overseas is about waaay more than just education.

However, I've learnt that we really are blessed to be born in SG. \n\n- other country's education level lower (doesn't mean less stressful, also you have to live your whole life struggling to understand things we learn here in SG schl) \n- bullying rates seem to be higher over there (not saying SG no bullying, but honestly I think they have it worse there) \n- culture of sex, drugs, partying, smoking. (I mean if that's how you wanna live your life and become an addict... sure.) \n- Good facilities etc, food quality maintained.. subsidies for the needier people.. \n\nlots of things basically, that we don't think about often.

I feel like when I look at countries like Japan, France, US (which i think is a shit country), etc. they have a lot of passionate people who devote so much of their life to craft, like gastronomy, music, and the arts, and they\'re able to succeed in what they\'re so passionate about. I don\'t really see much of that kind of devotion in Singapore.

Not even a second"", 'Even though education in Singapore is “decent compared to some other countries” it doesn’t mean that we should accept the status quo. There are areas where much-needed changes are needed, not just in a balanced emphasis on both the arts/humanities/social sciences and STEM (I prefer to call them STEAM) but also in pedagogy and curriculum etc.\n\nThe focus on so-called “STEM” is a misnomer; many engineering and math majors don’t end up in a career related what they had studied, and we don’t have that many scientists as compared to ppl who use scientific discoveries to create new products - that’s why we are highly unlike to see Singapore produce someone like an Einstein - we are taking the lower-risk option of translating scientific research into products rather than carrying out most the actual research ourselves.\n\nAnd Yes there is a great focus on “STEM” subjects in Singapore but it’s not limited only to ppl who study them. The up and coming stuff like Data Analytics, AI, Computer Science, etc, are more interdisciplinary than one might think. I’ve seen Communications graduates being able to do programming, Philosophy graduates doing data analytics, and Linguistics majors contributing to Natural Language Processing (a Comp Science thing).\n\nThere’s an increased need for multidisciplinary perspectives due to the complexities of this (cliche) “VUCA” world that we are in. Take the Covid-19 situation for example. It’s not only relevant to public health experts but also sociologists (why do ppl still go out even when it’s “circuit breaker”?), psychologists (“what are the effects of the covid-19 crisis on the mental health of the population?”), journalism and comms professionals (“How do I present these ever-updating news and information with much clarity to readers/the audience?).\n\nPerhaps the reason why we have contrasting subjects in sec schools, JCs, and Polys is to encourage cross-disciplinary thinking.\nPerhaps what one learns in history and chemistry be applied to GP and beyond.\nMaybe taking both science and literature could nurture a potential science fiction writer.\n\nWestern education varies so it’s hard to make generalizations about them. \nOn the school fees topic, Germany offers free university education (yes, even for foreign students) while the same could not be said of the US, with Trump cutting federal budgets even as students are burdened with heavy student loans.\n\nWe can appreciate what we have while also realizing that there’s much room for improvement. There is still a sense that the sg education system is still very much a factory producing exam-takers rather than people who  can truly think critically or learn independently.\n\nThe system is slow to move but I’ve seen some encouraging examples (which are anecdotal and not representative) - teachers designing fun games for lessons (I’ve had a GP teacher who played musical chairs with us in class, turned the Paper 2 passage into a card game), students coming together to start new initiatives (this Subreddit is an example), people learning new stuff from Youtube videos and TED talks etc.\n\nThe grass is greener *when you water it*', 'adding on to this, if u wna go to a top college in the us (or even some state schools) ur extracurriculars have to be phenomenal along with your grades, and the us places a lot of emphasis on extracurriculars in general, which could actually mean MORE stress for students since they\'re expected to excel at what they do for fun, or take up ECs like volunteering or entrepreneurship to boost their portfolio...which doesn\'t sound all that different from sg :"") in fact i would posit that it might be worse bc students now have to be outstanding in all areas of their personal development and not just acads lol so i wouldn\'t say that education in the us is necessarily less stressful:,)', 'the problem is if i wanna go overseas to study art i either need 1) very good results 2) a whole lot of money to go to a school that won’t guarantee me a job here. i don’t wanna sound v privileged but i personally could afford an education if i was born elsewhere, but of course that’s not everyone.\n\ni don’t take art also, my teacher failed me when i was in sec 2 and told me multiple times that she’ll never accept me. also my point isn’t really we should value humanities more, i think in general we value results too much. i guess i understand bc sg is a small country so we have to stay competitive and it’s the only way for us but wish i was in a place where i didn’t have to do that.\n\nwhen i think back to my time in sec school i don’t really have anything memorable, mostly studying or avoiding studying lol. i think a lot of people here also only have studying and no other hobbies. i feel like i wasted my time studying when my results aren’t that great either way.\n\nbut thanks anyways. really appreciate you typing out a long reply. i hope i will pull through for Os and can go elsewhere in the future.', 'i guess i’m just really stressed out because of Os', ""Yeah I am from India and accidentally came across this thread and couldn't help myself from sharing some perspective from my country.

My intention is to use it for mainly watching Netflix shows and playing games, planning to get the PS5 which claims it will do 4K 120Hz.

Tbh, there’s so many different models out there and it’s overwhelming. After a reading a few guides and watching reviews, I stumbled upon [LG 49SM8600PTA](https://www.lg.com/sg/tvs/lg-49SM8600PTA-nanocelltv) which caught my eye due to the high refresh rate, as it claims.

But I’m not sure about all these technologies like nanocell, or different terms used by other brand. Any opinions on my choice?

Edit: I’ve decided that TVs with HDMI 2.1 (4K120Hz) feature is not worth the price point at this moment. Probably will look into Prism or Xiaomi for 4K TVs. Thanks to all who helped!

198,sharingan87,hpcttz,GE2020: The Roar of the Swing Voter,2020-07-12 00:25:28,singapore,378641,36,146,"Hi everyone, this is my first ever post here.

I run a little website called The Thought Experiment where I talk about various issues, some of them Singapore related. And one of my main interests is Singaporean politics. With the GE2020 election results, I thought I should pen down my take on what us as the electorate were trying to say.

If you like what I wrote, I also wrote another article on the state of play for GE2020 during the campaigning period, as well as 2 other articles related to GE2015 back when it was taking place.

If you don't like what I wrote, that's ok! I think the beauty of freedom of expression is that everyone is entitled to their opinion. I'm always happy to get feedback, because I do think that more public discourse about our local politics helps us to be more politically aware as a whole.

Just thought I'll share my article here to see what you guys make of it :D

Article Starts Here:

During the campaigning period, both sides sought to portray an extreme scenario of what would happen if voters did not vote for them. The Peoples’ Action Party (PAP) warned that Singaporeans that their political opponents [“might eventually replace the government after July 10”](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/ge2020-pap-chan-chun-sing-scrutinises-opposition-manifestos-parties-could-be-coalition-government). Meanwhile, the Worker’s Party (WP) stated that [“there was a real risk of a wipeout of elected opposition MPs at the July 10 polls”](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-wp-launches-manifesto-and-election-slogan-make-your-vote-count).

Today is July 11th. As we all know, neither of these scenarios came to pass. The PAP comfortably retained its super-majority in Parliament, winning 83 out of 93 elected MP seats. But just as in GE2011, another Group Representation Constituency (GRC) has fallen to the WP. In addition, the PAP saw its vote share drop drastically, down almost 9% to 61.2% from 69.9% in GE2015.

Singapore’s electorate is unique in that a significant proportion is comprised of swing voters: Voters who don’t hold any blind allegiance to any political party, but vote based on a variety of factors both micro and macro. The above extreme scenarios were clearly targeted at these swing voters. Well, the swing voters have made their choice, their roar sending 4 more elected opposition MPs into Parliament. This article aims to unpack that roar and what it means for the state of Singaporean politics going forward.

**1. The PAP is still the preferred party to form Singapore’s Government**

Yes, this may come across as blindingly obvious, but it still needs to be said. The swing voter is by its very definition, liable to changes of opinion. **And a large factor that determines how a swing voter votes is their perception of how their fellow swing voters are voting.** If swing voters perceive that most swing voters are leaning towards voting for the opposition, they might feel compelled to vote for the incumbent. And if the reverse is true, swing voters might feel the need to shore up opposition support.

Why is this so? This is because the swing voter is trying to push the vote result into a sweet spot – one that lies between the two extreme scenarios espoused by either side. They don’t want the PAP to sweep all 93 seats in a ‘white tsunami’. Neither do they want the opposition to claim so much territory that the PAP is too weak to form the Government on its own. But because each swing voter only has a binary choice: either they vote for one side or the other (I’m ignoring the third option where they simply spoil their vote), they can’t very well say “I want to vote 0.6 for the PAP and 0.4 for the Opposition with my vote”. And so we can expect the swing voter bloc to continue being a source of uncertainty for both sides in future elections, as long as swing voters are still convinced that the PAP should be the Government.

**2. Voters no longer believe that the PAP needs a ‘strong mandate’ to govern. They also don’t buy into the NCMP scheme.**

Throughout the campaign period, the PAP repeatedly exhorted voters to vote for them alone. Granted, they couldn’t very well give any ground to the opposition without a fight. And therefore there was an attempt to equate voting for the PAP as voting for Singapore’s best interests. However, the main message that voters got was this: PAP will only be able to steer Singapore out of the Covid-19 pandemic if it has a strong mandate from the people.

What is a strong mandate, you may ask? While no PAP candidate publicly confirmed it, [their incessant harping on the Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) scheme](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-pap-will-not-have-blank-cheque-because-of-ncmp-scheme-say-chun-sing-and) as the PAP’s win-win solution for having the PAP in power and a largely de-fanged opposition presence in parliament shows that the PAP truly wanted a parliament where it held every single seat.

Clearly, the electorate has different ideas, handing Sengkang GRC to the WP and slashing the PAP’s margins in previous strongholds such as West Coast, Choa Chu Kang and Tanjong Pagar by double digit percentages. There is no doubt from the results that swing voters are convinced that a PAP supermajority is not good for Singapore. They are no longer convinced that to vote for the opposition is a vote against Singapore. They have realized, as members of a maturing democracy surely must, that one can vote for the opposition, yet still be pro-Singapore.

**3. Social Media and the Internet are rewriting the electorate’s perception.**

In the past, there was no way to have an easily accessible record of historical events. With the only information source available being biased mainstream media, Singaporeans could only rely on that to fill in the gaps in their memories. Therefore, [Operation Coldstore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Coldstore) became a myth of the past, and [Chee Soon Juan became a crackpot in the eyes of the people](https://www.amnesty.org.uk/press-releases/singapore-defamation-suits-threaten-chee-soon-juan-and-erode-freedom-expression), someone who should never be allowed into Parliament.

Fast forward to today. Chee won 45.2% of the votes in Bukit Batok’s Single Member Constituency (SMC). His party-mate, Dr. Paul Tambyah did even better, winning 46.26% of the votes in Bukit Panjang SMC. For someone previously seen as unfit for public office, this is an extremely good result.

Chee has been running for elections in Singapore for a long time, and only now is there a significant change in the way he is perceived (and supported) by the electorate. Why? Because of social media and the internet, two things which the PAP does not have absolute control over. With the ability to [conduct interviews with social media personalities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OISj2rQSx64) as well as [upload party videos on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPLikoXzEjs), he has been able to display a side of himself to people that the PAP did not want them to see: someone who is merely human just like them, but who is standing up for what he believes in.

**4. Reserved Election Shenanigans and Tan Cheng Block: The electorate has not forgotten.**

Tan Cheng Bock almost became our President in 2011. There are many who say that if Tan Kin Lian and Tan Jee Say had not run, Tony Tan would not have been elected. In March 2016, Tan Cheng Bock publicly declared his interest to run for the next Presidential Election that would be held in 2017. The close result of 2011 and Tan Cheng Bock’s imminent candidacy made the upcoming Presidential Election one that was eagerly anticipated.

That is, until the PAP shut down his bid for the presidency just a few months later in September 2016, using its supermajority in Parliament to pass a “reserved election” in which only members of a particular race could take part. Under the new rules that they had drawn up for themselves, it was decreed that only Malays could take part. And not just any Malay. The candidate had to either be a senior executive managing a firm that had S$500 million in shareholders’ equity, or be the Speaker of Parliament or a similarly high post in the public sector (the exact criteria are a bit more in-depth than this, but this is the gist of it. You can find the full criteria [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presidential_elections_in_Singapore#Qualifications)). And who was the Speaker of Parliament at the time? Mdm Halimah, who was conveniently of the right race (Although there was some hooha about her actually being Indian). With the extremely strict private sector criteria and the PAP being able to effectively control who the public sector candidate was, it came as no surprise that Mdm Halimah was declared the only eligible candidate on Nomination Day. A day later, she was Singapore’s President. And all without a single vote cast by any Singaporean.

Of course, the PAP denied that this was a move specifically aimed at blocking Tan Cheng Bock’s bid for the presidency. Chan Chun Sing, Singapore’s current Minister of Trade and Industry, stated in 2017 that the [Government was prepared to pay the political price](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/govt-prepared-to-pay-political-price-over-changes-to-elected-9199326) over making these changes to the Constitution.

We can clearly see from the GE2020 results that a price was indeed paid. A loss of almost 9% of vote share is very significant, although a combination of the [first-past-the-post rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First-past-the-post_voting) and the GRC system ensured that the PAP still won 89.2% of the seats in Parliament despite only garnering 61.2% of the votes. On the whole, it’s naught but a scratch to the PAP’s overwhelming dominance in Parliament. The PAP still retains its supermajority and can make changes to the Constitution anytime that it likes. But the swing voters have sent a clear signal that they have not been persuaded by the PAP’s rationale.

**5. Swing Voters do not want Racial Politics.**

In 2019, Heng Swee Keat, Singapore’s Deputy Prime Minister and the man who is next in line to be Prime Minister (PM) commented that [Singapore was not ready to have a non-Chinese PM](https://www.todayonline.com/singapore/older-generation-singaporeans-not-ready-non-chinese-pm-heng-swee-keat). He further added that race is an issue that always arises at election-time in Singapore.

Let us now consider the GE2015 results. Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Singapore’s Senior Minister and someone whom many have expressed keenness to be Singapore’s next PM, obtained 79.28% of the vote share in Jurong GRC. This was above even the current Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, who scored 78.63% in Ang Mo Kio GRC. Tharman’s score was the highest in the entire election.

And now let us consider the GE2020 results. Tharman scored 74.62% in Jurong, again the highest scorer of the entire election, while Hsien Loong scored 71.91%. So Tharman beat the current PM again, and by an even bigger margin than the last time. Furthermore, Swee Keat, who made the infamous comments above, scored just 53.41% in East Coast.

Yes, I know I’m ignoring a lot of other factors that influenced these results. But don’t these results show conclusively that Heng’s comments were wrong? We have an Indian leading both the current and future PM in both elections, but yet PAP still feels the need to say that Singapore “hasn’t arrived” at a stage where we can vote without race in mind. In fact, this was the same rationale that supposedly led to the reserved presidency as mentioned in my earlier point.

The swing voters have spoken, and it is exceedingly clear to me that the electorate does not care what our highest office-holders are in terms of race, whether it be the PM or the President. Our Singapore pledge firmly states “regardless of race”, and I think the results have shown that we as a people have taken it to heart. But has the PAP?

**6. Voters will not be so easily manipulated.**

On one hand, Singaporeans were exhorted to stay home during the Covid-19 pandemic. Contact tracing became mandatory, and groups of more than 5 are prohibited.

But on the other hand, we are also told that it’s absolutely necessary to hold an election during this same period, for Singaporeans to [wait in long lines](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-polling-day-long-queues-voting-polling-station-eld-12920390) and in close proximity to each other as we congregate to cast our vote, all because the PAP needs a strong mandate.

On one hand, Heng Swee Keat lambasted the Worker’s Party, claiming that it was [“playing games with voters”](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-ncmp-scheme-heng-swee-keat-pap-wp-12903332) over their refusal to confirm if they would accept NCMP seats.

But on the other hand, Heng Swee Keat was moved to the East Coast GRC at the eleventh hour in a surprise move to secure the constituency. (As mentioned above, he was aptly rewarded for this with a razor-thin margin of just 53.41% of the votes.)

On one hand, Masagos Zulkifli, PAP Vice-Chairman stated that [“candidates should not be defined by a single moment in time or in their career, but judged instead by their growth throughout their life”](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-masagos-responds-to-criticism-of-ivan-lim-says-candidates-will-have-to). He said this in defense of Ivan Lim, who appears to be the very first candidate in Singaporean politics to have been pushed into retracting his candidacy by the power of non-mainstream media.

But on the other hand, the PAP called on the WP to make clear its stand on Raeesah Khan, a WP candidate who ran (and won) in Sengkang GRC for this election, stating that the Police investigation into Raeesah’s comments made on social media was [“a serious matter which goes to the fundamental principles on which our country has been built”](https://www.straitstimes.com/politics/singapore-ge2020-wp-should-state-stand-on-raeesah-khans-posts-not-ask-voters-to-write-it-a).

On one hand, Chan Chun Sing stated in 2015, referring to SingFirst’s policies about giving allowances to the young and the elderly, [“Some of them promised you $300 per month. I say, please don’t insult my residents. You think…. they are here to be bribed?”](https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/vote-for-party-deserving-of-peoples-trust-chun-sing)

On the other hand, the PAP Government has just given out several handouts under its many budgets to help Singaporeans cope with the Covid-19 situation. \[To be clear, I totally approve of these handouts. What I don’t approve is that the PAP felt the need to lambast similar policies as bribery in the past. Comparing a policy with a crime is a political low blow in my book.\]

I could go on, but I think I’ve made my point. And so did the electorate in this election, putting their vote where it counted to show their disdain for the heavy-handedness and double standards that the PAP has displayed for this election.

**Conclusion**

I don’t say the above to put down the PAP. The PAP would have you believe that to not support them is equivalent to not wanting what’s best for Singapore. This is a false dichotomy that must be stamped out, and I am glad to see our swing voters taking a real stand with this election.

No, I say the above as a harsh but ultimately supportive letter to the PAP. As everyone can see from the results, we all still firmly believe that the PAP should be the Government. We still have faith that PAP has the leadership to take us forward and out of the Covid-19 crisis.

But we also want to send the PAP a strong signal with this vote, to bring them down from their ivory towers and down to the ground. Enough with the double standards. Enough with the heavy-handedness. Singaporeans have clearly stated their desire for a more mature democracy, and that means more alternative voices in Parliament. The PAP needs to stop acting as the father who knows it all, and to start acting as the bigger brother who can work hand in hand with his alternative younger brother towards what’s best for the entire family: Singapore.

There is a real chance that the PAP will not listen, though. As Lee Hsien Loong [admitted in a rally in 2006](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1WhJKsYb50), “if there are 10, 20… opposition members in Parliament… I have to spent my time thinking what is the right way to fix them”.

Now, the PAP has POFMA at its disposal. It still has the supermajority in Parliament, making them able to change any law in Singapore, even the Constitution at will. We have already seen them put these tools to use for its own benefit. Let us see if the PAP will continue as it has always done, or will it take this opportunity to change itself for the better. Whatever the case, we will be watching, and we will be waiting to make our roar heard once again five years down the road.

Majulah Singapura!

Like how singaporeans sent a message to pap this elections but still trust them to form the government, supporters of opposition parties need to be the same.\n\nThe last thing we need is a country divided by deeply entrenched beliefs that one party can do no wrong while accepting no alternatives."", 'Great article. Swing voter here, this is the first time I’ve voted opposition since three GEs ago. \n\nFirst of all I wasn’t convinced by PAP’s call for a strong mandate. All they needed is a simple majority to pass any bill they want, and a supermajority for constitutional amendments. What other legal or legislative advantage would be enjoyed by Singaporeans, if PAP achieved a strong mandate?   So that message fell flat for me. \n\nGoing into this GE, several factors weighed on me. \n\nI felt the reserved presidency was unnecessary. Halimah is not an unknown, and on any given day, Halimah might well stand her own and receive the popular vote. It still grates that PAP decided to take away our right to choose, and to contort logic by somehow not counting Ong Teng Cheong as our first elected president, in deciding when to implement the new reserved presidency regime. \n\nI was more on the fence on the 4G’s Covid response. Everything is rosier on hindsight and I do believe that the 4G made all their decisions in good faith, and based on information and expertise known at the time. Sure, we got some things wrong (like not adopting masks earlier), but I think the team has been trying their best. \n\nI was shocked when I first read the infamous Tan Wu Meng article about Pritam “supporting” Alfian Saat. I mean, here we are facing a once in a lifetime economic and health crisis, and the PAP chooses to lead with... this drivel?  This was the PAP’s opening salvo of the GE and it was nasty, divisive, negative and racist. Read the room, nobody was in the mood for that type of politics.  Questioning Pritam‘s loyalty because he did not publicly denounce an artist, who wrote critical works on Singapore ?  That was a pathetic piece of writing. \n\nWhich made me wonder if the article was sanctioned by the PAP’s leadership, or if TWM did so unilaterally. If the former, then it was not a good look for the leadership. If the latter, then it suggests that they just didn’t have a very good campaign manager. \n\nIvan Lim was a non issue for me. It’s impossible to do a complete screen of a candidate, and the allegations against him would not have surfaced until he was nominated as a candidate. \n\nNext, POFMA. I’m supportive of a law against fake news, but disappointed in its implementation. \n\nI know the ministers devolved their POFMA powers to the civil servants during the GE, so it’s not quite the PAP’s fault. But the civil servants majorly dropped the ball when PAP made two false statements that satisfied the POFMA criteria (false statement, affects public interest because it influences an election) but not a single word was heard from the civil servants. The two false statements are covered elsewhere in this sub, but they relate to PM’s false statement that opposition parties were completely silent about Covid (they were not), and the PAP’s bizarre press statement alleging that Raeesah admitted to making derogatory statements against Chinese and christians (all she did was accept they were insensitive, and she apologised on that basis). \n\nSo again, the PAP’s Raeesah press statement struck the same kind of sour note with me as TWM’a article. It was unfair, negative and even worse, I felt it was stirring up racial tension. \n\nSo whoever ran the PAP campaign, or was in charge of its press statements, made some very poor decisions. These politics really don’t resonate well with younger voters. \n\nUltimately, did I want the PAP to form the next government ? Sure, because the opposition was not gunning to do that, and I believe the PAP has many talented MPs who have a heart for service. \n\nDid I want PAP to dominate parliament ? No. \n\nDid I want to signal to the PAP that, as a nation , we have to move away from nasty, divisive politics? Absolutely. \n\nDidn’t intend to make such a long post but I suppose PAP researchers do read internet fora, so I thought this might help in their post GE review.', ""Did you write this entire article yourself?\n\nIt was a very good article.\n\nI am not sure if I am what you call a swing voter.\n\nI do not categorize myself as a PAP supporter but as someone whom viewed parties by their policies.\n\nIts just that I really liked some of PAP's policies. \n\nIn GE2011, GE2015 and Bukit Batok SMC by-election, I voted for PAP because I disagree with some of the opposition party's policies in their manifesto.\n\nCome GE2020, PAP lost my vote because I realised that after GE2015, I felt that PAP started backtracking from its promises made after GE2011 to build a stronger Singaporean core at the workplace.\n\nDoes that make me a swing voter?"", '[deleted]', 'Usually only browse through articles without commenting but felt compelled to say that I enjoyed your article - it reflects everything I felt going into this GE', 'Thanks for sharing.

Thanks a lot for quality pieces like yours, that have given me so much insight!\n\nI’m wondering if you had any thoughts on whether the queue lengths at polling stations (eg Sengkang) had a positive effect for swing voters to choose the opposition there? \n\nI’m still baffled by the last minute extension, and that some polling stations had such long queues  in the second half of the day, whilst others barely had any issues. If I’m not mistaken, the voters were distributed quite evenly amongst all the polling stations?\n\nEdit: Typo for Sengkang', 'Up voted. Good article', ""very well written article. you beautifully worded my thoughts that i couldn't.\n\ni am a swing voter. my pro-pap friends consider me a pro-opposition and my pro-opposition friends consider me pro-pap. and that's because i challenge their arguments during political discussions. my intention is not to change their votes but hope that thought-provoking discussions would helped everyone make an informed decision because no matter who they vote for, they do so with the intent to make Singapore better.\n\ni have voted for both PAP and Opposition in the past based on various points that you mentioned. i think that power corrupts and no 1 party should hold all the power, and Singapore shouldn't be a 1 party system. \n\ncontinue to write such articles to voice out opinions for people like me who does not have the flair to do so."", 'A lot of nice words, but no data to back up your statements. Getting very tired of people trying to control the narrative over this GE with their pretentious essays. Kaki kong kaki song.', 'I agree with you wholeheartedly. I think I saw another article stating that swing voters are ""the true check on government"", because of the same reasons that you cited: that they are more objective than diehard supporters.\n\nI do think that as our politics matures that we will definitely see some entrenching though. It is only natural that support for our opposition needs to grow before we can see a greater opposition presence in Parliament.\n\nThat said, I definitely agree with you that we don\'t want to see a country that is totally splintered. US is definitely a good example, and I also watched the UK tear itself apart ove Brexit. Both are paths that Singapore definitely cannot afford to go down on.', ""Hmm going by what you said, I guess I'm a swing voter.

I think this left a bad taste in the mouths of many, and for the PAP to effectively say, ""It\'s ok, we can take any hit to our political support that arises from this"" was very arrogant in my opinion.\n\n> Which made me wonder if the article was sanctioned by the PAP’s leadership, or if TWM did so unilaterally. If the former, then it was not a good look for the leadership. If the latter, then it suggests that they just didn’t have a very good campaign manager. \n\nConsidering how our government operates, where several layers of approval are required to do every little thing, it is highly likely that Tan Wu Meng did not act by himself, but rather acted with the approval of the PAP leadership. Of course, I do not have direct evidence, but in terms of circumstantial evidence, consider how quickly Shanmugam waded into the debate to double down on Tan Wu Meng\'s assertions. At the very least, this displayed implicit approval on the part of the PAP leadership.\n\n> Didn’t intend to make such a long post but I suppose PAP researchers do read internet fora, so I thought this might help in their post GE review. \n\nI hope the PAP realizes that it really needs to up its game in the social media and the Internet space. That said, my concern is that to many, a place like Reddit may simply be dismissed by PAP supporters (or even swing voters) as overwhelmingly pro-opposition, such that whatever is said here becomes ignored entirely. I think that would be very unfortunate.', "">Did you write this entire article yourself?\n\nYes, I did! Thank you for the compliment! I just write these pieces for fun, so I figured I might as well just share them to see what people make of it and to provoke discussion/feedback.\n\n>Does that make me a swing voter?\n\nYeah, I think it does. I think that non-swing voters can be characterized as such: If you would vote a tree stump over the other side, you're not a swing voter. Swing voters try to appraise both sides objectively, and have no qualms about switching sides if they feel that the other side has become more appealing.\n\nThat being said, I don't think being a non-swing voter is bad. Both sides definitely have their weak areas, and I think a healthy democracy has a decent amount of support for either side, in order to ensure a decent competition."", ""Thank you so much for your feedback! I'm always happy whenever people read my stuff and like it! :D"", ""Thank you for commenting! I'm glad that I was able to give voice to your opinion! I do think that like the silent majority, swing voters tend to be ones that watch and observe rather than to express their views, so yeah I thought it was worthwhile to try putting what swing voters felt into words. I was a tad worried that people might think I'm presumptuous to speak for all swing voters, but from the comments I think it went ok :D"", ""I think I've seen some here on reddit and elsewhere state that the breakdown in 30% PAP, 30% opposition and 40% swing voters.\n\nI don't really have any stats to back me up, but since you asked, I think we could actually use the election results as a rough agaration gauge.\n\nLet's take the strongest performing PAP constituency, Jurong, where Tharman won 74.62% (oppo won 25.38%) and the strongest performing opposition constituency, Hougang, where WP won 61.19% (PAP won 38.81%).\n\nIt seems reasonable to conclude that in either stronghold, there was still this entrenched vote that voted for the other side. If I extrapolate this further, this same entrenched group is probably present in every other constituency too, with the remainder consisting of swing voters.\n\nUsing the figures above, that would mean that the PAP core support is about 39%, the opposition core support is about 25%, and that leaves a very significant 36% swing voter bloc, a bloc that can easily cause the significant swings we saw from 2011 to 2015, and once again from 2015 to 2020.\n\nI made a LOT of assumptions in coming up with the above, so I can't say that they are conclusive in any way. But it does seem to fit nicely into the results so far."", ""Sorry, I'm a noob at posting on reddit. It's up now!"", 'I fully agree with you. I’m sorry that others called you those names - I don’t think that such name-calling and other ad hominem attacks are called for, when actually everyone has the same goal: wanting what’s best for Singapore. Having more swing voters means having people who will be able to critically evaluate both sides, meaning both sides can not afford to become complacent or arrogant. That would be the most ideal outcome.\nThat said, I do think that if swing voters consume too much content that’s slanted towards one side, there’s a risk of becoming a supporter. For this election, I tried my best to consume equal amounts of both mainstream and alternative media to keep myself balanced 😅', ""I'm the same as you, politically apathetic in the past and paid a lot more attention this time round, stayed up til 4am watching the results. (abit suprised with myself actually)\n\ni have friends saying the long queues (e.g. Seng Kang) swinging voters towards opposition as well. it is a funny thought but at the same time, quite possible.\n\ni don't mind the extension. it's an important day every 5 years, if we need 2 more hours for people to get their votes in, so be it. kudos to all the volunteers and people working around the elections.\n\nAlso interested in the distribution of voters across polling stations. I walked in and out of my polling station (HDB void deck) within 5 mins. the whole process was so fast i had to slowed myself down at the booth to think clearly who i wanted to vote for."", '> I’m wondering if you had any thoughts on whether the queue lengths at polling stations (eg Seng Kang) had a positive effect for swing voters to choose the opposition there? \n\nIt did seem to appear that the voting queues for Sengkang were very long. I\'m not sure how significant the effect was, but if true, then it\'s pretty ironic that the phrase ""The PAP is the Government and the Government is the PAP"" actually worked against them in this instance.\n\nFor my own experience, I was very lucky - I waited less than 5 minutes to cast my vote. So I think there was definitely some unevenness in the distribution of the voters across the polling stations.', 'Thank you! :D', 'I fully agree with you! Swing voters will keep both sides on their toes and doing their best to earn their vote, and that will bring about a better Singapore overall.', 'I\'m sorry you got downvoted. Actually I thought that I tried to attach links to various sources for the things that I covered. Would you like to elaborate on the specific areas where I failed to do so?\n\nThe above was just my opinion - it was in no way an attempt to ""control the narrative"" as you\'ve said. It may be that others don\'t feel comfortable in airing their views, whether they be for one side or the other, and I actually think that\'s an unnecessary waste. I also don\'t think that that should be a reason not to express one\'s views.\n\nI understand that Reddit is often seen as a platform that\'s heavily leaning towards the opposition, and that may have a silencing effect on those who disagree with the opinions shared here. With that said, I am interested to hear your views on where you may disagree with what I\'ve said - as I\'ve said elsewhere in the comments, more political discourse helps us overall in terms of awareness.', 'Thanks for starting the discussion with a really thoughtful article too. Yes I think reddit is disproportionately young, middle class and English speaking. But in terms of demographics, this counts for a fairly significant chunk of voters, and the PAP really needs to pay attention.', 'Keep it up. Do you have a Facebook or Twitter where you post these?', 'I would split the numbers a bit further with approximate, 35% hard core pap and 20% hard core anti pap.\n\nwhy I took 5% away from each block is because there will still be some swing voters in those areas.', 'while there are some who may think this is another echo chamber and we\'re just circlejerking here, i think its a reasonable assumption given the swing in the last few elections.\n\n2011 - 60.1% - It\'s often said that the PAP became more humble after this result and they perform much better in the next 5 years.\n\n2015 - 69.9% - Due to the better performance of the PAP, and the lowest % for the PAP in the last election, PAP gain back more votes from these swing voters and i quote you - ""Neither do they want the opposition to claim so much territory that the PAP is too weak to form the Government on its own ""\n\n2020 - 61.2% - Many were surprised of the high vote % for PAP in the last election, with WP only keeping Aljunied and Hougang. swing voters voted in a way to move closer to the \'sweet spot\' balance.\n\nI think the next 5 years would be interesting to see how PAP perform with Shanmugam saying soul searching and reflection required after the GE2020 result. GE2025 will also be equally interesting.\n\n[https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-pap-shanmugam-clear-messages-voters-soul-searching-12924404](https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/ge2020-pap-shanmugam-clear-messages-voters-soul-searching-12924404)\n\nBut no matter the result (even if PAP achieved a higher mandate), i\'m extremely proud of our elections (except maybe long queues and handling of the crowds) and definitely think its a good system and good chance at achieving bipartisanship.', ""Your links illustrate the narrative you are making, but not proving the narrative you are forming.

I just never realised how safety can be such a huge pro until I remembered this incident that happened to me when I was 11 (I'm 23 now). 

Back then, I was still living in Queenstown but my parents had alr bought a house in Boon Lay and had decided to send me to tuition in Boon Lay so that it won't be a hassle choosing a tuition centre when we eventually moved there. During the first weeks, my parent still sent me there. They accompanied me there a few times so I could get used to the route but on the first week I went back on my own, I got quite lost. I think I took the wrong bus and by the time I realised it, the bus was at a really ulu part of SG. So, I decided to get off to try and get a sense of my surroundings. It looked like it was going to rain and there really wasn't anyone else on the bus stop that I could ask about directions. 

Then this guy stopped his lorry just in front of the bus stop and I think he was throwing some covers on the stuff on his lorry bcos it had started drizzling by then. I decided to ask him about directions and he told me that the next bus is only gonna come in 45 mins (big yikes). He asked me which direction I was heading and when I told him, he said he could give me a lift to the nearest mrt bcos he was heading in that direction. So he very kindly dropped me off at Clementi MRT and I managed to get home in one piece. 

This incident didn't really mean much to me other than a guy being kind enough to send a dumb 11-year-old girl home. But now I realised that had it happened in any other country, the outcome would've likely been very very different. So, for that, I'm super grateful for how safe Singapore is and it really makes me appreciate why my parents chose to move here in the first place.",0.96,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/f8jg59/singapores_safety/,"['Once, I got lost on the public bus home as a 10-year-old girl.

203,tinkingthings,j953es,[A levels] advice on how to study with negative mental health,2020-10-11 21:06:42,SGExams,77662,8,29,"I’m a J2 student and it’s only a month away from A levels for me. I’m the kind of person that tends to be very critical to myself, low self-esteem and basically downplay a lot of things I experience, which is not great. So I end up feeling emotionally numb, melancholic, or both, quite regularly. Occasionally, I panic / get anxious very suddenly and intensively for like a few hours. These emotional occurrences have been cultivated and intensified in me through many factors in my house. It probably started way back in primary school but worsened every year due to increasing stress & workload. I don’t have a terrible relationship with my parents but they perpetuate a lot of the negative things I end up feeling towards myself. I don’t like staying at home because I never really feel at ease with myself or feel comfortable with sharing about myself.  So my whole mental health state really took a huge plunge because of the whole circuit breaker + final year in JC / preparation for A’s. 

I’ve started thinking of going to a therapist on my own after A’s, without letting my parents know, like a few months back. And I thought I could wait till then too but I think the emotional spirals are becoming more frequent and uncontrollable. Like I tend to feel overwhelming emotional numbness & melancholy on weekends, almost every week. Even on weekdays sometimes I get stuck in a loop of emotions. Usually when I spiral down / get stuck, it could take me like from a few hours to a whole day to “get over it” and function or do things I want to do. My friend recommended me to check out CHAT, which I did, but they didn’t have any available slots for Oct & Nov so I don’t know how soon I can check in with them. I was looking for CHAT as my source of temporary relief before A’s but now I’m not sure if that would be possible. Besides that, my emotional support in the family would be “missing” really soon because my older sibling is gonna be enlisting. 

I guess I just want to say that I’m just really worried that my emotions will intensify with me having no one to depend on. And if that happens before A’s I fear I’ll do poorly / fail because these emotions, which I had for years (but only worsened this year), always stops me from studying because I feel too much. I genuinely worry that if I do fail A’s, I might end up sinking too deep into my negative emotions and not be able to come out of it, which is already an issue I struggle with periodically this year. Any advice on what I should do to keep my mental health at bay but not put additional stress on myself? And also how I could bring myself to study with my current mental health state? I appreciate anything concrete at this point, I just want to study and do decent:/ And I’m so sorry if this whole situation sounds so confusing, I’m trying to understand myself as well:”",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/j953es/a_levels_advice_on_how_to_study_with_negative/,"['Still got time, there\'s the school counselor(just say you wanna see them privately) that you gotta see before A\'s(a few hours isn\'t much). They\'re willing even after ""graduation"". Call your teachers too. They know how to keep it private. \n\nAlso, you can call counselors, so maybe say to your parents you\'re going out to do something or wait till they leave for like lunch.\n\nAlso, music really helps. Just on it and study, and study. Don\'t care about your grades now or how well you do with the practice papers cause it\'s one step at a time. \n\nWhile the first two weeks(i think) of enlistment you prob. can\'t keep in close contact, after that your sibling should be alright with you frequently calling them and messaging them over whatsapp. But for now just talk with your sibling and tell them to keep it private. They\'re willing to listen to you rant even if they don\'t have advice, so might as well get it all out first.\n\nDon\'t try to suppress your emotions, cause your exam is not tmr it is like maybe 9-19 days away which is good enough.\n\nAs long as you study you should get good grades. So don\'t bother worrying and stuff, just do it and have no regrets after.\n\nI would suggest getting into a routine, even if you\'re emotionally numb you can get better just by doing practice papers, like they really take your focus away from bad stuff.\n\nAgain, music is important. Just get the kind you like and plug it in like half the day.\n\nEven if you\'re feeling bad, like real bad, either go to sleep for an hour or continue your routine.

204,Rubriclee,ffr8z6,Please be a bit more concerned about Covid19,2020-03-09 15:50:58,singapore,378641,84,167,"Singapore has been faring quite well thanks to the quick and hard work of our government and healthcare officials. However, we are to expect worse days ahead and even deaths to be reported. Yet I see long queues for food at many places, and also comments like ""It's just the flu"" which are meant to assure people and reduce panic.

While I do not agree with supermarket runs and other selfish behaviour, I think we do need to at least a little bit more concerned about Covid19. Here's why:

* It's not just the elderly and those with existing medical conditions who will be critically ill. Even the young and healthy (except perhaps little children) can have their immune systems go into overdrive and attack their organs.  [https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/2020/02/here-is-what-coronavirus-does-to-the-body/).

* Dr Richard Hatchett--Chief Executive Officer of the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations--wiho has 20 years of experience dealing with infectious diseases considers Covid19 to be more frightening than Ebola, MERS and Sars due to its infectiousness and much higher fatality rate than flu (compared to what was initially predicted). [https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs](https://youtu.be/dcJDpV-igjs) 

* Even if local healthcare is capable of handling Covid19, it will not be able to do so if hospitals are overwhelmed by huge numbers of cases. This is what happened in Wuhan and is happening in Italy.  I find this report by a surgeon in Italy to be extremely compelling and moving: [https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony\_of\_a\_surgeon\_working\_in\_bergamo\_in\_the/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf](https://www.reddit.com/r/medicine/comments/ff8hns/testimony_of_a_surgeon_working_in_bergamo_in_the/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) 

So can we all be at least a bit more concerned and continue to play our part in fighting this virus? We will not win the war by panicking and stockpiling; by blaming governments and countries, people of various races, etc. This is a global war! Be vigilant but stay calm. Stay home if you have even just some respiratory symptoms (and isolate from family members if need be) and see a doctor immediately if it worsens. Cover your mouth with tissue when you cough or sneeze. Be nice to one another, and remember to take care of both your physical and mental health.  That's all I have to share for now.

Covid-19 is no different.\n\n>Is it true that the main method of transmission is droplet and not airborne, or are people just guessing?\n\nOkay, here\'s the thing that people get confused about between layman terms and technical terms. In technical terms, ""airborne transmission"" means the virus can travel on dust particles or tiny, aerosolised respiratory droplets, whereas ""droplet transmission"" means larger respiratory droplets. Covid is *definitely* transmissible by droplet, so if someone sneezes and touches something, that surface is contaminated. Or if someone with it coughs/sneezes on you, then it can spread. But the latter, transmission by dust particle or aerosolised respiratory droplets? No confirmation yet - and frankly, it\'s not the major vector. The former is. So while you *might* be able to get covid by an infected person breathing on you or sneezing into the air some distance from you, there\'s been no confirmed cases of such happening and even if there were, there aren\'t enough cases for the WHO to consider a major vector over droplet transmission.\n\n>I haven\'t read accounts of people being in contact with others who were coughing or sneezing violently, so transmission may be a lot more insidious.\n\nTransmission isn\'t insidious, really. It\'s pretty well documented by now. People tend to touch their faces a lot more than they realise.\n\n>Are asymptomatic cases truly not contagious?\n\nThere are no confirmed asymptomatic cases. Only two *possible* asymptomatic spreads so far. Frankly, we won\'t know it until a large scale study spanning years will figure how much of an issue asymptomatic spread is. For the time being, it\'s effectively irrelevant as long as you take the basic hygiene measures (which frankly, you should be doing even if there wasn\'t a flu epidemic).\n\n>Also, does the virus mutate to become stronger or weaker?\n\nBoth.

205,1imp3h,hsl0gz,[Dr Catherine Lim] The Surprising GE2020 Election Results: What Could Have Happened?,2020-07-17 07:37:48,singapore,378641,37,61,"Source: [EDMW](https://forums.hardwarezone.com.sg/eat-drink-man-woman-16/%5Bdr-catherine-lim%5D-surprising-ge2020-election-results-what-could-have-happened-6338213.html)

In deciding on the date for the GE 2020 polling day, the Prime Minister had clearly been guided by a widely claimed truth, that is, in times of crisis, people take a ‘flight to safety’ by giving overwhelming support to the incumbent leadership, rather than by casting their lot with an as yet untried and untested opposition. Hence the PM did not hesitate to set Polling Day right in the midst of the Covid 19 pandemic. He assured all voters that the government would take every precaution to make sure that voting would be totally safe. He was clearly confident of a resounding mandate for the PAP’s return to power.

But when the election results came in, he and his colleagues had a shock. There had been a marked swing towards the Opposition. Although the PAP kept its majority and would continue to dominate in parliament, it was clear that the Opposition had made deep inroads into that majority.

Suddenly the ground that had felt secure under the PAP feet since 1968, was beginning to shake, with forebodings of a seismic eruption if the voting trend continued. In his post-election TV appearance, the Prime Minister looked sombre and worried, gamely admitting that he had been hoping for much better results.

What had caused Singaporean voters to actually buck a universally acknowledged trend in voting behaviour? Why hadn’t they given their full support to their leaders during a crisis serious enough to put world leaders on a wartime footing?

An honest answer would expose the complex, perturbing nature of the relationship between Singaporeans and the PAP leaders. It is a relationship that has always been marked by ambiguity and contradiction,by a curious mixture of two opposing states of mind and feeling, namely , respect and resentment. The respect is for an efficient leadership that has given Singaporeans a good life, with all the material comforts which people in other societies can only yearn for. The resentment is against a self-serving leadership that ultimately cares only about maintaining power, best achieved by creating a contented, compliant electorate. Part of this maintenance of power is intolerance of dissenting voices which are immediately slapped down. No sustained effort has ever been made by the leaders to bridge this gap between themselves and those they lead. It is noteworthy that the leaders have never been described in the epithets of emotive nurturing and human connection, such as ‘warm’,’affable’ ‘approachable’,’highly regarded’, ‘popular’, ‘likeable’, etc. Instead, the praise has always been limited to the detached language used for high intellectuality,proven efficiency and moral stringency.

So will post GE2020 Singapore with the PAP being still the predominant power,be just a continuation of the status quo? Has anything changed? Yes, something has changed, and in a radical way. It is the upsetting, for the first time, of a stance which Singaporeans had developed towards their leaders, whether consciously or unconsciously, over five long decades and which they have learnt to live comfortably with. It is that curious respect-resentment ambiguity, just described, which , though far from ideal, has the comforting feel of habit and familiarity. Now suddenly that ambiguity is being replaced by the fear of change. For the close numbers and margins in the GE2020 results point to the possibility, once unthinkable, of the PAP losing its majority and Singapore emerging as a two-party or multiple-party state, with all that implies of an overhaul of existing state structures, institutions, age-old traditions and expectations, indeed of the entire ethos itself. It would be change on an unprecedented scale. Moreover, it could happen in the foreseeable future, creating an unrecognisable Singapore. It is a most alarming prospect for Singaporeans who have long been habituated to a one-party government and the stability and predictability of its rule. Even when these Singaporeans express a desire for change, they could never imagine such a scenario. Their alarm highlights the special nature of their attitude towards the PAP. It can best be expressed by an array of pronouncements which appear contradictory - ‘We don’t like you but we want you to be around’, ‘We appreciate your efficiency but you’re unlikeable because of your arrogance and aloofness ’, ‘You are too elitist and can’t ever connect with the ground, but you’re okay as long as you make Singapore safe and the environment clean,’ etc. In short, there is a split between head and heart in the Singaporean as he evaluates PAP leadership. While the head acknowledges the good work of the PAP, the heart is repelled by the cold, ruthless efficiency that marks its demeanour. While the head wants the PAP to continue as the ruling party, the heart wants to see a little humbling take place now and then.

I believe that it is this ambivalence of Singaporean voters today, especially of the increasingly large bloc of young voters , that will stand in the way of a resounding win for the PAP in future elections, where it is not likely to improve much on the unimpressive performance of GE2020. Indeed, if no lesson is learnt from this election debacle, the party may very well lose its predominant position in the next GE in four or five years’ time, a period long enough for the Opposition to turn itself into a formidable force, and for the young voters to become even bolder in their push for major political reforms. They have become a force to reckon with, and can only grow in strength and influence in the coming years.

One problem of Singapore’s leaders is that they have always been guided by an entrenched conservatism, showing great cautiousness about any change that even remotely suggests the need of an overhaul, preferring the small, incremental changes of evolution to the tumultuous swings of revolution. But in a world of dizzying transformations, they may have no choice but to join hands with their younger counterparts who are ready to face challenges, take risks, even embrace dangers, rather than be left behind in an increasingly demanding world",0.77,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/hsl0gz/dr_catherine_lim_the_surprising_ge2020_election/,"['It shouldn\'t be surprising that the PAP pushed for the elections as soon as they were able to.

206,eggpaper,hwym32,"[a levels] i'm in the science stream right now, should i switch to arts next year? (any advice will be super helpful)",2020-07-24 17:15:31,SGExams,77662,20,19,"**hi! so i'm just gonna summarize my situation**

&#x200B;

\- my net L1R5 is 14, i was planning to go to yijc arts but my parents convinced me to join a sci stream instead, so i joined millennia institute's sci scream. so basically i have three years of science stuff ahead of me.

\- at first i thought, oh this is fine, i bet with hard work i can make it through, but im really suffering. i take h2 math, h2 chem, h2 eng lit and h1 bio. and honestly the only thing i truly enjoy is h2 lit, its the only thing keeping me sane.

\- ik i sound pathetic but every time i do my chem/math homework, i honestly feel so hopeless and overwhelmed. im in constant fear of my future, im not sure i can do well with this stream. 

\- so i was considering switching to yijc arts stream next year, which is essentially like wasting a whole year, but if im going to spend another two years in millennia science i might as well switch to yijc arts, where i know i can perform much better. i want to do something english lit based in uni as well so...

&#x200B;

**thats my situtation. here are the things holding me back**.

&#x200B;

\- my parents. theyre kind of desp for me to stay in mi science and as much as i feel bad for disappointing them im not sure if i can keep this up much longer. i feel suffocated everytime i think about it. i feel like if i miraculously made it to year three, and sat for my alevels my rank points will be below average

\-what if i dont do well in an arts stream either? this is what my parents asked me. they said arts subjects are no joke, and im completely aware of that. i just feel like id be more inclined to study arts than sci, that id be more interested. i think if i switched to an yijc arts stream id take h2 lit, h2 hist h2 econs and h1 math. h2 hist is no joke right? but i think id rather study that than math or chem at this point.

\- all the money spent on mi this year... i know this isnt an issue in the long run but i still feel some sort of guilt... haha

\- will i even be accepted into yijc arts if join next year? i took my olevels in 2019 so if i do switch to yijc id be 18 while the others would be 17...  that is possible right?

A fellow Y1 Millennian here and I just felt slightly compelled to give my two cents on this though I\'m not really confident of giving advice that would actually be helpful but I\'ll do my best 🙃🙃\n\nFirst of all, a bit of background information about myself. In terms of O level results, we\'re kinda similiar (my L1R5 net was 14) though my reasons for choosing MI are different from yours - I wanted to pursue MOB and the commerce course in MI so that\'s why I didn\'t choose a JC instead.\n\nEnough about that, I wanna move on to the actual situation here. I\'m unsure of why your parents are quite insistent on you pursuing a science course, though my speculation would be that they want you to have more options when it comes to university course applications. However, you know what you want to pursue in university, which is great ! The first step that I would encourage you to do is to discuss this issue with your parents again (hopefully they won\'t push it away) and explain to them that you\'re not able to excel in the science stream. Remind them again that you have a clear university course goal for the future and explain that you being the arts stream would allow you to do better in your subjects and subsequently stand a greater chance of scoring better at A\'s - which in my opinion (and definitely in yours and many others) is more important than having a myriad of university course choices :))\n\nLet\'s say you\'ve got the initial approval of your parents. The next consideration would definitely be whether to stay in MI or transfer out to YIJC/any other JC next year. A year difference may or may not be very big for you, but if time is really a major constraint, my advice would be for you to transfer out to YIJC to save yourself a year. Otherwise, of course, stay in MI, which to be seems like the option I would choose if I were in your shoes. If you\'re alright with the school environment and the teachers, as well as your classmates and friends, there is no reason in the social aspect to transfer out. I too take H2 Literature and I get what you mean when it literally becomes a ""lifeline"" from insanity - Mr C and Ms S do make lessons pretty engaging and fun 😍😍\n\nI too take H2 Economics and H1 Math, and I have friends who do take H2 History as well. The general consensus from me and my friends is that the teachers are really caring and will look out for you all the time. Moreover, the bright side of MI is that you have an additional year of proper learning to get your subject content solid before A\'s, but if you feel that you can keep up with the pace in a 2 year program then sure go ahead with it. A word of caution though; I have secondary school classmates who scored around the same as me (some even better) and they are struggling slightly with the workload, so do consider that very carefully too 😬\n\nWA2 results are in the midst of being returned to the cohort, and I really want to encourage you to not be too discouraged by the marks you score. Heads up and see where you went wrong so you can improve the next time round 🤗🤗\n\nI apologise for deviating slightly off topics at times, but I wanna end this off with one more advice for you. Even if your decision may be to transfer out, it\'ll be encouraging to see you complete the school year before you do. Finish what you started here in MI before moving on 💪\n\nAll the best !!', 'Actually you sound quite convinced that u wanna go arts to me. Think Long term.

No one cares about what age you are. I have a batchmate from YIJC from Drama club who is a year older than me when she transferred(from what I heard) and she became a TDP student and she scored pretty damn well. Anyways, in YIJC, there is possibly a handful(more than 10) who are a year older in J1 because of many different reasons(transfer from poly, from 5NA, retook O levels, retained in J1 etc) so it is alright to feel that way.\n\nAnd personally, from many rumors I heard, YI art stream is really good(well except for maybe Econs but...)

YIJC Science Stream prerequisites are quite lenient except for if you're planning to do double H2 Science or if you're taking 1 at H2 and another at H1. The requirement to do double science with 1 science at H1 is just a distinction for combined science. However, if you want to do double science, you not only need to get a distinction for combined science, you need good grades for Maths, probably A Maths too, and overall good grades. Source: I am YIJC double H2 Science student. As for your concern about applying to YIJC Arts Stream next year, I'd say go for it. Every year, YIJC sees a lot of students from Poly, other JCs, and other places that apply into the school rather than just from the conventional 'O' Level bunch. I have a classmate who came to YIJC from Sec 5 too. Going to JC at age 18 shouldn't be too much of an issue, the only issue is that you will probably not be given priority and will be on a waiting list. However, your L1R5 is pretty good so you would be quite high on the waiting list. We do have numerous students who withdraw from the college within the first 1-2 weeks and it will open up space for people like you who wish to enrol into YIJC. Btw, I would personally recommend doing H2 Maths if you can but don't take my word for it if that's not what you want.""]"

Put your phone down and get to work, you can do it!"", 'jiayou!! you can do it!! i just finished my N’s last year , was super nervous because I didn’t do very well for my prelims,(25pt) but managed to get 11pts for N’s and got into NP PFP. My best advice is sleep, sleep is important, don’t go around bragging how much less sleep you have because girl, you’ll need it.\n\nMy subject combi was EM, Bio-Chem, SS-History, Chinese and POA.\n\n\nI have this state of mind whereby mu brain just go brr and cant focus, keeps getting side tracked and cant remember important details. I was afraid that my brain will go brr during the day of my humanities examination so I slept at 8 the previous night and woke up at 3am to do some breathing exercises, stretching and went to mcdonald’s to study.

Idk why but it works for me\n\n\nI hate math, I am terrible at math, math makes me gag, additionally i hated my math teacher. I always failed or barely passed math but N’s I surpassed all expectations and got A2. I just did TYS, every, single, day. goD bless for TYS. There’s answer sheet at the back so thats pretty useful, if u don’t understand anything just use photomath ( math teacher who? we dont know her )\n\n\nSince I focused so much on Math, I fgt abt my language and paid the price of getting G3. Its important, better start now, english fucked a lot of my classmates up. What’s unfortunate as well is that the paper wasn’t difficult, we were just terrible. Unfortunately there isn’t any TYS for english, you just gotta buy a little unreliable exercise book and do, or just read (USE THE MAGAZINE YOUR SCHOOL PROVIDES FOR YOU GOD THAT THING IS SO GOOD) \n\n\nI was naturally good at science so I didn’t focus on it too much, but I remember writing a shit tons of notes, over and over again.

Never stop doing TYS. Use and abuse it. \nI was having a difficult time in school during my N’s so I skipped school a lot, if not I just go to my school library to self study. Having a good support system is important:> \n\n\nTheres a light at the end of the tunnel, mine was being better than everyone else, rekting everyone as I stand, shaking, and collecting my award epic pro gamer style with a backflip ( im just joking about the last part I cant go back to school due to covid )\n\nOhya please sleep. 8 hours a day, 8 glasses of HYDRATION, VEGETABLES AND LEAN MEAT, 30MINUTES OF EXERCISE AND DOPAMINE RELEASEEEEEEEE good luck!!\n\nYours sincerely,\nN level survivor', 'hello i did my n levels last year,doing sec 5 this year &  tbh didn’t even start chionging hardcore until like september holidays which was one week before N levels. so i guess now isn’t too late! even so during n levels after ng papers i would go home and just toh on the sofa lol v bad example so pls don’t follow me. anyway,you still uve time left! don’t feel too overwhelmed. plan ur time well and utilise ur time wisely. see which subjects u rly need to buck up and focus more on them! not boasting but js wna say even w this^ i still got 12 points for n’s so if u work harder than me which i’m sure you are,u can definitely do much better than me! jiayou OP:))', 'Hellloooo :< :) Taking N levels this year as well! Just did my prelims too and I did pretty well. I just want to say that it’s okay to give yourself breaks along the way. (Since you just finished prelims btw) don’t over stress yourself.

Anyone mind painting out a detailed guide of the application process, I would appreciate it alot! And what are the important dates to take note for application in 2021. ( I found out that the application period is 1-21 Feb 2021)

Hi guys just to clarify how hard is it to get c6 for o levels. I’m currently still @ a f9 I know I promise I working very hard on it. But careless mistakes demoralise me a lot and make me lose the little motivation I’m hanging onto. I really want to get at least a b4 but my teacher asked me to aim for c6 as it is unrealistic and stupid to aim for a b4.

Please help me, some questions when I see them I get panic attacks one moment it seems so easy one moment it is the hardest paper I have seen. Similarly for science I have good topic knowledge but some parts I still can’t answer them as I don’t know what the questions is asking for. Not only that but u also don’t know why I have so much of learning gaps despite studying :( 

For chemistry topics like mole concept just give me breakdowns and it is so overwhelming. :(",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/hz9zvr/o_levels_e_math_stress/,"[""Hihi I'm gonna give some tips which I applied for amath but should be about the same for emath\n\n1. Go nuts with topical - it's super good to just do questions over and over again\n\n2. Just do an exam paper. Don't care if you haven't revised or you're super bad at emath, just go do one. Refer to the textbook if you need to. Doing this will give you a clearer insight on topics you can't do, and hopefully will give you some hope because you recognise some sums and can somewhat do it.\n\nGood luck man! After a while math is just repeating the same type of questions so don't stress\n\nAs for careless mistakes, all I can say is that practise your math more because when you can do sums faster, you have more time to check your work."", 'Hi man\nLast year I was in the same boat as u\nUp untill prelim I was a E8/F9 standard\n\nBecause of a rly good tuition teacher I got B3 in about 3 months\nOfc I did my own fair share of work as well\nIf u interested lmk', 'Hello im gna share with you some tips i used for both my maths and hopefully they will help you too.\n1. I read what i write twice before i proceed, and if that is a long qn, i will check each part then proceed. i find that this rlly helps to eliminate any possibilities of careless, altho ur progress may be abit slower than others, but u know that ur ans will be correct and u dont need to stress if there is not enough time for double checking.\n2. Do every qn of ur textbook. Like every. Textbook gives u most of the question types that will get tested, and it gives u many similar qns to drill that part of the chapter ur practicing.\n3. This is probably the most important tip. Understand what the cher is teaching during the lesson. If you find difficulties with understanding the solution or have any qns, ask ur peers or the cher. You hv to get the concept in that lesson, or in that day. If u let urself relax and procrastinate it, u will find it harder and harder to get the topic right. \n4. When you practice math qns, think hard. If u dont know the solution, keep trying and thinking for at least 5. mins, explore all the different possible ways of solving the qn. Do not ask for help immediately. Because if u ask only after u’ve tried everything, you will get a deeper impression of the qn and the solution, making u remembering ur mistakes, and the method to solve the qn easier.\n6. Colour code ur qns. I use green(correct), red(wrong/didnt understand/dk how to do), purple(do it again, even if i get that qn correct), grey (careless mistakes). This will aid ur revision as u will know what qns to look out for and ur weakness in that subject by simply glancing through ur practice qns.\n7. Lastly, do notes. For each chapter, look through all ur practices and types of qns. Make notes of formulas, type of qns and solutions, and the mistakes that u made before. Through this, u will be reminded not to commit that mistake again and whenever u need a guide for that chapter, u can always refer to ur notes. \n\nI hope those tips above will help u in some way:) try not to be stress and jiayou for your o levels!', 'https://www.sponge-me.com/mathematics/tips-avoid-careless-mistakes/', 'Okay for math, this is how i practice\n\n1. Grind the practice paper on foolscap and refer to answer. Redo questions you got wrong.\n2. Dont be afraid to use answer key when you dont know how to do the question. Any question udk how do look at answer key and work backwards. Example u take the answer and reverse all the working.\n3. Ten years series is your best friend for topical practice. Keep doing all the topical practices.', 'Yes it is possible try to minimise your careless and if u don’t know any concepts well ask ur teachers to explain maybe u can give them a qn so it will be easier.\nFor science u can ask ur teacher to explain the concept or u can read up more on it u need to understand the concept then u can do the qns. For mole or calculations wise, maybe do more practice? Or do u not know the formula or u don’t know how to use/understand the formula. Ask your teacher or friends for help! I might be able to help with math and sci but it’s best if u ask ur teachers!!! Hope u so well for ur prelims and Os?!?', 'hi! first off you rlly need to calm down. being stressed won’t get you anywhere bc coming from personal experience,i always get stressed out when i do a math questions but once i calm down i feel like its easier to read and do the questions. fret not,if you’re working very hard now for e math you’ll definitely be able to get a b4! just keep practising and reviewing your past mistakes& bear in mind not to repeat the same mistakes again. last year during my prelims i got a c6 for e math (i take sbb) and for o levels i got a b3, so hard work does pay off:) this year i’m retaking the e math paper in hopes of getting an A1 haha', 'hi! i’m also somewhat stressed for my math right now seeing many people in my class scoring much better than i am, but i have been doing my best in trying to improve my math and i can see it! basically i always do practices through topical tys just so i can be stronger in the particular topic for like 2 hours a day at least. if youre not sure on how to do the question despite looking through answer key do consult your teacher (or friends too because idl my cher HAHA)', 'hii! Getting from F9 to a B3 is NOT impossible for emath! i’ve seen many of my friends done it :) I started off with D7/C6 but in about 5months managed to climb to a constant 85-90 marks. You really need to do a lot of practices but beforehand, write down all the key eqns and concepts in each topic (it’s not that a lot, most of them take only 1/2 or 1 page of an A4 paper) so when you do practices, you can refer to them much easier. at first it can be a headache when you attempt the questions, if you’re unable, go to the answer key and find out what they’re trying to do in each step cause usually those steps are frequently applied in each topic. at first, try to solve every single qn, don’t time yourself. when you get the hang of it, try to set a duration that is slightly more than the exam duration and when you’re ready, you can practice the actual timing :) other than just revising, your teacher plays an impt role! your teacher should not be chasing you to complete your math practices but the other way around! complete the papers as fast as you can and demand(yes, DEMAND!) for more! It’s your Os this year and your teachers SHOULD prioritise your needs to do well in Os. nevertheless, all the best for Os!', 'Hi! Since the others are commenting on math I\'ll give you smth for science that helped me during my O\'s.\n\nYou said that you have a problem in figuring out what exactly is the question asking. Try doing more papers - but this does not mean spam papers. Try to pick up the pattern of the questions and how to answer them, what exactly is needed etc. In the SEAB website, look for your syllabus document ([here](https://www.seab.gov.sg/home/examinations/gce-o-level/o-level-syllabuses-examined-for-school-candidates-2020)) and go all the way to the ""glossary"" (i think it\'s called that). It shows what is expected of students to answer when they have certain keywords in the question (e.g when they ask for definitions (""define"") vs the concept of the material (""explain"")). \n\n\nAs for mole concept, rmb all your formulae. Try memorising it in diagrams (like the triangle for mass = mol× Mr) and linking it up to the units (Mr = g/mol, so to get mass (g) you need to somehow take away mol, therefore you need to multiply by the amt of mol). Also, when you answer qns for mol concept try using tables. Write the general balanced equation as the header, and then you have mol, Mr, mass (depending on the qn) on the extreme left. It\'s easier when you can see what you have all in one place instead of it being in the question.\n\nHope this helps! Good luck for your O\'s!', 'This is what I told my friend who have been failing Amath but this should apply for any math, for question that you can do, please make sure you get it right. Don’t spend much time bother on questions that you are barely prepared but try to do those that I have seen before or looks easy. I think the problem is you made a lot of careless mistake. It doesn’t mean you are dumb, it just means that well you were being careless and it can totally be solved by practice and allocate enough time for them.', ""I face similar issues for chemistry as my phrasing is really bad so what my teacher did was ask us to self mark our own work and give ourselves a mark. this really helps me as when self-marking I'm able to know what is lacking in my answer and to take note of it the next time I see similar qns. \n\nfor math wat my teacher did was to give us revision worksheet to do, she also times us roughly 1.5 mins/mark. this helps us as we can have better time management,  brush up on our concept, also do reduce our careless mistakes. hope these 2 points will be helpful to you. atb!"", 'emath you must understand the concepts (what the qn is asking).

Air conditioning), get trainers for unique CCAs or tablets for the students, other resources, etc... \n\nIt is perceived that all the above *might* give the students an edge to produce better academic results and better academic results *may* allow the kid to go into a “good” secondary school, followed by “good” junior college/polytechnic, “good” University, “good high paying” job = successful in life. \n\nGetting into a elite school does not always guarantee success though. There are students who don’t perform well in these elite schools and don’t be surprised if the teachers berates them for bringing down the school’s standards.  \n\nIt is perceived that those in neighbourhood schools are average, won’t go into good JCs/polys, won’t go into good unis, won’t get good jobs and won’t be “successful”. It’s a blanket statement that’s not true, of course. \n\nI consider myself an average student and personally studied in neighbourhood schools for primary and secondary schools. I am a late bloomer and got good results near the end of my sec sch life and eventually stayed on Dean’s List for all my uni semesters. Pretty happy with my job in science now. \n\nIMO, the basic facilities are adequate across all primary schools and the curriculum is the same across Singapore. It’s just that some schools have a little extra to stimulate the kid’s interest in learning or have teachers with a teaching style that motivates students... \n\nYou know your child and you’ll have to see what kind of environment they thrive in. Some kids might thrive in high pressure environment, some are self-motivated, some need a bit of guidance, some just need a different style of teaching. \n\nIMO, EQ and street smarts are more important than exam and book smarts. Knowing how to interact and work with people would be part of one’s eventual job scope, not regurgitating facts from a textbook.  \n\nThis is a discussion/debate that’s never ending... Do we allow our kids to have a childhood or do we force them to get good grades for the sake of “success”?', 'Our ministers always like to say that all schools are good school. This is not true. It is not because good school has more resources than normal/neighbour school (at most marginal more only because of alumni network), but the key difference is the parents background. \n\nGood schools tend to have parents who are consciously trying to provide better education opportunity for their kids. This creates a competitive environment for the kids (indirectly especially if parents share notes with each other on educational methods). \n\nOn the contrary, neighbourhood school tends to have parents that either have issue in their family (family abuse, divorces) or parents who are struggling to provide for the family (tend to be blue collar workers). A primary school teacher who is a personal friend of mine mentioned that in her class where 50% are from such family background, the kids lack motivation and tend to stray. \n\nOr to quote what another friend who remarked, he’s a lazy folk from an elite school that starts with ‘R’, “how can you slack when the classmate that sit beside you is a minister son?”. This statement explains a lot.', ""others have commented their experience in neighbourhood schools, so i think I'll add my experience in elite schools, both primary and secondary. im now in university and have met people from different backgrounds, ie elite primary, secondary schools and now in uni, or neighbourhood primary school, elite secondary school then university, or those from neighbourhood schools and now in university. comparing my experiences with theirs, i can say there are differences\n\n1. general funding of the schools are different. i had a lot of enrichment classes within and outside of curriculum, held by the school (meaning my parents didnt sign me up for them but did have to pay for them). during PE lessons the equipment the school had which we used were always adequate and we had a wider range of sports to choose from, compared to my friends experiences where everyone played 1 sport. with more funding also meant there was more overseas programmes ie OCIP, immersion programme. we had more fun school events as well, ie carnivals\n\n2. environment is more conducive for studying, people are generally well behaved. there were the typical few notorious kids in each cohort but it seemed like the notorious ones in my school would be the normal ones in my friends (from neighbourhood schools) cohort.\n\n3. being from an elite school means a lot of my friends are from affluent backgrounds and had so many people watching over them, keeping them on the right track. i feel like its difficult to stray and become a delinquent when my friends werent the type to do so?\n\nnevertheless, many of my uni friends are from neighbourhood schools. and we all end up at the same place! so i think that as long as parents keep a watchful eye, no matter which school their children are from, there wouldnt be much of a problem"", 'Whichever school it is, parental upbringing is more important. If kid goes to a neighbour school, have to be wary of bad influence. If kid goes to an elite school, have to help kid manage high stress environment.

(idk the dynamic yall have lol just assuming) is the allure of it as a whole. \n\nin my very own perspective, i have no regrets going to a nb pri sch, it was enough and fine as a whole. i can delve more into my personal experience, the pressures i faced with its kind of special dynamic if u like more enquires :) good luck on your applications and i hope they\'ll go smoothly.', ""Totally agree with you.

I couldn't cook, and when I got married and have kids, I had no idea how to care for a family on my own. I've always had all resources and support systems with me, money was never an issue, I had no responsibilities other than my studies, then suddenly I had to settle in a foreign country without support system of a family. This changed the way I view the world generally - that resilience matters above anything else. My master's degree brought me here but I need other skillsets to survive, which my childhood upbringing simply lacking.\n\nHence my queries on neighborhood vs elite schools.

Other than sending out this template email, we have other ways of getting the administration to act, PM me for more info.

I will post my thoughts about the issue and the actions I have taken to push for improvement in the comments.

~~Two days~~ Weeks ago, I posted a [thread inviting tertiary students of Singapore to share how their school life has changed due to COVID-1](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iebqzr/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_is_school/)[9](https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/iebqzr/tertiary_students_of_singapore_what_is_school/). It turns out that students of NTU are facing a very unique situation because of the preventive measures put in place by people in the upper echelons.

If you haven't been catching up, here's a short summary of what we are facing:

>Most lectures are online while tutorials and labs are physical lessons. Lecturers have the final decision on whether to keep their lectures online or bring it back to physical classes if their classes are <50 students.  
>  
>Most students have both online and physical lessons in a single day with little breaks in-between, so students are forced to come to campus for their online lessons because their travel time > break time.  
>  
>Because of this, our campus is flooded with students. We have no means of safe distancing, especially during peak hours in food establishments or bus stops.

To NTU students affected by these measures or for those who know someone else who is affected, it is time to make yourself heard. **All it takes is 2 minutes of your time to send an email & share this movement with other NTU undergraduates.**

Don't wait for change to happen, **be** the change.",0.86,https://www.reddit.com/r/NTU/comments/ipgzh6/template_email_to_get_ntus_administration_to/,"['EDIT: Updated email threads with SU - 11/9/20\n\nThe administration has communicated to me that their planning (that resulted in students having to go to campus for online learning) is justifiable because of the safe distancing measures implemented. However in reality, the sheer number of students on campus due to online/offline schedules prevent us from actually safe distancing.\n\nDr Goh (Chief Health and Safety officer) stated “Bus controllers and security officers are deployed during peak hours to help ensure that safe distancing at the bus stops are observed”.\n\nMy question is, does Dr Goh work in a different university that I am currently attending? Just take a look at the Hive bus stop during peak hours and tell me again if there is safe distancing going on there. The answer is a resounding no, **because it’s impossible (to safe distance) due to the size of the bus stop and the sheer number of students.**\n\n# What can be done then?\n\nBefore someone falsely accuses me again of hinting for an online semester, I’m not pushing for it. Plus, what are the chances the administration would do it? No students on campus = people start complaining about school fees, people staying in hall will also ask for refund.\n\nThere are other soft measures that I think can be implemented to reduce the number of students on campus.\n\nMy guesses on why students feel compelled to attend their online lessons on campus:\n\n* Online lectures are not recorded\n* Online lectures are recorded badly\n* Online lectures have attendance requirements\n* Online tutorials/seminars have a participation component or attendance requirement\n   * These classes should have been conducted physically in the first place\n* Students don’t have a suitable learning environment at home\n\nSoft measures that could be implemented are:\n\n**To give students the peace of mind that they will not miss out on any learning opportunity by not attending the online lecture live,**\n\n* Make it mandatory for all online classes to be recorded regardless of faculty\n   * All lecturers should be given support and guidance on how to operate the recording function on zoom/BBcollaborate\n* Do away with participation grades/attendance for online classes\n\n**All classes that can be done without discussion between students should be done online.**\n\n* Personally, I have lectures where the lecture just talks for 2 hours without interacting with students being held in person when it could\'ve been an online class (This class was originally online in week 1, but the lecturer changed it to physical class the week after)\n* If the lecturers can find a way to tweak the learning materials to allow for online learning, it would be ideal.\n\n**Some students don\'t have a suitable learning environment at home.**\n\n* Utilize the unused exam halls to allow students who have online and physical classes a place to attend their online classes.\n\n# Actions I have taken so far to push for improvement\n\n* Emailed the president\'s office detailing the problem and possible solutions\n   * The Chief Health and safety officer of NTU refused to acknowledge the problems and taichi-ed it to my faculty chair, who then pushed it to the faculty manager\n      * I have since met the faculty manager and the conclusion was to get my Chair to ask the administration to meet me directly\n* Tried to start an [online movement](https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/ig9yd7/uni_ntu_students_who_have_to_attend_online/) to get affected students to email the president.\n* Email the Student Union about the issues and asked for their stance on the problem\n   * First reply totally ignored the problem of overcrowding due to online/offline schedules and only addressed the \'no standing\' rule on campus buses\n   * Second reply detailed their (SU members) opinions on why my possible solutions are not in line with what they personally believe in (without giving any elaboration) and aligning with the views and direction of the NTU administration.\n      * The NTUSU claims to be our voice, but has failed to gather the views and thoughts of students on the ground, instead they chose to push for their own personal views and to act as an extension of the NTU administration\n\nEmail thread with SU:\n\n[Email to SU](https://pastebin.com/QSkVFTyd) \\- Detailing the current problems 1) Students having to attend online lessons on campus 2) \'No standing\' rule resulting in inconveniences\n\n[SU reply 1](https://pastebin.com/29QWnQaU) \\- Totally ignored problem 1) and only addressed problem 2)\n\n[Email to SU 2](https://pastebin.com/h76pzHKv) \\- Restated problem 1) and provided suggestions that might help solve the issue\n\n[SU reply 2](https://pastebin.com/rKFS0j7N) \\- Provided vague examples, pushed for the personal views and agendas of SU and academic club presidents without addressing the concerns\n\n[Email to SU 3](https://imgur.com/a/0ehLjqB)  \\- Asked for clarification regarding the vague examples given and also to substantiate their arguments\n\n[SU president reply 3](https://pastebin.com/dmejB5Nf) \\- Misrepresented my concerns and accused me of pushing for all classes to be moved online (it\'s alright, not the first time people have accused me of that). Made the assumption that ""I preferred online classes"" based on his misrepresentation of my concern.\n\n[Email to SU 4](https://imgur.com/a/veIYUum) \\- Clarified my stance and my suggestions again. Asked for the VP Cheryl to substantiate her points in ""SU reply 2"".\n\n# The NTU administration had a full month to take my email seriously but chose to ignore it, guess what kind of shit we are in now?', 'Commendable effort, but honestly to be realistically speaking, unless there’s a major problem that arise due to students having issues on online learning, I believe NTU will not change their stance. From what I gathered from my friends and other school mates, online lectures and tutorials are still serviceable. If it’s to the point that learning has been compromised, I believe majority of the cohort for that module would email the prof and let them know how to improve on it. Hence, I think the issues of not learning well online can’t be generalised. \n\nAlso, regarding the overcrowding issues, it’s fair to say that various parts of the school where they are doing their lectures are still adhering to safe distancing measures as libraries and study areas have their own measures in place. It’s probably a matter of not enough seats for students but that could be solved. \n\nHonestly speaking, the problems you raised are valid and of concern but it is not to the point of alarm that we have to change up the entire current system to cater to these smaller issues at hand. Thats how I feel about it and probably how the school views it based on their replies.', 'You know, the best way (historically proven so too)  to get NTU complaints actually addressed and remedied is to get them on news media like mothership/NewPaper/Straits times. (eg, the erratic/changed exam schedule issue last sem)', 'ZeroPauper I commend your efforts and your civic mindedness. You have been very helpful in highlighting opportunities for improvement which I imagine are easily implementable with a reasonable budget.', 'Whether or not the issues are major or not can only be determined through a school wide survey. Which I have suggested Dr Goh to conduct (I even offered my assistance in helping him craft the questions). \n\nMy view is that the issues with students having to come to campus for online lessons are of a minority when compared to the whole population of NTU. However we cannot discount what these students are facing because in absolute numbers, the 100 or 200 students who have to camp in public study areas should deserve better. \n\nThe suggestions I have brought up to them can be easily implemented (e.g. mandatory lecture recordings) and would benefit everyone’s learning. \n\nThese measures are nowhere near “changing up the entire system”.\n\nPlus with the recent news of that covid case walking freely around NTU, it brings up the issue of health and safety. My friends are concerned about coming to campus because they’re living with their grandparents. Some of their parents have expressed their worries and asked them if they really have to go to school and crowd around. \n\nIt doesn’t matter if the learning spaces (Open area or libraries) have safe distancing measures. Coming to campus does not only revolve around spending time in those “safer” areas. We have to eat, we have to travel around campus (on foot or on crowded buses).', 'Local news media are not interested to feature our plight.', 'Okay true maybe other parts they could improve on like record every lectures but i dont think we should be paranoid about the local case in NTU as there have been so many “frequently visited” places outside and not one single cluster has been formed from that. Even MOH is saying that we need not avoid those cases. The case about u saying we have to to eat and travel. It has been proven that it’s merely transient, the risk of contacting COVID via public transport is low. Perhaps you are adding this to try to validate your argument of creating a better online learning environment but I disagree on these two fronts.', 'What we currently know about COVID is in its infancy. In every pandemic or epidemic, extensive knowledge about how the pathogen works or infects it’s hosts are known years after the end of the episode after intensive research.\n\nTake for example the hoo-ha about the effectiveness of masks. Initially WHO said that masks were not effective, but then it turned out to be false. My point being that we don’t yet know this virus fully, and what we contend to be true now might change very rapidly.\n\nRegarding your argument of “no clusters formed”, you forgot to add “so far” to that. Remember that we are in the middle of a pandemic and anything can change in a blink of an eye. All of the “detected” community cases so far have been **asymptomatic** and were only uncovered through **active testing**. There could be more cases out there that are asymptomatic for all we know. \n\nThe NTU staff who was covid positive was asymptomatic and **""had no further information of where or when he may have been exposed to the virus""** if you read the email from the president\'s office. This further proves the point of us not knowing if there are more asymptomatic cases out there.\n\nPlus, the virus could have evolved to avoid detection by our immune system, or worse still suppress it. So that in evolutionary sense they are able to replicate and “reproduce” more effectively.\n\nOf course these are only assumptions based on my limited knowledge as a biology student. But my point is that we **do not fully understand the extent or capabilities of the virus** and we should err on the side of caution, especially when we can control the number of students on campus.']"
217,mellowminister,f7pha9,My father has cancer and we are running out of masks for him,2020-02-22 15:41:13,singapore,378641,63,186,"3 weeks ago, I was ranting about how my father who is currently going through chemotherapy could not find masks at the hospital. 

It’s been 3 weeks and we still can’t find any legitimate sources. We’ve used up the 4 pieces that the government gave out long ago, and if this situation goes on, my father will have no masks to protect him from viruses. It’s not a 100% protection, but at least we feel safer when he wears them when he’s out.

My sibling went out to source and ended up getting scammed with fake 2 ply masks at exorbitant prices, I tried searching at every thrift store and drugstore that I pass by, but it was either no masks or shady looking ones. In fact, an acquaintance gave my father some “medical grade” masks which turned out to be non-3 ply ones which we could see through easily.

Right now, we don’t know what are the proper channels to go through. We understand that hospitals and clinics are having a tough time as well. Anyone knows what can cancer patients like my father do?

TLDR version: 
- father has cancer
- doc advises to wear a mask whenever he heads out
- got scammed a few times with fake masks
- can’t find legitimate sources
- still no news from the g to help immunocompromised patients

219,queenjoyuri,e1b4pa,Just wanted to get it off my chest,2019-11-25 13:04:06,singapore,378641,114,499,"I feel so overwhelmed. Today, I finished my A Level exams. The paper was 3 hours long and unreasonably hard, but I went home hoping to hear a word of congratulations and affirmation from family. It really sucks because that giddiness of relief and happiness from finishing this journey of my teenage years just shattered two minutes into stepping into my home because of a mother figure who is so riddled in insecurity that she treats every single thing uttered as if the other party had plotted with evil intentions to insult and ridicule her, and projects her insecurity of being insulted onto others by being consistently toxic, narcissistic, and lacking in empathy. The paternal figure is confrontational with absolutely no ability to hold a conversation without roaring three sentences in, nor does he use any form of communication skills to, actually, communicate. No amount of reasoning helps when they simply don't listen. And I'm just typing away here going deaf from music at the highest volume so I can drown out the jabs they keep taking at each other. After so many years of this it never really gets easier to tolerate but today of all days it just feels so utterly depressing

Edit: I posted this 4 hours ago not thinking that this would even get remotely 5 replies so thank you to everyone for the genuine kindness shown to me. What made me feel down today wasn't so much the fact that they didn't throw a big fuss or reward me for completing my As (because I don't expect that LOL it's just exams) but rather the lack of warmth between family members, and its absence was especially glaring today, because I think I might have appreciated it. Thank you to everyone that offered a listening ear, and those that congratulated me and reassured me that moving forward, things will get better. It really does mean so much to me.",0.93,https://www.reddit.com/r/singapore/comments/e1b4pa/just_wanted_to_get_it_off_my_chest/,"['People say school was the best time of their lives.

Take a well deserved break, and don\'t let your current situation get you down. It sounds like you\'re the adult in the situation.\n\nI empathize with your situation - my little sister and I went through a very similar situation with my parents as I grep up, and was subject to physical and emotional abuse. Things were never ever ""good enough"" and there\'s constant drama and there was no real ""warmth"" in the family. It has affected me even today (almost 50), and after lots of therapy, I have managed with the reality of the situation.\n\nMy advice is avoid escalating the confrontation. Whenever the situation starts spiraling downhill, just say ""I\'m going for a walk"" and leave. Removing yourself gives the opportunity for all sides to cool and calm down. You\'re going to be asked why you are leaving at that point, and your response should be something like ""if we cannot have a constructive conversation, like adults, there\'s no point. I\'m going to take a walk to give us time to calm down, and we can discuss this later.""  This approach has worked well and it gives your parents time to think ""what did we do wrong."" The key is to act consistently - they will have to realize that if they act like spoiled children, they won\'t get anything.\n\nActually, since NS started, I had actively avoided time at home. I\'d be in camp for most of the week, then spend time with (then) GF and friends during the weekend. While in NUS, I lived in the residence halls and avoided going home. There was always staying with the GF too. The situation got so bad that I could not be in the same flat with my dad without getting into a big argument/fight (this is true even when I last returned to SG when my mom passed) . My sister and I are really close, and eventually we left SG, and have kept our parents very distant.\n\nTL:DR - been there, and I know how you feel.

220,spookitkat,gnbx3k,"haven't worked in 4 years, need advice",2020-05-20 22:04:36,askSingapore,44614,36,219,"My story is simple. I’m 23 y.o. and  haven't worked in about 4 years. This hasn't been due to laziness, but due to depression, coupled with issues that I haven't been able to overcome. 

My confidence issues regarding working and functioning are a result of a father who was overly-critical and perfectionistic. He works at the SAF and brought that same sort of mentality home. He would shout, berate and shame me if things weren't done his way. Everything had to be done perfectly. His words would drip with condescension when he spoke to me. Even something as simple as washing the dishes could get him riled up. 

As a result, I developed a huge fear of failure and a fear of making mistakes. I believe that I'm stupid, unworthy and just not good enough. I have no faith in my abilities, even simple abilities like being able to understand concepts is problematic for me. These seem like basic fears that most people struggle with to some degree, but unfortunately for me, they have become debilitating and have affected every part of my life. 

I survived in school as far as grades were concerned, but only because I could go home and study on my own. I had a difficult time with anything that required me to use my hands, like science experiments. Or my brain, like being tested on the spot. I still remember how we had to do practicals every Thursdays in JC. I would lie in bed awake the night before, unable to sleep, and sick with worry. During the experiments, I would be so nervous that my hands would be trembling throughout the lesson. 

This extended to the non-academic side of things as well. I vividly remember an instance where my teacher asked me to count some money, I was so flustered, my heart was pounding and my hands were trembling. I did not even trust myself to do something as simple as count money! 

I spent all my schooling years severely depressed. I had grown up in a messed up family with a lot of other childhood trauma. It was an unstable environment, which eventually led to my own unstable mental state. 

I continued with school for as long as I could, but about 4 years ago, I dropped out of JC without completing my A levels. I couldn't do it anymore. I was suicidal, depressed, and couldn't focus in the slightest. Since then, I haven't worked either. I'm basically a NEET. I have tried going back to jc twice since then but dropped out after a short period each time. 

I had one job once as an insurance telemarketer. I spent hours and hours rehearsing the script before the first day only for them to give me a completely different script , which completely threw me off. I was really bad at it too. After the first day, I never went back. I refused the money that they offered me for the 4 hours I worked on the first day because I had done a horrible job, and I didn't feel like I deserved the money. That’s the other problem I guess. I have always believed that I’m so unworthy and bad that I don’t deserve to be paid. It’s a terrible mentality.  

 I very clearly have issues and am in therapy trying to work through them. 

Every Chinese new year, I get the same questions and same looks  from relatives when they realise I'm not working or studying. I know that people view our worth based on how productive we are. But all that does is fill us with shame and perpetuate that inner narrative that we are useless. As someone who was raised to be ultra productive all the time, when I first dropped out school, I would starve myself because I felt like I didn't deserve to eat. I felt like I didn't even deserve to live because I was no longer a productive member of society.

Someone in my life made a comment recently that I am depressed because of unemployment and that basically I wouldn’t be depressed if I had a job. It made me feel terribly invalidated.

Sometimes I wish I could explain to people the helplessness I feel when they ask me why I've been unable to work so far. I wish I could explain that I can’t just pull myself up by my bootstraps, and the conventional advice of staying busy, exercising and eating healthy, though useful, doesn’t have a significant effect on depression that’s caused by deep rooted issues. It can help, but not to the extent that one might believe. It’s why I was depressed even while I was in school and busy. It’s why even though I still exercise, try to meet friends when I can muster the strength, eat well, take omega 3 acids, get plenty of sunlight, I still remain depressed. 

Having said that, there was some truth to that person’s comments. In my case, although staying busy has never helped with my depression, it does affect my anxiety levels. The busier I am, the less prone I am to angst. Working may not make me mentally well, but it’s a start. At the very least, it can give me a sense of purpose. Also, I can’t hide forever. I don’t want to hide forever. 

So that leads me to the purpose of my post. I find myself stuck in a rut, wanting to work but somehow paralysed by fear. I realise that exposure therapy of just getting out and doing it might help, yet the fear continues to overwhelm me. Therapy and medication have unfortunately not helped me. 

Something that did help, though, was reading your stories. 2 days ago, I submitted this post here but deleted it, together with that acc, within 10 minutes of posting because I was terrified. There were a few who read that first post before I deleted it and messaged me with stories of their own. Reading those stories was very encouraging. This has been a lonely experience, and more than anything, I need to know that there are others who’ve been through it and managed to find their way out of the rut. I’m posting here again because I really need some help. 

If you’ve been through something similar, even if just for a short period, please share. If you have advice for me, even if you’ve never been a neet, please share. I really need the advice.

Edit 1: Everyone, thank you for all your comments. Please know I'm reading and processing every single one of them. I really appreciate them and will reply to them tomorrow. <3",0.97,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/gnbx3k/havent_worked_in_4_years_need_advice/,"['You\'re not alone.  \n\nI\'m over 10 years older than you, so consider this a message from the future.  And for the record, I\'m not a therapist, doctor, etc.  \n\nI went through the same type of abuse (for me it was emotional, mental, and physical) during my childhood and the impact has lasted even into my 30\'s.  For example: I have a speech impediment, a stammer that limits me from saying my own name properly and I pretty much dry heave before any high stress event (e.g. big work presentation, first date, second date, etc).  When I was about 27, I was unemployed for well over a year and felt incredibly worthless and less than everyone.  I too have the same feelings of ""not being worthy"" and feeling like I don\'t deserve things, even the things that I did by all accounts earn on my own.\n\nI\'d like to say that you\'ll have this epiphany when you hit 30 and everything will fall in place and suddenly you can live your life, but that\'s not the truth.  \n\nThe truth is: you will live with this burden for the rest of your life, but you are fully capable of managing this burden.  The problems and the world seem so huge to you right now; in the aggregate it feels like there\'s nothing you can do.  But you can. You absolutely can.  I know because I am you.  \n\nWith people like us, it\'s important to be kind to ourselves.  We tend to be super hard on ourselves because that\'s a projection of the abuse we faced.  A defense mechanism (if I\'m hard on myself then abuser won\'t be hard on me) that we developed in order to stay safe.  And when you say things like ""I don\'t deserve that"" or ""I\'m an idiot"", that is you being unkind to yourself.  I\'d like to believe you\'re a good person who is empathetic to others, but often times we don\'t afford ourselves the same courtesy.  You can action on this by literally telling yourself ""it\'s going to be ok"".  That\'s it.  See how that feels.  See how that feels when you go through an anxiety attack and you say it (if you\'re alone) out loud.  Mean it.  \n\nThere\'s plenty more advice if you want to hear it, but honestly it\'s not about reading some comment/book and making yourself feel better.  It\'s about understanding that you are not alone, that other people go through this and it\'s not about ""making it out to the other side"" as much as it is ""living with it"".  And you 100% can live with it and manage it and do whatever it is you want to do in life.  You can do it.\n\nLast anecdote:  I have a speech impediment, dry-heave and have massive anxiety before big events?  I work in an industry now where I regularly speak publicly in front of 100\'s of people (before COVID).  Insanity.  If you had told me 10 years ago this is where I\'d be, I would\'ve laughed and said you were crazy.  What I didn\'t realize 10 years ago is that while it is impossible to completely remove this burden, I can absolutely live with it and overcome it.\n\nSomedays are tougher than others, like I said it\'s about living with it, not curing yourself.  But I keep going and I occasionally look back at the ""route"" and have to remind myself how far I\'ve come.  In 10 years, I believe you will too.', 'For one, you gotta celebrate your strengths. You write well! You\'ve overcame a lot and still fight to move on. Well done. The truth is, well meaning or not, there\'s always gonna be opinions about you and what you do. People are gonna believe what they want and do things their way but PROTECT YOUR HEART. Not everyone is for you. Listen to the meaning behind their msg. If it\'s smth you can improve on, use it. If it isn\'t a voice, it\'s noise. Cast it. There\'re many things you can\'t control, but you can control how you react and what you choose to do.\n\nThere\'s power in words. Don\'t let words grip you of fear. You\'re not defined by opinions or situations. Don\'t look at yourself as who you are right now but who you\'re gonna be. Your setbacks are limitations. You\'re beyond that. Take charge in what you\'re telling yourself. Don\'t wait for someone to care for you. Care for yourself and love yourself first because you\'re important.\n\nWe\'re always a work in progress. I feared moving into the working world. I fear lots of things in life. I still fear interviews. It\'s okay but don\'t run away because sooner or later you still need to confront it. Take baby steps before moving on to big ones. You need to build your confidence slowly. Productivity can also mean enjoying yourself and resting because mental health is often overlooked but one of the greatest things important and necessary to look at. Samaritans of Singapore (SOS) offer emotional support. \n\nThat said, give yourself a timeline. Even if you tried and it didn\'t go as well as you\'d like, CREDIT yourself and TRY AGAIN. As Einstein said ""Failure is success in progress."" Everyone fails more times than we get it right. Success is in being resilient. What can you do now? TAKE ACTION. We await your good news!', ""You sure don't sound stupid, unworthy or just not good enough to me. Have a little faith in yourself. You're more than capable to achieve so much more.

I might not be experienced enough but I’m just going to leave my advice here just in case:\n\nStart small. Do small jobs to build up your confidence or you can start volunteering first. Don’t care how old you are now or how low paying the job is, right now you have a personal issue that needs some help as it will affect how you react towards bigger responsibility or workload. Mini victories are still an accomplishment, no matter how “mini” you think it is, it is still a win! \n\nEven after dropping out of school I’m sure you can always go back, if possible, private education could be an option\n\nThere was one post on r/LifeProTips that I read which might help. It said something along the lines of, “When you’re feeling down, talk to yourself like how you would to a friend who is upset.” Our words are always kind to others but not to ourselves, maybe you can practice that! \n\nMaybe when you’re doing something, teach yourself like how you would teach others. Use words that you would say or wished someone would say to you, when trying to comfort someone who has made a mistake.\n\nThough we might never cross paths, I really want you to feel better about yourself and be kind to yourself. Everyone else can be mean but you should be the last person to be mean to yourself. I wish you the best in recovery and maybe if you like to, it would be awesome to update on your journey to recovery! Might help some lurkers as well :)', 'Hey, you definitely aren’t alone in this. I’m 25 years old and have been working for a few months now, with several internships previously. My friends all feel that I should have enough experience to be able to tackle work life pressure without issues, but that’s not true at all. The more I work the more demoralised I get because I get very self-critical with every mistake I make. Then when the next workload or job comes to me, the worse and more anxious I feel because of all the mistakes I made previously.\n\nYou’re right that you cannot keep running forever, the only way to tackle an issue is to face it somehow. However, I feel like one thing you should know is you have no time limit to face whatever issues you have, you can take all the baby steps you want. You said that you worked as an insurance telemarketer, but I feel that may be a too big step for you now; you need to be very eloquent and thick skinned enough to face rejection. It’s a difficult job even for normal people without the thick skin. \n\nI feel like you should consider whatever issues you wanna change about yourself, then think about how you can slowly work your way through it. In my case, I’m Super introverted and awkward, but I felt that its an important thing to socialise. So I started work as a simple goods packer, where I had to report to different supervisors. I then moved on to carnival part time sales, then to perfume etc. I could see that I improved over these experiences. I still have many flaws and get stressed out/depressed easily, but this “stepping stone” plan I set for myself is one of the few things I’m actually proud of myself in.\n\nCould you tell me if you have any particular interests or aims that you wanna set for yourself? Perhaps I can give you abit of advice on how you can work your way through it.\n\nI don’t think im able to fully understand your circumstance, as I have good friends and family but I still get anxiety and stressed over minor issues. Nonetheless, I hope I’m able to help you through this difficult period of your life. Hope to hear more from you!', 'Hi OP,\n\nYou are young and it is ok not to work for 4 years. Different people have different things they need to do with their lives, and if you need time to take care of yourself, it’s valid and reasonable. A lot of relatives here like to gossip and cast judgments and that’s their right. BUT it’s also your right and your free will to give no fucks about their opinions.\n\nSimilar to you, I grew up in an unstable environment as well and was depressed and miserable for as long as I can remember.\n\nMy advice is that for a start, you can consider working part time. This gives you time to distract yourself (when at work) while also having time to sort out your issues. I did that for a year or so, working part time and taking it slow on my off days to work on my issues, think about life, reset my expectations. \n\nIt can be very scary at first trying something you think is too daunting. But persevere. I forced myself to do exposure therapy by going after things I fear the most. Sure, the first few months gave me endless panic attacks and messed up sleep cycles but after a while, you will improve. \n\nOn days when it’s tough, remind yourself to set your expectations low. Do what you can, but don’t push it. And when it’s the end of the day, don’t forget to cheer yourself on for your small but fantastic achievement. \n\nLike the other poster said, it’s about managing your condition and not about suppressing or curing it.

It’s not easy to battle your inner demons/thoughts but please keep on fighting for you, for your future and for all the things you are going to achieve. \n\nI do not have the same issues as you so I cannot empathise but I truly hope that you find strength in yourself to push through. \n\nRemember, baby steps. Some days will be extra harder but know that each day, you write your own story different from yesterdays. \n\nYou are still going to beat yourself up about the failures, but you can and you will slowly reduce the emotions intensity (I mean level of emotions?) each time until a certain day comes, you are able to pick yourself up when you fall down. \n\nYou are your own adventures and imaginations. You sound like a creative person who writes very well. Your vocabulary is so much more than mine. Please take this compliment! \n\nFirst thing you gotta do is tell yourself what do you want to achieve each day (read for 30 mins, meditate, learn sign language, pick up writing [lowkey think you can pursue this area] etc) and do your utmost best to achieve it. And observe that if you fail to achieve, you learn that this is not the method to proceed, so change and adapt. Manage your expectations, and be gentle with yourself. We are our own best friend, and we are going to spend every second with our thoughts. Of course, you cannot stop negativity from coming, but you can rationalise and recognise that they are not part of you. Think of it as a passing storm.

They are subreddits about abstaining from porn usage and explaining the negative effects of porn on the brain (one of the more serious side effects include: anxiety, depression, lack of motivation). Tbh i’m actually shocked at today’s society view on porn, in fact many even put it on a pedestal, thinking it has more benefits than drawbacks while its actually the opposite and BY *A MILLION MILE!* Not suggesting that you are definitely one of its users but if you are I highly recommend this if you are ^^^ You’ll be surprised how many it has helped. \n\nNext as what you have said, you are trying to get good exercise, sleep and diet in which is correct. But what kind of exercise might be right for you will be aerobic exercises, especially jogging. Try to go easy on yourself but do it as long as you can in every session. If going out of your house is too tough for you, doing jogging on the spot or jumping jacks at home frequently will help tremendously.\n\nPractice mindfulness. This can be achieved in forms of meditation where you focused on your breathing. Mindfulness is the practise of being aware of your thoughts and the feeling of your body. When you are stressed, your mind wanders away, detaching from your body. Mindfulness helps by bringing it back and makes one become self aware of his thoughts, training calmness from within. Many have been skeptical about it because it may not give instant results but hey if it has the potential to solve your problems, why not give it a go right?\n\nIf you are looking for a job right now, like what others have said its great to take small steps, start with easy part time jobs then slowly proceed to doing other simple jobs before deciding on working full time. Remember *one step at a time*.\n\nWhat you need now is patience and working on things that will improve yourself a little bit at a time. Know that every single action towards improvement is cumulative and it really means something. Give yourself a pat on the back and think you have done good today 👌🏻  *Focus in the present day, forget about the past and the future do not matter.* Make the best out of everyday. \n\nLastly hear this, you are not alone in this. Tons of people are facing the same issue as you. Just treat it as a part of life, the test you’ll have to face to become stronger. Take it as an experience so you know what to do in the future. I know you can be better, *WE ALL DO*. Know that there will always be a community by your side on reddit. Do not be ashamed of your shortcomings my friend, we each have our own stories. What matters is how we help each other to overcome it. You can get over this, i believe in you okie 😊', 'Hi there, I resonated with your post and thank you for your courage to reach out! \n\nI myself was brought up by a narcissistic personality disorder parent who seek to feel good each time at the expense of her children.

Staying away from my narcissistic parent albeit she still calls me. \nGive a thought about your environment. An open and conducive away from bad visual cues (eg.

It's almost impossible to explain to others how someone could spend 4 years or even decades doing nothing. But it's possible, and almost all too easy after a while.\n\nSometimes people choose not to work and that's okay, but if someone isn't able to work for decades because they're so paralysed by fear and anxiety, that's truly heartbreaking.

Yeah a job, staying busy, looking forward to things are important, but they\'re more like salves than anything else.  What you\'re looking for is the ability to face your depression and anxiety in the face on the daily and say ""Alright, let\'s go"" and walk out that door.  (Not literally with CB) :)\n\nAs for your work-issue, here\'s my take.  There\'s no shame in taking small steps.  Maybe instead of a job, it\'s more about grabbing coffee with friends who do have jobs and networking.  Maybe it\'s more about taking a part time gig that you can do online in your spare time (you seem super eloquent and well-spoken, so I\'m sure that can come in handy).  Maybe it\'s about volunteering your time at a Non-Profit or religious group or whatever floats your boat.  Someone below wrote ""baby steps"" and I agree: taking small steps is a great way, exposure therapy aside, to create change.  No one conquerers their issues in a day, it takes time and patience for most of us.\n\nAnd when you get down, reach out like you\'re doing now.  Talk to people who can listen and understand.  There are people out there whether in the form of family, friends, therapists, online strangers, they exist and want to hear from you.  Seriously, just reading your post made me feel all the more validated in the way I feel, so as much as you think I\'m helping you, you\'re really helping me.  Crazy, right?', ""well I understand that fear & anxiety in part because it is actually not uncommon today. many of my friends see a therapist or psychiatrist regularly for it. I've also gone through dark periods of insane anxiety and panic attacks myself.  \nfor me, I found hope in praying even though I was never a very religious person. DEFINITELY find someone to talk about it regularly, it helps A LOT.  \n\n\nUnfortunately or fortunately, you are the only one who can help yourself which I'm sure you already know. I'd encourage u to explore find something that works for you. Most importantly it is to make a very concerted effort to make tiny baby steps everyday, however miniscule.  Bake a cookie today. Draw something tomorrow. Write a diary of how that makes you feel?""]"
221,haseuul,gzokkj,[JC] dropping out of jc / taking As privately?,2020-06-09 22:49:27,SGExams,77662,17,50,"hello! currently a j1 studying bcme (h1 econs) and honestly i’ve been thinking about dropping out of jc to attend As as a private candidate for awhile now, it just never really seemed feasible until hbl came along and it really made me see how personal directed learning suits my learning style so much more. 

with school—i can barely keep up with the content being taught, i dont have proper understanding or a good foundation because everything is constantly being rushed so that we can start on tutorials and practice questions, and additionally, nowadays i can barely do my work without referring to my lecture notes. even with the first few topics of the year like carbohydrates and lipids, everytime i try to go back to these topics to revise i just find that the teachers are moving on to a new topic and that i have to start rushing work again...its just an endless cycle of me completing my mountain of homework just so that i can hand them in. many times when i do these worksheets i dont understand whats going on at all, and it doesnt help that quite a few of my subject teachers are the type of teachers that would ask you to “google something” when you come to them with a question. this makes me so infuriated sometimes and just causes me to lose interest in my favourite subjects like biology and math... i dont really have the motivation to revise my work anymore. additionally with our school having extremely stressful mugger culture, i feel stressed every single day because my friends are coping so well with homework and revision. of course, this might be a facade but it doesnt get rid of the fact that i feel constantly overwhelmed and stressed with schoolwork. i understand that being overwhelmed in jc is pretty inevitable but its to the point where im up every night worrying about my content revision on top of the deadlines etc.

plus: my social life in school has been pretty hard, with my closest group of friends being extremely toxic and forming group chats without me speculating my each and every move. i’ve tried to take this with a pinch of salt but its really difficult when people in the school feed on any drama they hear about and especially there are rumours going on about me. ngl i chose this jc because it was a mugger school and i didnt expect much drama because this kind of stuff really takes a toll on my mental health and i find it so hard to avoid being caught up in gossip and toxicity in general, but look what happened on the end HAHA

i think what adds on to all of this is my class being extremely clique-y and that i don’t really fit in anywhere, i pretty much feel really lonely in school with no support system and a few toxic friends oops

so yeah, i’ve been talking to my parents and close friends about it but i’m planning to approach my teachers and ecg counsellor soon about this. i know most people would advise me to bite the bullet and pull through the remaining time in jc, but i’m really conflicted and on the fence about my decision right now :’)

don’t really have a solid plan on what i’m going to do if i ever drop out but i’ll probably be relying on tuition, lecture notes and also practice papers, plus working a part-time job to cover the tuition fees. i’ve seen quite a few success stories of private A level candidates on reddit but please educate me more on the pros and cons of this!!!

any advice would be greatly appreciated <3 

tl;dr really unhappy about school life and how its not suited to my learning—planning to drop out of jc but seeking advice on this matter",0.95,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/gzokkj/jc_dropping_out_of_jc_taking_as_privately/,"['I would suggest just pressing through JC.\n\nIts okay to not keep up all the time, just make sure you go for consultations to clear up whatever you don\'t understand before the school exams and A levels.\n\nPersonally, I didn\'t do very well for A lvls as I kinda gave up in the last lap (personal issues, big mistake.) I passed everything though. So it\'s not too bad. But could be better. Don\'t be me. \n\nAnyway I retook A levels as a private candidate the next year, while juggling work. I felt even worse and more unmotivated. Its not as easy as it sounds. Improved on most subjects but accidentally failed one, which made the whole sitting useless. Thankfully I cleared everything on my first sitting tho, so I wasn\'t totally with no options. \n\nAs a private candidate, I alr had full notes and materials as I completed school. Right now you don\'t. So I would suggest staying on and just completing with the school. You can always retake as a private candidate if you feel like your results will be better, after that. Otherwise you needa find your own notes and study yourself, but if with tutors in sch and you\'re alr not coping well, it\'s definitely gonna be harder on ur own cos you won\'t have ppl to seek help from. \n\nIf it\'s rly bad, and you don\'t promote this year, maybe you can try other options like poly. But take note you will likely need to be more social there, and there\'s more groupworks and stuff like that. There\'s rly lesser ""bitchery"" in JC as everyone\'s busy studying. (briefly studied at NAFA and can see the types of conflicts at both types of institutions.) Not blaming that you\'re the reason why your classmates treat you that way, but rather, sometimes maybe we can reflect and see if there\'s anything we can improve on to fit in better. \n\nAll the best :)', 'honestly taking A levels as a private candidate is rlly hard as u wont have the resources that yr sch will provide u such as resource packages, past year papers and teachers feedback which are all critical to doing well for As other than yr own blood sweat and tears. \n\nHowever, if yr current sch environment is that unconducive, maybe taking As as a private candidate wld be btr for yr own mental well being. \n\nBut personally i wld j push through becos 2 years is legit v short and u will eventually meet more toxic and crazy ppl when u go into uni or work so i wld j take it as a learning experience LOL', 'Do NOT drop out at the stage you\'re at currently. Like others have mentioned, you\'d be in a different place from a candidate retaking A\'s privately (p solid resource inventory). \n\nAnd, what makes you think if you\'re struggling so much guided, that you\'d do any better independently? I so sympathise with your social and mental health situation, and if I were to take your word for it your teachers haven\'t been too helpful as well. But, taking issue with their ""google it"" response is a direct contradiction to this independence you are seeking and assuming you\'ll do better with. I don\'t think a teacher\'s default response is to direct a student to google either, so maybe there\'s some perspective we\'re missing here. Anyway, if you could do it independently as a private candidate, what\'s wrong with just doing that but riding along the school\'s resource provision? The problem doesn\'t seem like the school environment is trash, but that you\'re looking for a social escape by dropping out. I can\'t say I\'ve been in your position, but I\'d implore you to consider carefully - is the social respite you will gain from dropping out worth messing up your chances for uni admission (assuming that\'s your goal like most JC kids), and how will you deal with socialising from here on out? Uni/poly is filled with projects upon projects. \n\nI don\'t mean to be a wet blanket, but I think you\'re not seeing the bigger picture. I would advise you to get professional help - this CB has been quite insightful in terms of people realising certain problems exist and cinfronting them, and it seems like you have had that moment but you\'re stuck before the resolution. All the best.', 'Extremely cliquey class? Toxic classmates? I had my fair share of such bs in JC as well. It did take me a while to ignore other people’s opinions and focus on what was at hand. I had only one good friend in class I can relate to and converse like a normal human being. \n\nPersonally, I still feel it would be wiser to pull through these 2 yrs in JC. Being in school may instil some sort of discipline in getting work done. If you feel that you are lacking behind, don’t be afraid to approach teachers for individual consultations. Some teachers often rush through lectures and tutorials to keep up with the content, but with consultations, they can provide the support that you need.\n\nIf you are considering taking As as a private candidate, you have to make sure that you have the discipline to keep up with the momentum. You have to ask yourself if you are capable of juggling work, tuition and individual practice at the same time. If having a more personal and flexible schedule suits you, this may work out if you are disciplined enough and plan your work accordingly.\n\nDo continue to speak to your close friends/parents/reliable teachers and counsellors to seek their opinion and guidance. You don’t want to make such a decision only to regret it later.\n\nRegardless, I wish you all the best and may you achieve the goals you set! :)', 'You need CCA, build a portfolio, plus jcs can provide help with universities and application\n\nEdit: everyone struggles, do revision during holidays', 'imo, i think you should drop out because continuing like this will obviously take quite the toll on your mental health and affect your results—meaning you’d have to retain anyway. i had a friend who dropped out of jc to go to poly to pursue her desired course, animation, and she’s living the best life there— amazing and kind classmates, sincere teachers and studying for something that you’re genuinely passionate about. previously in jc, she was put in a class that was majorly cliquey and unbonded and had to deal with subjects she didn’t have interest in. in all honesty, i myself sometimes regret coming to jc and taking my current set of subjects— i kinda picked my subjects on impulse and found out that they weren’t really for me but it was too late to change them. so you should just drop out — the traditional jc route is overrrated anyway— take a break for your mental health and consider an alternative route: eg poly, ib, going overseas to study.', 'if you want, add me on discord and we can study together.

222,auspiciouscat63,izga5u,"Infected worker found dead in KTPH, thoughts?",2020-09-25 17:10:39,askSingapore,44614,8,23,"https://www.tnp.sg/news/singapore/infected-worker-found-dead-ktph-worried-about-future

I read earlier this year also there was a bangladeshi contract worker  diagnosed with covid 19 that ""accidentally fell by himself to their death"".

Now this one also, but with a  video of him  stating that with covid 19 he was going to die and did not wish to live anymore, and fishy defending that the nurses alr told him it was curable, saying he was making good progress.

For a man to make a video to say that he wants to die because he thought covid 19 was a death sentence. Do we just blatantly accept  he was ""too dumb"" to understand his own language of being told its curable?

Or of course one can be influenced by depression and stress supporting a family overseas, and the key issue being he is scared to not be able to continue working to earn money. Why wasnt that point emphasized?

I honestly find it appalling how much defending of asses is going on here instead of actually going to figure out why he killed himself like it was a murder case.










EDIT: thanks for the responses and upvotes and I added some comments before editing, please read in full. 


From rereading, with the information provided, I want to point the target on Dr. Goh, I have a huge disdain for how he defended himself and others over “why there were no reason for him to kill himself”. 


 He said that there was no way they could predict his death and gave the reasons why. But I disagree. 


Hypothesis 1: I have a theory The nurse didn't actually tell the Bangladeshi man (that committed suicide) or wasn't explained clearly to that it was curable. 


“Dr Goh said the pandemic was still evolving in April and patient numbers had become overwhelming. We did the best we could 


By this sentence, there is a reasonable  possibility that from own doctors and nurse stress, there wasn't explicit explanation to the “overwhelming foreign workers coming in” that it was curable to individual persons. The slew of infected workers coming into the hospital was not just in April, but following months also there has been pouring of foreign workers that has been infected with Covid-19 from the dorm. At least a Hundred plus a day. And with Dr. Goh defence, 


"" Dr Goh said many migrant workers with Covid-19 had a ""conceptual difficulty” in understanding why they were in hospital, even after the diagnosis was explained to them in a language they could understand.” 


 Is there a possibility that Dr. Goh and other staff members didn't actually explain it so that it is comprehensible to them? 


 I could google translate English to Hindu doesn't mean I know how to speak it. 


But the more likely hypothesis 2: considering that it was understandable and the man did understand the infection was curable. What a gross saying from Dr. Goh that the man did not understand it was curable and that's why he killed himself. 


Because in the man suicide note video, it's becoming more clear when I'm not clouded by Dr. Gohs gross misinterpretation 


. “ In one, he said in Tamil: “The doctors are saying that I have coronavirus. Therefore, I do not wish to stay alive. I am ready to lose my life. Nobody or nothing has anything to do with this. I have recorded this with a sober mind.”


And supported by following quotes from the article. 


“The head and senior consultant of psychological medicine said: “He mentioned some worries about his financial future as well as worrying about his kids in India...


“Those were common concerns by patients in similar situations.”


Dr Goh said Mr Alagu would have been told, as with other patients, that he could recover from the disease. ""

 


He never said he was going to die and not recover from Covid-19, it's highly likely that he committed suicide because of job insecurity accompanied by the financial bills of hospital stay.  A visit to the hospital is a serious issue that is associated with heavy payment. He does not wish to pay, and there is job insecurity and risk for being deported back therefore he rather dies.


https://www.singsaver.com.sg/blog/what-will-i-need-to-pay-for-covid-19 



But I have to point the man explicitly said he had no salary issues with his boss and this was his decision and his decision alone to do it.  However, necessary investigation should ensue to not take his word at face value and check the payment records first and treatment at work. Or just what miscommunication or misconception or actual legitimate reason occurred to make it so that because of being infected with Covid-19 his future looked so bleak he'd rather be dead. I don't believe after 10 years of being the sole supporter of his family  he would just randomly kill himself. Remember the key defining reason he wants to die is because he is infected by Covid-19. . 


Aside from the gross misconduct of the doctor, and

This fluff piece. “And while the hospital has always made sure that patients can stay in touch with friends by sourcing phone chargers and top-up cards for them, its staff now make it a point to better connect with them, such as writing their names on their PPE.” 


Which I understand why they did it, but it only begs me to speculate more why he killed himself. 



There could be some issues with paying the agency ? After 10 years even after paying off the original debt of coming here they still take a percentage. But then again up to investigation. ",0.92,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/izga5u/infected_worker_found_dead_in_ktph_thoughts/,"['Hearsay this is the situation in some rapidly spreading developing countries:\n\nPeople shun those who were tested positive, and continue to avoid them even after they have recovered and returned from the hospital.\n\nOnce your neighbour / coworkers / anyone sees you being taken away by someone in a hazmat suit, nobody will interact with you or your family ever again, even if it was a false alarm.\n\nThat’s the reason why people are so afraid and reluctant to get tested for Covid, because once they are diagnosed their social (and possibly work) life is over.\n\nAnd for the people at the bottom ranks of society earning a few bucks a day, they cannot afford to not go to work.

Do you really think after 10 years being the sole provider for his family he wants to kill himself? He literally thought he had no other options and its very likely  he didnt want to become a burden to his family (since he believe he would die anyway and cant work, and its wide known how a stay at the hospital especially for non sgeans are very expensive) . And why after 10 years he doesnt have reserves to fall on? How much is he earning? How much is the agency taking? How was he treated at work? Obviously having been here for 10 years as a foreigner under strict laws that deport foreigners like no ones business. Like people dont think this actually crushes lives cos they either dont have enough or barely scrape to pay back the agency that sent them here. \n\nWhat do u think happens to them in their homecountry, where a Worker that worked here for 3 years and was underpaid took back just enough to pay back the agency. \n\nThey literally come here cos they dont have jobs options to work in their own country. Millions are literally starving in the phillipines and yemen. \n\nIts hard not to also presume ur comment comes from the place of privelege to not understand the struggles of others that can literally be beyond their control. Suicide is not wanting to die, its to end all the pain and suffering that can inflict on others too that can be formed from. Misconception too. Most all people dont want to kill themself, they feel like they need to. So why did this poor man feel like he needed to?']"

224,jkaess,hrup6c,[POLY] MY JOURNEY THROUGH NA > ITE > POLY & TIPS,2020-07-16 03:52:34,SGExams,77662,16,119,"Hi guys! Don’t really know if this will be helpful to anyone but i just wanted to share my journey and some tips that may help whoever find this helpful!

**\*disclaimer**, i’m listing things that have helped me and have found it helpful throughout this journey especially it’s such an unconventional route. so to whoever needs this, feel free to read on and AMA!

some background info: I’m actually a Normal Acad student (12 point) who decided to pursue a route to ITE through the direct poly programme offered by ITE (2 years of higher nitec and if you manage to obtain a cgpa of 3, you will sort of be guaranteed a spot in your mapped course/course related to your higher nitec course)

**ITE:**

As a direct poly programme(DPP) student, you are required to start school a few months earlier than the O’Level intake. Take these classes as foundation classes for students to catch up to their O’Level peers (especially since the difference between N’level standards and O’s is quite a jump). There aren’t any exams or tests, just suck it up and go through it (and make some friends along the way!)

For my course, all the dpp students were put together in a class. So we were quite lucky that the friends we made earlier on were going to be with us for the remaining 2 years.

**TIPS:**

* **Find out your study method!** do you score better in a supervised setting or are you more of a hands-on learner? If you’re the latter, the DPP route is certainly a better choice! (after all ITE is a technical education type of setting)
* **Know what you want to do!** don’t take up a dpp course just because you want to get out of your secondary school or skip sec 5. if you’re unsure whether the course is suitable for you, ask around for guidance (trusted secondary school teachers, your peers, your parents). Use elimination method if required: e.g I don’t see myself doing this, this, this, therefore i’m only left with this choices.
* **Know who to mix with!** there will be bad influences but honestly most of the closest friends I have now are my friends I gained through ITE.
* **You can still change your course when applying for poly!** however, make sure you have a portfolio available for your change and ensure that you are prepared for their questions during the interview (e.g why are you making this change etc.)
* **Your first sem grades are important!!!!** try your best to score. with only 4 semesters, it’s going to be difficult to pull your grades up subsequently if your first sem grades are bad.

**POLY:**

I managed to get into Leisure and Events Management(LEM) in TP (now known as HTM) with a 3.2 C.GPA upon my graduation from ITE. I struggled initially, adapting to how different ITE was from Poly and that we no longer had lecturers who were there to provide us with constant feedback on our work. Despite this, I still manage to perform better on certain modules as I had already studied the basics in ITE. In addition, the projects that I managed in ITE made projects in poly feel like a norm and easier for me to regurgitate the information required.

Overtime, it became a lot easier for me to adapt to my surroundings as I realised that the key to managing my school life was really time management. I wouldn't say its' impossible to have social life, sleep and still score well as I have many friends who manage to have all of it. However, if you can't that's okay too. Know your limits and know what is important to you. As I have a part-time job, I did not join any cca and prioritised my school work. I also gain CCA points through volunteering and other positions that did not require me to make any major long term commitment.

**TIPS:**

* **Start to understand yourself.** As I start to shift into adulthood, I start to realise that the events life may not be what I am looking for. As much as I love creating and executing them, doing it as a job may not be what I would want to pursue as a career. It was demoralising as I've been studying it for 5 years. But that's okay. Find other alternatives and know what you can build through this skill you have learnt. Read up, look at some soft skills that you have learn during your time in the course and what interest you. For myself, I found out that I have a keen interest in facilities management and find passion in arts related facilities and therefore, steering towards that direction for further education.
* **Back to basics!** Similar to ITE, your first sem grades are important! Try to focus on getting your basics right as most year 1 subjects are foundational. Also, keep these notes as you'll tend to refer to them for more information time to time. Even during my time in year 3, I still refer to my year 1 notes and projects for references as many key information are present.
* **Prioritise!!!!** Know what is important to you. Don't push yourself if you know you're at your limit and don't compare yourself with others. Its' normal to take a break sometimes. The number of times I've broken down because I felt so incompetent really took a toll on my mental health. But always, talk to someone. Its' okay to put yourself before your studies sometimes.
* **CCA.** As mentioned, I did not have any CCA but took up various positions and volunteering work that provided me with CCA points. For TP, taking up the class representative position and attending events offer students SEAL/CCA points. Don't give opportunities like this up. It may come in handy whether you are looking for friends or just aiming to get the points. These points are honestly, a booster, when it comes to university applications as it really helps in showing that you're an all rounded student (especially when they ask you to talk about how you contribute back to the community and demonstrate some of your leadership qualities).
* **Use internship as a trial**. Whether it is to try something new or work in an industry you're interested in, use your time as an intern to find out about the real world. Find out from your supervisor and colleagues. Observe what they do and how they tackle these situations. Use this time to find out if you can see yourself in this industry and if not, what are your alternatives. If required, you can always use the elimination method (what are your choices > removing your dislikes > your final choice)
* **Consult your lecturers.** When in doubt, always ask! Many lecturers are really keen on helping students. I often seek guidance from lecturers as they have insights and knowledge on the industry which can be really helpful in mapping what I would like to do in future. If you have doubts on which intern company would be suitable etc, you can always check with the lecturers for more information on the company.

&#x200B;

**Other tips:**

* **Your friends may not be the best group mates.** And that's okay. Different people have different working styles and sometimes, your working styles may clash and arguments may arise. However, try to work things out and not to ruin any friendship because of projects. Ensure both parties understand that the argument you guys had is based on the project and no hard feeling should be involved.
* **GO TO SCHOOL!** I know its' tempting to sleep in a few more hours and to skip classes but TRY to attend and go for every lecture and tutorials. Sometimes, its' better and easier to absorb information if you're listening to it first hand as compared to copying your friend's lecture notes.
* **Find out what kind of learner you are.** I personally am an audio learner when it comes to receiving information. However, I memorise better when my notes are hand written by myself. Find out what style suits you best and the best way for you to retain information as all these come in handy when memorising for close book exams.
* **Study ahead of time.** I really can't stress this enough but as tempting as it is to procrastinate, studying ahead of time really can help you prevent information from leaking especially when there are tests packed back to back.
* **Planner**. If you don't like to use a planner, your phone's calendar will do fine. Take down important dates (submissions, tests, exams) With a planner, you get to see a clear view of what is due and what is coming up in the month so to prepare yourself mentally and give yourself that sense of urgency that you probably need if you have been procrastinating.
* **Mental health.** Always take a break. Go out with your friends! Take a walk! Talk to your loved ones. School can be tiring and draining. But always remember there are people who are around you supporting you. Its' helpful to rant to someone especially when things can get a little too overwhelming.

&#x200B;

And I think that's about it! I graduated TP with an above 3.5 c.gpa and an 'excellent' record on my CCA points (about 60 points for TP standard). Will be attending NUS PFM this coming semester (nervous but excited). Its' been a long journey for me and hope this post will be helpful to anyone who needs it!!!

225,cpjx9,fwgh1m,IUD Singapore: 6 April 2020,2020-04-07 15:53:20,askSingapore,44614,44,96," I have been researching on more permanent birth control methods for a while now, and have been reading Reddit to learn more on Singaporean women’s experiences. I thought I will share my experiences and contribute for others to learn more too. 

I did my research, I wanted to do a copper IUD because: 

1. It is effective immediately and there is little/no maintenance to it. 

2. Once removed, there is no “downtime” in fertility. 

Which is helpful because I am going to be 30 this year, and I don’t want kids for the next 2-3 years. But when I want kids, then will need to have it soon cos fertility and health of kids reduces after 35. For hormonal birth control methods, such as pills, implants, IUD, the fertility may take a while to return (around 6 months to one year) after birth control is stopped. 

3. I am always protected – don’t need to refrain from sex because we don’t have a condom. 

4. It is an appropriate form of emergency contraceptive for 5 days after the incident. 

5. Since it does not contain hormones, there will not be any hormonal side effects. 

6. Although I am in a committed relationship, I do not want me becoming accidently pregnant to be the cause of getting married. I want to get married at my own time. 

7. I think sex puts women at a disadvantage because even though the man will take responsibility, the woman will need to make hard decisions (keep the baby? Abort? Get married?) even with condoms as protection, there may be a risk of pregnancy if it is used incorrectly.

8. Once pregnancy happens, your lives will be forever changed. 

9. Since Singapore is still a very conservative society, having a shortgun marriage may still be frown upon. 

I saw Queenstown polyclinic nurse previously, and she shared it will be around $70 – including consultation, the device and the procedure. It will need to be done during my period, and usually, the procedure can be done only 2 times a week. You can call on the day of your period to book an appointment. I felt the polyclinic nurse asked uncomfortable questions, such as if I am married. She also explored alternative forms of birth control, such as pills and patches – all which are hormonal birth control, which I was not interested in. She did try to push her agenda, to schedule me to do a PAP smear. The nurse also tried to dissuade from exploring an IUD because I have not had children yet. I ended up asking her if it was illegal to get an IUD before getting married or having children. 

I felt I had to be assertive to tell the nurse what I wanted, and my reasons behind my choice. Although it was not a very pleasant experience interacting with her, I felt she was only doing her job and following the nation’s narrative. 

Having your period during the insertion is recommended because your cervix will be opened wider during that time, which allows for easier insertion. 

Back to what happened yesterday: 

I was considering to get an IUD this month anyway, during my period which will be happening around 20+ April. But… stuff happened and passion overwhelmed last weekend HAHAH and we didn’t use protection. 

So I decided to get the IUD earlier. 

I called the polyclinic and they suggested me to go to KKH emergency department, as I am not having my period now. The KKH Dr will be able to insert the IUD even when I am not having my period. 

I called a private obgyn clinic, IUD insertion, including dr appt, insertion, will be $1.8k. No thanks. 

I went to the KKH emergency department around 2pm. I ended around 4pm. 

The breakdown of the bill on 6 April 2020 is: 

\- Urgent care consultation: $128 

\- Urine HCG (pregnancy test): $22

\- Uterus contraception intrauterine contraceptive device insertion: $106

\- Multi-Safe Copper 375 IUD (5 years): $40.66 after GST

I am not allowed to use Medisave for the procedure. 

I felt the procedure was rather positive, I did not sense judgement from the Dr, and he asked me why I chose copper IUD instead of other birth control/emergency contraception methods. 

The procedure was uncomfortable. It just felt like cramps and there was tugging, tapping and generally not very pleasant. I am still having abit of cramps even today, around 24 hours after the procedure. 

I will experience some spotting the first few days and I will get heavier periods. I will need to watch out for allergy reactions as well. After every period, I will need to make sure the strings are still present. 

I will need to go for another followup in 6 weeks, then 6 months. 

Yes, the procedure at KKH is a lot more expensive than the polyclinic, but I felt it brought me a peace of mind and I am satisfied with my decision :)

My whole experience to have an IUD is empowering and liberating since I don’t need to worry about the accidental pregnancy for the next few years. 

Although I rave over the IUD and felt it is the right choice for me, please do your own research and don’t just refer to my post to decide to get the IUD.",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/fwgh1m/iud_singapore_6_april_2020/,"['Although it is anecdotal, I do know 2 women who got pregnant while being on IUD.

227,specornot210,g9kuv9,[Uni] [Poly] [A levels] I am a Poly Grad who took Private A levels in NS AMA,2020-04-28 18:31:38,SGExams,77662,48,164,"Hey all, 

Since I saw two posts so far about Poly to JC  stories, I thought I'll share my story too. At the same time, I hope to be able to both encourage people and answer any questions people might have on taking A levels as a private candidate (As there does not seem to be much info available online). 

Background:

I enrolled in a business course in poly because I had no idea what I wanted to do, I thought maybe I could grow to like business as I studied it. I was wrong, I hated studying business, I discovered that I was more inclined towards the humanities and social sciences. By the time I discovered this I already finished my first year with a miserable GPA of 2.2. However, I played around in poly too much and by the time I tried pulling my GPA up, I could only graduate with a trash GPA of 2.78.  I was blindly hoping that by some miracle I could get accepted into NTU or NUS because I wanted to do a solid humanities degree. Driven by passion, I applied to NTU 3 times. Naturally, I got rejected 3 times, not only from NTU but from every single local university I applied to. It was something that I should have expected, but still, I remember being overwhelmingly disappointed. I hated myself for being unfocused and immature in my earlier poly days. I saw all my peers entering universities of their choices and I saw myself lagging behind not being able to do anything about it. Regret hit me really hard.

The A levels: 

When I was in NS, near the start of my first year, I started researching private universities and overseas universities. I mean this was the only way forward right? I couldn't make it to my dream universities so I should settle for what I deserve, come to terms with what options I had.  (Note: I am not intentionally trying to put down private u students, but I believe given the choice wouldn't anyone trade for a better opportunity?) As I browsed through entry requirements for Aussie unis or private degrees, it sort of hit me, why don't I try taking the A levels as a private candidate? It was an immensely terrifying thought, JC students who take the A levels full time complain about the rigour and difficulty of A level subjects, what chance does a half-assed Poly grad have? As I researched more and more into taking A levels privately it seemed that many people shared the same sentiment. The success rate of private As (or retaking As) is miserably low. Additionally, when I reached out to my friends who did the A levels, they advised me not to do it, it is difficult enough in JC what about part-time without guidance? I was just setting myself up for failure. Compounding this, I was planning to study for the A levels while serving my National Service full time. How in the world am I even hoping for success against such odds? 

To be frank, I was quite depressed. The ticket out of the mess I created seemed impossible to get. Yet somehow, I sucked it up and applied as a private candidate to take the As in 2019. What followed was roughly 2 years of hell. I focused on studying as my main priority, everything else took a backseat. With this, I actually lost friends because I didn't socialise anymore. The single-minded determination that took over me was something even now I can't seem to muster up. Every bit of free time was dedicated to studying, lunch was constantly skipped to study, I cancelled plans, paid for duties just to have free time. It was exhausting. In the day I was dealing with very difficult regulars and NSFs who were very snake-ish (Clerks yall would know) in the night I was spending 3-4 hours trying to focus. Additionally, the entire time I worked towards my goal, I was plagued by constant uncertainty, I think anyone taking a major exam like the As would understand that uncertainty. But man to put up with that and the shit NS throws at you daily for 2 years makes for really unpleasant memories. 

The Results:

Come Feb 2020, I had ORD-ed and sat for the As the previous year. Results day was the deciding moment whether the past 2 years were worth it or a complete waste of money and time. I was trying to expect the worst possible outcome and it was really freaking me out. But when I opened up the results I scored a BBB/DA. Rebased from /80 to /90 I scored 77.5Rp (68.75/80 x 90) (The reason I rebased my score to 77.5Rp is because I managed to get into NUS FASS through ABA, based on past posts on r/SGexams it seems that people who got ABA scored between 77-79RP). 

I couldn't believe it, I actually did decently for once. My dreams and hopes, they could finally be real, the work and sacrifices put in weren't for nothing. I applied to both NTU and NUS. I am proud to say that I got offered admission into both courses! 

Takeaway: 

This entire journey was one hell of a ride. I think it changed me to become a more mature and disciplined individual and it taught me that even if some challenge seems insurmountable, you just might have what it takes to overcome it! The key is to believe in yourself despite the odds and work hard to your goal! I'm also damned grateful for this subreddit, the number of times I scroll here asking questions and looking for answers is uncountable. So Thank You  r/SGExams 

In any case, thanks for reading my story! I would be happy to answer any questions! especially from people who are thinking about taking the A levels privately!

I assume when you say revision it means to stop learning new content & start reviewing the entire syllabus.\n\n**Revision date**: I started intense revision about 3 months before the A levels. \n\n**duration of revision** It’s hard to say what’s the duration of each H2 subject because I didn’t separate my time out into equal blocks for each subject. I portioned my time based on my weakest to strongest subjects with my weakest subjects receiving the most attention. However nearer to my As I spent on average around 6-8 hours a day studying. \n\n**Obtaining practise papers**: Popular sells TYS for almost every single A level subject. I also found school prelim papers online & my tutors (explained below) provided test papers also.\n\n**Marking Appraisals**: I started going for tuition for most of my subjects around 7-8 months before my As, that’s where I was able to get feedback and refine my essays etc. \n\n2. I sat for the mid year paper for my MT. I’m pretty bad at my MT I can at most hold basic conversations only. But tbh H1 Chinese was even easier then O level Chinese. \n\n**P1 - compo**: I dug up my old secondary school/primary school model compo book and copied the compos out. My chinese was so bad I could only understand P6 Chinese compos. So I had to work my way up copying essays from primary to secondary and finally to JC level. \n\n**P2- cloze passage and comphre**:The way I prepared was to buy the the MT TYS from popular and do the papers front to back. I often copied the answers from the answer booklet to memorize phrases and understand how exactly the answers should be phrased. \n\n**P3- oral & LC**: honestly I didn’t prepare for these papers. I kinda just went through with it w out any preparation. I’m not sure how I did tho.', 'Hey! \nIt was a daily struggle. Some days I felt completely unmotivated and really stressed but others it wasn’t so bad. Honestly, I’m not sure how I pulled through. I had some good friends in Army who I could talk to and I would frequently talk to them about my stress. I guess that helped quite abit in managing my stress levels.', 'I see, I’m curious though, what made you choose philo in the first place?', 'Don’t worry about age, 2-3 years is really not much when you compare having a solid degree to no degree at all! But I would recommend trying with your GPA first before planning to take the A levels!', 'Hi,\n\nI took arts stream. I thought it was impractical for me to take a science stream while doing NS as I have no access to labs to practise for science practicals! So it was more prudent to opt for softer subjects.\n\nYes, the max we can get is 80Rp. But, I believe that NTU and NUS rebases scores for private candidates that have no opportunity to take PW. In email correspondence with both unis they kinda hinted this! Nothing explicit though.\n\nFor NTU I was invited for an admission interview & test before people scoring 73 rp or 70 rp received the same invitation. This means my rp had to be higher than them.\n\nFor NUS I managed to get an ABA which as explained in my post meant my score had to range around 77-79 rp.\n\nI roughly rebased my score by taking the /80 and multiplying by 90 which gives me 77.5 this fits into both the way NTU and NUS treated my admission application!\n\nSMU, however, didn’t even reply me at all. Perhaps they don’t practise rebasing? I’m not sure. But I’m pretty sure NUS and NTU doesn’t disadvantage applicants without PW! If not it would have been impossible for me to get into both with only 68.75 Rp\n\nEdit: For clarity', ""How difficult is it actually? I'm bout to enlist, but considering I'm PES C, I would like to think that I have some leeway to study a little bit more to supplement my subpar GPA from poly."", ""Thank you for the reply. I have already started revising all my subjects in February. I allow myself to do one chapter (or two if they are closely related) per day  but I will not proceed with the next chapter unless I am completely sure I can do the majority of questions from the topic.\n\nI struggle more with subjects that are subjectively marked. As such, I have a greater time dealing with General Paper and Chinese, and to a much smaller degree, Economics. (at least Economics have economic terms that I can remember and form a objective argument with 'Assess ...., explain...., describe..., etc).

Mainly because of his beautiful prose and the ease in which he conveyed difficult philosophical concepts. That gave me the misconception that university philosophy will be as interesting and easy at least. \n\nHowever for the modules was mainly given secondary readings which are really abstract and difficult to understand (perhaps due to my Low iq, not the fault of the Writers). \n\nAlso during the lectures, such as moral philosophy, I didn’t understand a word of what the professor was saying. Everyone was nodding their heads in agreement though. \n\nSo my eventual disinterest and the lack of job prospects contributed to my leaving last year?\n\nWhat about you, why philo?', 'truee :)) yep ill try to apply w my gpa first hehe keeping my fingers crossed. anyways thank u so much for ur reply!! :3 may i ask what poly were u from previously?', 'I emailed all the unis before and they all replied back by saying private candidates will be assesed fairly and that we will not be disadvantaged.However,after you said smu did not reply back im scared now cos my dream course is in smu😥😥😥.Btw how do they expect us to do aba when we dont know anything?Is aba anything related to A-levels?Also,did u have any kind of achievements which might have helped you in the admission process?', ""Hmm, it depends on your vocation and place of posting.

My friend as a PES C storeman in guards woke up at 4 every day to prepare stores for the guards who were going on exercise.\n\nSo ultimately, I think only once you have finished BMT, received your posting and actually experienced unit life for about a week then you can decide whether there's leeway to study."", 'Hey sorry for the late reply, \n\nBe sure to create a content calendar counting down to your A levels! What I did was to create a spread sheet listing week by week what content I had to master/revise through to complete everything by A levels. \n\nHmm, what’s important in GP is not so much that you really must have a stand.

What’s more important is that your arguments are cogent and well substantiated with good clear & relevant examples. \n\nAll the best! I hope you do well', 'Ahh I see cool cool, I personally haven’t read Schopenhauer but seems interesting. I’ll check it out soon! \n\nPersonally, I started reading more into philo when I was in year 2 of Poly. It started out as a general interest in what supposedly are the “greater” questions in life. I started reading guidebooks on Plato, reading Aristotle etc. mostly popular level stuff like generic continental stuff. I was introduced to analytic philosophy when I saw a footnote in a book I was reading reference a guy named Plantinga. I bought his book and for the first time I read an actual academic work of philosophy. I was amazed by the rigor, detail and level of complexity put into writing the book. I wasn’t aware of logic back then but I was really into how it was so precise and convincing. \n\nAfter that, I started reading more and more works of analytic philo! I even bought textbooks to study etc. (perhaps that’s why I screwed up my poly diploma LOL) Coincidentally, my friend matriculated into NTU Philo the same year! so she would invite me to talks and lectures by the profs there which helped kindle my interest even more. \n\nI decided (IIRC) the next year that I wanted to work in academia as a professor!

That would be wholly unfair. For example for the FASS ABA test, they didn’t test specifically on economic concepts or psychological theories.

233,caesady,i7mc14,Advice for a Uni Student: AIA Pro Achiever? RSPs?,2020-08-11 14:01:29,singaporefi,19146,19,7,"Hello, I'm a beginner who's just begun looking into ways to invest. Just some BGI: Since I'm not working, I'm looking to invest about 2/3 of what I have, which is about 10k total. 
Recently been approached by a friend who's selling AIA's Pro Achiever and I'm currently trying to decide if I should commit to the 13 years. 
For those who don't know, this is what I've managed to find out:

- 2.5% charge p.a (so about 0.21%, assuming I invest monthly with them.

- 13 years total, with a surrender fee of 60-70% if I want to stop the plan before 10 years

- $200/month mimimum

- 5-8% return according to what we have discussed

- transparency about which funds my money is going into
The clear advantage I see is the fact that the pro-achiever is apparently managed by mercer. With fund managers, I would reasonably assume that it provides and edge over ETFs.

But on the other hand, I'm worried about the 13 year commitment because a lot could happen in the future. Especially as I'm in university now and don't have to worry about bills, debt, other living expenses.

Meanwhile I've been doing my own reading and am considering an ETF RSP with FSMOne + roboinvestors like kristal. (To take advantage of this recession period while at the same time taking small steps towards active investing) 

- 0.08% fees 

- Lower minimum - 50SGD if I'm not wrong

- more personalisation if i choose to (Even though I am only planning to invest in SGX through FSMOne)

Any advice, or other alternatives would be greatly appreciated (: Apologies for the length of this, but I'll be glad to supply any other info if it'd help!

Edit: thank you so much for the answers. I was leaning towards the ETF RSP/Roboadvisors option but now I have a more concrete idea of why this is the better option.

See if your family situations require you to be insured at this time. \n\nHospitalization plans (aka integrated shield plans - ISP) are damn bloody impt to buy asap. This is to lock in your status as having no preexisting conditions. Ask your parents if you already have one. If they’re savvy and bought early you may even have private hospital rider with no copay.\n\nAs for investments, most impt is to recognize that your “friend” is a blood sucking leech. Don’t have to stop being friends, just have to recognize his/her leech status. I recommend buying a bit of what you have mentioned so far. STI ETF, IWDA, even SWRD and VOO.

Other than Krist.Al and FSMOne's RSP, I'm currently reading up on how to evaluate ETFs.

And then there are synthetic ETFs that use derivatives to replicate the returns they benchmark. \n\nWhen we dig into synthetics ETFs (also called Specialty ETFs) there’s a super wide range that does really funny stuff, for example there are inverse ETFs which aim to return the opposite of S&P500 (S&P down 1%, your ETF value up 1%), leveraged ETFs (S&P down 1%, your ETF value down 3%), and inverse leverage ETFs (S&P down 1%, your value up 3%). \n\nWhen you evaluate, you gotta be sure of what you’re buying.', ""There's a lot more homeworm to do indeed.

For econs I've got A but the way I've studied is quite unorthodox I guess? Never really wrote any essay outline cause I either end up writing an entire essey or just like 4 lines per essay. \n\nMy prefered route of studying for econs is just reading my notes and relating economic concepts to real life events. For example, fiscal and monetary policies to the eurozone crisis in Greece etc. Our econs tutors have always emphasized the importance of examples in the essay. Like using real companies and their decisions to evaluate essays on firms. Usually for long paragraphs I would put 1-2 examples and I'll omit examples from shorter filler paragraphs. Them I'll link the examples to the econs concept I'm explaining. Finally further evaluate by giving pro/con, alternatives, long/short term, situations etc. \n\nThis really helps in 2019 H2 econs A-level paper 2 as question 6 was on (how does current events affect the economic performance of Singapore) or smt similar. I used the US-China trade crisis, HongKong unrest and Brexit to write about trade, investment and labour flows respectively. \n\nTo score in econs essey you'll need to give the general economic principles of the economical concept and relevant examples. Most time the students are good at explaining the concepts but no real life examples. \n\nFor the few months I studied for As, econs was my weakest subject yet I spent the least amount of time studying for it. The content is not that difficult to memorise or understand, is the way you apply that concept. Hence I only read up on various magazine (Economist, World History BBC) or YouTube videos (ACDC Econs, Crash Course Econs, Vox).\n\nHowever, do not try this route of action if you do not have at least some ideas of the various econs concept and graph knowledge. A strong foundation is needed before you can apply examples at the right time."", 'Heya.

I have been sleeping quite often in those from J1 which I plan to fix when I enter university but yeah, it also means I haven't been sleeping well so please do also sleep a good 7h.\n\nFor breaks in between lessons, I eat, relax or do more work. School ends usually around 4pm now for me so I would either study in the school library or public library. My house doesn't work for me so hopefully you can also find a place where you can do so at this time. Also try to find people you can study with because really, it can affect your studying. I prefer studying with one more person as it usually keeps me from relaxing too much. Anyway, I would study usually until the library closes, and this happens maybe 3 or 4 times on weekdays, and I try to go to the library too on weekends.\n\nRemember to time yourself as you do the papers and go for consultations as soon as you can, they really just shoot up towards As so your teacher might not even have free time (that is in my school).\n\nI also noticed that I use social media too much then so I actually tried to not use them completely for 3 days and even though it was not the 7 days I wanted, that 3 days really made me realise how much I use it which made me cut my usage."", ""Because I took H2 Theatre Studies and Drama, I basically only managed to become productive after July, which was when the practical examinations for TSD were over (before that, many many hours were spent each week in rehearsals etc so I neglected my studies). \n\n&#x200B;\n\nMy advice would be to not let yourself be pressured by your friends and focus on strengthening your content for the individual subjects. I was in the Science Stream (4H2 BCM/TSD, GP) and I found it useful to take some time to split and breakdown the individual topics within each subject and find out which areas are you weaker at. Then, you have a clearer idea to plan your revision. Focus on your weaker topics first. You can look for practice questions on those topics to strengthen your foundations before moving on to the yearly TYSes. I found it more useful that way as you won't get too demoralised by attempting full papers. \n\nYou should also aim to develop a deeper understanding of the content and how the questions are testing which particular concepts as knowing which area to source information from will be useful in helping you compartmentalise and revise. \n\nFor General Paper (hated by many), my advice would be to catch up on current affairs and trends, especially local news as you would need that in your AQ. I personally didn't study much for GP as I relied on conversations with my friends and content from my other subjects to substantiate my points. The PEEL structure is a life saviour and I still use it in uni essays etc \n\nPace yourself and don't make unnecessary comparisons with your friends. By comparing, you're only going to feel more upset. \n\nLastly, make good use of your tutors and schedule regular consultations with them!

235,outroqi,f7pv93,[A Levels] U for H2 Econs throughout JC to A in A Levels,2020-02-22 16:25:57,SGExams,77662,26,170,"i received my A level results yesterday!!

h2 economics has been the bane of my existence since i entered jc. i have never gotten above an E in any test ever. j1 ct1, lecture tests, class tests. mostly U, some S. for promos, all my classmates were happy that they had improved from CTs and i remember my guy friend was so happy that he got a B and when he saw me so happy he asked if i had gotten A. little did he know, i had just scraped an E (46%) and was just overjoyed to pass. when jc2 came, it was worse. my micro was already weak, added to completely new topics from macro.... i started to zone out and skip lectures to eat lunch with friends or study other subjects. for one of my lecture tests, i actually scored 0/20. my own teacher wrote ""what happened to you?"" on my script. somewhere after ct1, when i scored a U (again), i woke up and realised A levels was just under 8 months away. so i started putting in double the effort i'd put in in j1. i started studying the content myself and going for consults. and i actually understood the concepts, but for some reason i couldn't score in the essays. mid years came, and i scored a big fat U. not 0 anymore, but still a fail grade. i was discouraged, and i knew time was running out. i signed up for econs tuition as a last resort.

the tuition did really help, the notes provided were concise and summarised my school notes with all the right keywords. i started to feel more confident in my answers, and i thought maybe if i could get a C for prelims and then a B for A levels, i would be satisfied. but when prelims came, i got another rude shock. i scored an E, again only scraping a pass by one mark (46%). meanwhile my friends and classmates were all celebrating with their Cs and Bs and even As. the same guy friend mentioned above scored an A and this time i turned away from him before i could break down. i cried when i received my econs results. i felt like the double effort i'd put in over the last few months to catch up on content and build my micro foundation was for nothing. 

but this time, i knew my problem. i had severe time management issues -- often when the exam finished i hadn't even started on the third essay. i went to my tuition teacher and school tutor for help. they both told me there was only one way -- to write 3 essays a day, in 2h15min, until i could train myself to finish a paper.

by this point, there was only a month left to the econs paper. and i felt like there was no hope. being idealistic, of course i wanted the A, but was it realistic to go from E to A? nevertheless, i started writing. it sucked. after the first week, i still had barely enough time to even start the third essay. my hands hurt from the constant writing. i had to use the same tactic for csq as well. i finished 9 or 10 school papers and yet i still couldn't finish writing. the same thing happened in the second week. unbeknownst to my friends and then-bf, i was crying in the school toilet on study breaks because i felt like a failure. i even wished i had taken any other subject but econs.

but as time passed, my writing speed did improve. i found that the more i wrote, the more i was able to recall content faster. and it really helped. but by then, i faced a new set of problems. my micro had always been weaker than macro and in my bid to finish a paper, i'd neglected revising my content. with A levels the next day, i walked in knowing almost nothing about market structure or the tax/subsidy part of DDSS. i was only strong in market failure and the whole of macroeconomics, which was what i was banking on for the essay.

the paper was bad. everyone remembers the csq question about globalisation being reversible like wtf is that?? and for the essay, afterward when i went on reddit, i saw everyone had done the market failure qn. and written sources that i hadn't thought of. i knew i hadn't done spectacularly. i'd left some marks blank for the csq (mainly the 2m questions). but at the same time i was proud of myself, because it was the FIRST time in my whole life i'd actually managed to finish an econs paper!!!

the week before results day, i started praying. praying for at least a C. because i didn't have high hopes. one of my friends from my clique comforted me, saying she had gotten E in prelims and then A in A levels but i felt like that was really the miracle case, 1 in 1000 kind of chance. i thanked her but told her to be realistic about the situation and not to give me false hope.

when results day came i didn't dare to open my cert for an hour. those letters would decide my whole future, at least for the next few months. i had two panic attacks and had cried twice by the time an hour passed. my best friend and i promised to open our certs together, and so when i finally opened my cert, my eyes happened to land on the bottom letter first. i saw H2 Economics -- A. not a C, not a B, but the most coveted A. i tell you there was no way to describe the way i felt in that moment. i screamed. and then i broke down. i couldn't believe it. i was shaking and gasping and i felt like my skin was tingling all over and like i was about to faint. 

honestly i still cry because i'm so overwhelmed that all the effort i put in paid off despite all the odds. so i want to say it's possible. please don't give up. and i'm sorry if this post sounds like i'm bragging, but i'm honestly not --- as someone who has been an econs failure throughout, i just wanted to share my joy with reddit because my heart is so full to bursting :"""") and of course if anyone needs any tips feel free to pm me i'll try my best to answer!!",0.98,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/f7pv93/a_levels_u_for_h2_econs_throughout_jc_to_a_in_a/,"[""Same for gp. Got E throughout but an A in Alevels. Memes. I still can't get my grammar right."", 'same here, my econs grade really took me by surprise because i was so ready to receive a C or B at best but lo and behold, i got a freakin A??? i still cannot believe bc my tutor kinda sux and i really wasnt confident of my answers at all. for essays ppl wrote 3 solid points while i wrote only 2 or even just 1 point. but i guess i wrote all the main points + the cambridge markers like whatever BS i wrote LOL. but bless lah, im just really really happy, for you too!\n\nso to the juniors : never ever lose hope because the cambridge uncles are generally more lenient while jc teachers are v stingy w giving marks, so school performance is not a true gauge of your standard :) this is coming from someone who has scored 1/25 for an essay before and never ever written out a full essay other than in exams (couldnt even finish usually tbh). but im not trying to say that the A comes easily, i believe with hard work and studying smart yall can do it, JIAYOU!', 'I\'m so happy for you:"")', 'Good job :D', 'Really proud of you! & it’s exactly how i felt/feel about H2 Econs.

Cheers to you & all Econs student in this Crazy journey!', 'I wanted to just up this. This was me too, completely true story and the same kind of miracle happened.\n\nOnly for me in this case, I didn\'t know where my problems were. Even right now, I\'m not sure what I did that was so different from my JC1 exams and my A-Level exams. I know something was different (??) but I can\'t pinpoint what.\n\nEventually, after JC1, I and two close friends (all did poorly in econs) went to go for group tuition together. We determined that we probably needed a lot more help and took that step. By going together, we also helped to make each other\'s tuition fees cheaper. \n\nHonestly, we were so blessed, and I personally feel vvv blessed to have found a good tutor. Patient, lots of materials, willing to entertain questions not exactly in the syllabus, in fact, happy to see an interest in econs out of the subject.\n\nI think this was one of the main mental blocks I had, even now I feel this sense of a knot in my chest when I think about learning econs in school. I guess I was too afraid to ask questions because I was the \'U\' student. Can\'t blame my teacher for feeling like I didn\'t pay attention and didn\'t work hard enough but I really tried very very hard.\n\nPersonally, I took a supp paper for econs (no dox hopes?) and that was super stressful. I got a U for promos and my overall RP was not stable, so I had to take the supp exam. Sometimes I have the feeling I was passed out of pity. Like I said, I don\'t know what was different. \n\nI just spent a lot of time looking over answer keys, seeing the flow in the answers, looking for the key phrases, the economic reasons for this and that, and I spent a lot of time trying to identify the ""GP-ish"" portions of my answers. \n\nIf you ask me again, I would say that sometimes these changes in my writing style are unidentifiable. Just something that gets hammered in with enough answer keys and more practice. I know people say that rote memorisation isn\'t the way to go, but for me in econs, improvising never worked well. \n\nOr, at least until the A-Levels and there were some questions that we had never prepared before? I suppose what worked out was having the rote memory for things like an increase in national income, or the dd/ss, or like the normal things, but still being able to flip around and think of how to answer different questions.\n\nUnlike OP, I was good at tax and floor and thingas but once we talk about market failure I would fail lol. So like is globalisation reversible?? Well, I remembered the things about some globalisation, and from there just keep writing whatever sounds logical. \n\nFor econs, if there\'s something important, I think it is to know what the question wants. Whether it wants a diagram, whether you need an anti-thesis, whether you need to give the whole explanation of a certain process (kough kough). Honestly, I didn\'t get to finish the last part of my econs paper at A-Levels. I didn\'t write everything I wanted to, I wasn\'t satisfied with that answer. \n\nLike all my other econs papers in the past, this question or that conclusion not written... Still, things can happen. With enough work, from the darkness stumbling into the light?\n\nWhat sort of light did I find? I walked out of the tunnel into the light with my eyes closed. A consistent U-----E, then A. That feeling of the ""E"" that gave me hope, I cannot forget it. As OP says, everyone else is doing better, but at that moment when you have defeated yourself, it feels liberating. When I saw my A I thought I was dreaming lol.\n\n...Not dreaming. Wow. Okay.\n\nEnd of the long story. But actually seriously, if you have a U now, keep working at it, read a lot of answer keys, memorise the k process, circular flow of income, deflationary spiral, marginalist principle etc etc. all of those things, read them and write them until they are there at the tip of your pen. \n\nIt can be done. So please please please, as OP says, don\'t give up. You can feel like it\'s hopeless, but hey let us give you some hope. We cannot console or assure you, but we can tell you to keep studying because there\'s a real possibility.', 'Haha I was also one of those U to A econ students.

For me, Chem is a lot about the way you structure your answers and that requires memory work.\n\nIf you can't understand concepts, you can ask your tutors for help. After all, you need to at least partially understand concepts before you polish your understanding of the subject.\n\nHowever, be careful about your other subjects and don't just devote all your time to just Chemistry.

1. Time management

I started working since year 1 of university so managing time well is exceptionally important. Every minute saved from each module makes a difference. Before class, I read the lecture notes (a quick scanning if time is tight is better than nothing). By having a rough idea of what will be covered during class b4hand, I can absorb the materials more easily as the professor teaches. Pay attention in class, so you know what questions you have. Ask these questions during the break or after class (There will be a couple of students doing that, so don’t worry). This helped me to save time because I can clear my questions instantly. I would have spend more time if I revisit the notes some time later to figure out the answers to my questions. Leave the figuring out part to tutorials - more efficient and effective. [Listen](https://bit.ly/2MNJfXJ) to some nice music while studying helps too

2. Proritise your work constantly with a to-do list. 

Time will pass real fast. Keep track of the assignments, and prioritise your work. Weekly planner is quite useful for me, as I need to keep track of important dates (project group meetup, exams, tutorials due date etc). The planner can also help organise your tasks that you need to accomplish so you can have a clear picture of what your day/week is going to be like. 

3.Choosing modules

Going to university after Junior College is quite overwhelming for me, primarily due to the change in learning environment. One of the questions I was having to refine my strategy on what modules to take and when to take it every semester. My tip is to read module reviews, to get a rough idea of the modules you intend to take. Note that the professors teaching the modules may vary every semester, so ask on top of asking your seniors.

4.Explore 

Take the modules you like or interest you. Get out of your comfort zone. Popular modules that some took are language modules, computer science modules. You can save quite a lot of money by taking modules in schools. I have friends who picked up 3 languages. But of course, gauge your interest beforehand. Since Data Science has gained so much popularity, do your homework to see if it you are up for the challenge. Before I took the computer science modules, I went to look at the list of resources to get a sense of what will be covered in school. ",0.99,https://www.reddit.com/r/SGExams/comments/h0ve0p/uni_life_in_universitytips_nus_fass_modules/,"['[deleted]', '>My tip is to read module reviews, to get a rough idea of the modules you intend to take.

Just a month ago, I ooc-ed from driving course due to my atopic dermatitis flaring up very very badly,  and the Sembawang MO was like 'i think I better take you out of this course, your skin looks to be very bad.' And he even wrote a god damn letter to my higher in charge that they should take me out of this vocation. 

Moreover, my concerning parents couldn't bear the sight of my nasty skin and took me to see a dermatologist specialist, whom wrote a letter for me to endorse at the MO to take me out of this course because the conditions of saf driving school is really not very healthy for my skin

Despite the fact that I explained to the MO about how my itching also affects my driving, (can't concentrate on the road if its itching - some instructors even asked me whether i wanted to ooc or not because my skin looks bad but I was stubborn at that time and wanted to go on). The god damn medical board still thinks I'm fit for driving course and will send me back once my excuse driving ends. I dont get it. All the overwhelming evidence pointing to the fact that this course is horrendous for my skin and they still tell me that my skin do not fit the criteria for a revocation. What do you want my skin to do? Bleed pus and rot out until I look like a decayed zombie????. I understand there's protocol and all, its not like I'm insisting on you to put me in an air-conditioning kind of job like ASA or whatnot, just somewhere under shelter, maybe with a fan so I won't be too warm (all the stupid training shed during driving training have no fan/fan is stupid spoiled and it gets really fking warm and i will itch a lot). 

I have an appointment with the national skin centre late this month but I guess even a letter from them won't do me any fucking good right.

I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder which caused me to drop out last year as a j2. I've re-enrolled this year and was improving at the start of this year until CB happened which made my mental state even worse. Been just trying to get by since then. Some days are so bad that I can't even get out of bed to eat or bathe, let alone study. I really am trying. I just can't concentrate properly and I feel very overwhelmed especially when prelims is starting in a few days time. Anyone that has gone through something similar and can provide some guidance? I feel alone and frustrated because it's something that has affected me for a very long time, and got even worse since I enrolled into jc. I really tried to get better. I'm currently on therapy but there's so much it can help you know? 

Also:
Should I drop a subject this late? I'm taking BCME and I'm having a hard time memorising especially for biology due to my condition. But I'm extremely bad in chemistry and my intention for not dropping was to ""gamble"" which subject I'd get lower to calculate as my h1. Also feel that it may be too late to drop.

Really don't want to retake As next year. Don't think I can spend another year in this place. Also trying to take advantage of the removal of content tested.

I was in a similar position last year, felt pretty overwhelmed due to relationship issue, academic stress and peer pressure. \nMy advise will be first, most importantly, make sure you get adequate sleep, especially since you’ve emotional issues to handle. You can seek advice from your specialist and perhaps to get some medication that aids sleep quality (e.g Melatonin). With quality sleep, you’ll be more able to manage your emotion and stress, and more able to focus.\n\n\nSecondly, decide on the subject to drop ASAP. It’s straightforward, choose the one that you’re currently spending the most time with and yet with the most slim chance of improving the grade. Don’t spend too much time considering, the earlier you can strategise and focus on the remaining 3 H2, the more likely you can secure better grades. In my opinion, dropping H2 chemistry or H2 physics is better as the science practical is indeed a big burden. \nAlso to take note, if you’re running out of time, just give up your H1 subject, solely focus on 3 H2s, as you can redo H1 subject next year in a single sitting to replace your this year H1 grade (do confirm this info with your teacher) \n\n\nAll the best, there’s still time to make a difference.', 'Hey can U pm me?\n\nMy dm option is not working']"

Guys, I need advice

#Tl;dr I think I accepted a job offer but am now faced with a better offer from current employers to ''make me stay'' (I wasn't leaving cos I hate them, just to clarify), how do I ''cancel'' my acceptance of the job offer



I completed a part-time diploma this year with straight A's, and as I was feeling very motivated I was planned to continue on to degree in private uni. Unfortunately due to a lot of reasons I was unable to secure a loan. 

So fine, I decided that I'm simply gonna delay my plans a little and keep working to earn half my school fees, and then hopefully by the 4th term I'll be able to rely on my sibling to help me apply for a joint loan.

However, current job pays me a survivable salary (1800) that suited me before, but now with my savings intentions it is severely ''lacking'', simply not enough. Therefore I decided I need to go out there and find me a new job.

I did a bit of reading and asking around and the more common advice was to secure a job before quitting. So that's what I did. 

Two weeks ago I started job hunting, last week I did 3 interviews from 3 different clinics. This week I was offered one that was really good, offer was 2300.

I told the recruiter (middleman, have not really communicated directly with the prospective employer other than during interview) that I was really happy with the offer. 

They are aware that I'm only able to join by Jan 2021 (during circuit breaker my current employer forwarded hours to financially help me get by and so if I still intend to survive these months it would take me max until end December to return the hours) so I was especially happy that they could accomodate such a long wait time.

I finally go to my current manager to put in my resignation. Things to note: I fricking love this clinic, I love my colleagues very much, and I'd say I've contributed well as a nurse and performed better than I care to acknowledge (I have anxiety and low self-esteem, makes me think I'm the biggest fuck up). I explained the job offer and all (which clinic, which branch, expected salary) when asked. Manager didn't show any strong emotion and was very understanding. 

Within one hour of me doing so my manager sits me down again to let me know that together with my employer she has come up with an offer. In essence, it's better than the offer from the new clinic, plus I get to stay with my beloved colleagues. I didn't give any answer, said I'd think about it, simply because I was overwhelmed. 

Current clinic counter offer no outpatient/dental benefits butin the 2yrs 3mths I've been there I have never once used it (wasted, I know). Current clinic will require me to go to other branch on select days, only 2 different branches that are highly accessible, 1 being v close to home. Prospective clinic is a bigger group (seems more stable/ structured) and has outpatient/ dental benefits, has 7-ish branches that I also have to travel between from time to time, but all are q far from home, at least 1 hour travel, all with vastly different opening hours (to cater to different crowds).

This is honestly my first time changing jobs under such circumstances and I don't know if I'm just dumb or naive but I really have no idea where I've made a mistake, I feel like I made several though. I also have anxiety and I'm honestly _panicking_ so I just need some people with functioning brains to help me

I have questions:
1. Am I now in a way ''legally bound'' to this new clinic cos I expressed my gratitude and all for their offer? I haven't sat down to sign any papers yet but they're already planning where to place me and when I start
2. Was I actually wrong to not have discussed this earlier with my current employer?
3. Am I ethically wrong to accept this offer from my current employer? I don't even know if my seniors are paid that much, plus I'm really stressed that my employers see this as a ''favor'' to me (I hate favors, never know if I can ever adequately repay them)
4. I'm very much keen to stay with my current clinic, is this seemingly greedy of me? Like I'm money-hungry? Also how do I tell this to the prospective employer?
5. Is there anything I should clarify before accepting or rejecting this offer?

TIA guys, I appreciate",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/askSingapore/comments/jj3kwa/employment_headache_for_an_anxious_and_naïve/,"['Get your current employer\'s offer in written form before rejecting your new offer. Hell you can even go back to the new employer and say my current employer gave me a better counter offer can you do more. I\'ve recently been able to increase my salary by more than 1k doing this.  You just have to have an accurate picture of how easily replaceable you are before you play ball. \n\nThis is literally how employment works.
