grampa55,1622809348,ns3tkj,6,1,"Pre-note: I know there are good cyclists but honestly, there are more of bad ones in my daily encounters. I hope this is isolated but when I ask around, fellow pedestrians feel the same as me and so I feel obliged to write this post for awareness and as an official plea to all cyclists for more peace, safety and consideration for our group. 

So a little background, I am a working adult who walks around 900m to take bus, which throws me into the most affected group (by cyclist) as a pedestrian and commuter. We are weaker, slower and defenceless against cyclists. You must be thinking why there is no mention of motorists, truthfully, other than a few rare occasion motorists fail to give way at zebra crossings, all of my negative experiences were caused by cyclists and almost on a daily basis. 

So the pavement I take daily is actually narrow around 1m, there are numerous signs encouraging cyclist to dismount and look out for pedestrians but let me tell u, over 5 years of staying here, I have only seen less than 5 cyclists actually dismounted. The others simply sped past us or ring at us to move aside. I nearly got knocked by cyclists due to slower action to move aside and I have also seen pregnant women and kids nearly knocked down too, Other times, I could almost feel their handle brushed against my arm. Every day's journey to work is stressful and irritable, this could be said for all the other pedestrians in front and behind me as they will encounter the same. Imagine dragging yourself to work early in the morning and having to deal with such dangers and rude ringing on a daily basis? 

When I finally got on the bus, you think it will be all smooth and safe, but no, cyclists continue to haunt my way to work by hogging the bus lane. If you meet a patient bus caption, you will be late for work as he snail crawl all the way behind cyclists. if you meet an impatient driver, you are in for a heart-thumping ride. Either way, it is a lose-lose for all the passengers. Even when the bus finally overtake the hogging cyclist, it will only be for a short while till the next bus stop and the cyclist will get in front again, this slowing down-brake-accelerate motion rocks us to work daily. 

After alighting the bus, there is be a cross junction where cyclists don't stop for pedestrians, instead they do a L turn and cycle on our crossing on to pavement, there are so many times I was shocked when they came bulldozing at me then I realised they were going to transform from road user to pedestrian in split seconds. Finally zebra crossing, 90% of motorists will stop and give way but 99% of cyclists will zip through that tiny opening to give us all an adrenaline boost before we start work. 

I understand cycling is a hobby, exercise or mode of transport, but please spare a thought for our group as we are really defenceless against you. If we were to be knocked down, we can't catch you without identity, and even if we are able to, we can't claim insurance from you. 

I understand cyclists are pushing for dedicated cycling lane and widening of pavement or more PCN, but our group will appreciate if more of such effort can be invested in assuring our safety first. For example, ensuring all cyclists to have some form of identity so we can report any errant cyclists, or widen the pavement for us so cyclist won't cycle so close and cause danger to us. You can ring at us if u really feel we are blocking your way, but please consider our safety and rights as a pedestrian.

imtired9447,1592238597,h9jmxc,19,3,"I‚Äôve been feeling quite depressed for a while, ever since I got rejected by all the unis I applied to. I have a borderline gpa with a slightly decent portfolio so I was quite shocked that I wasn‚Äôt accepted into any uni at all, even if I met the cutoff for last year. However, I tried to pick myself up and tell myself that the competition is just more intense this year and I should take a gap year to improve on my portfolio so that I can try again next year.

The problem is, my parents have never been understanding towards my issues. When they heard about my situation, the first thing they said was about how I never put in effort into anything and my shitty results is probably why I cant get a placement. They have never been through tertiary education so they don‚Äôt know what is GPA and how the admissions requirements are like. So when they found out that I wasn‚Äôt able to get into any local uni, they immediately thought it was because I did not do well for my exams and basically started pointing out all the faults they could find in me and making me feel even more shitty than I already do. I don‚Äôt even know how to begin to explain to them how competitive it is this year due to multiple factors and admissions aren‚Äôt based on just grades alone. They also kept pushing me to find a full time job, which I‚Äôm already trying to do although I am having difficulty finding one when most companies suspended their hiring processes. The thing is, I‚Äôm actually already working multiple part time jobs related to the degree I was interested in. They‚Äôre aware I‚Äôm currently working part time. And yet they still continue pushing me to find a full time job for what? So i can be even more stressed by juggling full time and multiple part time jobs at the same time? I told them its hard to find a job outside now and their response is just basically saying that I‚Äôm not trying hard enough.

I don‚Äôt dare to hope for them to be understanding towards my issues but I just want them to leave me alone. I‚Äôm already depressed enough because I felt inadequate for not being able to get into local u. And after what my parents said to me, I feel even more worthless as a person. I don‚Äôt take allowance from them and they don‚Äôt pay for my education fees either. So I don‚Äôt understand what gives them the right to be so controlling over me when I‚Äôm already an adult and they‚Äôve never been through the same education pathway as I did so they have no right to say I don‚Äôt work hard enough just because I don‚Äôt show them that Im trying my best. To be honest, I‚Äôve been thinking of cutting ties with them in the future because I can no longer deal with how toxic they are. It‚Äôs messing with my mental health a lot. I could be having a good day but if they are feeling irritable they‚Äôll start snapping at me and saying i‚Äôm useless out of nowhere and then start having an one sided rant about all the dissatisfaction they have with me. And it really hurts me badly whenever they do that. I tried shutting out their shoutings but I can never forget the pain they caused me.

I know it's super upsetting coming on this sub and seeing people talk about their prelim L1R5s being 15 and below. It's been rough, hasn't it? We're probably still lamenting over how much we studied and yet we still failed, I know I'm still bitter on how I spammed my TYS everyday and still failed my E Math. 

Personally, it's been difficult for me to get back to studying after seeing my results. Funny, right? I thought that my prelims results would finally be the slap of reality I needed to push myself, but it's been difficult to even open my notes or start any practice papers. I guess seeing my results made me realize that the all-nighters and the frequent cramming sessions didn't work for me when it worked for all my friends. It just made me irritable and I couldn't remember information.

So, to the person reading this: take care of yourself. Take breaks when you need to, stop pulling all-nighters if your mental and physical health is starting to be affected by it. If you get anxious over reading how much people have been studying, be it on IG or twitter, get off them. Remember to eat, even if it's small meals. Please don't neglect your health in pursuit of that A1.

NotFromYouTube,1603987853,jkcxvo,17,1,"Many of you may have heard of withdrawal symptoms after one has stopped drinking alcohol, stopped doing drugs or smoking. 

I now have 1 week until my paper 1 for physics and chemistry and I have decided to pick up my PS4 after 3 months. The feeling I got when I turned on my console was the same feeling of looking at homework as a primary school kid. I stopped playing after like 5 minutes due to my brain going into overdrive telling me to stop and study and my entire body feeling itchy and I also felt very irritable. 

Holding the controller in my hand is the most unnatural and disgusting feeling I ever felt even though I fucking love video games. Why I labeled this as ‚Äúwithdrawal symptoms"" is due the similar symptoms. This is the first time I have stopped studying in almost 2 and a half months and I study almost 5 hours a day. Today was the first time I stopped in a while and felt this. To really test if this was something like a withdrawal, I went to my room and did some MCQ papers and 4 hours flew by. I did not feel any dread or boredom while doing the papers, hell I even felt happy and energetic.

Did o level really fuck up my brain to the point I hate the things I love and love the things I hate? Or is this just a one time thing? To give you context I used to study 5 hrs a day before my CT or Exams but only like 2 days before. O level was the exception. I am also able to play games 5 hrs a day. I don't really have a in-between and although this may make me seem like some top school student flexing, no I'm not. I go to a normal neighborhood school and get slightly above average grades all the time. What have I become, I became the very thing I sworn to destroy. Can any seniors tell me if this ever happened?

dak3ene,1613752545,lnk4fo,30,1,"I'm extremely fed up with being accused of ""smurfing"" in JC, here's why:

During the weeks prior to and during O levels, I went through alot of mental stress and was very tense for most of the time, common for people with low-to-no self-esteem(much like how most students have it normally), but this overwhelmed me to such a great extent that I would just sit and cry, or just rage  over small issues. This period of time was so stressful and it was a breath of fresh air after O's, being able to calm down and de-stress properly.

Received O level results in January, was relatively surprised by how well I did (L1R5=7-4). After much consideration, I chose not to go for the ""Institutions"" and went for _________ Junior College. My reasoning was that I felt the environment would be more beneficial to me such that I could better cope academically and mentally, given how mentally-destroyed I was during O's, I wanted to be in a less stressful but still competitive learning environment. Now here's where the problem starts:

Nosy, irritating distant relatives/former schoolmates(NIDR/FS):
Hahaha LOL you didn't go to ___/__, what did you score? Confirm damn trash one.
Me:
Yeah I didn't go ___/__. But I did get 7-4.
(NIDR/FS): look at this guy so zai (good) yet choose to go to ________ JC, smurf sia.

To be honest, I don't fault their thinking. Growing up most of us were told to go to the best possible learning environments, in most cases, the prestigious schools. 

However, it's always good to remember that there is no ""one-size-fits-all"" institute of higher learning. You could be more suited to JCs, Polytechnics, or ITE, depending on what kind of person you are. This brings me to my point, which is that not everyone who goes to a ""lesser"" school when they could have gone elsewhere is smurfing. 

Knowing the lack of mental health I was dealing with during O's, going to an 'elite' JC, where everyone is fighting to be the best is the worst possible destination for me. But those who parry these accusations don't see the struggle, the nights of pure agony, the last-minute dash to the toilet during papers (Irritable Bowel Syndrome). They just assume: Hey you're so smart stop depriving other people of the opportunity to go to ABCDEFG JC!

I personally feel that the point of going to school is for the passion of learning and improving myself, not just being a mindless body who memorizes content for the sake of a degree, diploma or A. I just can't stand it anymore when people just hurl such accusations at me and just spread it around, and I'm sure that some of your reading this post agree with how I feel and have similar experiences.

It would be absolutely phenomenal if everyone could just respect each other's decisions, and stopped jumping to conclusions based on their assumptions. But this is real life, so that's obviously not happening. But you, reading this post, can make a difference. Be more respectful and understanding of problems other people face and the decisions they make, and don't judge a book by it's cover.

silverpawwhitebear,1590328420,gpq0s7,6,1,"Hello everyone

I have a problem with smokers. I really cannot stand them. As in my body reacts badly to smoke / secondhand smoke. Heart suddenly goes faster, I start to get really moody and irritable.

Yes I think everyone has bigger problems than me (I‚Äôm reading suicide notes, depression, abusive household, everything and mine is really.. trivial in the grand scheme of things.

But this really affects me badly.

To the extent I start to feel things like I‚Äôd rather die than continue to suffer from these smokers. And I get abusive towards my family members when I get affected too. 

And I want this to stop. 

I stay on the ground floor so that makes me even more susceptible. In a household of 5, I have 2 smokers in the house too. My neighbour household probably has 4 smokers out of 6. My unit has a few parking lots behind (at my bedroom‚Äôs window). My unit‚Äôs front door is the service corridor.

Smokers smoke the moment they stop their vehicles. Lepak around in the carpark and smoke before going home. Spreading the fumes into my room.

The service corridor.. smoke from neighbour, smoke from family members, smoke from passers-by. Spreading fumes into my living room.

THERE IS NO ESCAPE!

Let‚Äôs say it rains, smokers come out to enjoy the cool breeze and well, smoke. It doesn‚Äôt take Sherlock to know where all the smoke goes to.

WHAT ABOUT ME?!

I cannot open the windows to get fresh air. I cannot stay in any place to avoid the smoke. Everywhere I go, I inhale smoke. I might as well join them alrd.

I am not here to denounce smokers. They have their choice in life to do what they want. We all know the harmful effects of smokers and yet we see smokers outliving non smokers too.

ndorville,1619005424,mvdup5,111,1,"I am a 30 YO Singaporean who has studied overseas and lived overseas for 8 years of my life. I have also spent a lot of time in Malaysia, probably equivalent to at least 3 years over time. One of the things I miss living in an Angmoh/caucasian country is that the work life balance is very different. People are generally friendlier and more understanding. Even in a big city, people shove past you because they are late, and it is almost always followed by sorry or excuse me. It's almost never entitled.

I am back to living in sg, and there are some things that really get to me from driving to the way people talk to their kids/maids. Everybody is so stressed out and just focused on their own problems (which is fair). Others act very entitled and petulant. Several in positions of management, experience, parenting and/or leadership roles forget about being good or kind leaders or teachers, they are barely patient or even cordial. Sometimes even snide or openly condescending (which is not fair).

From work to school to interacting with the service industry, people label people on just either ""clever"" or ""stupid"". There does not seem to be even a sliding scale or some benefit of the doubt for people who are slower, forgetful or naive. Even these are labelled as dumb excuses for the smallest thing.

And don't get me started on how a punishment based society has probably influenced people into doing the right/kind thing only because they will get punishment otherwise.

I suggest you go and do some volunteer work.

Every morning if you get up early enough, go see the old folks doing exercises near the HDB. Most of the organizers of these exercise programmes do it for free, and have done so, rain or shine, for years, to benefit the empty nesters and get them out and moving. You want more examples? Look at the thousands of stall holders in hawker centers and coffee shops who woke up at 3am to prep and sell you a $3 plate of caifan or horfun. Not kind?

In this city of six million, tens of thousands of people choose lower paying jobs and choose not to hustle, so that they can spend more time on meaningful things, like social workers, special needs teachers and theatre practitioners. Many people choose to do meaningful work that don\'t pay, like nurses and coaches.\n\nWhy don\'t you try to be empathetic towards all these people that you don\'t think about? Watch them really try. Are they stressed up about life? Yeah likely. Are they all perfectly kind and chill, the way you describe other countries\' people? Seems like not.

Life here is much harder and harsher than our countries because we are a densely populated country. \n\nAs a Singaporean, I am constantly stressed out by everything : like from school to work and people around me. I was stuck in a corporate job with politics which I absolutely abhor. I cannot see myself doing corporate for like the next 40 years of my life in SG. Felt super miserable, I don‚Äôt know. Is just the people around me and the environment that makes me sick to my stomach. As work has taken a toll on my mental health, I decided to resign from my job. I know people might think that I am crazy, but I feel that working corporate overseas would be better for my mental health. Been to Perth and I rly like Perth. Perth is q layback and chill, work generally ends at 5 which I don‚Äôt rly get to see these situations in SG. And Perth is q cooling (except for summer time) compared to SG whereby it‚Äôs always 30 degrees everyday and I literally can‚Äôt take the heat. Sometimes I do get migraines due to the weather in SG. \n\nBut rn I am just taking things slowly at a time, I am thinking of going overseas to work after Uni graduation as it‚Äôs less stressful (in a way) compared to SG. Of cause, Singapore has also its good points but in terms of work and living environment, I really don‚Äôt think is a good place to live in. In fact, our depression rates are constantly rising over the years. \n\nBut having said that, I think it‚Äôs society mindset. If everybody can take a step back and learn how to relax, I think life would be less stressful. And I think as singaporeans, we must show our care and concern to our loved ones: maybe ask how‚Äôs their day? (I think the problem here is that we lack empathy , more often we are concerned about our own needs).... in addition, the support system in sg is lacking. \n\nThere are so many things that we can collectively do as a society.

Because I don\'t read empathy from you at all. I don\'t know why we can\'t see others as kind just because they earn a profit or get a salary. Do we not benefit from their service and effort, even if we pay $1.50 for coffee or $5 for the food? You try to go to a country with no ba chor mee and even if you are willing to spend 20 euros you still can\'t find one bowl. \n\nAnd I don\'t know how less indifferent do we expect of a coffee stall guy, other than give us our order? These buggers woke up at 3 or 4 am, have their hands scalded several times a day, are on their feet for hours, and constantly have to remember the orders plus the siew dai, ga dai, gao, dapao or drink here variants. Yes, great if they can still give us a big smile, greet all of us like we are their fav customers... but I don\'t fault them for looking indifferent. Have you tried to be empathetic towards them, stand in their shoes? And 40+ years living here and no hawker stall has asked me to order more than what I can eat, so I suggest you go to elsewhere to buy food if you get these attitude, because there are plenty of other options around. \n\nLife in Singapore is what we make out of it. If we want the society to be kinder and more empathetic, then it has to start with us. Many of us in Singapore also see kindness, chill, patient, forgiving people everywhere. But it is because we try (imperfectly) to be forgiving and patient towards others who do not meet our high standards and expectations. People are imperfect; we are imperfect ourselves. It\'s illogical to carry a critical, fault-finding mind and expect others to be kind, chill, patient... if you have a fault-finding mind, guess what you\'ll find?
